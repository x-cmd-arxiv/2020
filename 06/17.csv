likelihoods have poor specificity for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and
often assign higher likelihoods to OOD data than in-distribution data. To
ameliorate this issue we propose DoSE, the density of states estimator. Drawing
on the statistical physics notion of ``density of states,'' the DoSE decision
rule avoids direct comparison of model probabilities, and instead utilizes the
``probability of the model probability,'' or indeed the frequency of any
reasonable statistic. The frequency is calculated using nonparametric density
estimators (e.g., KDE and one-class SVM) which measure the typicality of
various model statistics given the training data and from which we can flag
test points with low typicality as anomalous. Unlike many other methods, DoSE
requires neither labeled data nor OOD examples. DoSE is modular and can be
trivially applied to any existing, trained model. We demonstrate DoSE's
state-of-the-art performance against other unsupervised OOD detectors on
previously established ``hard'' benchmarks.

being the emergence and borrowing of new linguistic elements. Competition
between the new elements and older ones with a similar semantic or grammatical
function may lead to speakers preferring one of them, and leaving the other to
go out of use. We introduce a general method for quantifying competition
between linguistic elements in diachronic corpora which does not require
language-specific resources other than a sufficiently large corpus. This
approach is readily applicable to a wide range of languages and linguistic
subsystems. Here, we apply it to lexical data in five corpora differing in
language, type, genre, and time span. We find that changes in communicative
need are consistently predictive of lexical competition dynamics.
Near-synonymous words are more likely to directly compete if they belong to a
topic of conversation whose importance to language users is constant over time,
possibly leading to the extinction of one of the competing words. By contrast,
in topics which are increasing in importance for language users,
near-synonymous words tend not to compete directly and can coexist. This
suggests that, in addition to direct competition between words, language change
can be driven by competition between topics or semantic subspaces.

propose a model that assumes the true positives and true negatives for each

an extensive simulation study and an application example that determines which

low-dimensional manifold. Autoencoders (AE) is a popular technique to learn
representations of such data by pushing it through a neural network with a low
dimension bottleneck while minimizing a reconstruction error. Using high
capacity AE often leads to a large collection of minimizers, many of which
represent a low dimensional manifold that fits the data well but generalizes
poorly.
  Two sources of bad generalization are: extrinsic, where the learned manifold
possesses extraneous parts that are far from the data; and intrinsic, where the
encoder and decoder introduce arbitrary distortion in the low dimensional
parameterization. An approach taken to alleviate these issues is to add a
regularizer that favors a particular solution; common regularizers promote
sparsity, small derivatives, or robustness to noise.
  In this paper, we advocate an isometry (i.e., local distance preserving)
regularizer. Specifically, our regularizer encourages: (i) the decoder to be an
isometry; and (ii) the encoder to be the decoder's pseudo-inverse, that is, the
encoder extends the inverse of the decoder to the ambient space by orthogonal
projection. In a nutshell, (i) and (ii) fix both intrinsic and extrinsic

Passing Interface (MPI) communications enable the required remapping of data in
memory. For the latter operation, a first available implementation resorts to
the standard all-to-all routines. A second implementation, featuring
non-blocking and persistent point-to-point communications, is however shown to
be more efficient in a majority of cases and especially while taking advantage
of the shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The scalability of the algorithm,
aimed at massively parallel architectures, is demonstrated up to 73 720 cores.
The results obtained with three different supercomputers show that the weak
efficiency remains above 40\% and the strong efficiency above 30% when the
number of cores is multiplied by 16, for typical problems. These figures are
slightly better than those expected from a third party 3D Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) tool, with which a 20% longer execution time was also measured
on average.

current cloud computing technology may not be suitable. The feasibility of such
a system can be anticipated as high-speed and low-latency wireless technologies
get mature. We present a system model by defining the architecture, basic
functions, processes at both system-level and pipeline device level. A pipeline
pathfinding algorithm along with a multi-task optimization framework is
developed. To minimize the search space since the algorithm may need to be run
on resource-limited mobile devices, an adjacency-matrix-power-based graph
trimming technique is proposed and validated using simulation. A preliminary
feasibility assessment of our proposed techniques is performed using
experiments and computer simulation. As part of the feasibility assessment, the
impact of mmWave blockage on the pipeline stability is analyzed and examined
for both single-pipeline and concurrent-multiple-pipeline scenarios. Our design

low-spatial-resolution (LR) but rich spectral characteristics with a
panchromatic image (PAN) of high-spatial-resolution (HR) but poor spectral
characteristics. Traditional methods usually inject the extracted
high-frequency details from PAN into the up-sampled MSI. Recent deep learning
endeavors are mostly supervised assuming the HR MSI is available, which is
unrealistic especially for satellite images. Nonetheless, these methods could
not fully exploit the rich spectral characteristics in the MSI. Due to the wide
existence of mixed pixels in satellite images where each pixel tends to cover
more than one constituent material, pansharpening at the subpixel level becomes
essential. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening (UP) method
in a deep-learning framework to address the above challenges based on the
self-attention mechanism (SAM), referred to as UP-SAM. The contribution of this
paper is three-fold. First, the self-attention mechanism is proposed where the
spatial varying detail extraction and injection functions are estimated
according to the attention representations indicating spectral characteristics
of the MSI with sub-pixel accuracy. Second, such attention representations are
derived from mixed pixels with the proposed stacked attention network powered
with a stick-breaking structure to meet the physical constraints of mixed pixel
formulations. Third, the detail extraction and injection functions are spatial
varying based on the attention representations, which largely improves the
reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed approach is able to reconstruct sharper MSI of different types, with
more details and less spectral distortion as compared to the state-of-the-art.

trajectories of SGD via stochastic differential equations (SDE) under
heavy-tailed gradient noise has recently shed light over several peculiar
characteristics of SGD, a rigorous treatment of the generalization properties
of such SDEs in a learning theoretical framework is still missing. Aiming to
bridge this gap, in this paper, we prove generalization bounds for SGD under
the assumption that its trajectories can be well-approximated by a \emph{Feller
process}, which defines a rich class of Markov processes that include several
recent SDE representations (both Brownian or heavy-tailed) as its special case.
We show that the generalization error can be controlled by the \emph{Hausdorff
dimension} of the trajectories, which is intimately linked to the tail behavior
of the driving process. Our results imply that heavier-tailed processes should
achieve better generalization; hence, the tail-index of the process can be used
as a notion of ""capacity metric"". We support our theory with experiments on
deep neural networks illustrating that the proposed capacity metric accurately
estimates the generalization error, and it does not necessarily grow with the
number of parameters unlike the existing capacity metrics in the literature.

coefficients. We solve the governing equation for the control function which
includes a sum of the fractional operator and its inverse, both discretized
over large 3D $n\times n \times n$ spacial grids. Using the diagonalization of
the arising matrix valued functions in the eigenbasis of the 1D Sturm-Liouville
operators, we construct the rank-structured tensor approximation with
controllable precision for the discretized fractional elliptic operators and
the respective preconditioner. The right-hand side in the constraining equation
(the optimal design function) is supposed to be represented in a form of a
low-rank canonical tensor. Then the equation for the control function is solved
in a tensor structured format by using preconditioned CG iteration with the
adaptive rank truncation procedure that also ensures the accuracy of
calculations, given an $\varepsilon$-threshold. This method reduces the
numerical cost for solving the control problem to $O(n \log n)$ (plus the
quadratic term $O(n^2)$ with a small weight), which is superior to the
approaches based on the traditional linear algebra tools that yield at least
$O(n^3 \log n)$ complexity in the 3D case. The storage for the representation
of all 3D nonlocal operators and functions involved is also estimated by $O(n
\log n)$. This essentially outperforms the traditional methods operating with
fully populated $n^3 \times n^3$ matrices and vectors in $\mathbb{R}^{n^3}$.
Numerical tests for 2D/3D control problems indicate the almost linear
complexity scaling of the rank truncated PCG iteration in the univariate grid

objects to run more than one task. However, the exponential growth of objects
in IoT poses the challenge of distributing and managing task allocation among
objects. One of the main goals of task allocation is to improve the quality of
information and maximize the tasks to be performed. Although there are
approaches that optimize and manage the dynamics of nodes, not all consider the
quality of information and the distributed allocation over the cluster service.
This paper proposes the mechanism CONTASKI for task allocation in IIoT networks
to distribute tasks among objects. It relies on collaborative consensus to
allocate tasks and similarity capabilities to know which objects can play in
accomplishing those tasks. CONTASKI was evaluated on NS-3 and achieved 100% of
allocated tasks incases with 75 and 100 nodes, and, on average, more than 80%
clusters performed tasks in a low response time.

functions in which each car is willing to park only in a fixed interval of
spaces. Each interval parking function can be expressed as a pair $(a,b)$,
where $a$ is a parking function and $b$ is a dual parking function. We say that
a pair of permutations $(x,y)$ is \emph{reachable} if there is an IPF $(a,b)$

Reachability is reflexive and antisymmetric, but not in general transitive. We
prove that its transitive closure, the \emph{pseudoreachability order}, is
precisely the bubble-sort order on the symmetric group $\Sym_n$, which can be
expressed in terms of the normal form of a permutation in the sense of
du~Cloux; in particular, it is isomorphic to the product of chains of lengths
$2,\dots,n$. It is thus seen to be a special case of Armstrong's sorting order,

transform the input image into a generalized representation that encodes

establish a preprocessing step that unifies data from multiple sources into a
common representation that facilitates training downstream tasks in computer

with results from both the Steidel et al. (2002) monolithic halo model and a
new cylindrical Navarro-Frenk-White galaxy halo model to interpret these data
in the context of probing 3D galaxy halos via 1D QSO absorption-line

Variability is found to increase with energy, though it decreases as the

algorithm called the instance-based tail area density (ITAD) metric to reduce
the number of keystrokes required to authenticate users. Additionally, commonly
used features in the keystroke dynamics literature, such as monographs and
digraphs, are all found to be useful in informing who is typing. The usefulness
of these features for authentication is determined using a random forest
classifier and validated across two publicly available datasets. Scores from
the individual features are fused to form a single matching score. With the
fused matching score and our ITAD metric, we achieve equal error rates (EERs)

varying patterns of emotions. In multiplayer activities that take place in a
common space (such as sports and board games), players are generally aware of
the emotions of their teammates or opponents as they can directly observe their
behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance and so on.
Players of online video games, however, are not generally aware of the other
players' emotions given the limited channels of direct interaction among them
(e.g. via emojis or chat boxes). It also turns out that the impact of real-time
emotionawareness on play is still unexplored in the space of online digital
games. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the role of the affect
of others to one's gameplay performance in this paper we investigate the
degrees to which the expression of manifested emotions of an opponent can
affect the emotions of the player and consequently his gameplay behavior. In
this initial study, we test our hypothesis on a two-player adversarial car
racing game. We perform a comprehensive user study to evaluate the emotions,
behaviors, and attitudes of players in emotion aware versus emotion agnostic
game versions. Our findings suggest that expressing the emotional state of the
opponent through an emoji in real-time affects the emotional state and behavior
of players that can consequently affect their playing experience.

hydrocarbon and residual species exposure. We quantitatively show that TEM
holders are inherently dirty and introduce a range of unwanted chemical

quantum algorithms that reduce the measurement cost (e.g. quantum amplitude and

implementation. Here we propose methods that take advantage of the available
quantum coherence to maximally enhance the power of sampling on noisy quantum
devices, reducing measurement number and runtime compared to the standard
sampling method of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our scheme
derives inspiration from quantum metrology, phase estimation, and the more
recent ""alpha-VQE"" proposal, arriving at a general formulation that is robust
to error and does not require ancilla qubits. The central object of this method
is what we call the ""engineered likelihood function"" (ELF), used for carrying
out Bayesian inference. We show how the ELF formalism enhances the rate of
information gain in sampling as the physical hardware transitions from the
regime of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers into that of quantum error
corrected ones. This technique speeds up a central component of many quantum

spectrum of a matrix perturbed by either the addition or the multiplication of
a random matrix noise, under the assumption that the distribution of the noise
is unitarily invariant. This method, introduced by Arizmendi, Tarrago and
Vargas in arXiv:1711.08871, is done in two steps : the first step consists in a
fixed point method to compute the Stieltjes transform of the desired
distribution in a certain domain, and the second step is a classical
deconvolution by a Cauchy distribution, whose parameter depends on the
intensity of the noise. We also provide explicit bounds for the mean squared
error of the first step.

prevalent chemical reaction in biological systems, and is responsible for
fueling nearly all cellular processes, from nerve impulse propagation to DNA
synthesis. ATP synthases, the family of enzymes that carry out this endless
task, are nearly as ubiquitous as the energy-laden molecule they are
responsible for making. The F-type ATP synthase (F-ATPase) is found in every
domain of life, and is believed to predate the divergence of these lineages
over 1.5 billion years ago. These enzymes have therefore facilitated the
survival of organisms in a wide range of habitats, ranging from the deep-sea
thermal vents to the human intestine. In this review, we present an overview of
the current knowledge of the structure and function of F-type ATPases,
highlighting several adaptations that have been characterized across taxa. We
emphasize the importance of studying these features within the context of the
enzyme's particular lipid environment: Just as the interactions between an
organism and its physical environment shape its evolutionary trajectory,
ATPases are impacted by the membranes within which they reside. We argue that a
comprehensive understanding of the structure, function, and evolution of
membrane proteins -- including ATP synthase -- requires such an integrative
approach.

the bias of haloes and galaxies selected by stellar mass $M_*$, which is
instead described better by $b_\phi(M_*) = 2\delta_c(b_1(M_*) - p)$ with $p \in

overdensities and local PNG have on the median stellar-to-halo-mass relation. A
simple model of this impact allows us to describe the stellar mass dependence

a leading learning algorithm for improving the robustness of CNNs on

specifically the shape bias and internal features learned inside
adversarially-robust CNNs. In this paper, we perform a thorough, systematic
study to understand the shape bias and some internal mechanisms that enable the
generalizability of AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet-50 models trained via
adversarial training. We find that while standard ImageNet classifiers have a
strong texture bias, their R counterparts rely heavily on shapes. Remarkably,
adversarial training induces three simplicity biases into hidden neurons in the
process of ""robustifying"" CNNs. That is, each convolutional neuron in R
networks often changes to detecting (1) pixel-wise smoother patterns, i.e., a
mechanism that blocks high-frequency noise from passing through the network;
(2) more lower-level features i.e. textures and colors (instead of objects);and
(3) fewer types of inputs. Our findings reveal the interesting mechanisms that
made networks more adversarially robust and also explain some recent findings

the star does not reach the full disruption radius, only a fraction of the

These results deepen our understanding of the properties and breadth of

050908 at $z=3.3467$, and GRB 060607A at $z=3.0749$), to determine their LyC
escape fraction and compare their properties. From the afterglow spectrum of
GRB 191004B we determine a neutral hydrogen column density at the LGRB redshift
of $\log(N_{\rm HI}/cm^{-2})= 17.2 \pm 0.15$, and negligible extinction
($A_{\rm V}=0.03 \pm 0.02$ mag). The only metal absorption lines detected are
CIV and SiIV. In contrast to GRB 050908 and GRB 060607A, the host galaxy of GRB
191004B displays significant Ly$\alpha$ emission. From its Ly$\alpha$ emission
and the non-detection of Balmer emission lines we constrain its star-formation
rate (SFR) to $1 \leq$ SFR $\leq 4.7$ M$_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}$. We fit the
Ly$\alpha$ emission with a shell model and find parameters values consistent
with the observed ones. The absolute LyC escape fractions we find for GRB
191004B, GRB 050908 and GRB 060607A are of $0.35^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$,
$0.08^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ and $0.20^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$, respectively. We compare the
LyC escape fraction of LGRBs to the values of other LyC emitters found from the
literature, showing that LGRB afterglows can be powerful tools to study LyC
escape for faint high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Indeed we could push LyC
leakage studies to much higher absolute magnitudes. The host galaxies of the
three LGRB presented here have all $M_{\rm 1600} > -19.5$ mag, with the GRB
060607A host at $M_{\rm 1600} > -16$ mag. LGRB hosts may therefore be
particularly suitable for exploring the ionizing escape fraction in galaxies

contribute to the radiation energy budget, and are commonly parametrized as

Additionally, relics with masses greater than $10^{-4}$ eV become

of massive neutrinos. Here we forecast how well current and upcoming
cosmological surveys can probe light massive relics (LiMRs). We consider
minimal extensions to the SM by both fermionic and bosonic relic degrees of

early in time but then nearly ceases. Plenty of hot gas remains available but
does not cool and condense into star-forming clouds. Active galactic nuclei
(AGN) release enough energy to inhibit cooling of the hot gas, but energetic
arguments alone do not explain why quenching of star formation is most
effective in high-mass galaxies. In fact, optical observations show that
quenching is more closely related to a galaxy's central stellar velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_v$) than to any other characteristic. Here, we show that
high $\sigma_v$ is critical to quenching because a deep central potential well
maximizes the efficacy of AGN feedback. In order to remain quenched, a galaxy
must continually sweep out the gas ejected from its aging stars. Supernova
heating can accomplish this task as long as the AGN sufficiently reduces the
gas pressure of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). We find that CGM
pressure acts as the control knob on a valve that regulates AGN feedback and
suggest that feedback power self-adjusts so that it suffices to lift the CGM
out of the galaxy's potential well. Supernova heating then drives a galactic
outflow that remains homogeneous if $\sigma_v \gtrsim 240 \, {\rm km \,

velocity dispersion, but feedback in galaxies with a much lower velocity
dispersion tends to result in convective circulation and accumulation of
multiphase gas within the galaxy.

(""regulator model""). Specifically, we quantify the strength of the fluctuation
in the star-formation rate (SFR) on different timescales, i.e. the power
spectral density (PSD) of the star-formation history, and connect it to gas
inflow and the life-cycle of molecular clouds. We show that in the general case
the PSD of the SFR has three breaks, corresponding to the correlation time of
the inflow rate, the equilibrium timescale of the gas reservoir of the galaxy,
and the average lifetime of individual molecular clouds. On long and

the PSD is typically set by the variability of the inflow rate and the
interplay between outflows and gas depletion. On short timescales, the PSD
shows an additional component related to the life-cycle of molecular clouds,

high intensity sources of photons. The dark matter candidate of interest comes
from the relatively prompt decay of a dark sector gauge boson which may replace
a Standard-Model photon, so the delayed neutrino events can be suppressed by
keeping prompt events only. Furthermore, prompt neutrino events can be rejected
by a cut in recoil energy spectra, as their incoming energy is relatively small
and bounded from above while dark matter may deposit a sizable energy beyond
it. We apply the search strategy of imposing a combination of energy and timing
cuts to the existing CsI data of the COHERENT experiment as a concrete example,

their jets drive the overall structure to sizes larger than 700 kpc, and they
are called giant radio galaxies (GRGs). A very small fraction of the population
of such radio galaxies contains molecular and atomic gas in the form of rings

known; it has sometimes been associated with a minor merger with a gas-rich
disc galaxy (e.g. Centaurus A) or cooling of material from a hot X-ray
atmosphere (e.g. cooling flows). The giant radio jets might be the extreme
evolution of these objects, and they can teach us about the radio galaxy

Because of the unique properties of the source, these systems hold a lot of

this very first example presented modelers with a few puzzles. It was expected
that to explain image fluxes a contribution from microlensing by stars would be
required, but to accommodate the magnitude of microlensing, the density slope
of the elliptical power law lens model had to be quite shallow, $\rho_{2D}
\propto r^{-0.7}$. Furthermore, the center of mass had to be displaced from
that of observed light by ~0.1 kpc, and the position angle of light
distribution was misaligned with that of mass by ~40 degrees. In this paper we
present mass models that resolve the first two problems, and suggest a
resolution of the third. Motivated by observations of local ellipticals, and
some recent analysis of galaxy-scale lenses, our mass models consist of two
offset (baryonic) mass components. The resulting mass distributions have a
single centroid, but are lopsided, and have isodensity contours that are not
purely elliptical and not self-similar with radius. For many of our models the
microlensing requirements are modest, and the ring formed by the extended

and theoretical efforts, where the scarcity of direct probes poses a key
challenge. Among their clearest signatures is a thermal Hall conductance with
quantized half-integer value in natural units $ \pi^2 k_B^2 T /3 h$ ($T$ is
temperature, $h$ the Planck constant, $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant). Such a
value was indeed recently observed in a quantum-Hall system and a magnetic
insulator. We show that a non-topological ""thermal metal"" phase that forms due
to quenched disorder may disguise as a non-Abelian phase by well approximating
the trademark quantized thermal Hall response. Remarkably, the quantization
here improves with temperature, in contrast to fully gapped systems. We provide
numerical evidence for this effect and discuss its possible implications for
the aforementioned experiments.

mesons, including both charmed and bottom mesons, to the model and predict
masses of tetraquarks as well as diquarks. In particular, we find masses of
four axial-vector diquarks, i.e., $qc$, $cc$, $qb$, and $bb$, where $q = u,d$,
and 24 ground-state tetraquarks, including both heavy-light tetraquarks
($qc\overline{qc}$ and $qb\overline{qb}$) and heavy tetraquarks
($cc\overline{cc}$ and $bb\overline{bb}$). In general, our results for the
masses of $qb\overline{qb}$, $cc\overline{cc}$, and $bb\overline{bb}$ are
largely comparable with other reported results, whereas our results for the
masses of $qc\overline{qc}$ are slightly larger than what has been found
earlier. Finally, we identify some of the obtained predictions for masses of
tetraquarks with masses of experimental tetraquark candidates, and especially,
we find that $\psi(4660)$, $Z_b(10610)$, and $Z_b(10650)$ could be described by

the model interpretation of their spectra. Complex cloud models are too
numerically costly for generating a large number of spectra, while more
efficient models may be too strongly simplified. We aim to constrain the
atmospheric properties of the directly imaged planet HR 8799e with a free
retrieval approach. We use our radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS for
generating spectra, which we couple to the PyMultiNest tool. We added the
effect of multiple scattering which is important for treating clouds. Two cloud
model parameterizations are tested: the first incorporates the mixing and
settling of condensates, the second simply parameterizes the functional form of
the opacity. In mock retrievals, using an inadequate cloud model may result in
atmospheres that are more isothermal and less cloudy than the input. Applying
our framework on observations of HR 8799e made with the GPI, SPHERE and
GRAVITY, we find a cloudy atmosphere governed by disequilibrium chemistry,
confirming previous analyses. We retrieve that ${\rm
C/O}=0.60_{-0.08}^{+0.07}$. Other models have not yet produced a well
constrained C/O value for this planet. The retrieved C/O values of both cloud
models are consistent, while leading to different atmospheric structures:
cloudy, or more isothermal and less cloudy. Fitting the observations with the
self-consistent Exo-REM model leads to comparable results, while not
constraining C/O. With data from the most sensitive instruments, retrieval
analyses of directly imaged planets are possible. The inferred C/O ratio of HR
8799e is independent of the cloud model and thus appears to be a robust. This
C/O is consistent with stellar, which could indicate that the HR 8799e formed
outside the CO$_2$ or CO iceline. As it is the innermost planet of the system,
this constraint could apply to all HR 8799 planets.

neutrinos consists of leveraging cosmological datasets, such as the cosmic
microwave background and surveys of the large-scale structure of the universe.
In order to obtain unbiased estimates of the neutrino mass, however, many
effects ought to be included. Here we forecast, via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
likelihood analysis, whether measurements by two galaxy surveys: DESI and {\it
Euclid}, when added to the CMB-S4 experiment, are sensitive to two effects that
can alter neutrino-mass measurements. The first is the slight difference in the
suppression of matter fluctuations that each neutrino-mass hierarchy generates,
at fixed total mass. The second is the growth-induced scale-dependent bias
(GISDB) of haloes produced by massive neutrinos. We find that near-future
surveys can distinguish hierarchies with the same total mass only at the
$1\sigma$ level; thus, while these are poised to deliver a measurement of the
sum of neutrino masses, they cannot significantly discern the mass of each
individual neutrino in the foreseeable future. We further find that neglecting
the GISDB induces up to a $1\sigma$ overestimation of the total neutrino mass,
and we show how to absorb this effect via a redshift-dependent parametrization

analyse archival ALMA images of nine z>6 galaxies observed in both [CII] and

identification of extended line emission, we detect [CII] emission in the whole
sample, with an extent systematically larger than the [CII] emission. Next, we
use interferometric simulations to study the effect of SBD on the line
luminosity estimate. About 40% of the extended [CII] component might be missed
at an angular resolution of 0.8$^{\prime\prime}$, implying that $L_{\rm [CII]}$
is underestimated by a factor $\approx2$ in data at low (<7) signal-to-noise

galaxies lies, on average, slightly below the local $L_{\rm [CII]}-SFR$

gravito-inertial modes, in some cases supplemented with delta Scuti-like
pressure modes and in numerous cases with Rossby modes. The present paper aims
at showing that, in addition to these modes established in the radiative
envelope, pure inertial modes, trapped in the convective core, can be detected
in Kepler observations of gamma Doradus stars, thanks to their resonance with
the gravito-inertial modes.
  We start by using a simplified model of perturbations in a full sphere of
uniform density. Under these conditions, the spectrum of pure inertial modes is
known from analytical solutions of the so-called Poincare equation. We then
compute coupling factors which help select the pure inertial modes which
interact best with the surrounding dipolar gravito-inertial modes. Using
complete calculations of gravito-inertial modes in realistic models of gamma
Doradus stars, we are able to show that the pure inertial/gravito-inertial
resonances appear as dips in the gravito-inertial mode period spacing series at
spin parameters close to those predicted by the simple model. We find the first
evidence of such dips in the Kepler gamma Doradus star KIC5608334. Finally,
using complete calculations in isolated convective cores, we find that the spin
parameters of the pure inertial/gravito-inertial resonances are also sensitive
to the density stratification of the convective core.
  In conclusion, we have discovered that certain dips in gravito-inertial mode
period spacings observed in some Kepler stars are in fact the signatures of
resonances with pure-inertial modes that are trapped in the convective core.
  This holds the promise to finally access the central conditions , i.e.
rotation and density stratification, of intermediate-mass stars on the main
sequence.

radiation significantly contributes to their X-ray emission, with Doppler
boosting making values higher than other radio-loud NLSy1. The 0.3-10 keV
photon indices are on average harder with respect to radio-quiet and radio-loud

variability amplitude with respect to blazars and the softening of the spectrum
in some periods suggests that also the corona radiation contributes to the
X-ray emission. In optical and ultraviolet (UV) significant flux changes have
been observed on daily, weekly, and monthly time-scale, providing a clear
indication of the significant contribution of the jet radiation in this part of
spectrum. A strong correlation between X-ray, UV, and optical emission and
simultaneous flux variations have been observed in 1H 0323+342, SBS 0846+513,

the ground state of many-body systems, as it is of great interest in various
fields from condensed matter physics to material science. Traditionally, in an
analog sense, adiabatic evolution has been proposed to slowly evolve a simple
Hamiltonian, initialized in its ground state, to the Hamiltonian of interest
such that the final state becomes the desired ground state. Recently,
variational methods have also been proposed and realized in quantum simulators
for emulating the ground state of many-body systems. Here, we first provide a
quantitative comparison between the adiabatic and variational methods with
respect to required quantum resources on digital quantum simulators, namely the
depth of the circuit and the number of two-qubit quantum gates. Our results
show that the variational methods are less demanding with respect to these
resources. However, they need to be hybridized with a classical optimization
which can converge slowly. Therefore, as the second result of the paper, we
provide two different approaches for speeding the convergence of the classical
optimizer by taking a good initial guess for the parameters of the variational
circuit. We show that these approaches are applicable to a wide range of
Hamiltonian and provide significant improvement in the optimization procedure.

that halo ellipticity is strongly correlated with halo properties that serve as

peak-centroid offset. In particular, the correlation between halo ellipticity
and halo concentration is nearly independent of the halo density peak height.
We present a simple model for the correlation between halo ellipticity and

formulae for the multi-dimensional distributions of triaxial halo shape as a
function of halo peak height. We apply our halo shape model to gauge the

$T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$ and chemistry are assigned cluster membership with

an integral operator with the kernel being the one-particle Green's function of
free fermions at finite temperature and the statistics parameter determining
the constant in front of the integral operator. We show that the numerical
evaluation of this representation using Nystr\""{o}m's method significantly
outperforms the other approaches present in the literature when there are no
analytical expressions for the overlaps of the wave-functions. We illustrate
the distinctive features and novel phenomena present in the dynamics of anyonic
systems in two experimentally relevant scenarios: the quantum Newton's cradle
setting and the breathing oscillations initiated by a sudden change of the trap
frequency.

explain the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Gravitational
tidal effects at the quantum loop level modify the dynamics of the leptons in
curved spacetime and may be encoded in a low-energy effective action Seff. It
has been shown in previous work how in a high-scale BSM theory the CP odd
curvature-induced interactions in Seff modify the dispersion relations of
leptons and antileptons differently in an expanding universe, giving rise to an
effective chemical potential and a non-vanishing equilibrium lepton-antilepton
asymmetry. In this paper, the CP even curvature interactions are shown to break
lepton number current conservation and modify the evolution of the lepton
number density as the universe expands. These effects are implemented in a
generalised Boltzmann equation and used to trace the dynamical evolution of the
lepton number density in different cosmological scenarios. The theory predicts
a potentially significant gravitationally-induced lepton-antilepton asymmetry
at very early times in the evolution of the universe.

the structural position of constituents is determined by their logical function
(topic or comment) rather than their grammatical function (e.g., subject or
object). We build on work by Koml\'osy (1989) and argue that in addition to
discourse context, the lexical semantics of the verb also plays a significant
role in determining Hungarian word order. In order to investigate the role of
lexical semantics in determining Hungarian word order, we conduct a
large-scale, data-driven analysis on the ordering of 380 transitive verbs and
their objects, as observed in hundreds of thousands of examples extracted from
the Hungarian Gigaword Corpus. We test the effect of lexical semantics on the
ordering of verbs and their objects by grouping verbs into 11 semantic classes.
In addition to the semantic class of the verb, we also include two control
features related to information structure, object definiteness and object NP
weight, chosen to allow a comparison of their effect size to that of verb
semantics. Our results suggest that all three features have a significant
effect on verb-object ordering in Hungarian and among these features, the
semantic class of the verb has the largest effect. Specifically, we find that
stative verbs, such as fed ""cover"", jelent ""mean"" and \""ovez ""surround"", tend
to be OV-preferring (with the exception of psych verbs which are strongly
VO-preferring) and non-stative verbs, such as b\'ir\'al ""judge"", cs\""okkent
""reduce"" and cs\'okol ""kiss"", verbs tend to be VO-preferring. These findings
support our hypothesis that lexical semantic factors influence word order in
Hungarian.

scatter in supernova luminosity could be due to the environmental effects that
are not yet accounted for by the current standardisation methods. In this work,
we compare the local and global colour $(U-V)$, the local star formation rate,
and the host stellar mass to the host galaxy morphology. The observed trends
suggest that the host galaxy morphology is a good parameter to characterize the
SN Ia environment. Therefore, we study the influence of host galaxy morphology
on light-curve parameters of SNe Ia for the Pantheon cosmological supernova
sample. We determine the Hubble morphological type of host galaxies for a
sub-sample of 330 SNe Ia. We confirm that the SALT2 stretch parameter $x_1$
depends on the host morphology with the $p$-value $\sim10^{-14}$. The
supernovae with lower stretch value are hosted mainly by elliptical and
lenticular galaxies. No correlation for the SALT2 colour parameter $c$ is
found. We also examine Hubble diagram residuals for supernovae hosted by the
""Early-type"" and ""Late-type"" morphological groups of galaxies. The analysis
reveals that the mean distance modulus residual in early-type galaxies is
smaller than the one in late-type galaxies, which means that early-type
galaxies contain brighter supernovae. However, we do not observe any difference
in the residual dispersion for these two morphological groups. The obtained
results are in the line with other analyses showing environmental dependence of
SN Ia light-curve parameters and luminosity. We confirm the importance of
including a host galaxy parameter into the standardisation procedure of SNe Ia

proton's eigenstate. This result, together with the exclusive and inclusive
connection and analytic constraints on the form of hadronic structure functions
from Light-Front Holographic QCD (LFHQCD) predicts a significant
non-perturbative $c(x,Q) - \bar{c}(x,Q)$ asymmetry in the proton structure
function at high $x$, consistent with the dynamics predicted by intrinsic charm
models. Recent ATLAS data on the associated production of prompt photons and
charm-quark jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 8$ TeV has provided new
constraints on non-perturbative intrinsic charm and tests of the LGTH
predictions. We also focus on other experimental observables which have high
sensitivity to the intrinsic heavy contributions to PDFs.

Here we combine simultaneous transport and x-ray diffraction measurements with
in-situ tunable strain (elasto-XRD) to measure the temperature dependence of
the shear modulus and elastoresistivity above the nematic transition and the
spontaneous orthorhombicity and resistivity anisotropy below the nematic

The ratio of transport to structural quantities is nearly
temperature-independent over a 74 K range and agrees between the ordered and

to probe the nemato-elastic and nemato-transport couplings, which have
important implications to the nearby superconductivity. It also enables the
measurement in the large strain limit, where the breakdown of mean field

their improved performance. Traditionally, these methods are trained in a
supervised manner, requiring a set of noisy input and clean target image pairs.
More recently, self-supervised approaches have been proposed to learn denoising
from only noisy images. These methods assume that noise across pixels is
statistically independent, and the underlying image pixels show spatial
correlations across neighborhoods. These methods rely on a masking approach
that divides the image pixels into two disjoint sets, where one is used as
input to the network while the other is used to define the loss. However, these
previous self-supervised approaches rely on a purely data-driven regularization
neural network without explicitly taking the masking model into account. In
this work, building on these self-supervised approaches, we introduce
Noise2Inpaint (N2I), a training approach that recasts the denoising problem
into a regularized image inpainting framework. This allows us to use an
objective function, which can incorporate different statistical properties of
the noise as needed. We use algorithm unrolling to unroll an iterative
optimization for solving this objective function and train the unrolled network
end-to-end. The training paradigm follows the masking approach from previous
works, splitting the pixels into two disjoint sets. Importantly, one of these
is now used to impose data fidelity in the unrolled network, while the other
still defines the loss. We demonstrate that N2I performs successful denoising
on real-world datasets, while better preserving details compared to its purely
data-driven counterpart Noise2Self.

pericentric and the apocentric resonance zone. As the eccentricity approaches
zero, the centers of these zones diverge away from the nominal resonance
location but their widths shrink. We also report a novel finding of ""bridges""
between adjacent first order resonances: at low eccentricities, the apocentric
libration zone of a first order resonance smoothly connects with the
pericentric libration zone of the neighboring first order resonance. These
bridges may facilitate resonant migration across large radial distances in
planetary systems, entirely in the low eccentricity regime.

Deep-network-based data-fusion models have been developed to capture the
complex associations and the performance in diagnosis has been improved
accordingly. Moving beyond diagnosis prediction, evaluation of disease
mechanisms is critically important for biomedical research. Deep-network-based
data-fusion models, however, are difficult to interpret, bringing about
difficulties for studying biological mechanisms. In this work, we develop an
interpretable multimodal fusion model, namely gCAM-CCL, which can perform
automated diagnosis and result interpretation simultaneously. The gCAM-CCL
model can generate interpretable activation maps, which quantify pixel-level
contributions of the input features. This is achieved by combining intermediate
feature maps using gradient-based weights. Moreover, the estimated activation
maps are class-specific, and the captured cross-data associations are
interest/label related, which further facilitates class-specific analysis and
biological mechanism analysis. We validate the gCAM-CCL model on a brain
imaging-genetic study, and show gCAM-CCL's performed well for both
classification and mechanism analysis. Mechanism analysis suggests that during
task-fMRI scans, several object recognition related regions of interests (ROIs)
are first activated and then several downstream encoding ROIs get involved.
Results also suggest that the higher cognition performing group may have
stronger neurotransmission signaling while the lower cognition performing group
may have problem in brain/neuron development, resulting from genetic

policies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since
models are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a
calibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it
predicts an error is likely. Crucially, the calibrator benefits from observing

work, we study whether reflection is indeed absent or undetectable due to its
intrinsically weak features together with the low statistics inherent to LLAGN.
Here we focus on NGC 3718 ($L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim10^{-5}$) combining observations
from XMM--Newton and the deepest to date NuSTAR (0.5--79 keV) spectrum of a
LLAGN, to constrain potential reflectors, and analyze how the fitted coronal
parameters depend on the reflection model. We test models representing both an
accretion disc (Relxill) and a torus-like (MYTorus and Borus) neutral
reflector. From a statistical point of view, reflection is not required, but
its inclusion allows to place strong constraints on the geometry and physical
features of the surroundings: both neutral reflectors (torus) tested should be
Compton thin ($N_H<10^{23.2}$cm$^{-2}$) and preferentially cover a large
fraction of the sky. If the reflected light instead arises from an ionized
reflector, a highly ionized case is preferred. These models produce an
intrinsic power-law spectral index in the range [1.81--1.87], where the torus
models result in steeper slopes. The cut-off energy of the power-law emission
also changes with the inclusion of reflection models, resulting in constrained
values for the disc reflectors and unconstrained values for torus reflectors.

functions revealed by medium amplitude parallel superposition (MAPS) rheology.
This experimental protocol measures the medium amplitude response of a material
to a simple shear deformation composed of three sine waves at different
frequencies. Imposing this deformation and measuring the mechanical response
reveals a rich data set consisting of up to 19 measurements of the third order
complex modulus at distinct three-frequency coordinates. We discuss how the
choice of the input frequencies influences the features of the MAPS domain
studied by the experiment. A polynomial interpolation method for reducing the
bias of measured values from spectral leakage and variance due to noise is
discussed, including a derivation of the optimal range of amplitudes for the
input signal. This leads to the conclusion that conducting the experiment in a
stress-controlled fashion possesses a distinct advantage to the
strain-controlled mode. The experimental protocol is demonstrated through
measurements of the MAPS response of a model complex fluid: a surfactant
solution of wormlike micelles. The resulting data set is indeed large and
feature-rich, while still being acquired in a time comparable to similar medium
amplitude oscillatory shear (MAOS) experiments. We demonstrate that the data
represents measurements of an intrinsic material function by studying its
internal consistency, its compatibility with low-frequency predictions for
Coleman-Noll simple fluids, and its agreement with data obtained via MAOS
amplitude sweeps. Finally, the data is compared to predictions from the
corotational Maxwell model to demonstrate the power of MAPS rheology in
determining whether a constitutive model is consistent with a material's
time-dependent response.

  In this paper, we consider the problem of randomizing data so that previously
discovered patterns or models are taken into account. The randomization methods
can be used in iterative data mining. At each step in the data mining process,
the randomization produces random samples from the set of data matrices
satisfying the already discovered patterns or models. That is, given a data set
and some statistics (e.g., cluster centers or co-occurrence counts) of the
data, the randomization methods sample data sets having similar values of the
given statistics as the original data set. We use Metropolis sampling based on
local swaps to achieve this. We describe experiments on real data that
demonstrate the usefulness of our approach. Our results indicate that in many

PsP (33) and tumor recurrence (41) were analyzed. First, enhancing lesion on
Gd-T1w MRI and peri-lesional hyperintensities on T2w/FLAIR were segmented by
experts and then registered to a brain atlas. Using patients from the two
phenotypes, we construct two atlases by quantifying frequency of occurrence of
enhancing lesion and peri-lesion hyperintensities, by averaging voxel
intensities across the population. Analysis of differential involvement was
then performed to compute voxel-wise significant differences (p-value<0.05)
across the atlases. Statistically significant clusters were finally mapped to a
structural atlas to provide anatomic localization of their location. Our
results demonstrate that patients with tumor recurrence showed prominence of
their initial tumor in the parietal lobe, while patients with PsP showed a
multi-focal distribution of the initial tumor in the frontal and temporal
lobes, insula, and putamen. These preliminary results suggest that
lateralization of pre-treatment lesions towards certain anatomical areas of the

  Parameters","Accepted by NeurIPS 2020",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) is a very successful algorithm
in meta-learning practice, it can have high computational cost because it
updates all model parameters over both the inner loop of task-specific
adaptation and the outer-loop of meta initialization training. A more efficient
algorithm ANIL (which refers to almost no inner loop) was proposed recently by
Raghu et al. 2019, which adapts only a small subset of parameters in the inner
loop and thus has substantially less computational cost than MAML as
demonstrated by extensive experiments. However, the theoretical convergence of
ANIL has not been studied yet. In this paper, we characterize the convergence
rate and the computational complexity for ANIL under two representative
inner-loop loss geometries, i.e., strongly-convexity and nonconvexity. Our
results show that such a geometric property can significantly affect the
overall convergence performance of ANIL. For example, ANIL achieves a faster
convergence rate for a strongly-convex inner-loop loss as the number $N$ of
inner-loop gradient descent steps increases, but a slower convergence rate for
a nonconvex inner-loop loss as $N$ increases. Moreover, our complexity analysis
provides a theoretical quantification on the improved efficiency of ANIL over
MAML. The experiments on standard few-shot meta-learning benchmarks validate
our theoretical findings.

An acoustic (dispersive spin-wave) mode develops. (2) The spin-wave bandwidth

magnetic island and becomes abnormally small for large clusters. (3) Optical
(dispersionless spin excitation) modes are present for all block states studied

exploration, for instance, when an agent needs to learn many skills
simultaneously, or multiple conflicting objectives need to be balanced. To
address these challenges, we propose the \textit{task-agnostic RL} framework:
In the exploration phase, the agent first collects trajectories by exploring
the MDP without the guidance of a reward function. After exploration, it aims
at finding near-optimal policies for $N$ tasks, given the collected
trajectories augmented with \textit{sampled rewards} for each task. We present
an efficient task-agnostic RL algorithm, \textsc{UCBZero}, that finds
$\epsilon$-optimal policies for $N$ arbitrary tasks after at most $\tilde

$\ell$-walk MPNNs, which aggregate features along walks of length $\ell$

More generally, $\ell$-walk MPNNs, for any $\ell\geq 2$, are shown to match the
expressive power of the recently introduced $\ell$-walk refinement procedure
(W[$\ell$]). Based on a correspondence between 2-WL and W[$\ell$], we observe
that $\ell$-walk MPNNs and $2$-walk MPNNs have the same expressive power, i.e.,
they can distinguish the same pairs of graphs, but $\ell$-walk MPNNs can
possibly distinguish pairs of graphs faster than $2$-walk MPNNs. When it comes
to concrete learnable graph neural network (GNN) formalisms that match 2-WL or
W[$\ell$] in expressive power, we consider second-order graph neural networks
that allow for non-linear layers. In particular, to match W[$\ell$] in

propose different versions of second-order GNNs depending on the type of

atmospheric turbulence. We characterize the size and morphology of the snow
particles, and we simultaneously image their velocity, acceleration, and
relative concentration over vertical planes about 30 m2 in area. We find that
turbulence-driven settling enhancement explains otherwise contradictory trends
between the particle size and velocity. The estimates of the Stokes number and
the correlation between vertical velocity and local concentration indicate that
the enhanced settling is rooted in the preferential sweeping mechanism. When
the snow vertical velocity is large compared to the characteristic turbulence
velocity, the crossing trajectories effect results in strong accelerations.
When the conditions of preferential sweeping are met, the concentration field
is highly non-uniform and clustering appears over a wide range of scales. These
clusters, identified for the first time in a naturally occurring flow, display
the signature features seen in canonical settings: power-law size distribution,
fractal-like shape, vertical elongation, and large fall speed that increases
with the cluster size. These findings demonstrate that the fundamental
phenomenology of particle-laden turbulence can be leveraged towards a better
predictive understanding of snow precipitation and ground snow accumulation.

  controls: a mean field game-like approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we consider a mean field approach to modeling the agents flow
over a transportation network. In particular, beside a standard framework of
mean field games, with controlled dynamics by the agents and costs
mass-distribution dependent, we also consider a path preferences dynamics
obtained as a generalization of the so-called noisy best response dynamics.
Such a preferences dynamics says the agents choose their path having access to
global information about the network congestion state and based on the
observation of the decision of the agents that have preceded. We prove the
existence of a mean field equilibrium obtained as a fixed point of a map over a
suitable set of time-varying mass-distributions, defined edge by edge in the
network. We also address the case where the admissible set of controls is
suitably bounded depending on the mass-distribution on the edge itself.

facilitates making decisions on whether an order should be picked individually

so with which other orders. We approach the problem by formulating it as a
semi-Markov decision process and develop a vector-based state representation
that includes the characteristics of the warehouse system. This allows us to
create a deep reinforcement learning solution that learns a strategy by
interacting with the environment and solve the problem with a proximal policy
optimization algorithm. We evaluate the performance of the proposed DRL

different problem settings. The results show that the DRL approach is able to
develop a strategy that produces consistent, good solutions and performs better

  However, there are important metrics beyond accuracy: computational
efficiency and stability against adversarial perturbations. In this paper, we
propose two closely connected methods to improve these metrics on contour

adversarial perturbations and (b) a novel constructive training algorithm that
generates sparse networks with $O(1)$ connections per neuron.

relying on the robustness of strong neurons alone. We also proved that

a striking numerical agreement between the bulk viscosity in the lepton era
calculated by Husdal (2016) and our own calculations of the present-day bulk
viscosity when the functional form is $\zeta\,\sim\sqrt{\rho}$. From a
phenomenological point of view, we thus seem to have an ansatz for the
viscosity which bridges the infancy of the Universe ($\sim 1$ s) with the
present. This can also be looked upon as a kind of symmetry between the
early-time cosmology and the present-day cosmology: it is quite remarkable that
the kinetic theory-based bulk viscosity in the early universe and the
experimentally-based bulk viscosity in the present universe can be covered by
the same simple analytical formula. \textit{Second}, we consider the Kasner
universe as a typical anisotropic model of Bianchi-type I, investigating
whether this geometrical model is compatible with constant viscosity
coefficients in the fluid. Perhaps surprisingly, the existence of a shear
viscosity turns out to be incompatible with the Kasner model. By contrast, a
bulk viscosity is non-problematic in the {\it isotropic} version of the model.
In the special case of a Zel'dovich (stiff) fluid, the three equal exponents in
the Kasner metric are even determined by the bulk viscosity alone, independent
of the value of the fluid energy density. We also give a brief comparison with
some other recent approaches to viscous cosmology.

opens a gap at half-filling and allows for the realization of a quantum Hall

both spin components are in the same quantum Hall state. We add to the system a
staggered potential $\Delta$ along the $\hat{x}$-direction favoring a normal
insulator and the Hubbard interaction $U$ favoring a Mott insulator. The Mott
insulator is a N\'eel antiferromagnet for small and a stripe antiferromagnet
for large NNN hopping. We investigate the $U$-$\Delta$ phase diagram of the

Weights Update (OMWU) for saddle-point optimization have received growing

behaviors for simple bilinear games over the probability simplex are still not
fully understood - previous analysis lacks explicit convergence rates, only
applies to an exponentially small learning rate, or requires additional
assumptions such as the uniqueness of the optimal solution. In this work, we
significantly expand the understanding of last-iterate convergence for OGDA and
OMWU in the constrained setting. Specifically, for OMWU in bilinear games over
the simplex, we show that when the equilibrium is unique, linear last-iterate
convergence is achieved with a learning rate whose value is set to a universal
constant, improving the result of (Daskalakis & Panageas, 2019b) under the same
assumption. We then significantly extend the results to more general objectives
and feasible sets for the projected OGDA algorithm, by introducing a sufficient
condition under which OGDA exhibits concrete last-iterate convergence rates
with a constant learning rate whose value only depends on the smoothness of the
objective function. We show that bilinear games over any polytope satisfy this
condition and OGDA converges exponentially fast even without the unique
equilibrium assumption. Our condition also holds for
strongly-convex-strongly-concave functions, recovering the result of (Hsieh et

algorithms responsible for making decisions on behalf of such groups encounter
the problem of preference aggregation: combining inconsistent and sometimes
contradictory individual preferences into a representative aggregate. In this
paper, we address this problem in a real-world public health context: kidney
exchange. The algorithms that allocate kidneys from living donors to patients
needing transplants in kidney exchange matching markets should prioritize
patients in a way that aligns with the values of the community they serve, but
allocation preferences vary widely across individuals. In this paper, we
propose, implement and evaluate a methodology for prioritizing patients based
on such heterogeneous moral preferences. Instead of selecting a single static
set of patient weights, we learn a distribution over preference functions based
on human subject responses to allocation dilemmas, then sample from this
distribution to dynamically determine patient weights during matching. We find
that this methodology increases the average rank of matched patients in the
sampled preference ordering, indicating better satisfaction of group
preferences. We hope that this work will suggest a roadmap for future automated
moral decision making on behalf of heterogeneous groups.

understand these observations, we explore the sulfur-water chemical system
using a one-dimensional chemistry-diffusion model. We find that SO2 and H2O
mixing ratios above the clouds are highly dependent on mixing ratios of the two
species at the middle cloud top (58 km). The behavior of sulfur-water chemical
system can be classified into three regimes but there is no abrupt transition
among these regimes. In particular, there is no bifurcation behavior as
previously claimed. We also find that the SO2 self-shielding effect causes H2O
above the clouds to respond to the middle cloud top in a non-monotonic fashion.
Through comparison with observations, we find that mixing ratio variations at
the middle cloud top can explain the observed variability of SO2 and H2O. The
sulfur-water chemistry in the middle atmosphere is responsible for the H2O-SO2
anti-correlation at 64 km. Eddy transport change alone cannot explain the
variations of both species. These results imply that variations of species
abundance in the middle atmosphere are significantly influenced by the lower

require an important modeling effort or may lead to models which are not
flexible enough to reproduce all the complexity of the phenomenon of interest.
In such situations, an appealing alternative consists in inferring the
state-space model directly from the data using a non-parametric framework. The
recent developments of powerful simulation techniques have permitted to improve
the statistical inference for parametric state-space models. It is proposed to
combine two of these techniques, namely the Stochastic Expectation-Maximization
(SEM) algorithm and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches, for non-parametric
estimation in state-space models. The performance of the proposed algorithm is
assessed through simulations on toy models and an application to environmental
data is discussed.

  Masking uses secure multi-party computation to split the secrets into random

construct secure hardware primitives to mask $\textit{all}$ the linear and

Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained popularity in this area since graphs
offer a natural way of modeling particle interactions and provide a clear way
of discretizing the continuum models. However, the graphs constructed for
approximating such tasks usually ignore long-range interactions due to
unfavorable scaling of the computational complexity with respect to the number
of nodes. The errors due to these approximations scale with the discretization
of the system, thereby not allowing for generalization under mesh-refinement.
Inspired by the classical multipole methods, we propose a novel multi-level
graph neural network framework that captures interaction at all ranges with
only linear complexity. Our multi-level formulation is equivalent to
recursively adding inducing points to the kernel matrix, unifying GNNs with
multi-resolution matrix factorization of the kernel. Experiments confirm our

brain functions by identifying brain network interactions and, ultimately, how
those interactions produce cognitions. A popular definition of FC is by
statistical associations between measured brain regions. However, this could be
problematic since the associations can only provide spatial connections but not
causal interactions among regions of interests. Hence, it is necessary to study
their causal relationship. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models have been
applied in recent FC studies but often encountered problems such as limited
sample sizes and large number of variables (namely high-dimensional problems),
which lead to both computational difficulty and convergence issues. As a
result, the use of DAG models is problematic, where the identification of DAG
models in general is nondeterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard). To this
end, we propose a $\psi$-learning incorporated linear non-Gaussian acyclic
model ($\psi$-LiNGAM). We use the association model ($\psi$-learning) to
facilitate causal inferences and the model works well especially for
high-dimensional cases. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed

even under black-box settings, in which the adversary only has query access to

such attacks (e.g., observing massive similar but non-identical queries), it is
often challenging to exactly infer the adversary intent (e.g., the target class
of the adversarial example the adversary attempts to craft) especially during
early stages of the attacks, which is crucial for performing effective
deterrence and remediation of the threats in many scenarios.
  In this paper, we present AdvMind, a new class of estimation models that
infer the adversary intent of black-box adversarial attacks in a robust and
prompt manner. Specifically, to achieve robust detection, AdvMind accounts for
the adversary adaptiveness such that her attempt to conceal the target will
significantly increase the attack cost (e.g., in terms of the number of
queries); to achieve prompt detection, AdvMind proactively synthesizes
plausible query results to solicit subsequent queries from the adversary that
maximally expose her intent. Through extensive empirical evaluation on
benchmark datasets and state-of-the-art black-box attacks, we demonstrate that
on average AdvMind detects the adversary intent with over 75% accuracy after
observing less than 3 query batches and meanwhile increases the cost of
adaptive attacks by over 60%. We further discuss the possible synergy between
AdvMind and other defense methods against black-box adversarial attacks,

parameterization restricts the type of functions they can learn compared to
discrete architectures with layer-dependent weights. Here, we describe a new
module called neurally controlled ODE (N-CODE) designed to improve the
expressivity of NODEs. The parameters of N-CODE modules are dynamic variables
governed by a trainable map from initial or current activation state, resulting
in forms of open-loop and closed-loop control, respectively. A single module is
sufficient for learning a distribution on non-autonomous flows that adaptively
drive neural representations. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence
that N-CODE circumvents limitations of previous NODEs models and show how
increased model expressivity manifests in several supervised and unsupervised
learning problems. These favorable empirical results indicate the potential of
using data- and activity-dependent plasticity in neural networks across
numerous domains.

high-resolution depth migration approach useful for extracting information such
as reservoir localization and boundaries. RTM, however, is time-consuming and
data-intensive as it requires computing twice the wave equation to generate and
store an imaging condition. RTM, when embedded in an uncertainty quantification

that one-dimensional TSs, realized as optical spatial solitons in a planar

SOC-like terms emulated by obliquity of the coupling between cores of the

approximations identifies a vast stability area for skew-symmetric solitons in

For broad solitons, diffraction, represented by second derivatives in the

To overcome these difficulties, we analyze the scheme through its dual problem

Notably, the contraction principle relies only on the existence of an optimal

principle holds in a very general setting, and opens the door to using
optimal-transport-based variational schemes to study a larger class of

aligning feature representations from different domains. Beyond the discrepancy
in feature space, the gap between known source label and unknown target label
distribution, recognized as label distribution drift, is another crucial factor
raising domain divergence, and has not been paid enough attention and well
explored. From this point, in this paper, we first experimentally reveal how
label distribution drift brings negative effects on current domain adaptation
methods. Next, we propose Label distribution Matching Domain Adversarial
Network (LMDAN) to handle data distribution shift and label distribution drift
jointly. In LMDAN, label distribution drift problem is addressed by the
proposed source samples weighting strategy, which select samples to contribute
to positive adaptation and avoid negative effects brought by the mismatched in
label distribution. Finally, different from general domain adaptation
experiments, we modify domain adaptation datasets to create the considerable
label distribution drift between source and target domain. Numerical results
and empirical model analysis show that LMDAN delivers superior performance
compared to other state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods under such
scenarios.

however, focus only on the topological properties of networks for resilience
assessment, which does not fully capture their dynamical resilience. In this
study, we evaluate and quantify network resilience based both on the
functionality states of links and on topology. We propose three independent
measures---the failure scaling index (FSI), the weighted degree scaling index
(WDSI), and the link functionality irregularity index (LFII)---that capture
macroscopic, microscopic, and temporal performance characteristics of networks.
Accordingly, an integrated general resilience (GR) metric is used to assess
performance loss and recovery speed in networks with time-variant
functionality. We test the proposed methods in the study of traffic networks
under urban flooding impacts in the context of Harris County, Texas, during
Hurricane Harvey using a high-resolution dataset, which contains temporal speed
of 20,000 roads every 5 minutes for 5 months. Our results show that link
weights and node weighted degrees with perturbed functionality in the traffic
network during flooding follow a scale-free distribution. Hence, three proposed
measures capture clear resilience curves of the network as well as identify the
irregularity of links. Accordingly, network performance measures and the
methodology for resilience quantification reveal insights into the extent of
network performance loss and recovery speed, suggesting possible improvements
in network resilience in the face of external perturbations such as urban
flooding.

identifying the diagonal Ramsey numbers $r_k(p)$. The best-known general upper

us to greatly reduce the amount of case-checking required in identifying

general circulation models have been employed to simulate their possible

differences in the results of the models even when they are forced with the

contributes to the differences. Using the atmospheric general circulation model
ExoCAM coupled to a 50-m slab ocean, we examine three different horizontal
resolutions (440 km * 550 km, 210 km * 280 km, and 50 km * 70 km in latitude

under the same dynamical core and the same schemes of radiation, convection and
clouds. Among the experiments, the differences are within 5 K in global-mean
surface temperature and within 0.007 in planetary albedo. These differences are
from cloud feedback, water vapor feedback, and the decreasing trend of relative
humidity with increasing resolution. Relatively small-scale downdrafts between
upwelling columns over the substellar region are better resolved and the mixing
between dry and wet air parcels and between anvil clouds and their environment
are enhanced as the resolution is increased. These reduce atmospheric relative
humidity and high-level cloud fraction, causing a lower clear-sky greenhouse
effect, a weaker cloud longwave radiation effect, and subsequently a cooler
climate with increasing model resolution. Overall, the sensitivity of the
simulated climate of tidally locked aquaplanets to model resolution is small.

We first consider settings where the difference between largest and second
largest underlying metric has a known lower bound. With this knowledge we
propose a class of perturbed SBRD with the following property: only policies
with maximum metric are observed with nonzero probability for a broad class of
stochastic games with finite memory. We then consider settings where the lower
bound for the difference is unknown. For this setting, we propose a class of
perturbed SBRD such that the metrics of the policies observed with nonzero
probability differ from the optimal by any given tolerance. The proposed
perturbed SBRD addresses the opponent-induced non-stationarity by fixing the
strategies of others for the learning agent, and uses empirical game-theoretic
analysis to estimate payoffs for each strategy profile obtained due to the
perturbation.

structures can cause severe damage to piping systems or fluid machines,
inducing serious accidents. In these phenomena, the mechanism of structural
damage depends on the wave propagation across the fluid-solid interface.
Previous studies reported that disagreements between the induced pressure value
on the solid-fluid movable interface and the value predicted by the classical
one-dimensional theory arose from the effects of two-dimensional wave
propagation. To address this problem, in this study, a two-dimensional
axisymmetric simulation of wave propagation across the solid-fluid interface
with FSI was conducted. The simulation was performed using ANSYS Autodyn with a
Lagrangian solver for solids and Eulerian solver for water. The results showed
that radial wave propagation caused by the dynamic effect of the tube and
water's inertia affected the peak pressure on the solid-fluid interface. The
peak pressure was attenuated near the tube wall because of the inertial effect
of the tube and fluid expansion. By calculating the mean pressure and axial
stress to compare the simulated peak pressure with that from one-dimensional
acoustic theory, it was indicated that the transition region for transmitted
pressure was located immediately after the solid-fluid interface. In this
region, the transmitted peak pressure may exceed the value predicted by
one-dimensional acoustic theory. The transition region was oriented in the
axial direction from the interface. In addition, prediction of the transmitted
peak pressure with one-dimensional acoustic theory was suggested via normal
wave speed in the unconfined fluid from a safety engineering perspective,
although the circumferential stress generated in the tube enclosing fluid can
be sufficiently accurately predicted using the same theory with the Korteweg
speed.

special case of such reducts. Then we refine this structure demonstrating that
the edges of the graph of an algebra omitting type 1 can be made `thin', that

Within our SMSR, spatial masks learn to identify ""important"" regions while
channel masks learn to mark redundant channels in those ""unimportant"" regions.
Consequently, redundant computation can be accurately localized and skipped

nuclei. An intriguing test of this scenario is to look for quantum nucleation
of $ud$QM inside neutron stars due to their large baryon densities. In this
paper, we study the transition rate of cold neutron stars to $ud$ quark stars
($ud$QSs) and the astrophysical implications, considering the relevant
theoretical uncertainties and observational constraints. It turns out that a
large portion of parameter space predicts an instantaneous transition, and so
the observed neutron stars are mostly $ud$QSs. We find this possibility still
viable under the recent gravitational wave and pulsar observations, although
there are debates on its compatibility with some observations that involve
complicated structure of quark matter. The tension could be partially relieved
in the two-families scenario, where the high-mass stars ($M\gtrsim2 M_{\odot}$)

hadronic stars. In this case, the slow transition of the low-mass hadronic
stars points to a very specific class of hadronic models with moderately stiff

angular scales in the CMB have a common origin in a cosmic bounce that took
place before the inflationary era. The bounce introduces a new physical scale
in the problem, which breaks the almost scale invariance of inflation. As a
result, the state of scalar perturbations at the onset of inflation is no
longer the Bunch-Davies vacuum, but it rather contains excitations and
non-Gaussianity, which are larger for infrared modes. We argue that the
combined effect of these excitations and the correlations between CMB modes and
longer wavelength perturbations, can account for the observed power
suppression, for the dipolar asymmetry, and it can also produce a preference
for odd-parity correlations. The model can also alleviate the tension in the
lensing amplitude $A_L$. We adopt a phenomenological viewpoint by
characterizing the model with a few free parameters, rather than restricting to
specific bouncing theories. We identify the minimum set of ingredients needed
for our ideas to hold, and point out examples of theories in the literature
where these conditions are met.

ubiquitously in various scientific fields. Recently, deep reinforcement

vectors of molecules, moving along different directions in the rest frame of

X-ray pulsar, GX 301-2, to explain the orbital spin-up to spin-down reversal
near periastron, based on the stream model invoked to explain the
pre-periastron flare of GX 301-2 previously. We study in detail three rare
spin-up events detected by Fermi/GBM and find that the spin derivatives are
correlated with the Swift/BAT fluxes, following a relation of $\dot{\nu}\propto
F^{0.75\pm0.05}$. All the spin-up events of GX 301-2 started about 10 days
after the periastron, which is the time needed for tidally stripped gas to
reach the neutron star. The slow rotation of the optical companion implies that
the accreted matter is likely to have angular momentum in the direction of the
orbital motion, as in a Roche-Lobe-like overflow. As a result, the spin-up
events of GX 301-2 would favor accretion of a prograde disk to a prograde
neutron star. We also find that the flare of intrinsic X-ray emission of GX
301-2 happened 0.4 days before periastron, while the flare of low energy
emission (2-10 keV) happened about 1.4 days before periastron. The preceding
low energy flare can be explained by stronger absorption of the intrinsic X-ray
emission closer to the periastron. This finding weakened the need of the stream
model. The pulse fraction of GX 301-2 near periastron is reduced heavily, which
is likely caused by Compton scattering process. Compton reflection from the
optical companion might be responsible for the observed orbital spin reversal
of GX 301-2.

which involves replicating data points, has been used to mitigate the effect of
straggling machines. Recent work has studied approximate gradient coding, which
concerns coding schemes where the replication factor of the data is too low to
recover the full gradient exactly. Our work is motivated by the challenge of
creating approximate gradient coding schemes that simultaneously work well in
both the adversarial and stochastic models. To that end, we introduce novel
approximate gradient codes based on expander graphs, in which each machine
receives exactly two blocks of data points. We analyze the decoding error both
in the random and adversarial straggler setting, when optimal decoding
coefficients are used. We show that in the random setting, our schemes achieve
an error to the gradient that decays exponentially in the replication factor.
In the adversarial setting, the error is nearly a factor of two smaller than
any existing code with similar performance in the random setting. We show
convergence bounds both in the random and adversarial setting for gradient
descent under standard assumptions using our codes. In the random setting, our
convergence rate improves upon block-box bounds. In the adversarial setting, we
show that gradient descent can converge down to a noise floor that scales
linearly with the adversarial error to the gradient. We demonstrate empirically
that our schemes achieve near-optimal error in the random setting and converge
faster than algorithms which do not use the optimal decoding coefficients.

domain, where an agent needs to reach multiple goals, the choice of training
goals can largely affect sample efficiency. When biological agents learn, there
is often an organized and meaningful order to which learning happens. Inspired
by this, we propose setting up an automatic curriculum for goals that the agent
needs to solve. Our key insight is that if we can sample goals at the frontier
of the set of goals that an agent is able to reach, it will provide a
significantly stronger learning signal compared to randomly sampled goals. To
operationalize this idea, we introduce a goal proposal module that prioritizes
goals that maximize the epistemic uncertainty of the Q-function of the policy.
This simple technique samples goals that are neither too hard nor too easy for
the agent to solve, hence enabling continual improvement. We evaluate our
method across 13 multi-goal robotic tasks and 5 navigation tasks, and

paradigmatic fluid dynamical systems frequently discussed together because of
their many similarities despite their different geometries and forcing. Often
these analogies require approximations, but in the limit of large radii where
TCF becomes rotating plane Couette flow (RPC) exact relations can be
established. When the flows are restricted to two spatial degrees of freedom
there is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC
to the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we
deduce several relations between both flows: (i) The Rayleigh number $Ra$ in
convection and the Reynolds $Re$ and rotation $R_\Omega$ number in RPC flow are
related by $Ra= Re^2 R_\Omega (1-R_\Omega)$. (ii) Heat and angular momentum
transport differ by $(1-R_\Omega)$, explaining why angular momentum transport
is not symmetric around $R_\Omega=1/2$ even though the relation between $Ra$
and $R_\Omega$ has this symmetry. This relationship leads to a predicted value
of $R_\Omega$ that maximizes the angular momentum transport that agrees
remarkably well with existing numerical simulations of the full 3D system.
(iii) One variable in both flows satisfy a maximum principle i.e., the fields'
extrema occur at the walls. Accordingly, backflow events in shear flow
\emph{cannot} occur in this two-dimensional setting. (iv) For free slip
boundary conditions on the axial and radial velocity components, previous
rigorous analysis for RBC implies that the azimuthal momentum transport in RPC
is bounded from above by $Re^{5/6}$ with a scaling exponent smaller than the
anticipated $Re^1$.

allows faster convergence rates and robust solutions even in the presence of
noisy data as demonstrated in our comparisons to popular algorithms such as
Q-learning, Double Q-learning and entropy regularized Soft Q-learning. The
framework extends to the class of parameterized MDP and RL problems, where
states and actions are parameter dependent, and the objective is to determine
the optimal parameters along with the corresponding optimal policy. Here, the
associated cost function can possibly be non-convex with multiple poor local
minima. Simulation results applied to a 5G small cell network problem
demonstrate successful determination of communication routes and the small cell
locations. We also obtain sensitivity measures to problem parameters and
robustness to noisy environment data.

ability to influence users' perceptions and decisions, from their dining
choices to their voting preferences. This influence has drawn scrutiny, with
many calling for regulations on filtering algorithms, but designing and
enforcing regulations remains challenging. In this work, we examine three
questions. First, given a regulation, how would one design an audit to enforce
it? Second, does the audit impose a performance cost on the platform? Third,
how does the audit affect the content that the platform is incentivized to
filter? In response, we propose a method such that, given a regulation, an
auditor can test whether that regulation is met with only black-box access to
the filtering algorithm. We then turn to the platform's perspective. The
platform's goal is to maximize an objective function while meeting regulation.
We find that there are conditions under which the regulation does not place a
high performance cost on the platform and, notably, that content diversity can
play a key role in aligning the interests of the platform and regulators.

on other 'secondary' attributes. We assume that the attributes can be estimated
using samples from the arms' distributions, and that the estimators enjoy
suitable concentration properties. We propose an algorithm called Con-LCB that

outputs a Boolean flag that correctly identifies, with high probability,
whether the given instance is feasible/infeasible with respect to the

In a dissipative universe, the irreversible entropy included in the Hubble

$\ddot{\nu}$. We combine multiple pulsars with Bayesian inference, and obtain
an upper limit, $\left|\zeta_{2}\right|<1.3\times10^{-5}$ at 95% confidence

scalable, reliable, and agile wireless network that supports many types of

networks. Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels, interference
between channels adversely affects the fair distribution of bandwidth among
mesh clients, causing node starvation in terms of insufficient bandwidth, which
impedes the adoption of WMN as an efficient access technology. Therefore, a
fair channel assignment is crucial for the mesh clients to utilize the
available resources. However, the node starvation problem due to unfair channel
distribution has been vastly overlooked during channel assignment by the extant
research. Instead, existing channel assignment algorithms either reduce the
total network interference or maximize the total network throughput, which
neither guarantees a fair distribution of the channels nor eliminates node
starvation. To this end, the Fairness-Oriented Semi-Chaotic Genetic
Algorithm-Based Channel Assignment Technique (FA-SCGA-CAA) was proposed in this
paper for Nodes Starvation Problem in Wireless Mesh Networks. FA-SCGA-CAA
optimizes fairness based on multiple-criterion using a modified version of the

technique for creating the primary chromosome with powerful genes. Such a
chromosome was used to create a strong population that directs the search
towards the global minima in an effective and efficient way. The outcome is a
nonlinear fairness oriented fitness function that aims at maximizing the link
fairness while minimizing the link interference. Comparison with related work

required to control their operation dynamically to track the time-varying power

turbines, which remarkably influence the WF dynamic power production. The
nonlinear and high-dimensional nature of dynamic wake model, however, brings
extremely high computation complexity and obscure the design of WF controllers.
This paper overcomes the control difficulty brought by the dynamic wake model
by proposing a novel control-oriented reduced order WF model and a
deep-learning-aided model predictive control (MPC) method. Leveraging recent
advances in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to provide high-fidelity data
that simulates WF dynamic wake flows, two novel deep neural network (DNN)
architectures are specially designed to learn a dynamic WF reduced-order model
(ROM) that can capture the dominant flow dynamics. Then, a novel MPC framework
is constructed that explicitly incorporates the obtained WF ROM to coordinate
different turbines while considering dynamic wake interactions. The proposed WF
ROM and the control method are evaluated in a widely-accepted high-dimensional
dynamic WF simulator whose accuracy has been validated by realistic measurement
data. A 9-turbine WF case and a larger 25-turbine WF case are studied. By
reducing WF model states by many orders of magnitude, the computational burden
of the control method is reduced greatly. Besides, through the proposed method,
the range of AGC signals that can be tracked by the WF in the dynamic operation
is extended compared with the existing greedy controller.

Planet Crossing (GPC) population (those objects with $5.2$ au $ < q < 30$ au)
studying their number and their evolution from their sources, considering the
current configuration of the Solar System. This subject is reviewed from
previous investigations and also addressed by new numerical simulations of the
dynamical evolution of Scattered Disk Objects (SDOs). We obtain a model of the
intrinsic orbital element distribution of GPCs. The Scattered Disk represents
the main source of prograde GPCs and Centaurs, while the contribution from
Plutinos lies between one and two orders of magnitude below that from the SD.
We obtain the number and size distribution of GPCs from our model, computing
9600 GPCs from the SD with $D > 100$ km and $\sim 10^8$ with $D > 1$ km in the
current population. The contribution from other sources is considered
negligible. The mean lifetime in the Centaur zone is 7.2 Myr, while the mean
lifetime of SDOs in the GPC zone is of 68 Myr. The latter is dependent on the
initial inclination, being the ones with high inclinations the ones that
survive the longest in the GPC zone. There is also a correlation of lifetime
with perihelion distance, where greater perihelion leads to longer lifetime.
The dynamical evolution of observed GPCs is different for prograde and
retrograde objects. Retrograde GPCs have lower median lifetime than prograde
ones, thus experiencing a comparatively faster evolution. However, it is
probable that this faster evolution is due to the fact that the majority of
retrograde GPCs have low perihelion values and then, lower lifetimes.

incorporate the notion of delayed service of page requests. The first is the

classical weighted paging problem except that each page request only needs to
be served before a given deadline. This problem arises in many practical
applications of online caching, such as the ""deadline"" I/O scheduler in the
Linux kernel and video-on-demand streaming. The second, and more general,
problem is the (weighted) Paging with Delay (PageD) problem, where the delay in
serving a page request results in a penalty being assessed to the objective.
This problem generalizes the caching problem to allow delayed service, a line
of work that has recently gained traction in online algorithms (e.g., Emek et
al. STOC '16, Azar et al. STOC '17, Azar and Touitou FOCS '19).
  We give $O(\log k\log n)$-competitive algorithms for both the PageTW and
PageD problems on $n$ pages with a cache of size $k$. This significantly
improves on the previous best bounds of $O(k)$ for both problems (Azar et al.
STOC '17). We also consider the offline PageTW and PageD problems, for which we
give $O(1)$ approximation algorithms and prove APX-hardness. These are the
first results for the offline problems; even NP-hardness was not known before
our work. At the heart of our algorithms is a novel ""hitting-set"" LP relaxation
of the PageTW problem that overcomes the $\Omega(k)$ integrality gap of the
natural LP for the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
example of an LP-based algorithm for an online algorithm with delays/deadlines.

Offline-developed algorithms are guided by offline evaluation metrics, which

maximize business KPIs, it is important to pick a north star among all
available offline evaluation metrics. By noting that online products can be
measured by online evaluation metrics, the online counterparts of offline
evaluation metrics, we decompose the problem into two parts. As the offline A/B
test literature works out the first part: counterfactual estimators of offline
evaluation metrics that move the same way as their online counterparts, we
focus on the second part: causal effects of online evaluation metrics on
business KPIs. The north star of offline evaluation metrics should be the one
whose online counterpart causes the most significant lift in the business KPI.
We model the online evaluation metric as a mediator and formalize its causality
with the business KPI as dose-response function (DRF). Our novel approach,
causal meta-mediation analysis, leverages summary statistics of many existing
randomized experiments to identify, estimate, and test the mediator DRF. It is
easy to implement and to scale up, and has many advantages over the literature
of mediation analysis and meta-analysis. We demonstrate its effectiveness by

attention as it is more practical to real-world applications. Though the
composite database provides more sample diversity for learning good
representation models, the important subtle dynamics are prone to disappearing
in the domain shift such that the models greatly degrade their performance,
especially for deep models. In this paper, we analyze the influence of learning
complexity, including the input complexity and model complexity, and discover
that the lower-resolution input data and shallower-architecture model are
helpful to ease the degradation of deep models in composite-database task.
Based on this, we propose a recurrent convolutional network (RCN) to explore
the shallower-architecture and lower-resolution input data, shrinking model and
input complexities simultaneously. Furthermore, we develop three parameter-free
modules (i.e., wide expansion, shortcut connection and attention unit) to
integrate with RCN without increasing any learnable parameters. These three
modules can enhance the representation ability in various perspectives while
preserving not-very-deep architecture for lower-resolution data. Besides, three
modules can further be combined by an automatic strategy (a neural architecture
search strategy) and the searched architecture becomes more robust. Extensive
experiments on MEGC2019 dataset (composited of existing SMIC, CASME II and SAMM
datasets) have verified the influence of learning complexity and shown that
RCNs with three modules and the searched combination outperform the

reducing the size of the model. By these means, heavy calculations can be
avoided when doing the inference, which enables the method to deal with videos
beyond real-time speed while keeping promising performance. Our method achieves

estimate causal effects, partly because their internal validity tends to be
high. At the same time, as part of the big data revolution, large, detailed,
and representative, administrative data sets have become more widely available.
However, the credibility of estimates of causal effects based on such data sets
alone can be low.
  In this paper, we develop statistical methods for systematically combining
experimental and observational data to obtain credible estimates of the causal
effect of a binary treatment on a primary outcome that we only observe in the
observational sample. Both the observational and experimental samples contain
data about a treatment, observable individual characteristics, and a secondary
(often short term) outcome. To estimate the effect of a treatment on the
primary outcome while addressing the potential confounding in the observational
sample, we propose a method that makes use of estimates of the relationship
between the treatment and the secondary outcome from the experimental sample.
If assignment to the treatment in the observational sample were unconfounded,
we would expect the treatment effects on the secondary outcome in the two
samples to be similar. We interpret differences in the estimated causal effects
on the secondary outcome between the two samples as evidence of unobserved
confounders in the observational sample, and develop control function methods
for using those differences to adjust the estimates of the treatment effects on
the primary outcome.
  We illustrate these ideas by combining data on class size and third grade
test scores from the Project STAR experiment with observational data on class
size and both third and eighth grade test scores from the New York school

different frequencies originating from a given transient source. Extragalactic
fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their low frequency emissions, short time
durations, and long propagation distances, are excellent astrophysical probes
to constrain the rest mass of the photon $m_{\gamma}$. However, the derivation
of a limit on $m_{\gamma}$ is complicated by the similar frequency dependences
of dispersion expected from the plasma and nonzero photon mass effects. If a
handful measurements of redshift for FRBs are available, the different redshift
dependences of the plasma and photon mass contributions to the dispersion
measure (DM) might be able to break dispersion degeneracy in testing the photon
mass. For now, nine FRBs with redshift measurements have been reported, which
can turn this idea into reality. Taking into account the DM contributions from
both the plasma and a possible photon mass, we use the data on the nine FRBs to
derive a combined limit of $m_{\gamma}\leq7.1\times10^{-51}\;{\rm kg}$, or
equivalently $m_{\gamma}\leq4.0\times10^{-15}\; {\rm eV}/c^{2}$ at 68\%

reasonable estimation for the DM contribution from the host galaxy, $\rm

in localizing FRBs will further tighten the constraints on both $m_{\gamma}$

unknown medium from available observations by exploring a restricted search
space of possible solutions. Standard grid-based representations are very
general but all too often computationally prohibitive due to the high dimension
of the search space. Adaptive spectral (AS) decompositions instead expand the
unknown medium in a basis of eigenfunctions of a judicious elliptic operator,
which depends itself on the medium. Here the AS decomposition is combined with
a standard inexact Newton-type method for the solution of time-harmonic
scattering problems governed by the Helmholtz equation. By repeatedly adapting
both the eigenfunction basis and its dimension, the resulting adaptive spectral
inversion (ASI) method substantially reduces the dimension of the search space
during the nonlinear optimization. Rigorous estimates of the AS decomposition
are proved for a general piecewise constant medium. Numerical results
illustrate the accuracy and efficiency of the ASI method for time-harmonic
inverse scattering problems, including a salt dome model from geophysics.

  System",,,,,"cs.NI cs.AI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern large-scale systems such as recommender system and online advertising
system are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure. The typical
objective in these applications is to maximize the total revenue, e.g.
GMV~(Gross Merchandise Volume), under a limited computation resource. Usually,
the online serving system follows a multi-stage cascade architecture, which
consists of several stages including retrieval, pre-ranking, ranking, etc.
These stages usually allocate resource manually with specific computing power
budgets, which requires the serving configuration to adapt accordingly. As a
result, the existing system easily falls into suboptimal solutions with respect
to maximizing the total revenue. The limitation is due to the face that,
although the value of traffic requests vary greatly, online serving system
still spends equal computing power among them.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel idea that online serving system could
treat each traffic request differently and allocate ""personalized"" computation
resource based on its value. We formulate this resource allocation problem as a
knapsack problem and propose a Dynamic Computation Allocation Framework~(DCAF).
Under some general assumptions, DCAF can theoretically guarantee that the
system can maximize the total revenue within given computation budget. DCAF
brings significant improvement and has been deployed in the display advertising
system of Taobao for serving the main traffic. With DCAF, we are able to
maintain the same business performance with 20\% computation resource
reduction.

recommend high-quality online reviews to customers. Currently, the vast
majority of studies assume that a review's helpfulness is self-contained. In
practice, however, customers hardly process reviews independently given the
sequential nature. The perceived helpfulness of a review is likely to be
affected by its sequential neighbors (i.e., context), which has been largely
ignored. This paper proposes a new methodology to capture the missing
interaction between reviews and their neighbors. The first end-to-end neural
architecture is developed for neighbor-aware helpfulness prediction (NAP). For
each review, NAP allows for three types of neighbor selection: its preceding,
following, and surrounding neighbors. Four weighting schemes are designed to
learn context clues from the selected neighbors. A review is then
contextualized into the learned clues for neighbor-aware helpfulness
prediction. NAP is evaluated on six domains of real-world online reviews
against a series of state-of-the-art baselines. Extensive experiments confirm
the effectiveness of NAP and the influence of sequential neighbors on a current
reviews. Further hyperparameter analysis reveals three main findings. (1) On
average, eight neighbors treated with uneven importance are engaged for context
construction. (2) The benefit of neighbor-aware prediction mainly results from
closer neighbors. (3) Equally considering up to five closest neighbors of a
review can usually produce a weaker but tolerable prediction result.

approaches, like Random Forests, commonly used for variable selection do not
perform well when there are correlated features and do not account for data
observed over time. FREEtree deals with longitudinal data by using a piecewise
random effects model. It also exploits the network structure of the features by
first clustering them using weighted correlation network analysis, namely
WGCNA. It then conducts a screening step within each cluster of features and a
selection step among the surviving features, that provides a relatively
unbiased way to select features. By using dominant principle components as
regression variables at each leaf and the original features as splitting
variables at splitting nodes, FREEtree maintains its interpretability and
improves its computational efficiency. The simulation results show that
FREEtree outperforms other tree-based methods in terms of prediction accuracy,
feature selection accuracy, as well as the ability to recover the underlying

sketches encode the information necessary for reconstructing 3D shapes. Despite
great progress achieved in 3D reconstruction from distortion-free line

3D shapes from free-hand sketches. We study this task and aim to enhance the

  Unlike previous works, which mostly study distortion-free line drawings, our
3D shape reconstruction is based on free-hand sketches. A major challenge for
free-hand sketch 3D reconstruction comes from the insufficient training data
and free-hand sketch diversity, e.g. individualized sketching styles. We thus
propose data generation and standardization mechanisms. Instead of
distortion-free line drawings, synthesized sketches are adopted as input
training data. Additionally, we propose a sketch standardization module to
handle different sketch distortions and styles. Extensive experiments

on their assembly history. However, only limited information can be extracted
from currently available spin measurements of MBHs owing to the small sample
size and large measurement uncertainties. Upcoming X-ray telescopes with
improved spectral resolution and larger effective area are expected to provide
new insights into the growth history of MBHs. Here we investigate, at a proof
of concept level, how stringent constraints can be placed on the accretion
history of MBHs by the spin measurements from future X-ray missions. We assume
a toy model consisting of a two-phase accretion history composed of an initial
coherent phase with a constant disk orientation, followed by a chaotic phase
with random disk orientations in each accretion episode. By utilizing mock spin
data generated from such models and performing Bayesian Markov Chain Monte
Carlo simulations, we find that most accretion models of MBHs can be
reconstructed provided that $\gtrsim100$ MBH spins are measured with an
accuracy of $\lesssim0.1$. We also quantify the precision of the reconstructed
parameters by adopting various combinations of sample sizes and spin
accuracies, and find that the sample size is more crucial to model
reconstruction once the spin accuracy reaches $\sim 0.1$. To some extent, a
better spin accuracy will compensate for a small sample size and vice versa.
Future X-ray missions such as the Advanced Telescope for High Energy
Astrophysics and the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, may provide
spin measurements of $\gtrsim100$ MBHs with an uncertainty of $\sim0.04-0.1$
and will thus put strong constraints on the MBH growth history.

from coordinated multi-sets of observations: (1) it is usually short in
duration and lasts a few hours at 1 AU; (2) its solar wind parameters, in
particular the magnetic field, seem to keep enhanced for a large range of
distances; and (3) common ICME signatures are often lost. The host ejecta could
be a single ICME or a complex ejecta, being fast enough to drive a shock. These
results clarify previous misinterpretations of this phenomenon as a normal part
of a sheath region. The ""ICME-in-sheath"" phenomenon, together with a
preconditioning effect, produced an extreme set of the magnetic field, speed

porosity of the sedimentary section entering the North Sumatra subduction zone
was measured. This total porosity is derived from the total water content of
core samples thus including pore water and water bound to hydrous minerals like
smectite. Clay mineral composition varies over the sedimentary section and is
mainly kaolinite/illite in the Nicobar Fan units and smectite/illite in the
prefan pelagic unit below. The prefan pelagic unit shows anomalously high total
porosity values and is stratigraphically correlated to a high amplitude
negative polarity (HANP) seismic reflector located landward. This HANP
reflector has been previously interpreted as a porous fluid-rich layer where
the d{\'e}collement may develop along parts of the margin as a consequence of
pore pressure buildup. We estimate clay bound water content from Cation
Exchange Capacity (CEC) which gives information about the smectite/illite
composition and soluble chloride content data. Interstitial porosity
corresponds to onboard total porosity corrected from clay bound water and is
more relevant in terms of sediment compaction state and fluid flow properties.
Interstitial porosity versus vertical effective stress curve shows no evidence
of undercompaction and suggests that the input section 2 has been experiencing
normal consolidation due to high sediment accumulation rate. The porosity
anomaly observed in the prefan pelagic unit results from the local occurrence
of water-bearing minerals like smectite rather than excess pore pressure, which
might, however, buildup more landward in the basin. We also estimate fracture
porosity using a resistivity model for shales used in previous works based on
wireline resistivity log and show that fracture porosity yields 4-6% in damaged

image processing and robotic interactions, is that there are plenty of tasks
but each task cannot afford to collect enough labeled examples to be learned in
isolation. However, by exploiting the similarities across those tasks, one can
hope to overcome such data scarcity. Under a canonical scenario where each task
is drawn from a mixture of k linear regressions, we study a fundamental
question: can abundant small-data tasks compensate for the lack of big-data
tasks? Existing second moment based approaches show that such a trade-off is
efficiently achievable, with the help of medium-sized tasks with
$\Omega(k^{1/2})$ examples each. However, this algorithm is brittle in two
important scenarios. The predictions can be arbitrarily bad (i) even with only
a few outliers in the dataset; or (ii) even if the medium-sized tasks are
slightly smaller with $o(k^{1/2})$ examples each. We introduce a spectral
approach that is simultaneously robust under both scenarios. To this end, we
first design a novel outlier-robust principal component analysis algorithm that
achieves an optimal accuracy. This is followed by a sum-of-squares algorithm to
exploit the information from higher order moments. Together, this approach is
robust against outliers and achieves a graceful statistical trade-off; the lack
of $\Omega(k^{1/2})$-size tasks can be compensated for with smaller tasks,
which can now be as small as $O(\log k)$.

in the framework of chiral quark models. The result obtained at the low-energy
quark model scale is particularly simple, where in the chiral limit a
factorized form follows, $D(x_1,x_2, \vec{q}) = \delta(1-x_1-x_2) F(\vec{q})$
with $x_{1,2}$ standing for the longitudinal momentum fractions of the valence
quark and antiquark, and $\vec{q}$ denotes the relative transverse momentum.
For $\vec{q}=\vec{0}$ the result satisfies the Gaunt-Sterling sum rules. The
QCD evolution to higher scales is carried out within the dDGLAP framework. We
argue that the ratios of the valence Mellin moments $\langle x_1^n x_2^m
\rangle / \langle x_1^n \rangle \langle x_2^m \rangle $, which do not depend on
the dDGLAP evolution, provide particularly convenient measures of the

applications at the edge of mobile networks. When a user moves erratically
among multiple MEC nodes, the challenge of how to dynamically migrate its
service to maintain service performance (i.e., user-perceived latency) arises.
However, frequent service migration can significantly increase operational
cost, incurring the conflict between improving performance and reducing cost.
To address these mis-aligned objectives, this paper studies the performance
optimization of mobile edge service placement under the constraint of long-term
cost budget. It is challenging because the budget involves the future uncertain
information (e.g., user mobility). To overcome this difficulty, we devote to
leveraging the power of prediction and advocate predictive service placement
with predicted near-future information. By using two-timescale Lyapunov
optimization method, we propose a T-slot predictive service placement (PSP)
algorithm to incorporate the prediction of user mobility based on a frame-based
design. We characterize the performance bounds of PSP in terms of cost-delay
trade-off theoretically. Furthermore, we propose a new weight adjustment scheme
for the queue in each frame named PSP-WU to exploit the historical queue
information, which greatly reduces the length of queue while improving the
quality of user-perceived latency. Rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive
evaluations using realistic data traces demonstrate the superior performance of
the proposed predictive schemes.

recoil data recorded with the XENON1T detector. With an exposure of 0.65 t-y
and an unprecedentedly low background rate of $76\pm2$ events/(t y keV) between
1 and 30 keV, the data enables sensitive searches for solar axions, an enhanced
neutrino magnetic moment, and bosonic dark matter. An excess over known
backgrounds is observed at low energies and most prominent between 2 and 3 keV.
The solar axion model has a 3.4$\sigma$ significance, and a 3D 90% confidence
surface is reported for axion couplings to electrons, photons, and nucleons.
This surface is inscribed in the cuboid defined by $g_{ae}<3.8 \times
10^{-12}$, $g_{ae}g_{an}^{eff}<4.8\times 10^{-18}$, and
$g_{ae}g_{a\gamma}<7.7\times10^{-22} GeV^{-1}$, and excludes either $g_{ae}=0$
or $g_{ae}g_{a\gamma}=g_{ae}g_{an}^{eff}=0$. The neutrino magnetic moment
signal is similarly favored over background at 3.2$\sigma$ and a confidence
interval of $\mu_{\nu} \in (1.4,2.9)\times10^{-11}\mu_B$ (90% C.L.) is
reported. Both results are in strong tension with stellar constraints. The
excess can also be explained by $\beta$ decays of tritium at 3.2$\sigma$ with a
trace amount that can neither be confirmed nor excluded with current knowledge
of its production and reduction mechanisms. The significances of the solar
axion and neutrino magnetic moment hypotheses are reduced to 2.0$\sigma$ and
0.9$\sigma$, respectively, if an unconstrained tritium component is included in
the fitting. With respect to bosonic dark matter, the excess favors a
monoenergetic peak at ($2.3\pm0.2$) keV (68% C.L.) with a 3.0$\sigma$ global
(4.0$\sigma$ local) significance. We also consider the possibility that
$^{37}$Ar may be present in the detector and yield a 2.82 keV peak. Contrary to
tritium, the $^{37}$Ar concentration can be tightly constrained and is found to
be negligible.

match the galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-mass spectrum, using the measured nonlinear
matter spectrum from the simulations to test one-loop effects from the bias
expansion alone. In addition, we investigate the relevance of short-range
nonlocality and halo exclusion through higher-derivative and scale-dependent
noise terms, as well as the impact of using co-evolution relations to reduce
the number of free fitting parameters. From comparing validity and merit of
these assumptions we find that a four-parameter model (linear, quadratic, cubic
nonlocal bias, and constant shot noise) with fixed quadratic tidal bias
provides a robust modeling choice for the auto power spectrum of the less
massive halos in our set of samples and their galaxy populations (up to
$k_{\mathrm{max}} = 0.35\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ for a sample volume of

include scale-dependent noise. This is also the preferred option when
considering combinations of the auto and cross power spectrum, which might be
relevant in joint studies of galaxy clustering and weak lensing. We also test
the use of perturbation theory to account for matter loops through gRPT, EFT

find the latter to be the best in terms of validity and recovered mean

are generated from a Gaussian $N(\mu,\Sigma)$ and observed only if they belong
to a subset $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. We show that ${\mu}$ and ${\Sigma}$ can

from a truncated $\mathcal{N}({\mu},{\Sigma})$ and having access to a
membership oracle for $S$. The set $S$ is assumed to have non-trivial measure
under the unknown distribution but is otherwise arbitrary.
  (ii) For sparse linear regression, suppose samples $({\bf x},y)$ are
generated where $y = {\bf x}^\top{{\Omega}^*} + \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and $({\bf

the support of ${\Omega}^*$. Specifically, we show that under some mild

in both nanoscale magnetic metals and insulators with low damping by the spin

The nanogap SHNOs based on in-plane magnetization Py/Pt exhibits a nonlinear
self-localized bullet soliton localized at the center of the gap between the
electrodes and a secondary high-frequency mode which coexists with the primary
bullet mode at higher currents. While in the nanogap SHNOs with strong
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), besides both nonlinear bullet soliton
and propagating spin-wave mode are achieved and controlled by varying the
external magnetic field and current, the magnetic bubble skyrmion mode also can
be excited at a low in-plane magnetic field. These SW modes show
thermal-induced mode hopping behavior at high temperature due to the coupling
between modes mediated by thermal-magnon-mediated scattering. Moreover, thanks
to PMA-induced effective field, a single coherent mode also can be achieved
without applying an external magnetic field. The strong nonlinear effect of
spin-waves makes SHNOs easy to achieve synchronization with external microwave
signals or mutual synchronization between multiple oscillators with improving
the coherence and power of oscillation modes significantly. Spin-waves in SHNOs
with an external free magnetic layer have a wide range of applications from as

size distribution on molecular abundances in starless and pre-stellar cores. We
introduce grain-size dependence simultaneously for cosmic-ray (CR)-induced
desorption efficiency and for grain equilibrium temperatures. We keep explicit
track of ice abundances on a set of grain populations. We find that the
size-dependent CR desorption efficiency affects ice abundances in a highly
non-trivial way that depends on the molecule. Species that originate in the gas
phase follow a simple pattern where the ice abundance is highest on the
smallest grains (the most abundant in the distribution). Some molecules, such
as HCN, are instead concentrated on large grains throughout the time evolution,
while others (like $\rm N_2$) are initially concentrated on large grains, but
at late times on small grains, due to grain-size-dependent competition between
desorption and hydrogenation. Most of the water ice is on small grains at high
medium density ($n({\rm H_2}) \gtrsim 10^6 \, \rm cm^{-3}$), where the water
ice fraction, with respect to total water ice reservoir, can be as low as $\sim
10^{-3}$ on large (> 0.1 $\mu$m) grains. Allowing the grain equilibrium
temperature to vary with grain size induces strong variations in relative ice
abundances in low-density conditions where the interstellar radiation field and
in particular its ultraviolet component are not attenuated. Our study implies
consequences not only for the initial formation of ices preceding the starless
core stage, but also for the relative ice abundances on the grain populations
going into the protostellar stage. In particular, if the smallest grains can
lose their mantles due to grain-grain collisions as the core is collapsing, the
ice composition in the beginning of the protostellar stage could be very
different to that in the pre-collapse phase.

(LBGs) and Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs). LBGs and LAEs will be detected in
large numbers at high redshift ($z \approx$ 4 to 7) by ongoing and future
surveys. We consider a LBG sample like that expected from the The Rubin
Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), and a selection of LAEs
modelled after the Subaru SILVERRUSH program, but covering a much larger sky
fraction. The tSZ effect is sensitive to a line-of-sight integral of the
ionized gas pressure, and can be measured across large patches of the sky using
multi-frequency CMB surveys. We consider forecast tSZ maps from CMB Stage 4 and
more futuristic observations. Using a suite of hydrodynamical simulations, we
show that the high-redshift galaxies are correlated with the tSZ signal from
reionization, with cross-power amplitude of order $10^{-15}$ at $\ell \sim
1000$. The cross-spectra between LBGs/LAEs with tSZ maps contain information
about the reionization history of the Universe, such as the distribution of
bubble sizes, and could in principle be used to directly measure the timing of
reionization. The amplitude of the signal is small, however, and its
detectability is hindered by low-redshift contributions to tSZ maps and by
instrumental noise. If the the low-redshift contribution to the observed tSZ
signal is suppressed by masking of massive halos, a combination of overlapping
futuristic CMB and galaxy surveys could potentially probe this signal.

produce black holes (BHs) with masses in the range $3-5M_{\odot}$ and above
$\sim 45M_{\odot}$, referred to as the lower mass gap (LMG) and the upper mas
gap (UMG), respectively. However, it is possible to form BHs in these gaps
through merger of compact objects in dense clusters, e.g. the LMG and the UMG
can be populated through binary neutron star- and BBH mergers, respectively.
This implies that if binary mergers are observed in gravitational waves (GWs)
with at least one mass gap object, then either clusters are effective in
assembling binary mergers, or our single-star models have to be revised.
Understanding how effective clusters are at populating both mass gaps have
therefore major implications for both stellar- and GW astrophysics. In this
paper we present a systematic study on how efficient stellar clusters are at
populating both mass gaps through in-cluster GW mergers. For this, we derive a
set of closed form relations for describing the evolution of compact object
binaries undergoing dynamical interactions and GW merger inside their cluster.
By considering both static and time evolving populations, we find in particular
that globular clusters are clearly inefficient at populating the LMG in
contrast to the UMG. We further describe how these results relate to the
characteristic mass, time, and length scales associated with the problem.

Typically, the base hypothesis class is fixed to be all binary decision trees

Due to the high mass and close proximity of its companion, the host star has a
TESS light curve which shows clear ellipsoidal variations. We model the data
with a six-component model: secondary eclipse, phase curve accounting for
reflected light and thermal emission, Doppler beaming, ellipsoidal variations,
stellar activity and the primary transit. We determine the secondary eclipse
depth in the TESS bandpass to be 304 +/- 75 parts-per-million (ppm), the most
accurate eclipse depth determined so far for KELT-1b. We measure the amplitude
of the phase curve to be 128 +/- 27 ppm, with a corresponding eastward offset
between the region of maximum brightness and the substellar point of 19.2 +/-
9.6 degrees, in good agreement with Spitzer measurements. We determine day and
night brightness temperatures of 3201 +/- 147 K and 1484 +/- 110 K,
respectively, slightly higher than those from Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micrometer
data. A one-dimensional self-consistent atmospheric model can explain the TESS
and Spitzer day side brightness temperatures with thermal emission alone and no
reflected light. The night side data can be explained by a model with an
internal temperature of ~1100 K, which may be related to the inflated radius.
The difference between the TESS and Spitzer brightness temperatures can be
explained by stronger molecular opacity in the Spitzer bands. On the night
side, this opacity is due primarily to CH4 and CO while on the day side it is
due to H2-H2 and H2-He collision-induced absorption.

two bosons become unbound, has been intensively investigated in recent years
both experimentally and theoretically. In this particular region, called the
unitary window, details of the inter-particle interactions are not important
and observables, such as binding energies, can be characterized by a few
parameters. With an increasing number of particles the short-range repulsion,
present in all atomic, molecular or nuclear interactions, gradually induces
deviations from the universal behaviour. In the present letter we discuss for
the first time a simple way of incorporating non-universal behaviour through
one specific parameter which controls the smooth transition of the system from
universal to non-universal regime. Using a system of $N$ helium atoms as an
example we calculate their ground state energies as trajectories within the
unitary window and also show that the control parameters can be used to
determine the energy per particle in homogeneous systems when $N \rightarrow
\infty$.

of an abelian group can be decomposed into Hamiltonian cycles. We consider an
analogous question for infinite abelian groups. In this setting one natural
analogue of a Hamiltonian cycle is a spanning double-ray. However, a naive
generalisation of Alspach's conjecture fails to hold in this setting due to the
existence of $2k$-regular Cayley graphs with finite cuts $F$ where $|F|$ and
$k$ differ in parity, which necessarily preclude the existence of a
decomposition into spanning double-rays.
  We show that every $4$-regular Cayley graph of an infinite abelian group all
of whose finite cuts are even can be decomposed into spanning double-rays, and
so characterise when such decompositions exist. We also characterise when such
graphs can be decomposed either into Hamiltonian circles, a more topological
generalisation of a Hamiltonian cycle in infinite graphs, or into a Hamiltonian
circle and a spanning double-ray.

with respect to resource usage and performance. Nonetheless, the joint
optimization of parameters with respect to multiple tasks remains an active
research topic. Sub-partitioning the parameters between different tasks has
proven to be an efficient way to relax the optimization constraints over the
shared weights, may the partitions be disjoint or overlapping. However, one
drawback of this approach is that it can weaken the inductive bias generally
set up by the joint task optimization. In this work, we present a novel way to
partition the parameter space without weakening the inductive bias.
Specifically, we propose Maximum Roaming, a method inspired by dropout that
randomly varies the parameter partitioning, while forcing them to visit as many
tasks as possible at a regulated frequency, so that the network fully adapts to
each update. We study the properties of our method through experiments on a
variety of visual multi-task data sets. Experimental results suggest that the
regularization brought by roaming has more impact on performance than usual
partitioning optimization strategies. The overall method is flexible, easily
applicable, provides superior regularization and consistently achieves improved
performances compared to recent multi-task learning formulations.

Longitudinal VAE (L-VAE), that uses a multi-output additive Gaussian process

instability in a bluff-body stabilized premixed turbulent combustor. When the
equivalence ratio is varied, there is a transition from combustion noise to
thermoacoustic instability via intermittency in the combustor. We perform
simultaneous acoustic pressure, 2D-PIV, and CH$^*$ chemiluminescence
measurements to capture the pressure fluctuations, the velocity field, and the
heat release rate (HRR) field during the transition. We measure the spatial
distribution of the amplitude of turbulent velocity at the acoustic frequency,
time-averaged vorticity, time-averaged HRR, and Rayleigh index and identify
various regions of significance. We implement a passive control strategy by
targeting these regions with a steady injection of secondary micro-jet of air
to optimize the injection location and determine the critical region. Targeting
the critical region with secondary air leads to greater than 20 dB suppression
of the dominant thermoacoustic mode. We observe that the coherent structure
forming from the shear layer following the dump plane gets suppressed, leading
to an incoherent spatial distribution of HRR fluctuations. We find that the
turbulent velocity amplitude correctly identifies the critical region for
optimized passive control during thermoacoustic instability. In contrast, the
Rayleigh index identifies the region of the most significant acoustic driving;
however, it does not identify the region most sensitive to control. Finally, we
extend our analysis by determining the spatial distribution of the Hurst
exponent measured from the turbulent velocity field. We show that the Hurst
exponent identifies the critical region during thermoacoustic instability and
intermittency, unlike the other physical measures.

perpendicular pressures). It is a natural conjecture that the perpendicular
pressure decreases Tc because it increases the interlayer electron hopping
energy t_z, which weakens the logarithmic enhancement in the density of states
due to the two-dimensional Van Hove singularity. It is shown that, contrary to
this conjecture, the perpendicular pressure can significantly enhance Tc in
systems off half-filling before it decreases Tc, and the strength of the
enhancement significantly depends on the pairing symmetry. When the indices d,
d', cz, and sz are defined for the basis functions cos k_x - cos k_y, sin k_x
sin k_y, cos k_z, and sin k_z, respectively, it is shown that for s-, d-, cz-,
and cz-d-wave pairing, Tc steeply increases with increasing t_z near a cusp at
a certain value of t_z. On the other hand, for p-, cz-p-, sz-p-, and d'-wave
pairing, Tc is almost unaffected by tz. For sz- and sz-d-wave pairing, Tc
exhibits a broad and weak peak. The enhancement in Tc is the largest for this
state and the second largest for the d-wave pairing and interlayer singlet
(cz-wave) pairing. These results may explain recent observations in Sr2RuO4

experimental results indicates that the p-, cz-p-, and sz-p-wave states,
including chiral states, and the d'-wave state are the most likely candidates
for the intrinsic 1.5-K phase, and the d-, cz-d-, and cz-wave states are the

self-supervised twins together, while constraining the manifold with

eruptive stars EXors. In this paper we analyze new adaptive optics imaging and
spectroscopic observations of EX Lup and its circumstellar environment in
near-infrared in its quiescent phase. We observed EX Lup with the high contrast
imager SPHERE/IRDIS in the dual-beam polarimetric imaging mode to resolve the
circumstellar environment in near-infrared scattered light. We complemented
these data with earlier SINFONI spectroscopy. We resolve for the first time in
scattered light a compact feature around EX Lup azimuthally extending from
280deg to 360deg, and radially extending from 0.3arcsec to 0.55arcsec in the
plane of the disk. We explore two different scenarios for the detected
emission. One accounting for the emission as coming from the brightened walls
of the cavity excavated by the outflow whose presence was suggested by ALMA
observations in the J=3-2 line of 12CO. The other accounts for the emission as
coming from an inclined disk. We detect for the first time a more extended
circumstellar disk in scattered light, which shows that a region between 10 and
30 au is depleted of mum-size grains. We compare the J-, H- and K-band spectra
obtained with SINFONI in quiescence with the spectra taken during the outburst,
showing that all the emission lines were due to the episodic accretion event.
Conclusions. Based on the morphology analysis we favour the scenario in which
the scattered light is coming from a circumstellar disk rather than the outflow
around EX Lup. We analyze the origin of the observed feature either as coming
from a continuous circumstellar disk with a cavity, or from the illuminated
wall of the outer disk or from a shadowed disk. Moreover, we discuss what is
the origin of the mum-size grains depleted region, exploring the possibility
that a sub-stellar companion may be the cause of it.

no intrinsic order. Instead, categorical data have complex and latent relations
that must be inferred, like the synonymy between words. In this paper, we
investigate \emph{Categorical Normalizing Flows}, that is normalizing flows for
categorical data. By casting the encoding of categorical data in continuous
space as a variational inference problem, we jointly optimize the continuous
representation and the model likelihood. Using a factorized decoder, we
introduce an inductive bias to model any interactions in the normalizing flow.
As a consequence, we do not only simplify the optimization compared to having a
joint decoder, but also make it possible to scale up to a large number of
categories that is currently impossible with discrete normalizing flows. Based
on Categorical Normalizing Flows, we propose GraphCNF a permutation-invariant
generative model on graphs. GraphCNF implements a three step approach modeling
the nodes, edges and adjacency matrix stepwise to increase efficiency. On

integrability encoded in the dependence of the diffusion constant on the

the five major Uranus satellites Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel and Miranda,
based on observations with the photometer PACS-P aboard the Herschel Space
Observatory.
  Methods. The bright image of Uranus is subtracted using a scaled Uranus point
spread function (PSF) reference established from all maps of each wavelength in
an iterative process removing the superimposed moons. Photometry of the
satellites is performed by PSF photometry. Thermophysical models of the icy
moons are fitted to the photometry of each measurement epoch and auxilliary
data at shorter wavelengths.
  Results. The best fitting thermophysical models provide constraints for
important thermal properties of the moons like surface roughness and thermal
inertia. We present the first thermal infrared radiometry longward of 50$\mu$m
of the four largest Uranian moons, Titania, Oberon, Umbriel and Ariel, at
epochs with equator-on illumination. Due to this inclination geometry there was
heat transport to the night side so that thermal inertia played a role,
allowing us to constrain that parameter. Also some indication for differences
in the thermal properties of leading and trailing hemispheres is found. We
specify precisely the systematic error of the Uranus flux by its moons, when
using Uranus as a far-infrared prime flux calibrator.
  Conclusions. We have successfully demonstrated an image processing technique
for PACS photometer data allowing to remove a bright central source. We have
established improved thermophysical models of the five major Uranus satellites.
Derived thermal inertia values resemble more those of TNO dwarf planets Pluto
and Haumea than those of smaller TNOs and Centaurs.

(KRR) for a kernel $K$ with ridge $\lambda>0$ and i.i.d. observations. For
this, we introduce two objects: the Signal Capture Threshold (SCT) and the
Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE). The SCT $\vartheta_{K,\lambda}$ is a
function of the data distribution: it can be used to identify the components of
the data that the KRR predictor captures, and to approximate the (expected) KRR
risk. This then leads to a KRR risk approximation by the KARE $\rho_{K,
\lambda}$, an explicit function of the training data, agnostic of the true data
distribution. We phrase the regression problem in a functional setting. The key
results then follow from a finite-size analysis of the Stieltjes transform of
general Wishart random matrices. Under a natural universality assumption (that
the KRR moments depend asymptotically on the first two moments of the
observations) we capture the mean and variance of the KRR predictor. We
numerically investigate our findings on the Higgs and MNIST datasets for
various classical kernels: the KARE gives an excellent approximation of the
risk, thus supporting our universality assumption. Using the KARE, one can
compare choices of Kernels and hyperparameters directly from the training set.
The KARE thus provides a promising data-dependent procedure to select Kernels
that generalize well.

The $Q$-matrix of a stochastic reaction network can be derived from the
reaction graph, an edge-labelled directed graph encoding the jump vectors of an
associated continuous time Markov chain on the invariant space
$\mathbb{N}^d_0$. An open question is how to decompose the space
$\mathbb{N}^d_0$ into neutral, trapping, and escaping states, and open and
closed communicating classes, and whether this can be done from the reaction
graph alone. Such general continuous time Markov chains can be understood as
natural generalizations of birth-death processes, incorporating multiple
different birth and death mechanisms. We characterize the structure of
$\mathbb{N}^d_0$ imposed by a general $Q$-matrix generating continuous time
Markov chains with values in $\mathbb{N}^d_0$, in terms of the set of jump
vectors and their corresponding transition rate functions. Thus the setting is
not limited to stochastic reaction networks. Furthermore, we define structural
equivalence of two $Q$-matrices, and provide sufficient conditions for
structural equivalence. Examples are abundant in applications. We apply the
results to stochastic reaction networks, a Lotka-Volterra model in ecology, the
EnvZ-OmpR system in systems biology, and a class of extended branching

can contribute to the cosmic ray spectrum. We combine two different
computational methods, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and particle-in-cell (PIC)
into a single code that allows us to take advantage of the high computational
efficiency of MHD while maintaining the ability to model the behaviour of
individual non-thermal particles. Using this method, we perform a series of
simulations covering the expected parameter space of galaxy cluster collision
shocks. Our results show that for shocks with a sonic Mach number below 2.25 no
diffusive shock acceleration can take place because of a lack of instabilities
in the magnetic field, whereas for shocks with a sonic Mach number $\geq\,3$
the acceleration is efficient and can accelerate particles to relativistic
speeds. In the regime between these two extremes, diffusive shock acceleration
can occur but is relatively inefficient because of the time- and
space-dependent nature of the instabilities. For those shocks that show
efficient acceleration, the instabilities in the upstream gas increase to the
point where they change the nature of the shock, which, in turn, will influence
the particle injection process.

an important role in the evolution of protoplanetary discs. Photoevaporative
winds have been unambiguously detected through blue-shifted emission lines, but
their detailed properties remain uncertain. Here we present a new empirical
approach to make observational predictions of these thermal winds, seeking to
fill the gap between theory and observations. We use a self-similar model of an
isothermal wind to compute line profiles of several characteristic emission
lines (the [Ne${\rm{\scriptsize II}}$] line at 12.81 $\mu$m, and optical
forbidden lines such as [O${\rm{\scriptsize I}}$] 6300 $\mathring{A}$ and
[S${\rm{\scriptsize II}}$] 4068/4076 $\mathring{A}$), studying how the lines
are affected by parameters such as the gas temperature, disc inclinations, and
density profile. Our model successfully reproduces blue-shifted lines with
$v_{\rm peak} \lesssim 10$ km/s, which decrease with increasing disc
inclination. The line widths increase with increasing disc inclinations and
range from $\Delta v \sim 15-30$ km/s. The predicted blue-shifts are mostly
sensitive to the gas sound speed. The observed [Ne${\rm{\scriptsize II}}$] line
profiles are consistent with a thermal wind and point towards a relatively high
sound speed, as expected for EUV photoevaporation. However, the observed
[O${\rm{\scriptsize I}}$] line profiles require lower temperatures, as expected
in X-ray photoevaporation, and show a wider scatter that is difficult to
reconcile with a single wind model; it seems likely that these lines trace
different components of a multi-phase wind. We also note that the spectral
resolution of current observations remains an important limiting factor in
these studies, and that higher resolution spectra are required if emission
lines are to further our understanding of protoplanetary disc winds.

have shown promising results, a clear mechanism of lithium ion transport in
DESs is not yet established. This work reports the study on the solvation and
transport of lithium in a DES made from lithium perchlorate and acetamide using
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation and neutron scattering techniques. Based on
hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) of acetamide with neighbouring molecules/ions, two
states are largely prevalent: 1) acetamide molecules which are H-bonded to
lithium ions (~ 36 %) and 2) acetamide molecules that are entirely free (~
58%). Analysing their stochastic dynamics independently, it is observed that
the long-range diffusion of the former is significantly slower than the latter
one. This is also validated from the neutron scattering experiment on the same
DES system. Further, the analysis the lithium dynamics shows that the diffusion
of acetamide molecules in the first category is strongly coupled to that of
lithium ions. On an average the lithium ions are H-bonded to ~ 3.2 acetamide
molecules in their first solvation. These observations are further bolstered
through the analysis of the H-bond correlation function between acetamide and
lithium ions, which show that ~ 90% of lithium ionic transport is achieved by
vehicular motion where the ions diffuse along with its first solvation shell.
The findings of this work are an important advancement in understanding
solvation and transport of lithium ion in DES.

can also be excited with an alternating current well below the resonance

of the linear relationship between the wire-oscillation amplitude, integrated
field, and current amplitude. This technique is a good example for solving
partial differential equations, or more precisely, boundary value problems in
one and two dimensions. In particular, the field in the aperture of accelerator
magnets is governed by the Laplace equation, which leads to a boundary-value

involved players are of second-order integrator-type dynamics is investigated
in this paper. Noticing that velocity signals are usually noisy or not
available for feedback control in practical engineering systems, this paper
supposes that the velocity signals are not accessible for the players. To deal
with the absence of velocity measurements, two estimators are designed, based
on which Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are constructed. The first
strategy is established by employing an observer, which has the same order as
the players' dynamics, to estimate the unavailable system states (e.g., the
players' velocities). The second strategy is designed based on a high-pass
filter and is motivated by the incentive to reduce the order of the closed-loop
system which in turn reduces the computation costs of the seeking algorithm.
Extensions to Nash equilibrium seeking for networked games are provided. Taking
the advantages of leader-following consensus protocols, it turns out that both
the observer-based method and the filter-based method can be adapted to deal
with games in distributed systems, which shows the extensibility of the
developed strategies. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is analytically
proven that the players' actions can be regulated to the Nash equilibrium point
and their velocities can be regulated to zero by utilizing the proposed
velocity-free Nash equilibrium seeking strategies. A numerical example is
provided for the verifications of the proposed algorithms.

result, these systems have the tendency to constantly change according to the
second law of thermodynamics and the unstable modes represent the directions of
growth of the entropy in state space. We, then, verify that the conditions of

the first-order theories is a direct consequence of the truncation of the

typically regarded as an instantaneous material response with respect to the
optical field. However, in addition to an instantaneous part, the nonlinear
fiber response consists of a delayed contribution, referred to as the Raman
response. The imaginary part of its Fourier transform, referred to as the Raman
gain spectrum, leads to inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS). ISRS
is a nonlinear effect that redistributes optical power from high to lower
frequencies during propagation. However, as the nonlinear fiber response is
causal, the Raman spectrum obeys the Kramers-Kronig relations resulting in the
real part of the complex valued Raman spectrum. While the impact of the
imaginary part (i.e. ISRS) is well studied, the direct implications of its
associated real part on the NLI are unexplored.
  In this work, a theory is proposed to analytically quantify the impact of the
real Raman spectrum on the nonlinear interference power. Starting from a
generalized Manakov equation, an extension of the ISRS Gaussian Noise (GN)
model is derived to include the real Raman spectrum and, thus, to account for
the complete nonlinear Raman response. Accurate integral expressions are
derived and approximations in closed-form are proposed. Different formulations
for the case of single -and dual polarized signals are derived and novel
analytical approximations of the real Raman spectrum are proposed. Moreover, it
is analytically shown that the real Raman spectrum scales the strength of the
instantaneous nonlinear distortions depending on the frequency separation of
the interacting frequencies. A simple functional form is derived to assess the
scaling of the NLI strength. The proposed theory is validated by numerical
simulations over C-and C+L band, using experimentally measured fiber data.

between Schramm-Loewner evolutions (SLE) and conformal field theories with
extended conformal algebras (ECFT). By using Monte-Carlo simulation, we compute
the fractal dimension of different spin interfaces for the N=3 and N=4 spin
models that correspond respectively to the 3 states Potts model and to the
Ashkin-Teller model at the Fateev-Zamolodchikov point. These numerical
measures, that improve and complete the ones presented in the previous works,
are shown to be consistent with SLE/ECFT predictions. We consider then the
crossing probability of spin clusters in a rectangular domain. Using a multiple
SLE approach, we provide crossing probability formulas for ZN parafarmionic
theories. The parafermionic conformal blocks that enter the crossing
probability formula are computed by solving a Knhiznik-Zamolodchikov system of
rank 3. In the 3 states Potts model case, where the parafermionic blocks
coincide with the Virasoro ones, we rederive the crossing formula found by
S.M.Flores et al., that is in good agreement with our measures. For N>=4 where
the crossing probability satisfies a third order differential equation instead
of a second order one, our formulas are new. The theoretical predictions are
compared to Monte-Carlo measures taken at N=4 and a fair agreement is found.

dramatically in the recent years, it remains an ingrained problem due to
cluttered backgrounds and varying scales of people within an image. In this
paper, we propose a Shallow feature based Dense Attention Network (SDANet) for
crowd counting from still images, which diminishes the impact of backgrounds
via involving a shallow feature based attention model, and meanwhile, captures
multi-scale information via densely connecting hierarchical image features.
Specifically, inspired by the observation that backgrounds and human crowds
generally have noticeably different responses in shallow features, we decide to
build our attention model upon shallow-feature maps, which results in accurate
background-pixel detection. Moreover, considering that the most representative
features of people across different scales can appear in different layers of a
feature extraction network, to better keep them all, we propose to densely
connect hierarchical image features of different layers and subsequently encode
them for estimating crowd density. Experimental results on three benchmark
datasets clearly demonstrate the superiority of SDANet when dealing with
different scenarios. Particularly, on the challenging UCF CC 50 dataset, our
method outperforms other existing methods by a large margin, as is evident from
a remarkable 11.9% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) drop of our SDANet.

only proxies to absolute distances in the form of similarities are available.
Hence we ask the following: Given only \emph{comparisons} of similarities
amongst a set of entities, what can be said about the geometry of the
underlying space form? To study this question, we introduce the notions of the
\textit{ordinal capacity} of a target space form and \emph{ordinal spread} of
the similarity measurements. The latter is an indicator of complex patterns in
the measurements, while the former quantifies the capacity of a space form to
accommodate a set of measurements with a specific ordinal spread profile. We
prove that the ordinal capacity of a space form is related to its dimension and
the sign of its curvature. This leads to a lower bound on the Euclidean and
spherical embedding dimension of what we term similarity graphs. More
importantly, we show that the statistical behavior of the ordinal spread random
variables defined on a similarity graph can be used to identify its underlying
space form. We support our theoretical claims with experiments on weighted

Exploiting the sparse nature of the beamformer output, a second compression is
applied to the filtered data. Target detection is subsequently conducted by
formulating and solving a hypothesis testing problem at each grid point of the
discretized angle space. The proposed approach enables an 8-fold reduction of
the sample complexity in some settings as compared to a conventional compressed

undertaken, culminating in proposals such as probabilistic relational models.
While this progress has been notable, a general-purpose first-order knowledge

in continuous settings, is still to emerge. In this paper, we survey recent
results pertaining to the integration of logic, probability and actions in the

candidates, paying attention to three leading regular black hole models with
additional parameters $g$ related to nonlinear electrodynamics charge. Our

to extract clear global transformation, which effectively suppresses
uncertainty of local descriptors in high-dimensional space, resulting in a more

identifications for which the overall maximum number of red edges incident to a
single vertex is at most $d$, where a red edge appears between two sets of
identified vertices if they are not homogeneous in $G$. We show that if a graph
admits a $d$-contraction sequence, then it also has a linear-arity tree of
$f(d)$-contractions, for some function $f$. First this permits to show that
every bounded twin-width class is small, i.e., has at most $n!c^n$ graphs
labeled by $[n]$, for some constant $c$. This unifies and extends the same
result for bounded treewidth graphs [Beineke and Pippert, JCT '69], proper
subclasses of permutations graphs [Marcus and Tardos, JCTA '04], and proper
minor-free classes [Norine et al., JCTB '06]. The second consequence is an
$O(\log n)$-adjacency labeling scheme for bounded twin-width graphs, confirming
several cases of the implicit graph conjecture. We then explore the ""small
conjecture"" that, conversely, every small hereditary class has bounded
twin-width. Inspired by sorting networks of logarithmic depth, we show that
$\log_{\Theta(\log \log d)}n$-subdivisions of $K_n$ (a small class when $d$ is
constant) have twin-width at most $d$. We obtain a rather sharp converse with a
surprisingly direct proof: the $\log_{d+1}n$-subdivision of $K_n$ has
twin-width at least $d$. Secondly graphs with bounded stack or queue number
(also small classes) have bounded twin-width. Thirdly we show that cubic
expanders obtained by iterated random 2-lifts from $K_4$~[Bilu and Linial,

connection between the small conjecture and group theory. Finally we define a

shown promise in identifying target tumor mutational status on routine imaging

deep-learning/radiomics (context-based), using image features from the entire
tumor to identify the gene mutation status, or (2) atlas (spatial)-based to
obtain likelihood of gene mutation status based on population statistics. While
many genes (i.e. EGFR, MGMT) are spatially variant, a significant challenge in
reliable assessment of gene mutation status on imaging has been the lack of
available co-localized ground truth for training the models. We present
Spatial-And-Context aware (SpACe) ""virtual biopsy"" maps that incorporate
context-features from co-localized biopsy site along with spatial-priors from
population atlases, within a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator
(LASSO) regression model, to obtain a per-voxel probability of the presence of
a mutation status (M+ vs M-). We then use probabilistic pair-wise Markov model
to improve the voxel-wise prediction probability. We evaluate the efficacy of
SpACe maps on MRI scans with co-localized ground truth obtained from
corresponding biopsy, to predict the mutation status of 2 driver genes in
Glioblastoma: (1) EGFR (n=91), and (2) MGMT (n=81). When compared against
deep-learning (DL) and radiomic models, SpACe maps obtained training and
testing accuracies of 90% (n=71) and 90.48% (n=21) in identifying EGFR
amplification status,compared to 80% and 71.4% via radiomics, and 74.28% and

88.3% (n=61) and 71.5% (n=20), compared to 52.4% and 66.7% using radiomics,and

enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different

directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction
mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the
representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small
batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous
contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not
require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also
propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views
with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without
increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by
achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as
surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.

  However, simply being rule-based does not ensure interpretability. For
example, overlapped rules spawn ambiguity and hinder interpretation. Here we

we investigate several natural options for a small candidate set of

an efficient randomized algorithm, which samples rules that are highly
discriminative and have small overlap. The proposed sampling algorithm
analytically targets a distribution of rules that is tailored to our objective.

is quadratic and convex or concave and the constraints set is the reachable
value set of a convergent discrete-time affine system. Moreover, we assume that
the matrix defining the system is diagonalizable. The difficulty of the problem
lies in the infinite sequence to handle in the constraint set. Equivalently,
the problem requires to solve an infinite number of quadratic programs.
Therefore, the main idea is to extract a finite of them and to guarantee that
the resolution of the extracted problems provides the optimal value and a
maximizer for the initial problem. The number of quadratic programs to solve
has to be the smallest possible. Actually, we construct a family of integers
that over-approximate the exact number of quadratic programs to solve using
basic ideas of linear algebra. This family of integers is used in the final
algorithm. A new computation of an integer of the family within the algorithm
ensures a reduction of the number of loop iterations. The method proposed in
the paper is illustrated on small academic examples. Finally, the algorithm is
experimented on randomly generated instances of the problem.

characterise the groups according to intrinsic properties such as richness and
halo mass, as well as their position in the supercluster and proximity to the
two rich clusters, Abell 1656 (Coma) and Abell 1367. We devise a new way of
characterising the local environment using a kernel density estimator. We find
that apart from the dominant effects of the galaxy mass, the effect of the
environment on galaxies is a complex combination of the overdensities on
various scales, which is characterised in terms of membership of groups, and
also of the position of the galaxy on filaments and their proximity to the
infall regions of clusters. Whether the gas can be turned into stars depends
upon the level of pre-processing, which plays a role in how star formation is
enhanced in a given environment. Our results are consistent with gas accreted
in the cold mode from the filaments, being made available to enhance star
formation. Finally, we show that the Abell~1367 end of the supercluster is in
the process of assembly at present, leading to heightened star formation

overcome these challenges by relaxing assumptions about the form of the IRFs,
but standard tools are unable to simultaneously estimate flexible IRFs and
recover ability estimates for respondents. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric

elliptic curl-curl variational inequality (VI) of the second kind with an
L1-type nonlinearity. In particular, the non-smooth VI character and the
involved H(curl)-structure make the corresponding shape sensitivity analysis
challenging. To tackle the non-smoothness, a penalized dual VI formulation is
proposed, leading to the G{\^a}teaux differentiability of the corresponding

Conventionally, two general approaches exist to solve discrete problems: $(i)$
relaxation into the continuous domain to obtain an approximate solution, or
$(ii)$ development of a tailored algorithm that applies directly in the
discrete domain. In both approaches, worst-case performance guarantees are
often hard to establish. Furthermore, they are often complex, thus not
practical for large-scale problems. In this paper, we show how certain
scenarios lend themselves to exploiting submodularity so as to construct
scalable solutions with provable worst-case performance guarantees. We

can be represented by 1-dimensional column vectors. By extending the
representation of events to two dimensional matrices, we can introduce
""superposition events."" Probabilities are introduced for classical events,
superposition events, and their mixtures by using density matrices. Then
probabilities for experiments or `measurements' of all these events can be
determined in a manner exactly like in quantum mechanics (QM) using density
matrices. Moreover the transformation of the density matrices induced by the
experiments or `measurements' is the Luders mixture operation as in QM. And
finally by moving the machinery into the n-dimensional vector space over Z_2,
different basis sets become different outcome sets. That `non-commutative'
extension of finite probability theory yields the pedagogical model of quantum
mechanics over Z_2 that can model many characteristic non-classical results of
QM.

outflows, as the dust mantles composition is sputtered into the gas phase. The
chemical richness in these environments has been so far studied only in the
L1157 blue shifted outflow. Methods: To understand if the L1157-B1 case is
unique, we imaged the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A outflows using the NOEMA (NOrthern
Extended Millimeter Array) interferometer as part of the IRAM SOLIS (Seeds Of
Life in Space) Large Program and compared the observations with the GRAINOBLE+
gas phase astrochemical model. Results: Several iCOMs were detected in the IRAS
4A outflows: methanol (CH$_3$OH), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), formamide
(NH$_2$CHO) and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), all sampling upper excitation
energy up to $\sim$30 K. We found a significant chemical differentiation
between the IRAS 4A1 outflow, showing a richer molecular content, and the IRAS
4A2 one. The CH$_3$OH/CH$_3$CHO abundance ratio is lower by a factor $\sim$4 in
the former; furthermore the ratio in both outflows is lower by a factor
$\sim$10 with respect to hot corinos values. Conclusions: After L1157-B1, IRAS
4A outflow is now the second outflow to show an evident chemical complexity.
Given that CH$_3$OH is a grain surface species, GRAINOBLE+ reproduced our
observations assuming acetaldehyde formation in gas phase by the reaction of
ethyl radical (CH$_3$CH$_2$) with atomic oxygen. Moreover, the chemical
differentiation between the two outflows suggests that the IRAS 4A1 outflow is
likely younger than the IRAS 4A2 one. Further investigation is needed to
constrain the age of the outflow and observations of even younger shocks are
necessary and future spectroscopic studies on CH$_3$CH$_2$ are needed to be
able to observe this species and provide strong constraints on the CH$_3$CHO
formation.

the last few years, separable expansions have been used to represent the
optical potential between a nucleon (proton or neutron) and a target. Purpose:
We explore the non-local properties of these separable optical potentials as
well as their convergence behavior. Method: For a couple of cases, we use the
generalized Ersnt-Shakin-Thaler scheme to generate separable interactions
starting from local optical potentials. We study the variation of the
interaction with energy range and rank. Results: We find that, overall the
off-diagonal behavior of the converged separable interaction deviates from the
Gaussian form assumed by Perey and Buck. However, in the region surrounding the
maximum depth the Gaussian form works quite well. Focusing on this region, we
study potentials describing neutron elastic scattering on $^{16}$O and
$^{48}$Ca for beam energies in the range of $ E=$10-50 MeV and explore several
measures of non-locality of the separable interactions. Conclusions: When the
energy range considered for generating the separable interaction is $0\le
E_{range}\le 50$ MeV, the resulting non-locality is large and target dependent.
Contrarily, the nonlocality obtained including larger energy ranges in the
separable procedure is independent of the target and other details of the
original local potential. We find that, even when including in the expansion
many support points with energy ranges $0\le E_{range}\le 2400$ MeV, the
resulting potential retains non-local behavior. Connections with microscopic
optical potentials as well as other transformations used in the nucleon-nucleon
domain are made.

activities shared across individuals may lessen individual discrimination. By
reducing contributions from shared activities, inter-subject variability can be
enhanced. Results show that that refined connectomes utilizing an autoencoder
with sparse dictionary learning can successfully distinguish one individual
from the remaining participants with reasonably high accuracy (up to 99:5% for
the rest-rest pair). Furthermore, high-level cognitive behavior (e.g., fluid

better predicted using refined functional connectivity profiles. As expected,
the high-order association cortices contributed more to both individual

summarization is an effective graph-compression technique with many desirable
properties. It aims to compactly represent the input graph as (a) a summary
graph consisting of supernodes (i.e., sets of nodes) and superedges (i.e.,
edges between supernodes), which provide a rough description, and (b) edge
corrections which fix errors induced by the rough description. While a number
of batch algorithms, suited for static graphs, have been developed for rapid
and compact graph summarization, they are highly inefficient in terms of time
and space for dynamic graphs, which are common in practice. In this work, we
propose MoSSo, the first incremental algorithm for lossless summarization of
fully dynamic graphs. In response to each change in the input graph, MoSSo
updates the output representation by repeatedly moving nodes among supernodes.
MoSSo decides nodes to be moved and their destinations carefully but rapidly
based on several novel ideas. Through extensive experiments on 10 real graphs,
we show MoSSo is (a) Fast and 'any time': processing each change in
near-constant time (less than 0.1 millisecond), up to 7 orders of magnitude
faster than running state-of-the-art batch methods, (b) Scalable: summarizing

which the two layers are separated by a perfectly opaque tunnel barrier.
Combining an electrostatic and thermodynamic analysis with mean-field theory
estimates of interacting system chemical potentials, we explain the dependence
of the electron and hole densities on the two gate voltages. Because chemical
potential jumps occur for both electrons and holes at neutrality, there is a
finite area in gate voltage parameter space over which electron and hole
densities are equal. In that regime the electron-hole pair density depends only
on the sum of the two gate voltages. We are able to explain a recent
experimental study of electrically controlled bilayers by allowing for
interlayer tunneling and using a non-equilibrium steady-state transport

during the 2016 US presidential election, spreading millions of tweets with
misinformation and inflammatory political content. Whether these social media
campaigns of the so-called ""troll"" accounts were able to manipulate public
opinion is still in question. Here, we quantify the influence of troll accounts
on Twitter by analyzing 152.5 million tweets (by 9.9 million users) from that

such by Twitter itself. We construct and analyse a very large interaction graph
of 9.3 million nodes and 169.9 million edges using graph analysis techniques,
along with a game-theoretic centrality measure. Then, we quantify the influence
of all Twitter accounts on the overall information exchange as is defined by
the retweet cascades. We provide a global influence ranking of all Twitter
accounts and we find that one troll account appears in the top-100 and four in
the top-1000. This combined with other findings presented in this paper
constitute evidence that the driving force of virality and influence in the
network came from regular users - users who have not been classified as trolls
by Twitter. On the other hand, we find that on average, troll accounts were
tens of times more influential than regular users were. Moreover, 23% and 22%
of regular accounts in the top-100 and top-1000 respectively, have now been
suspended by Twitter. This raises questions about their authenticity and
practices during the 2016 US presidential election.

complex gaming and robotic environments. Often these results are achieved at
the expense of huge computational costs and require an incredible number of
episodes of interaction between the agent and the environment. There are two
main approaches to improving the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning
methods - using hierarchical methods and expert demonstrations. In this paper,
we propose a combination of these approaches that allow the agent to use
low-quality demonstrations in complex vision-based environments with multiple
related goals. Our forgetful experience replay (ForgER) algorithm effectively
handles errors in expert data and reduces quality losses when adapting the
action space and states representation to the agent's capabilities. Our
proposed goal-oriented structuring of replay buffer allows the agent to
automatically highlight sub-goals for solving complex hierarchical tasks in
demonstrations. Our method is universal and can be integrated into various
off-policy methods. It surpasses all known existing state-of-the-art RL methods
using expert demonstrations on various model environments. The solution based
on our algorithm beats all the solutions for the famous MineRL competition and
allows the agent to mine a diamond in the Minecraft environment.

transport in premixed swirl combustion at Karlovitz numbers between 20-50. Such
flames posses a large-scale pressure field that -- in addition to the pressure
fields associated with small-scale turbulent vortices -- can interact with
density gradients to produce baroclinic torque. Simultaneous tomographic
particle image velocimetry and formaldehyde planar laser induced fluorescence
measurements are used to obtain high-resolution velocity and progress-variable
fields. This allows statistical evaluation of the various terms in the
enstrophy transport equation. The impact of small- and large-scale pressure
gradients is assessed by conditioning the baroclinic torque on the position of
the fluid within the instantaneous flame front, within the flame brush, and
axially within the combustor. At all conditions studied, the baroclinic torque
was a significant contributor to enstrophy transport, with a comparable
magnitude to vortex stretching and viscous diffusion. Enstrophy attenuation and
production by baroclinic torque tended to occur towards the reactant and
product sides of the instantaneous flame surface, respectively. However, the
value of the baroclinic torque also depended equally strongly on the position
in the combustor. Hence, both small- and large-scale pressure fields can result
in significant enstrophy changes through baroclinic torque. This is evidence
both that flame-induced vorticity dynamics are significant in swirl combustion,
and that large-scale geometry-dependent flow fields can impact flame-generated
turbulence.

environment might be much harsher than that of the Sun. Thus, the exoplanets
are most likely exposed to an enhanced stellar radiation environment, which
could affect their habitability, for example, in the form of a hazardous flux
of energetic particles. Knowing the stellar radiation field, and being able to

this conjecture, we perform transport calculations of the $X(3872)$ through the
fireball formed in nuclear collisions at the LHC. Within a kinetic-rate
equation approach as previously used for charmonia, the formation and
dissociation of the $X(3872)$ is controlled by two transport parameters, i.e.,
its inelastic reaction rate and thermal-equilibrium limit in the evolving hot
QCD medium. While the equilibrium limit is controlled by the charm production
cross section in primordial nucleon-nucleon collisions (together with the
spectra of charm states in the medium), the structure information is encoded in
the reaction rate. We study how different scenarios for the rate affect the
centrality dependence and transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra of the $X(3872)$.
Larger reaction rates associated with the loosely bound molecule structure
imply that it is formed later in the fireball evolution than the tetraquark and
thus its final yields are generally smaller by around a factor of two, which is
qualitatively different from most coalescence model calculations to date. The
$p_T$ spectra provide further information as the later decoupling time within
the molecular scenario leads to harder spectra caused by the blue-shift from
the expanding fireball.

rate was characterized by 10 kHz chemiluminescence (CL) imaging of several
species. Stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and laser Mie scattering from
the fuel droplets were used to measure the gas velocity and spray dynamics,
respectively, at 5 kHz. The pressure fluctuations were dominated by
oscillations at a frequency $f_0$, whereas the spray, CL and velocity
oscillated at approximately $2f_0$. All of these oscillations were
nonstationary, exhibiting changes in frequency and amplitude. Comparing the
time evolution of the dominant frequencies and amplitudes indicates a behavior
consistent with mutually coupled self-oscillators; the observed dynamics of the
1:2 super-harmonic coupling is consistent synchronization via oscillation
death. Furthermore, increases in the frequency of the ca. $f_0$ velocity
oscillations away from the harmonic ratio (increased frequency detuning) were
correlated with decreases in the power of the $f_0$ pressure oscillations. The
corresponding nonreacting flow had a natural hydrodynamic mode at a frequency
slightly greater than $2f_0$. Hence, the data are consistent with the $f_0$
acoustic mode ""pulling"" the hydrodynamic frequency towards the super-harmonic

model with a high level of fidelity by addressing the problems of
non-linearity, uncertainties, and coupling. These uncertainties and measurement
noises cause instability in flight and automatic hovering. The proposed
controller associated with a heuristic Genetic Filter (GF) addresses these

present in several aspects of human life, especially, those dealing with
decision making. Many of these algorithmic decisions are taken without human
supervision and through decision making processes that are not transparent.
This raises concerns regarding the potential bias of these processes towards
certain groups of society, which may entail unfair results and, possibly,
violations of human rights. Dealing with such biased models is one of the major
concerns to maintain the public trust.
  In this paper, we address the question of process or procedural fairness.
More precisely, we consider the problem of making classifiers fairer by
reducing their dependence on sensitive features while increasing (or, at least,
maintaining) their accuracy. To achieve both, we draw inspiration from
""dropout"" techniques in neural based approaches, and propose a framework that
relies on ""feature drop-out"" to tackle process fairness. We make use of ""LIME
Explanations"" to assess a classifier's fairness and to determine the sensitive
features to remove. This produces a pool of classifiers (through feature
dropout) whose ensemble is shown empirically to be less dependent on sensitive
features, and with improved or no impact on accuracy.

generate view-consistent, high-fidelity, and high-resolution X-ray images from
radiology reports to facilitate radiology training of medical students. This
task is presented with several challenges. First, from a single report, images
with different views (e.g., frontal, lateral) need to be generated. How to
ensure consistency of these images (i.e., make sure they are about the same
patient)? Second, X-ray images are required to have high resolution. Otherwise,
many details of diseases would be lost. How to generate high-resolutions
images? Third, radiology reports are long and have complicated structure. How
to effectively understand their semantics to generate high-fidelity images that
accurately reflect the contents of the reports? To address these three
challenges, we propose an XRayGAN composed of three modules: (1) a view
consistency network that maximizes the consistency between generated
frontal-view and lateral-view images; (2) a multi-scale conditional GAN that
progressively generates a cascade of images with increasing resolution; (3) a
hierarchical attentional encoder that learns the latent semantics of a
radiology report by capturing its hierarchical linguistic structure and various
levels of clinical importance of words and sentences. Experiments on two
radiology datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. To our best
knowledge, this work represents the first one generating consistent and
high-resolution X-ray images from radiology reports. The code is available at

heterogenous sample of people living in the USA, showing that priming people to
""rely on their reasoning"" rather than to ""rely on their emotions"" significantly
increases their intentions to wear a face covering. Compared to the baseline,
priming reasoning promotes intentions to wear a face covering, whereas priming
emotion has no significant effect. These findings have theoretical and

intervention to promote intentions to wear a face mask. Theoretically, they
shed light on the cognitive basis of intentions to wear a face covering.

rare and recurrent events of high amplitude (extreme events) that are preceded
by so-called proto-events during which a certain fraction of the units become
excited. Although it is well known that a sufficiently large fraction of
excited units is required to turn a proto-event into an extreme event, it is
not yet clear how the other units are being recruited into the final generation
of an extreme event. Addressing this question and mimicking typical
experimental situations, we investigate the centrality of edges in
time-dependent interaction networks. We derived these networks from time series
of the units' dynamics employing a widely used bivariate analysis technique.
Using our recently proposed edge centrality concepts together with an
edge-based network decomposition technique, we observe that the recruitment is
primarily facilitated by sets of certain edges that have no equivalent in the
underlying topology. Our finding might aid to improve the understanding of
generation of extreme events in natural networked dynamical systems.

Simulation results indicated more stable and accurate performance over various
settings, especially when the sample size was small (high-dimensional cases).
We then applied to the analysis of real data from the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). This included 855 individuals aged 8-22 years

revealed the development of emotion-related intra- and inter- modular

categorized the hubs into two types: in-hubs and out-hubs, as the center of
receiving and distributing information. Several unique developmental hub
structures and group-specific patterns were also discovered. Our findings help
provide a causal understanding of emotion development in the human brain.

  neural networks trained for face classification","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The increased use of convolutional neural networks for face recognition in
science, governance, and broader society has created an acute need for methods
that can show how these 'black box' decisions are made. To be interpretable and
useful to humans, such a method should convey a model's learned classification
strategy in a way that is robust to random initializations or spurious
correlations in input data. To this end, we applied the decompositional
pixel-wise attribution method of layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to
resolve the decisions of several classes of VGG-16 models trained for face
recognition. We then quantified how these relevance measures vary with and
generalize across key model parameters, such as the pretraining dataset
(ImageNet or VGGFace), the finetuning task (gender or identity classification),
and random initializations of model weights. Using relevance-based image
masking, we find that relevance maps for face classification prove generally
stable across random initializations, and can generalize across finetuning
tasks. However, there is markedly less generalization across pretraining
datasets, indicating that ImageNet- and VGGFace-trained models sample face
information differently even as they achieve comparably high classification
performance. Fine-grained analyses of relevance maps across models revealed
asymmetries in generalization that point to specific benefits of choice
parameters, and suggest that it may be possible to find an underlying set of
important face image pixels that drive decisions across convolutional neural
networks and tasks. Finally, we evaluated model decision weighting against
human measures of similarity, providing a novel framework for interpreting face
recognition decisions across human and machine.

introducing computing concepts to K-12 students. One of the key pedagogical
challenges in these environments is in designing new practice tasks for a
student that match a desired level of difficulty and exercise specific
programming concepts. In this paper, we formalize the problem of synthesizing
visual programming tasks. In particular, given a reference visual task $\rm
T^{in}$ and its solution code $\rm C^{in}$, we propose a novel methodology to
automatically generate a set $\{(\rm T^{out}, \rm C^{out})\}$ of new tasks
along with solution codes such that tasks $\rm T^{in}$ and $\rm T^{out}$ are
conceptually similar but visually dissimilar. Our methodology is based on the
realization that the mapping from the space of visual tasks to their solution
codes is highly discontinuous; hence, directly mutating reference task $\rm
T^{in}$ to generate new tasks is futile. Our task synthesis algorithm operates
by first mutating code $\rm C^{in}$ to obtain a set of codes $\{\rm C^{out}\}$.
Then, the algorithm performs symbolic execution over a code $\rm C^{out}$ to
obtain a visual task $\rm T^{out}$; this step uses the Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) procedure to guide the search in the symbolic tree. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our algorithm through an extensive empirical evaluation and
user study on reference tasks taken from the \emph{Hour of Code: Classic Maze}
challenge by \emph{Code.org} and the \emph{Intro to Programming with Karel}
course by \emph{CodeHS.com}.

demonstrated, the extent of the studied AFM materials has been limited with few
systematic experiments and a poor understanding. We compare the electrical
current switching of the exchange-bias field ($H_{ex}$) in
AFM-Mn$_3A$N/ferromagnet-Co$_3$FeN bilayers. An applied pulse current can
manipulate $H_{ex}$ with respect to the current density and FM layer
magnetization, which shifts exponentially as a function of the current density.
We found that the saturation current density and exponential decay constant
$\tau$ increase with the local moment of AFM Mn atoms. Our results highlight
the effect of the AFM local moment to electrical current switching of $H_{ex}$,
although it has a near-zero net magnetization, and may provide a facile way to
explore the electrical current manipulation of AFM materials.

matrix model is expected to have a Hagedorn/deconfinement type phase transition
as the temperature is varied in the system. The Polyakov loop is used as an
order parameter for detecting the phase transition. Besides the Polyakov loop,
other prime observables such as the internal energy and the extent of space
were also computed. We also check the validity of numerical simulation
algorithms by exploring the behavior of various relevant toy models. As the
main result of this thesis, we present a parametrized phase diagram of the
bosonic BMN matrix model constructed using two dimensionless parameters: a
dimensionless coupling constant and a dimensionless temperature.

of solving a variety of difficult tasks such as NP-Hard combinatorial

very compact; requiring very few weights and biases. This, along with its
simple, parallelizable sampling algorithm for finding the ground state of such
problems, makes the RBM amenable to hardware acceleration. However, training of
the RBM on these problems can pose a significant challenge, as the training
algorithm tends to fail for large problem sizes and efficient mappings can be
hard to find. Here, we propose a method of combining RBMs together that avoids
the need to train large problems in their full form. We also propose methods
for making the RBM more hardware amenable, allowing the algorithm to be
efficiently mapped to an FPGA-based accelerator. Using this accelerator, we are
able to show hardware accelerated factorization of 16 bit numbers with high
accuracy with a speed improvement of 10000x and a power improvement of 32x.

techniques in the field of diagnostics is not a new concept, and these
techniques have been very successfully applied in a variety of applications,

problems that involve tests resulting in true or false (binary classification),
the data generally has a class imbalance with samples majorly belonging to one
class (ex: a patient undergoes a regular test and the results are false). Such
disparity in data causes problems when trying to model predictive systems on
the data. In critical applications like diagnostics, this class imbalance
cannot be overlooked and must be given extra attention. In our research, we
depict how we can handle this class imbalance through neural networks using a
discriminative model and contrastive loss using a Siamese neural network
structure. Such a model does not work on a probability-based approach to
classify samples into labels. Instead it uses a distance-based approach to
differentiate between samples classified under different labels. The code is
