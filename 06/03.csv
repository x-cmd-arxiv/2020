sensors and energy harvesters, since it offers thermal and mechanical isolation
from the environment at zero power. To advance the application of
diamagnetically levitating resonators, it is important to characterize their
dynamics in the presence of both magnetic and gravitational fields. Here we
experimentally actuate and measure rigid body modes of a diamagnetically
levitating graphite plate. We numerically calculate the magnetic field and
determine the influence of magnetic force on the resonance frequencies of the
levitating plate. By analyzing damping mechanisms, we conclude that eddy
current damping dominates dissipation in mm-sized plates. We use finite element
simulations to model eddy current damping and find close agreement with
experimental results. We also study the size-dependent Q-factors (Qs) of
diamagnetically levitating plates and show that Qs above 100 million are
theoretically attainable by reducing the size of the diamagnetic resonator down
to microscale, making these systems of interest for next generation low-noise
resonant sensors and oscillators.

developed under different homogenization conditions. Unlike the available CCT
diagrams in the reported studies, no gamma double prime and gamma prime
precipitates can be observed. NbC and delta are determined to be the

time and manufacturing methods are found to affect the Nb homogeneity in the

process of the delta phase, which has a high content in Nb. In the alloys with
high Nb homogeneity, the nucleation process mainly contributes to the
precipitation, whereas in the alloys with low Nb homogeneity, the precipitation
is primarily associated with the growth process. Subgrains are found to form
after cooling at 0.1 K/s and can cause the highest hardness in samples. This
work provides a new viewpoint on the study of processing-structure-property
relationships during cooling in Inconel 718 and is beneficial to the

iteratively approximates the gradient of the expected return via Monte-Carlo

where the condensate pseudo-spin precesses persistently within the driving

pseudo-spin performs over $10^5$ precessions with striking frequency stability.
The condensate maintains its phase coherence even after a complete precession
of the spin vector, making the observed state by a definition a spin coherent
state. The emergence of the precession is traced to the polariton interactions
that give rise to a self-induced out-of-plane magnetic field that in turn
drives the spin dynamics. We find that the Larmor oscillation frequency scales
with the condensate density, enabling external tuning of this effect by optical
means. The stability of the system allows for the realization of integrated
optical magnetometry devices with the use of materials with enhanced exciton
$g$-factor and can facilitate spin squeezing effects and active coherent

from the richness of the interactions among their units. Over the past decades,
a great variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks

human communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions
can occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just
in terms of simple dyads. Until recently, little attention has been devoted to
the higher-order architecture of real complex systems. However, a mounting body
of evidence is showing that taking the higher-order structure of these systems
into account can greatly enhance our modeling capacities and help us to
understand and predict their emerging dynamical behaviors. Here, we present a

to describe higher-order systems, highlighting the links between the existing
concepts and representations. We review the measures designed to characterize
the structure of these systems and the models proposed in the literature to
generate synthetic structures, such as random and growing simplicial complexes,
bipartite graphs and hypergraphs. We introduce and discuss the rapidly growing
research on higher-order dynamical systems and on dynamical topology. We focus
on novel emergent phenomena characterizing landmark dynamical processes, such

that the dynamics near a critical point is generically slower when the quenched
disorder is relevant than when it is not, independent of whether the pure model
is isotropic or cubic anisotropic. We demonstrate the surprising thresholdless
instability of the associated universality class due to perturbations from
rotational invariance breaking quenched disorder-order parameter coupling,
indicating breakdown of dynamic scaling. We speculate that this may imply a

competing definitions of what fairness or nondiscrimination between groups
requires. However, little attention has been paid to what precisely a group is.
Many recent approaches to ""fairness"" require one to specify a causal model of
the data generating process. These exercises make an implicit ontological
assumption that a racial or sex group is simply a collection of individuals who
share a given trait. We show this by exploring the formal assumption of
modularity in causal models, which holds that the dependencies captured by one
causal pathway are invariant to interventions on any other pathways. Causal
models of sex propose two substantive claims: 1) There exists a feature,
sex-on-its-own, that is an inherent trait of an individual that causally brings
about social phenomena external to it in the world; and 2) the relations
between sex and its effects can be modified in whichever ways and the former
feature would still retain the meaning that sex has in our world. We argue that
this ontological picture is false. Many of the ""effects"" that sex purportedly
""causes"" are in fact constitutive features of sex as a social status. They give
the social meaning of sex features, meanings that are precisely what make sex
discrimination a distinctively morally problematic type of action. Correcting
this conceptual error has a number of implications for how models can be used
to detect discrimination. Formal diagrams of constitutive relations present an
entirely different path toward reasoning about discrimination. Whereas causal
diagrams guide the construction of sophisticated modular counterfactuals,
constitutive diagrams identify a different kind of counterfactual as central to
an inquiry on discrimination: one that asks how the social meaning of a group
would be changed if its non-modular features were altered.

Schvab-Zel'dovich-Li\~nan formulation. The gaseous mixture-fraction variable as
function of the physical space, Z(x_i), typically employed for the description
of gaseous diffusion flames leads to non-monotonicity behaviour for spray
flames due to the extra fuel supplied by vaporisation of droplets distributed
into the flow. As a result, the overall properties of spray flames depend not
only on Z and the scalar dissipation rate, but also on the spray source term,
S_v. We propose a new general coordinate variable which takes into account the
spatial information about the entire mixture fraction due to the gaseous phase
and droplet vaporisation. This coordinate variable, Z_C(x_i) is based on the
cumulative value of the gaseous mixture fraction Z(x_i), and is shown to be
monotonic. For pure gaseous flow, the new cumulative function, Z_C, yields the
well-established flamelet structure in Z-space. In the present manuscript, the
spray-flamelet structure and the new equations for temperature and mass
fractions in terms of Z_C are derived and then applied to the canonical
counterflow configuration with potential flow. Numerical results are obtained
for ethanol and methanol sprays, and the effect of Lewis and Stokes numbers on
the spray-flamelet structure are analyzed. The proposed formulation agrees well
when mapping the structure back to physical space thereby confirming our
integration methodology.

isotropization term is physically associated with an electron heat flux. As a
consequence, we put forward that an enhanced value of a diagonal component is
observed in the very middle of field reversal at sub-ion scale. Because of the
increase of the kinetic pressure, the magnetic field is decreased in this
electron layer, hence increasing the associated out-of-plane current at its
edges and leading to its bifurcation. The bifurcation mechanism is based on the
presence of electron pressure anisotropy, related to the gradient of inflow
electron bulk velocity. The gradient in the inflow direction of the enhanced
diagonal electron pressure tensor component results in the deceleration of the
ions entering the X-point region. We suggest that bifurcated current sheets
resulting from the anisotropies/agyrotropies of the six-component electron
pressure tensor correspond to smaller reconnection rates comparing to
non-bifurcated ones.

wireless systems that will not only provide ubiquitous communication but also
empower high accuracy localization and high-resolution sensing services. They

this paper we propose an exploration algorithm that retains the simplicity of

the main limitation of {\epsilon}-greedy exploration is its lack of temporal

temporally extended form of {\epsilon}-greedy that simply repeats the sampled

uncover the formation and evolution of the Galaxy at high redshift, but it has

formed externally and subsequently accreted onto the Milky Way. Leveraging this

relativistically streaming non-stationary plasma flow, which is generated from
sparking discharges in the inner acceleration region (IAR) near the stellar
surface. A number of detailed works have shown the IAR to be a partially
screened gap (PSG) dominated by non-dipolar magnetic fields with continuous
outflow of ions from the surface. The phenomenon of subpulse drifting is
expected to originate due to variable $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$ drift of the
sparks in PSG, where the sparks lag behind corotation velocity of the pulsar.
Detailed observations show a wide variety of subpulse drifting behaviour where
subpulses in different components of the profile have different phase
trajectories. But the drifting periodicity is seen to be constant, within
measurement errors, across all components of the profile. Using the concept of
sparks lagging behind corotation speed in PSG as well as the different
orientations of the surface non-dipolar magnetic fields we have simulated the
expected single pulse behaviour in a representative sample of pulsars. Our
results show that the different types of drifting phase behaviour can be

Recent efforts have taken advantage of the enabling technologies from the field

problems, they generally require large amounts of training data even though the
construction of surrogates is by definition a Small Data problem. Rather than
employing data-based loss functions, it has been proposed to make use of the

that accounts for physical structure and information both in the training

probabilistic (Bayesian) model in which equalities that are available from the
physics (e.g. residuals, conservation laws) can be introduced as virtual
observables and can provide additional information through the likelihood. We
further advocate a generative model i.e. one that attempts to learn the joint
density of inputs and outputs that is capable of making use of unlabeled data

discovery of lower-dimensional embeddings which are nevertheless predictive of

generalization ability of deep learning models. Regional dropout is one of the
popular solutions that guides the model to focus on less discriminative parts
by randomly removing image regions, resulting in improved regularization.
However, such information removal is undesirable. On the other hand, recent
strategies suggest to randomly cut and mix patches and their labels among
training images, to enjoy the advantages of regional dropout without having any
pointless pixel in the augmented images. We argue that such random selection
strategies of the patches may not necessarily represent sufficient information
about the corresponding object and thereby mixing the labels according to that
uninformative patch enables the model to learn unexpected feature
representation. Therefore, we propose SaliencyMix that carefully selects a
representative image patch with the help of a saliency map and mixes this
indicative patch with the target image, thus leading the model to learn more
appropriate feature representation. SaliencyMix achieves the best known top-1
error of 21.26% and 20.09% for ResNet-50 and ResNet-101 architectures on
ImageNet classification, respectively, and also improves the model robustness
against adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, models that are trained with

electrons screen out the Ce-4f moment. Here, we show that the Ce-4f shell in
Ce-Fe intermetallics is partially Kondo screened. The Kondo scale is
dramatically enhanced by nitrogen interstitials completely suppressing the
Ce-4f contribution to the magnetic anisotropy, in striking contrast to the
effect of nitrogenation in isostructural intermetallics containing other
rare-earth elements. We determine the full temperature dependence of the Ce-4f

example of the Naproche system developed by M. Cramer and others - is an
automated proof checker for proofs written in a controlled fragment of natural
language specifically designed to capture the language of beginners' proving
exercises in mathematics. Both the accepted language and proof methods depend
on the didactical and mathematical context and vary with the level of education
and the topic proposed. An overall presentation of the system in general was
given in Carl and Krapf 2019. Here, we briefly recall the basic architecture of
Diproche and then focus on explaining key features and the working principles
of Diproche in the sample topics of elementary number theory and axiomatic
geometry.

inference cost of neural networks. The usual pruning pipeline consists of
ranking the network internal filters and activations with respect to their
contributions to the network performance, removing the units with the lowest
contribution, and fine-tuning the network to reduce the harm induced by
pruning. Recent results showed that random pruning performs on par with other
metrics, given enough fine-tuning resources. In this work, we show that this is
not true on a low-data regime when fine-tuning is either not possible or not
effective. In this case, reducing the harm caused by pruning becomes crucial to
retain the performance of the network. First, we analyze the problem of
estimating the contribution of hidden units with tools suggested by cooperative
game theory and propose Shapley values as a principled ranking metric for this
task. We compare with several alternatives proposed in the literature and
discuss how Shapley values are theoretically preferable. Finally, we compare
all ranking metrics on the challenging scenario of low-data pruning, where we
demonstrate how Shapley values outperform other heuristics.

Although an end-to-end neural diarization (EEND) method achieved

this paper, we solve this fixed number of speaker issue by a novel speaker-wise
conditional inference method based on the probabilistic chain rule. In the
proposed method, each speaker's speech activity is regarded as a single random
variable, and is estimated sequentially conditioned on previously estimated
other speakers' speech activities. Similar to other sequence-to-sequence
models, the proposed method produces a variable number of speakers with a stop
sequence condition. We evaluated the proposed method on multi-speaker audio
recordings of a variable number of speakers. Experimental results show that the

density matrix of dimension $d = 2^n$ and rank $r$ with $r \ll 2^n$, it was
shown that randomly chosen Pauli measurements of the order $O(dr \log(d)^2)$
are enough to fully reconstruct the density matrix by running a specific convex
optimization algorithm. The result utilized the low operator-norm of the Pauli
operator basis, which makes it `incoherent' to low-rank matrices. For quantum
systems of dimension $d$ not a power of two, Pauli measurements are not
available, and one may consider using SU($d$) measurements. Here, we point out
that the SU($d$) operators, owing to their high operator norm, do not provide a
significant savings in the number of measurement settings required for
successful recovery of all rank-$r$ states. We propose an alternative strategy,
in which the quantum information is swapped into the subspace of a power-two
system using only $\textrm{poly}(\log(d)^2)$ gates at most, with QST being
implemented subsequently by performing $O(dr \log(d)^2)$ Pauli measurements. We
show that, despite the increased dimensionality, this method is more efficient

to imply that KBOs formed over a relatively wide range of radial distance, r.
The cold classicals at 42<r<47 au are predominantly VR and known Neptune
Trojans at r=30 au are mostly R. Intriguingly, however, the dynamically hot
KBOs show a mix of R and VR colors and no correlation of color with r. Here we
perform migration/instability simulations where the Kuiper belt is populated
from an extended planetesimal disk. We find that the color observations can be
best understood if R objects formed at r<r* and VR objects at r>r*, with
30<r*<40 au. The proposed transition at 30<r*<40 au would explain why the VR
objects in the dynamically hot population have smaller orbital inclinations
than the R objects, because the orbital excitation from Neptune weakens for
orbits starting beyond 30 au. Possible causes of the R-VR color bimodality are

and accelerates the convergence compared to the conventional static partial
recovery schemes.

background solution, and this paper goes on to work out the covariance of
fluctuations around the background solution. Using a Green's function type
approach, one simply needs to solve additional ordinary differential equations;
an explicit matrix inversion is not required. The computed covariance matrix

in terms of massive black holes and nuclear stellar clusters being different
evolutionary paths of a common formation mechanism, unified under the standard
terminology of being both central massive objects. We propose a formation
scenario where central massive objects more massive than $\rm \sim 10^8 \,
Msun$, which also have relaxation times longer that their collision times, will
be too dense (in virial equilibrium) to be globally stable against stellar
collisions and most of its mass will collapse towards the formation of a
massive black hole. Contrarily, this will only be the case at the core of less
dense central massive objects leading to the formation of black holes with much
lower black hole efficiencies $\rm \epsilon_{BH} = \frac{M_{BH}}{M_{CMO}}$,
with these efficiencies $\rm \epsilon_{BH}$ drastically growing for central
massive objects more massive than $\rm \sim 10^7 \, Msun$, approaching unity
around $\rm M_{CMO} \sim 10^8 \, Msun$. We show that the proposed scenario
successfully explains the relative trends observed in the masses, efficiencies,

report on 3 studies in this paper. First, simulations in which we accrete only
solar matter using NOVA (our 1-D, fully implicit, hydro code). Second, we use
MESA for similar studies in which we accrete only Solar matter and compare the
results. Third, we accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then
switch the composition in the accreted layers to a mixed composition: either
25% WD and 75% solar or 50% WD and 50% Solar matter. We find that the amount of
accreted material is inversely proportional to the initial 12C abundance (as
expected). Thus, accreting solar matter results in a larger amount of accreted
material to fuel the outburst; much larger than in earlier studies where a
mixed composition was assumed from the beginning of the simulation. Our most
important result is that all these simulations eject significantly less mass
than accreted and, therefore, the WD is growing in mass toward the
Chandrasekhar Limit.

of behaviour, political views, texts, or viruses. If desired, tangles can also
be used for direct clustering of objects. They offer a precise, quantitative
paradigm suited particularly to fuzzy clusters, since they do not require any
`hard' assignments of objects to the clusters they collectively form. This is a
draft of the introductory chapter of a book I am preparing on the application
of tangles in the empirical sciences. The purpose of posting this draft early
is to give authors of tangle application papers a generic reference for the
basic guiding principles underlying tangle applications outside mathematics, so
that in their own papers they can concentrate on the ideas specific to their
particular application rather than having to repeat the generic story each

the natural sciences, in the social sciences, and in data science including
machine learning. It then gives a short informal description of the abstract
notion of tangles that encompasses all these potential applications.

exceptional points, pseudo-Hermiticity and parity-time symmetry, are delineated
in a pedagogical and mathematically coherent manner. Building on these, we
provide an overview of how diverse classical systems, ranging from photonics,
mechanics, electrical circuits, acoustics to active matter, can be used to
simulate non-Hermitian wave physics. In particular, we discuss rich and unique
phenomena found therein, such as unidirectional invisibility, enhanced
sensitivity, topological energy transfer, coherent perfect absorption,
single-mode lasing, and robust biological transport. We then explain in detail
how non-Hermitian operators emerge as an effective description of open quantum
systems on the basis of the Feshbach projection approach and the quantum
trajectory approach. We discuss their applications to physical systems relevant
to a variety of fields, including atomic, molecular and optical physics,
mesoscopic physics, and nuclear physics with emphasis on prominent
phenomena/subjects in quantum regimes, such as quantum resonances,
superradiance, continuous quantum Zeno effect, quantum critical phenomena,
Dirac spectra in quantum chromodynamics, and nonunitary conformal field
theories. Finally, we introduce the notion of band topology in complex spectra
of non-Hermitian systems and present their classifications by providing the
proof, firstly given by this review in a complete manner, as well as a number
of instructive examples. Other topics related to non-Hermitian physics,

to a given residual cosmic variance. Namely some regions and scales are
apparently not constrained by the data and seem purely random. Drawing
conclusions together with their uncertainties involves then statistics implying
a considerable amount of computing time. By applying the constraining algorithm
to paired fixed fields, this paper diverts the original techniques from their
first use to efficiently disentangle and estimate uncertainties on local
Universe simulations obtained with random fields. Paired fixed fields differ
from random realizations in the sense that their Fourier mode amplitudes are
fixed and they are exactly out of phase. Constrained paired fixed fields show
that only 20% of the power spectrum on large scales (> tens of megaparsecs) is
purely random. Namely 80% of it is partly constrained by the large scale /
small scale data correlations. Additionally, two realizations of our local
environment obtained with paired fixed fields of the same pair constitute an
excellent non-biased average or quasi-linear realization of the latter, namely
the equivalent of hundreds of constrained simulations. The variance between
these two realizations gives the uncertainty on the achievable local Universe

grew to $M_{\bullet} \sim 10^9 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ by $z\sim 7$. Here we
study the effects of the value of the Hubble parameter, $H_0$, on models
describing the early growth of BHs. First, we note that the predicted mass of a
quasar at $z=6$ changes by $> 300$% if the underlying Hubble parameter used in
the model varies from $H_0 = 65$ to $H_0 = 74$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, a range
encompassing current estimates. Employing an MCMC approach based on priors from
$z \gtrsim 6.5$ quasars and on $H_0$, we study the interconnection between
$H_0$ and the parameters describing BH growth: seed mass $M_i$ and Eddington
ratio $f_{\rm Edd}$. Assuming an Eddington ratio of $f_{\rm Edd} = 0.7$, in
agreement with previous estimates, we find $H_0 = 73.6^{+1.2}_{-3.3}$ km
s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$. In a second analysis, allowing all the parameters to vary
freely, we find $\log(M_{i}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}) > 4.5$ (at 95% CL), $H_0 =
74^{+1.5}_{-1.4}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$ and $f_{\rm
Edd}=0.77^{+0.035}_{-0.026}$ at 68% CL. Our results on the typical Eddington
ratio are in agreement with previous estimates. Current values of the Hubble
parameter strongly favour heavy seed formation scenarios, with $M_i \gtrsim
10^4 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. In our model, with the priors on BH masses of
quasars used, light seed formation scenarios are rejected at $\sim 3\sigma$.

Our description is within the recently proposed ETHOS framework and includes
standard thermal Warm DM (WDM) and models with dark acoustic oscillations
(DAOs). To define and explore this parameter space, we use high-redshift
zoom-in simulations that cover a wide range of non-linear scales from those
where DM should behave as CDM ($k\sim10\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$), down to those
characterised by the onset of galaxy formation ($k\sim500\,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$).
We show that the two physically motivated parameters $h_{\rm peak}$ and $k_{\rm
peak}$, the amplitude and scale of the first DAO peak, respectively, are
sufficient to parametrize the linear matter power spectrum and classify the DM
models as belonging to effective non-linear structure formation regions. These
are defined by their relative departure from Cold DM ($k_{\rm
peak}\rightarrow\infty$) and WDM ($h_{\rm peak}=0$) according to the non-linear
matter power spectrum and halo mass function. We identify a region where the
DAOs still leave a distinct signature from WDM down to $z=5$, while a large
part of the DAO parameter space is shown to be degenerate with WDM. Our
framework can then be used to seamlessly connect a broad class of particle DM
models to their structure formation properties at high redshift without the
need of additional $N$-body simulations.

our hierarchical picture of galaxy evolution. It is difficult to track the
merging process of SMBHs during mergers of galaxies as SMBHs are naturally
difficult to observe. We want to characterise and confirm the presence of two
independent active galactic nuclei (AGN) separated by a few kiloparsec in seven
strongly interacting galaxies previously selected from the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey (SDSS) as Seyfert-Seyfert pairs based on emission-line ratio
diagnostics. Optical slit spectra taken with MODS at the Large Binocular
Telescope (LBT) are presented to infer the detailed spatial distribution of
optical emission lines, and their line ratios and AGN signatures with respect
to the host galaxies, thereby quantifying the impact of beam smearing and large
fibre apertures on the spectra captured by the SDSS. We find that at most two
of the seven targets actually retain a Seyfert-Seyfert dual AGN, whereas the
others may be more likely powered by post-AGB stars in retired galaxies or
through shocks in the ISM based on spatially resolved optical line diagnostics.
The major cause of this discrepancy is a bias caused by the spillover of flux
from the primary source in the secondary SDSS fibre which can be more than an
order of magnitude at <3"" separations. Previously reported extremely low
X-ray-to-[\ion{O}{iii}] luminosity ratios may be explained by this
misclassification, as can heavily obscured AGN for the primaries. We also find
that the nuclei with younger stellar ages host the primary AGN. Studies of
close dual AGN selected solely from fibre-based spectroscopy can create severe
biases in the sample selection and interpretation of the results. Spatially
resolved spectroscopy should ideally be used in the future to characterise such
compact systems together with multi-wavelength follow-up observations.

confidence intervals are 90%. While we therefore do not find statistically
significant evidence for an X-ray AGN excess in post-mergers (p = 0.26), we
find a factor of ~17 excess of mid-IR AGN in our sample, consistent with past

Dominant, luminous AGN are therefore more frequent in post-mergers, and the
lack of a comparable excess of 2-10 keV X-ray AGN suggests that AGN in
post-mergers are more likely to be heavily obscured. Our results are consistent
with the post-merger stage being characterised by enhanced AGN fueling, heavy

event trigger extraction, the other is event arguments extraction. However, the
F-Score of event arguments extraction is much lower than that of event trigger
extraction, i.e. in the most recent work, event trigger extraction achieves
80.7%, while event arguments extraction achieves only 58%. In pipelined

classification feature, and the much higher computation consumption. In this
work, we proposed a novel Event Extraction approach based on multi-layer Dilate
Gated Convolutional Neural Network (EE-DGCNN) which has fewer parameters. In
addition, enhanced local information is incorporated into word features, to
assign event arguments roles for triggers predicted by the first subtask. The
numerical experiments demonstrated significant performance improvement beyond

may be uninterpretable and hard to learn from. A crucial step in bridging this
gap between human and artificial intelligence is modeling the granular actions
that constitute human behavior, rather than simply matching aggregate human
performance.
  We pursue this goal in a model system with a long history in artificial
intelligence: chess. The aggregate performance of a chess player unfolds as
they make decisions over the course of a game. The hundreds of millions of
games played online by players at every skill level form a rich source of data
in which these decisions, and their exact context, are recorded in minute
detail. Applying existing chess engines to this data, including an open-source
implementation of AlphaZero, we find that they do not predict human moves well.
  We develop and introduce Maia, a customized version of Alpha-Zero trained on
human chess games, that predicts human moves at a much higher accuracy than
existing engines, and can achieve maximum accuracy when predicting decisions
made by players at a specific skill level in a tuneable way. For a dual task of
predicting whether a human will make a large mistake on the next move, we
develop a deep neural network that significantly outperforms competitive
baselines. Taken together, our results suggest that there is substantial
promise in designing artificial intelligence systems with human collaboration
in mind by first accurately modeling granular human decision-making.

of galaxies through their enrichment with metals and dust. In this work, we
analyse how the dust and metal content varies with specific gas mass
($M_{\text{HI}}$/$M_{\star}$) across a diverse sample of 423 nearby galaxies.
The observed trends are interpreted with a set of Dust and Element evolUtion
modelS (DEUS) - incluidng stellar dust production, grain growth, and dust
destruction - within a Bayesian framework to enable a rigorous search of the
multi-dimensional parameter space. We find that these scaling laws for galaxies
with $-1.0\lesssim \log M_{\text{HI}}$/$M_{\star}\lesssim0$ can be reproduced
using closed-box models with high fractions (37-89$\%$) of supernova dust
surviving a reverse shock, relatively low grain growth efficiencies
($\epsilon$=30-40), and long dus lifetimes (1-2\,Gyr). The models have
present-day dust masses with similar contributions from stellar sources
(50-80\,$\%$) and grain growth (20-50\,$\%$). Over the entire lifetime of these
galaxies, the contribution from stardust ($>$90\,$\%$) outweighs the fraction
of dust grown in the interstellar medium ($<$10$\%$). Our results provide an
alternative for the chemical evolution models that require extremely low
supernova dust production efficiencies and short grain growth timescales to
reproduce local scaling laws, and could help solving the conundrum on whether
or not grains can grow efficiently in the interstellar medium.

Our sample consists of 9 $\gamma$-ray detected blazars and 133 candidate
blazars selected based on the flatness of their soft X-ray spectra (0.3$-$10

application of the likelihood profile stacking technique reveals that the
high-redshift blazars are faint $\gamma$-ray emitters with steep spectra. The
high-redshift blazars host massive black holes ($\langle \log~M_{\rm

used in numerous applications such as engineered systems (e.g., modeling how
pedestrians move in an intersection), computational finance (e.g., modeling
stock option prices), and ecological processes (e.g., population change over

this paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time
bound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a
negligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier
certificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of
safety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a
finite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation
over this interval. We demonstrate our approach over a collection of
interesting examples from the literature, wherein our approach can be used to
find tight bounds on the violation probability of safety properties over the

classical. Such equations model the incompressible Navier-Stokes systems,
generalized viscous Burgers-Hilbert equation and various active scalars. We
derive conditions that guarantee the propagation of Lipschitz regularity by the
incompressible NSE in the form of a non-local, one dimensional viscous
Burgers-type inequality. We show the analogous inequality is always satisfied
for the generalized viscous Burgers-Hilbert equation, in any spatial dimension,
leading to global regularity. We also obtain a regularity criterion for the
Navier-Stokes equation with fractional dissipation $(-\Delta)^{\alpha}$,
regardless of the power of the Laplacian $\alpha\in(0,1]$, in terms of
H\""older-type assumptions on the solution. Such a criterion appears to be the
first of its kind when $\alpha\in(0,1)$. The assumptions are critical when
$\alpha\in[1/2,1]$, but sub-critical when $\alpha\in(0,1/2)$. Furthermore, we
prove a partial regularity result under supercritical assumptions, which is
upgraded to a regularity criterion if we consider the pressure-less
drift-diffusion problem when $\alpha\in(1/2,1]$. That is, a certain H\""older
super-criticality barrier is broken when considering a drift-diffusion equation
without incompressibility constraints (no pressure term), which to our
knowledge was never done before. Depending on the scenario, our results either
improve on, generalize or provide different proofs to previously known

their ability to extend the region in which the dynamics is stable and well

v\right\}, \] and we show the inequality \[ d_{HR}(u,v)\leq K d_D(u,v)^{1/2}.
\] Let $u_\Theta$ be the universal unitary tuple $(u_1,\ldots,u_d)$ satisfying
$u_\ell u_k=e^{i\theta_{k,\ell}} u_k u_\ell$, where $\Theta=(\theta_{k,\ell})$
is a real antisymmetric matrix. We find that $c(u_\Theta, u_{\Theta'})\leq
e^{\frac{1}{4}\|\Theta-\Theta'\|}$. From this we recover the result of
Haagerup-Rordam and Gao that there exists a map $\Theta\mapsto U(\Theta)\in
B(H)^d$ such that $U(\Theta)\sim u_\Theta$ and \[
\|U(\Theta)-U({\Theta'})\|\leq K\|\Theta-\Theta'\|^{1/2}. \] Of special
interest are: the universal $d$-tuple of noncommuting unitaries ${\mathrm u}$,
the $d$-tuple of free Haar unitaries $u_f$, and the universal $d$-tuple of
commuting unitaries $u_0$. We obtain the bounds \[ 2\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{d}}\leq
c(u_f,u_0)\leq 2\sqrt{1-\frac{1}{2d}}. \] From this, we recover Passer's upper
bound for the universal unitaries $c({\mathrm u},u_0)\leq\sqrt{2d}$. In the
case $d=3$ we obtain the new lower bound $c({\mathrm u},u_0)\geq 1.858$
improving on the previously known lower bound $c({\mathrm u},u_0)\geq\sqrt{3}$.

the quintic equation from the moribund state into which Galois had placed it.
Klein's approach was a mix of algebra and geometry built on the structure of

quintic's Galois group and the rotational symmetries of the icosahedron.
  Roughly a century after Klein's work, P. Doyle and C. McMullen developed an
algorithm for solving the quintic that also exploited icosahedral symmetry.
Their innovation was to employ a symmetrical dynamical system in one complex
variable. In effect, the dynamical behavior provides for a partial breaking of
the polynomial's symmetry and the extraction of two roots following one
iterative run of the map.
  The recent discovery of a map whose dynamics breaks all of the quintic's
symmetry allows for five roots to emerge from a single run. After sketching
some algebraic and geometric background, the discussion works out an explicit
procedure for solving the quintic in a complete sense.

location and the amount of mixing at the convective boundary, on stellar
structure and evolution. For this we calculated two grids of stellar evolution
models with the MESA code, each with the Ledoux and the Schwarzschild boundary
criterion, and vary the amount of CBM. We calculate each grid with the initial
masses $15$, $20$ and $25\,\rm{M}_\odot$. We present the stellar structure of
the models during the hydrogen and helium burning phases. In the latter, we
examine the impact on the nucleosynthesis. We find a broadening of the
main-sequence with more CBM, which is more in agreement with observations.
Furthermore during the core hydrogen burning phase there is a convergence of
the convective boundary location due to CBM. The uncertainties of the
intermediate convective zone remove this convergence. The behaviour of this
convective zone strongly affects the surface evolution of the model, i.e. how
fast it evolves red-wards. The amount of CBM impacts the size of the convective
cores and the nucleosynthesis, e.g. the $^{12}$C to $^{16}$O ratio and the weak
s-process. Lastly, we determine the uncertainty that the range of parameter
values investigated introduce and we find differences of up to $70\%$ for the
core masses and the total mass of the star.

the Hubble parameter, obtained from the generative process. Using the full
advantages of our method, the models are constrained for two redshift ranges.
Namely, first this is done with mock $H(z)$ data over $z\in [0,2.5]$, thus
covering known $H(z)$ observational data, which are most helpful to validate
the fit results. Then, aiming to extend to redshift ranges to be covered by the

collisions stripping planets of their atmospheres. In this paper we present the
results from a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of
head-on collisions of planets with significant atmospheres and bare projectiles
without atmospheres. Collisions between planets can have sufficient energy to
remove substantial fractions of the mass from the target planet. We find the
fraction of mass lost splits into two regimes -- at low impact energies only
the outer layers are ejected corresponding to atmosphere dominated loss, at
higher energies material deeper in the potential is excavated resulting in
significant core and mantle loss. Mass removal is less efficient in the
atmosphere loss dominated regime compared to the core and mantle loss regime,
due to the higher compressibility of atmosphere relative to core and mantle. We
find roughly twenty per cent atmosphere remains at the transition between the
two regimes. We find that the specific energy of this transition scales
linearly with the ratio of projectile to target mass for all projectile-target
mass ratios measured. The fraction of atmosphere lost is well approximated by a
quadratic in terms of the ratio of specific energy and transition energy. We
provide algorithms for the incorporation of our scaling law into future

cytoskeleton, which consumes chemical energy to dynamically remodel its
structure. Recent experiments in vivo have revealed that this remodeling
occasionally happens through anomalously large displacements, reminiscent of
earthquakes or avalanches. These cytoskeletal avalanches might indicate that
the cytoskeleton's structural response to a changing cellular environment is
highly sensitive, and they are therefore of significant biological interest.
However, the physics underlying ""cytoquakes"" is poorly understood. Here, we use
agent-based simulations of cytoskeletal self-organization to study fluctuations
in the network's mechanical energy. We robustly observe non-Gaussian statistics
and asymmetrically large rates of energy release compared to accumulation in a
minimal cytoskeletal model. The large events of energy release are found to
correlate with large, collective displacements of the cytoskeletal filaments.
We also find that the changes in the localization of tension and the
projections of the network motion onto the vibrational normal modes are
asymmetrically distributed for energy release and accumulation. These results
imply an avalanche-like process of slow energy storage punctuated by fast,
large events of energy release involving a collective network rearrangement. We
further show that mechanical instability precedes cytoquake occurrence through
a machine learning model that dynamically forecasts cytoquakes using the
vibrational spectrum as input. Our results provide the first connection between
the cytoquake phenomenon and the network's mechanical energy and can help guide
future investigations of the cytoskeleton's structural susceptibility.

vehicles as fuels, due to their low volumetric energy density at ambient
conditions. One strategy to densify these gases is to pack the fuel tank with a
porous adsorbent material. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has set volumetric
deliverable capacity targets which, if met, would help enable commercial
adoption of hydrogen/natural gas as transportation fuels. Here, we present a
theoretical upper bound on the deliverable capacity of a gas in a rigid porous
material via an isothermal pressure swing. To provide an extremum, we consider
a substrate that provides a spatially uniform potential energy field for the
gas. Our bound relies directly on experimentally measured properties of the
pure gas. We conclude that the deliverable capacity targets set by the DOE for
room-temperature natural gas and hydrogen storage are just barely theoretically
possible. The targets are likely to be impossible for any real, rigid porous
material because of steric repulsion, which reduces the deliverable capacity
below our upper bound. Limitations to the scope of applicability of our upper
bound may guide fuel tank design and future material development. Firstly, one
could avoid using an isothermal pressure swing by heating the adsorbent to
drive off trapped, residual gas. Secondly, our upper bound assumes the material
does not change its structure in response to adsorbed gas, suggesting that
flexible materials could still satisfy the DOE targets.

objective of deriving Wiener-Hopf type factorizations for (real-valued)
time-inhomogeneous Levy processes. In order to prove our main theorem, we
derive some new results regarding time-inhomogeneous noisy Wiener-Hopf

classical Wiener-Hopf factorization for this particular time-homogenous Levy

items matching the customers' preferences. Merchants on e-commerce platforms
would like their items to appear as high as possible in the top-N of these
ranked lists. In this paper, we demonstrate how unscrupulous merchants can
create item images that artificially promote their products, improving their
rankings. Recommender systems that use images to address the cold start problem
are vulnerable to this security risk. We describe a new type of attack,
Adversarial Item Promotion (AIP), that strikes directly at the core of Top-N
recommenders: the ranking mechanism itself. Existing work on adversarial images
in recommender systems investigates the implications of conventional attacks,
which target deep learning classifiers. In contrast, our AIP attacks are
embedding attacks that seek to push features representations in a way that
fools the ranker (not a classifier) and directly lead to item promotion. We
introduce three AIP attacks insider attack, expert attack, and semantic attack,
which are defined with respect to three successively more realistic attack
models. Our experiments evaluate the danger of these attacks when mounted
against three representative visually-aware recommender algorithms in a
framework that uses images to address cold start. We also evaluate potential
defenses, including adversarial training and find that common,
currently-existing, techniques do not eliminate the danger of AIP attacks. In
sum, we show that using images to address cold start opens recommender systems
to potential threats with clear practical implications.

tasks. The state-of-the-art method for one-dimensional data infers locally
adaptive histograms using the minimum description length (MDL) principle, but
the multi-dimensional case is far less studied: current methods consider the
dimensions one at a time (if not independently), which result in
discretizations based on rectangular cells of adaptive size. Unfortunately,
this approach is unable to adequately characterize dependencies among
dimensions and/or results in discretizations consisting of more cells (or bins)
than is desirable.
  To address this problem, we propose an expressive model class that allows for
far more flexible partitions of two-dimensional data. We extend the state of
the art for the one-dimensional case to obtain a model selection problem based
on the normalized maximum likelihood, a form of refined MDL. As the flexibility
of our model class comes at the cost of a vast search space, we introduce a
heuristic algorithm, named PALM, which Partitions each dimension ALternately
and then Merges neighboring regions, all using the MDL principle. Experiments
on synthetic data show that PALM 1) accurately reveals ground truth partitions
that are within the model class (i.e., the search space), given a large enough
sample size; 2) approximates well a wide range of partitions outside the model
class; 3) converges, in contrast to the state-of-the-art multivariate
discretization method IPD. Finally, we apply our algorithm to three spatial

well as the influence of rotation and magnetic braking (MB) on its depletion

effects of rotational mixing and of the rotational hydrostatic effects on Li
abundances are studied by simulating several grids of PMS and MS rotating and
non-rotating models. Those effects are combined with the additional impact of
the MB (with magnetic field intensities ranging between 3.0 and 5.0 G). The
data obtained from simulations are confronted by comparing different stellar
parameters. The results show that the surface Li abundance for the Sun like
models at the end of the PMS and throughout the MS decreases when rotational
effects are included, i.e. the Li depletion rate for rotating models is higher
than for non-rotating ones. This effect is attenuated when the MB produced by a
magnetic field is present. This physical phenomena impacts also the star
effective temperature ($T_{\mathrm{eff}}$) and its location in the HR diagram.
The impact of MB in Li depletion is sensitive to the magnetic field intensity:
the higher it is, the lower the Li destruction. A direct link between the
magnetic fields and the convective zone (CZ) size is observed: stronger
magnetic fields produce shallower CZ's. This result suggests that MB effect
must be taken into consideration during PMS if we aim to reproduce Li
abundances in young clusters.

optimally mixed states consisting of pure states i.e., of the most regular and
most disordered which the space of states of a given system allows. A
parsimonious paradigmatic example of the simplest system with a small and a
large number of degrees of freedom, is shown to support this methodology.

combination of small-angle X-ray (SAXS) and neutron scattering (SANS) with a
spatial resolution of 0.8 nm. The a-Si:H materials were deposited using a range
of widely varied conditions and are representative for this class of materials.
We identify two different phases which are embedded in the a-Si:H matrix and
quantified both according to their scattering cross-sections. First, 1.2 nm
sized voids (multivacancies with more than 10 missing atoms) which form a
superlattice with 1.6 nm void-to-void distance are detected. The voids are
found in concentrations as high as 6*10^19 ccm in a-Si:H material that is
deposited at a high rate. Second, dense ordered domains (DOD) that are depleted
of hydrogen with 1 nm average diameter are found. The DOD tend to form 10-15 nm
sized aggregates and are largely found in all a-Si:H materials considered here.
These quantitative findings make it possible to understand the complex
correlation between structure and electronic properties of a-Si:H and directly
link them to the light-induced formation of defects. Finally, a structural
model is derived, which verifies theoretical predictions about the
nanostructure of a-Si:H.

to compute and the log Jacobian determinant is equal to the trace of the linear

implicitly, which allows the use of convolutional layers. Using this insight,
we develop new invertible transformations named convolution exponentials and
graph convolution exponentials, which retain the equivariance of their
underlying transformations. In addition, we generalize Sylvester Flows and
propose Convolutional Sylvester Flows which are based on the generalization and
the convolution exponential as basis change. Empirically, we show that the
convolution exponential outperforms other linear transformations in generative
flows on CIFAR10 and the graph convolution exponential improves the performance
of graph normalizing flows. In addition, we show that Convolutional Sylvester
Flows improve performance over residual flows as a generative flow model

  Comprehension Behavior","To Appear at CogSci 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Human reading behavior is tuned to the statistics of natural language: the
time it takes human subjects to read a word can be predicted from estimates of
the word's probability in context. However, it remains an open question what
computational architecture best characterizes the expectations deployed in real
time by humans that determine the behavioral signatures of reading. Here we
test over two dozen models, independently manipulating computational
architecture and training dataset size, on how well their next-word
expectations predict human reading time behavior on naturalistic text corpora.
We find that across model architectures and training dataset sizes the
relationship between word log-probability and reading time is (near-)linear. We
next evaluate how features of these models determine their psychometric
predictive power, or ability to predict human reading behavior. In general, the
better a model's next-word expectations, the better its psychometric predictive
power. However, we find nontrivial differences across model architectures. For
any given perplexity, deep Transformer models and n-gram models generally show
superior psychometric predictive power over LSTM or structurally supervised
neural models, especially for eye movement data. Finally, we compare models'
psychometric predictive power to the depth of their syntactic knowledge, as
measured by a battery of syntactic generalization tests developed using methods
from controlled psycholinguistic experiments. Once perplexity is controlled
for, we find no significant relationship between syntactic knowledge and
predictive power. These results suggest that different approaches may be
required to best model human real-time language comprehension behavior in
naturalistic reading versus behavior for controlled linguistic materials
designed for targeted probing of syntactic knowledge.

extremely difficult to detect at angular separations ($\rho$) smaller than 1""

large brightness contrast between the companion and the central star.
Constraints on the low-mass end of the companions mass-function for massive
stars are however needed, for example to help distinguishing between various
scenarios for the formation of massive stars. To obtain statistically
significant constraint on the presence of low-mass companions beyond the
typical detection limit of current surveys ($\Delta \mathrm{mag} \lesssim 5$ at
$\rho \lesssim 1$""), we initiated a survey of O and Wolf-Rayet stars in the
Carina region using the SPHERE coronagraphic instrument on the VLT. In this
first paper, we aim to introduce the survey, to present the methodology and to
demonstrate the capability of SPHERE for massive stars using the multiple
system QZ~Car. High-contrast imaging techniques, such as angular- and
spectral-differential imaging techniques as well as PSF-fitting, were applied
to detect and measure the relative flux of companions in each spectral channel
of the instrument. We detected 19 sources around the QZ~Car system with
detection limits of 9~mag at $\rho > 200$~mas for IFS and as faint as 13~mag at
$\rho$ > 1"".8 for IRDIS (corresponding to sub-solar masses for potential
companions). All but two are reported here for the first time. Based on this
proof of concept, we showed that VLT/SPHERE allows us to reach the sub-solar
mass regime of the companion mass function. This paves the way for this type of
observation with a large sample of massive stars to provide novel constraints
on the multiplicity of massive stars in a region of the parameter space that

system to be coherent and engaging, it must be able to maintain the user's
interest for extended periods, without sounding boring or annoying. In this
paper, we investigate one natural approach to this problem, of modulating
response prosody, i.e., changing the pitch and cadence of the response to
indicate delight, sadness or other common emotions, as well as using
pre-recorded interjections. Intuitively, this approach should improve the
naturalness of the conversation, but attempts to quantify the effects of
prosodic modulation on user satisfaction and engagement remain challenging. To
accomplish this, we report results obtained from a large-scale empirical study
that measures the effects of prosodic modulation on user behavior and
engagement across multiple conversation domains, both immediately after each
turn, and at the overall conversation level. Our results indicate that the
prosody modulation significantly increases both immediate and overall user
satisfaction. However, since the effects vary across different domains, we
verify that prosody modulations do not substitute for coherent, informative
content of the responses. Together, our results provide useful tools and
insights for improving the naturalness of responses in conversational systems.

needed in high-fidelity qubit readout schemes to unidirectionally route the
readout signals and protect the qubits against noise coming from the output
chain. However, cryogenic circulators and isolators are prohibitive in scalable
superconducting architectures because they rely on magnetic materials. Here, we
perform a fast (750 ns) high-fidelity (95%) quantum nondemolition readout of a
coherent superconducting qubit ($T_{1}=52$ $\mu s$, $T_{\rm{2E}}=35$ $\mu s$)
without any nonreciprocal magnetic devices. We employ in our readout chain a
microwave-controlled qubit-Readout Multi-Chip Module (qRMCM) that integrates
interferometric directional Josephson devices consisting of an isolator and a
reconfigurable isolator/amplifier device and an off-chip low-pass filter. Using
the qRMCM, we demonstrate isolation up to 45 dB within 13 MHz, when both
directional devices are operated as isolators, and low-noise amplification in
excess of 10 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of $10$ MHz, when the
reconfigurable device is operated as an amplifier. We also demonstrate using
the variable isolation of the qRMCM an in-situ enhancement of the qubit
coherence times $T_{\rm{\varphi}}$ and $T_{\rm{2E}}$ by two orders of magnitude
(i.e., from $T_{\rm{\varphi}}=T_{\rm{2E}}=0.5$ $\mu s$ to $T_{\rm{\varphi}}=90$
$\mu s$ and $T_{\rm{2E}}=50$ $\mu s$). Furthermore, by directly comparing the
qRMCM performance to a state-of-art configuration (with $T_{\rm{2E}}\approx
2T_{1}$) that employs a pair of wideband magnetic isolators, we find that the
excess pure dephasing measured with the qRMCM (for which $T_{\rm{2E}}\approx
T_{1}$) is likely limited by residual thermal photon population in the readout
resonator. Improved versions of the qRMCM could replace magnetic circulators
and isolators in large superconducting quantum processors.

communication uncertainty such as communication delays and packet drops.
Although some previous works contributed to the design of average consensus
protocols to guarantee the convergence to an exact average, these methods may
increase computational burdens due to extra works. Sometimes it is thus
beneficial to make each agent exchange information asynchronously without
modifying the algorithm, which causes randomness in the average value as a
trade-off. In this study, an expected average error is analyzed based on the
switched system framework, to estimate an upper bound of the asynchronous
average compared to the exact one in the expectation sense. Numerical examples
are provided to validate the proposed results.

valuable sources of such information is the News. However, in order for the
user to hear the news that is useful and relevant to them, it must be
recommended in an interesting and informative way. However, to the best of our
knowledge, how to present a news item for a voice-based recommendation remains
an open question. In this paper, we empirically compare different ways of
recommending news, or specific news items, in a voice-based conversational
setting. Specifically, we study the user engagement and satisfaction with five
different variants of presenting news recommendations: (1) a generic news
briefing; (2) news about a specific entity relevant to the current
conversation; (3) news about an entity from a past conversation; (4) news on a
trending news topic; and (5) the default - a suggestion to talk about news in
general. Our results show that entity-based news recommendations exhibit 29%
higher acceptance compared to briefing recommendations, and almost 100% higher
acceptance compared to recommending generic or trending news. Our investigation
into the presentation of news recommendations and the resulting insights could
make voice assistants more informative and engaging.

Machine learning can help scientists work with data on this larger scale.
Unlike many applications of machine learning, a primary use in planetary space
physics applications is to infer behavior about the system itself. This raises
three concerns: first, the performance of the machine learning model, second,
the need for interpretable applications to answer scientific questions, and
third, how characteristics of spacecraft data change these applications. In
comparison to these concerns, uses of black box or un-interpretable machine
learning methods tend toward evaluations of performance only either ignoring
the underlying physical process or, less often, providing misleading
explanations for it. We build off a previous effort applying a semi-supervised
physics-based classification of plasma instabilities in Saturn's magnetosphere.
We then use this previous effort in comparison to other machine learning
classifiers with varying data size access, and physical information access. We
show that incorporating knowledge of these orbiting spacecraft data
characteristics improves the performance and interpretability of machine
learning methods, which is essential for deriving scientific meaning. Building
on these findings, we present a framework on incorporating physics knowledge

explored. The spatial distribution of water molecules under confinement are
diameter-dependent; however, proton solvation and transport is consistently
found to occur in the water layer adjacent to the pore wall, showing an
""amphiphilic"" character of the hydrated excess proton hydronium-like structure.
The proton transport free energy barrier also decreases significantly as the
nanopore diameter increases and proton transport becomes almost barrierless in
the d > 1 nm nanopores. Among the nanopores studied, the Zundel cation
(${H_{5}O_{2}}^{+}$) is populated only in the d = 0.95 nm CNT (7,7) nanopore.
The presence of the hydrated excess proton and $K^{+}$ inside the CNT (7,7)
nanopore induces a water density increase by 40 and 20%, respectively. The
$K^{+}$ transport through CNT nanopores is also consistently higher in free
energy barrier than proton transport. Interestingly, the evolution of excess
protonic charge defect distribution reveals a ""frozen"" single water wire
configuration in the d = 0.81 nm CNT (6,6) nanopore (or segment), through which
hydrated excess protons can only shuttle via the Grotthuss mechanism. Vehicular
diffusion becomes relevant to proton transport in the ""flat"" free energy
regions and in the wider nanopores, where protons do not primarily shuttle in
the axial direction.

techniques seeking to improve molecular simulations by minimally biasing the
system Hamiltonian to reproduce certain experimental observables. In a previous
application of EDS to ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation-based on
electronic density functional theory (DFT), the AIMD simulations of water were
biased to reproduce its experimentally derived solvation structure. In
particular, by solely biasing the O-O pair correlation functions, other
structural and dynamical properties that were not biased were improved. In this
work, the hypothesis is tested that directly biasing the OH pair correlation,
will provide an even better improvement of DFT-based water properties in AIMD
simulations. The logic behind this hypothesis is that for most electronic DFT
descriptions of water the hydrogen bonding is known to be deficient due to
anomalous charge transfer and over polarization in the DFT. Using recent
advances to the EDS learning algorithm, we thus train a minimal bias on AIMD
water that reproduces the O-H radial distribution function derived from the
highly accurate MB-pol model of water. It is then confirmed that biasing the
O-H pair correlation alone can lead to improved AIMD water properties, with
structural and dynamical properties in even closer to experiment than the
previous EDS-AIMD model.

walls on bubbly drag reduction (DR). We apply rough sandpaper bands of width
$s$ between $48.4\,mm$ and $148.5\,mm$, and roughness height $k = 695\,{\mu}m$,
around the smooth inner cylinder (IC) of the Twente Turbulent Taylor-Couette
facility. Between sandpaper bands, the IC is left uncovered over similar width
$s$, resulting in alternating rough and smooth bands, a constant pattern in
axial direction. We measure the DR in water that originates from introducing
air bubbles to the fluid at (shear) Reynolds numbers $\textit{Re}_s$ ranging
from $0.5 \times 10^6$ to $1.8 \times 10^6$. Results are compared to bubbly DR
measurements with a completely smooth IC and an IC that is completely covered
with sandpaper of the same roughness $k$. The outer cylinder is left smooth for
all variations. Results are also compared to bubbly DR measurements where a
smooth outer cylinder is rotating in opposite direction to the smooth IC. This
counter rotation induces secondary flow structures that are very similar to
those observed when the IC is composed of alternating rough and smooth bands.
For the measurements with roughness, the bubbly DR is found to initially
increase more strongly with $\textit{Re}_s$, before levelling off to reach a
value that no longer depends on $\textit{Re}_s$. This is attributed to a more
even axial distribution of the air bubbles, resulting from the increased
turbulence intensity of the flow compared to flow over a completely smooth wall
at the same $\textit{Re}_s$. The air bubbles are seen to accumulate at the
rough wall sections in the flow. Here, locally, the drag is largest and so the
drag reducing effect of the bubbles is felt strongest. Therefore, a larger
maximum value of bubbly DR is found for the alternating rough and smooth walls
compared to the completely rough wall.

(STOC 16') initiated the analysis of these types of algorithms through the
lenses of approximation. Later, the dual problem was considered by Moseley and
Wang (NIPS 17') dubbing it the Revenue goal function. In this problem, given a
nonnegative weight $w_{ij}$ for each pair $i,j \in [n]=\{1,2, \ldots ,n\}$, the
objective is to find a tree $T$ whose set of leaves is $[n]$ that maximizes the
function $\sum_{i<j \in [n]} w_{ij} (n -|T_{ij}|)$, where $|T_{ij}|$ is the
number of leaves in the subtree rooted at the least common ancestor of $i$ and
$j$.
  In our work we consider the revenue goal function and prove the following
results. First, we prove the existence of a bisection (i.e., a tree of depth 2
in which the root has two children, each being a parent of $n/2$ leaves) which
approximates the general optimal tree solution up to a factor of $\frac{1}{2}$
(which is tight). Second, we apply this result in order to prove a
$\frac{2}{3}p$ approximation for the general revenue problem, where $p$ is
defined as the approximation ratio of the Max-Uncut Bisection problem. Since
$p$ is known to be at least 0.8776 (Wu et al., 2015, Austrin et al., 2016), we
get a 0.585 approximation algorithm for the revenue problem. This improves a
sequence of earlier results which culminated in an 0.4246-approximation
guarantee (Ahmadian et al., 2019).

flavour universality (LFU) goes beyond the mass proportionality, opening the
possibility to accommodate a different behaviour among charged leptons. We
analyze the electron and muon $(g-2)$ anomalies in the context of these general

We find two types of solutions that fully reproduce both $(g-2)$ anomalies, and
which are compatible with experimental constraints from LEP and LHC, from LFU,
from flavour and electroweak physics, and with theoretical constraints in the
scalar sector. In the first type of solution, all the new scalars have masses
in the 1--2.5 TeV range, the vacuum expectation values (vevs) of both doublets
are quite similar in magnitude, and both anomalies are dominated by two loop
Barr-Zee contributions. This solution appears in both models. In a second type
of solution, one loop contributions are dominant in the muon anomaly, all new
scalars have masses below 1 TeV, and the ratio of vevs is in the range 10--100.
The second neutral scalar $H$ is the lighter among the new scalars, with a mass
in the 210--390 GeV range while the pseudoscalar $A$ is the heavier, with a
mass in the range 400--900 GeV. The new charged scalar $H^\pm$ is almost
degenerate either with the scalar or with the pseudoscalar. This second type of

profiles generated by the 1d stellar evolution code MESA onto the 3d grid,
resolving the merger inspiral to within $0.02\, R_{\odot}$. We then map the
merger remnant into MESA to track its evolution on the HR diagram over a period

R4 was originally a member of a triple system in which the inner binary merged

higher for larger fractions of ablation opening and for shallower depths. More
than a few ablation structures reach the emission rates similar to the highest

a dark singlet scalar, which mixes with the two Higgs doublets. Choosing
benchmark parameter values, we show that $U(1)_{B-3L_\tau}$, which is
anomaly-free, and $U(1)_B$, both provide (phenomenologically) equally good
solutions to the excess. We also point out the other (anomaly-free) $U(1)$

simulated dynamics can be different from real-world dynamics. Past works
tackled this problem through domain randomization and online
system-identification. The former is sensitive to the manually-specified
training distribution of dynamics parameters and can result in behaviors that
are overly conservative. The latter requires learning policies that
concurrently perform the task and generate useful trajectories for system
identification. In this work, we propose and analyze a framework for learning
exploration policies that explicitly perform task-oriented exploration actions
to identify task-relevant system parameters. These parameters are then used by
model-based trajectory optimization algorithms to perform the task in the real
world. We instantiate the framework in simulation with the Linear Quadratic
Regulator as well as in the real world with pouring and object dragging tasks.
Experiments show that task-oriented exploration helps model-based policies
adapt to systems with initially unknown parameters, and it leads to better task
performance than task-agnostic exploration.

  In this paper, we present nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs. We
study the most interesting case of nucleus decomposition, k-(3,4)-nucleus,
which asks for maximal subgraphs where each triangle is contained in k
4-cliques. The major questions we address are: How to define meaningfully
nucleus decomposition in probabilistic graphs? How hard is computing nucleus
decomposition in probabilistic graphs? Can we devise efficient algorithms for
exact or approximate nucleus decomposition in large graphs?
  We present three natural definitions of nucleus decomposition in
probabilistic graphs: local, global, and weakly-global. We show that the local
version is in PTIME, whereas global and weakly-global are #P-hard and NP-hard,
respectively. We present an efficient and exact dynamic programming approach

numbers. By inspecting the rate at which a star's energy changes as it becomes
energetically unbound from the cluster, we can neatly identify two populations

the cluster and the external tidal field, respectively. We find that for a
typical halo globular cluster on a moderately eccentric orbit, sweeps are far
more common than kicks but the total mass loss rate is so low that these
clusters can survive for tens of Hubble times. The different N-body codes give
largely consistent results, but we find that numerical artifacts may arise in

epidemic spreading is to develop methods to control disease transmission. In
this article we study how the spreading of knowledge of a disease affects the
propagation of that disease in a population of interacting individuals. For
that, we analyze the interaction between two different processes on multiplex
networks: the propagation of an epidemic using the
susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics and the dissemination of information
about the disease --and its prevention methods-- using the
unaware-aware-unaware dynamics, so that informed individuals are less likely to
be infected. Unlike previous related models where disease and information
spread at the same time scale, we introduce here a parameter that controls the
relative speed between the propagation of the two processes. We study the
behavior of this model using a mean-field approach that gives results in good
agreement with Monte Carlo simulations on homogeneous complex networks. We find
that increasing the rate of information dissemination reduces the disease
prevalence, as one may expect. However, increasing the speed of the information
process as compared to that of the epidemic process has the counter intuitive
effect of increasing the disease prevalence. This result opens an interesting
discussion about the effects of information spreading on disease propagation.

predict gene functions and phenotypes. Despite the popularity of this approach,
little attention has been paid to the question of provenance tracing in this
context, e.g., determining how much any experimental observation in the input
contributes to the score of every prediction.
  Results: We design a network propagation framework with two novel components
and apply it to predict human proteins that directly or indirectly interact
with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. First, we trace the provenance of each prediction to
its experimentally validated sources, which in our case are human proteins
experimentally determined to interact with viral proteins. Second, we design a
technique that helps to reduce the manual adjustment of parameters by users. We
find that for every top-ranking prediction, the highest contribution to its
score arises from a direct neighbor in a human protein-protein interaction
network. We further analyze these results to develop functional insights on
SARS-CoV-2 that expand on known biology such as the connection between
endoplasmic reticulum stress, HSPA5, and anti-clotting agents.
  Conclusions: We examine how our provenance tracing method can be generalized
to a broad class of network-based algorithms. We provide a useful resource for
the SARS-CoV-2 community that implicates many previously undocumented proteins
with putative functional relationships to viral infection. This resource
includes potential drugs that can be opportunistically repositioned to target
these proteins. We also discuss how our overall framework can be extended to
other, newly-emerging viruses.

researching this question is a lack of large labeled data sets for training
automated classifiers to identify counter speech. Here we made use of a unique

hate and counter speech. We used an ensemble learning algorithm which pairs a
variety of paragraph embeddings with regularized logistic regression functions

magnetic field, and in general they show the quadrupole distribution. The
position of this pattern relative to the equator can depend on the tilt of the
bipolar region. We compute the time-latitude diagrams of the helicity density

bands of sign for the density distribution in each hemisphere. Similar helicity
density patterns are provided by the helicity density flux from the emerging

modeling, although sparse and noisy clinical data can introduce significant
uncertainty in the estimated parameter values. This importance source of
uncertainty, if left unquantified, will lead to unknown variability in model
outputs that hinder their reliable adoptions. Probabilistic estimation model
parameters, however, remains an unresolved challenge because standard Markov
Chain Monte Carlo sampling requires repeated model simulations that are
computationally infeasible. A common solution is to replace the simulation
model with a computationally-efficient surrogate for a faster sampling.
However, by sampling from an approximation of the exact posterior probability
density function (pdf) of the parameters, the efficiency is gained at the
expense of sampling accuracy. In this paper, we address this issue by
integrating surrogate modeling into Metropolis Hasting (MH) sampling of the
exact posterior pdfs to improve its acceptance rate. It is done by first
quickly constructing a Gaussian process (GP) surrogate of the exact posterior
pdfs using deterministic optimization. This efficient surrogate is then used to
modify commonly-used proposal distributions in MH sampling such that only
proposals accepted by the surrogate will be tested by the exact posterior pdf
for acceptance/rejection, reducing unnecessary model simulations at unlikely
candidates. Synthetic and real-data experiments using the presented method show
a significant gain in computational efficiency without compromising the
accuracy. In addition, insights into the non-identifiability and heterogeneity
of tissue properties can be gained from the obtained posterior distributions.

lead to severe hardware failures due to abrupt changes in the velocities and
torques. Without dedicated hardware and controllers, robots typically operate
at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts. We assume knowing how much
of impact the hardware can absorb and focus solely on the controller aspects.
The novelty of our approach is twofold: (i) it uses the task-space inverse
dynamics formalism that we extend by seamlessly integrating impact tasks; (ii)
it does not require separate models with switches or a reset map to operate the
robot undergoing impact tasks. Our main idea lies in integrating post-impact
states prediction and impact-aware inequality constraints as part of our
existing general-purpose whole-body controller. To achieve such prediction, we
formulate task-space impacts and its spreading along the kinematic tree of a
floating-base robot with subsequent joint velocity and torque jumps. As a
result, the feasible solution set accounts for various constraints due to
expected impacts. In a multi-contact situation of under-actuated legged robots
subject to multiple impacts, we also enforce standing stability margins. By
design, our controller does not require precise knowledge of impact location
and timing. We assessed our formalism with the humanoid robot HRP-4, generating
maximum contact velocities, neither breaking established contacts nor damaging

yet there is little tool support for analyzing these bugs. We present a method
based on differential performance analysis---we find inputs for which the
performance varies widely, despite having the same size. To ensure that the
differences in the performance are robust (i.e. hold also for large inputs), we
compare the performance of not only single inputs, but of classes of inputs,
where each class has similar inputs parameterized by their size. Thus, each
class is represented by a performance function from the input size to
performance. Importantly, we also provide an explanation for why the
performance differs in a form that can be readily used to fix a performance
bug.
  The two main phases in our method are discovery with fuzzing and explanation
with decision tree classifiers, each of which is supported by clustering.
First, we propose an evolutionary fuzzing algorithm to generate inputs. For
this fuzzing task, the unique challenge is that we not only need the input
class with the worst performance, but rather a set of classes exhibiting
differential performance. We use clustering to merge similar input classes
which significantly improves the efficiency of our fuzzer. Second, we explain
the differential performance in terms of program inputs and internals. We adapt
discriminant learning approaches with clustering and decision trees to localize
suspicious code regions.
  We applied our techniques to a set of applications. On a set of
micro-benchmarks, we show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art
fuzzers in finding inputs to characterize the differential performance. On a
set of case-studies, we discover and explain multiple performance bugs in
popular machine learning frameworks. Four of these bugs, reported first in this

Pressures subsequently increase due to thermal and rotational evolution of the

within a self-balancing tree. The tree is based on the ordering of elements,
which requires extra information to determine element placement, but it enables
significantly smaller proof sizes. This allows for much lower tree heights
(directed by the order of elements, not the size of the key), and therefore
creates smaller and more efficient proofs and operations. Additionally, the B
Merkle Tree is defined with subset queries that feature similar communication
costs to non-membership proofs. Our scheme has the potential to benefit

60 telescopes distributed over all the Italian territory; each telescope is
made of three MRPCs and allows to reconstruct the trajectory of cosmic muons
with high efficiency and optimal angular resolution. A distinctive feature of
the EEE network is that almost all telescopes are housed in High Schools and
managed by groups of students and teachers, who previously took care of their
construction at CERN. This peculiarity is a big plus for the experiment, which
combines the scientific relevance of its objectives with effective outreach
activities. The unconventional location of the detectors, mainly in standard

much longer than the acquiring the data. The most important reason for this is
that the model fitting, or ""inversion"", used to infer physical quantities from
the observations is extremely slow, because the underlying models are
numerically demanding. We aim to improve the speed of the inference by using a
neural network that relates input polarized spectra to the output physical
parameters. We first select a subset of the data to be interpreted and infer
physical quantities from corresponding spectra using a standard
minimization-based inversion code. Taking these results as reliable and
representative of the whole data set, we train a convolutional neural network
to connect the input polarized spectra to the output physical parameters
(nodes, in context of spectropolarimetric inversion). We then apply the neural
network to the various other data, previously unseen to the network. As a
check, we apply the referent inversion code to the unseen data and compare the
fit quality and the maps of the inferred parameters between the two inversions.
The physical parameters inferred by the neural network show excellent agreement
with the results from the inversion, and are obtained in a factor of $10^5$
less time. Additionally, substituting the results of the neural network back in
the forward model, shows excellent agreement between inferred and original
spectra. The method we present here is very simple for implementation and
extremely fast. It only requires a training data set, which can be obtained by
inverting a representative subset of the observed data. Applying these (and
similar) machine learning techniques will yield orders of magnitude
acceleration in the routine interpretation of spectropolarimetric data.

equilibrium and charge neutrality conditions in the framework of RBHF model.
Comparing to the conventional treatment, where the chemical potential of lepton
was approximately represented by the symmetry energy of nuclear matter, the
equation of state (EOS) of neutron star matter in the present self-consistent
calculation with pvCD-Bonn B has striking difference above the baryon number
density $n_b=0.55$ fm$^{-3}$. However, these differences influence the global
properties of neutron star only about $1\%\sim2\%$. Then, three two-body
potentials pvCD-Bonn A, B, C, with different tensor components, are
systematically applied in RBHF model to calculate the properties of neutron
star. It is found that the maximum masses of neutron star are around
$2.21\sim2.30M_\odot$ and the corresponding radii are $R =11.18\sim11.72$ km.
The radii of $1.4M_\odot$ neutron star are predicated as $R_{1.4} =

cluster gas is enriched to a universal metallicity prior to cluster formation,
with little to no evolution thereafter. The leverage provided by the high

atoms on an optical lattice is a significant achievement. Experiments have been
carried out in one, two, and three dimensions, and have also studied
anisotropic configurations with stronger tunneling in some lattice directions.
Such anisotropy is relevant to the physics of cuprate superconductors and other
strongly correlated materials. Moreover, this anisotropy might be harnessed to
enhance AF order. Here we numerically investigate, using Determinant Quantum
Monte Carlo, a simple realization of anisotropy in the 3D Hubbard model in
which the tunneling between planes, $t_\perp$, is unequal to the intraplane
tunneling $t$. This model interpolates between the three-dimensional isotropic
($t_\perp = t$) and two-dimensional ($t_\perp =0$) systems. We show that at
fixed interaction strength to tunneling ratio ($U/t$), anisotropy can enhance
the magnetic structure factor relative to both 2D and 3D results. However, this
enhancement occurs at interaction strengths below those for which the N\'eel
temperature $T_{\rm N\acute{e}el}$ is largest, in such a way that the structure
factor cannot be made to exceed its value in isotropic 3D systems at the
optimal $U/t$. We characterize the 2D-3D crossover in terms of the magnetic
structure factor, real space spin correlations, number of doubly-occupied
sites, and thermodynamic observables. An interesting implication of our results
stems from the entropy's dependence on anisotropy. As the system evolves from
3D to 2D, the entropy at a fixed temperature increases. Correspondingly, at
fixed entropy, the temperature will decrease going from 3D to 2D. This suggests
a cooling protocol in which the dimensionality is adiabatically changed from 3D
to 2D.

steps for updating the primal and dual variables alternatively at each

$\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-4} \right)$) iterations under
nonconvex-strongly concave (resp. nonconvex-concave) setting. Moreover, its
gradient complexity to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point of the
objective function is bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( \varepsilon ^{-2} \right)$

convex-nonconcave (resp., convex-nonconcave) setting. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time that a simple and unified single-loop

(strongly) convex-nonconcave minimax problems. Moreover, the complexity results
for solving the latter (strongly) convex-nonconcave minimax problems have never
been obtained before in the literature. Numerical results show the efficiency
of the proposed AGP algorithm. Furthermore, we extend the AGP algorithm by
presenting a block alternating proximal gradient (BAPG) algorithm for solving
more general multi-block nonsmooth nonconvex-(strongly) concave and (strongly)

  publication",,,,"math.ST cs.LG cs.NA math.NA math.PR stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion maps is a manifold learning algorithm widely used for
dimensionality reduction. Using a sample from a distribution, it approximates
the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of associated Laplace-Beltrami operators.
Theoretical bounds on the approximation error are however generally much weaker
than the rates that are seen in practice. This paper uses new approaches to
improve the error bounds in the model case where the distribution is supported
on a hypertorus. For the data sampling (variance) component of the error we
make spatially localised compact embedding estimates on certain Hardy spaces;
we study the deterministic (bias) component as a perturbation of the
Laplace-Beltrami operator's associated PDE, and apply relevant spectral
stability results. Using these approaches, we match long-standing pointwise
error bounds for both the spectral data and the norm convergence of the
operator discretisation.
  We also introduce an alternative normalisation for diffusion maps based on
Sinkhorn weights. This normalisation approximates a Langevin diffusion on the
sample and yields a symmetric operator approximation. We prove that it has
better convergence compared with the standard normalisation on flat domains,
and present a highly efficient algorithm to compute the Sinkhorn weights.

However, the message exchange among AGVs and the ICS would experience large

Fast Failure Recovery(SD-FFR) mechanism, aiming to improve network reliability

failure occurs, the SDN controller actively detects the link failure within
milliseconds, and then reroutes the affected traffic flows accordingly. The

selecting routing paths when a new traffic flow joins or link failure occurs in
the network. The evaluation results show that network performance can be time
efficiently improved.

potentially useful side information into a penalized regression. The basic idea
is to translate the external information into different penalization strengths

covariate-dependent structures and study the risk properties of the resulting
estimator. To this, we generalize the state evolution framework recently
introduced for the analysis of the approximate message-passing algorithm to the
SA-Enet framework. We show that the finite sample risk of the SA-Enet estimator
is consistent with the theoretical risk predicted by the state evolution

confirmed in our numerical studies. We also demonstrate the usefulness and the

decision-making by providing coherent forecasts at different aggregation
levels. Traditional hierarchical forecasting approaches, such as the bottom-up
and top-down methods, focus on a particular aggregation level to anchor the
forecasts. During the past decades, these have been replaced by a variety of
linear combination approaches that exploit information from the complete
hierarchy to produce more accurate forecasts. However, the performance of these
combination methods depends on the particularities of the examined series and
their relationships. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical forecasting
approach based on machine learning that deals with these limitations in three
important ways. First, the proposed method allows for a non-linear combination
of the base forecasts, thus being more general than the linear approaches.
Second, it structurally combines the objectives of improved post-sample
empirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Finally, due to its non-linear
nature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and
automated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for
producing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method
is evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets
coming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the
proposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches,
especially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by
the same patterns.

The flavour anomaly is explained from new physics contribution by introducing
one generation of heavy quark and heavy lepton which are vector-like under the
standard model (SM) gauge group but charged under a local $U(1)_X$ group. They
mix with the SM quarks and leptons, inducing flavour-changing $Z^\prime$
couplings, which generates the $b \to s \mu^+\mu^-$ anomaly at tree level. On
the other hand the new fermions are chiral under the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ)
symmetry. The pseudo-Goldstone boson coming from the spontaneous breaking of
the PQ symmetry becomes an axion, solving the strong CP problem and providing a
cold dark matter candidate. The same symmetry prevents the right-handed
neutrino from having a Majorana mass term. But the introduction of a
neutrino-specific Higgs doublet allows neutrino to have Dirac mass term without
fine-tuning problem. The model shows an interplay between axion, neutrino, dark
matter, and flavour physics.

well as weights. Partly motivated by the recent study on tight Euclidean
$t$-designs on two concentric spheres, in this paper we discuss tight relative

must have only integral simple zeros. The Terwilliger algebra is the main tool
to establish these results. By explicitly evaluating the behavior of the zeros

For DMRG to be conveniently used in different problems described by different
Hamiltonians, in this work we propose a new generic algorithm to construct the
MPO of an arbitrary operator with a sum-of-products form based on the bipartite
graph theory. We show that the method has the following advantages: (i) It is
automatic in that only the definition of the operator is required; (ii) It is
symbolic thus free of any numerical error; (iii) The complementary operator
technique can be fully employed so that the resulting MPO is globally optimal
for any given order of degrees of freedom; (iv) The symmetry of the system
could be fully employed to reduce the dimension of MPO. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the new algorithm, the MPOs of Hamiltonians ranging from the
prototypical spin-boson model and Holstein model to the more complicated ab
initio electronic Hamiltonian and the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian with
sextic force field are constructed. It is found that for the former three
cases, our automatic algorithm can reproduce exactly the same MPOs as the
optimally hand-crafted ones already known in the literature.

  Generation",,,"10.1109/TPWRS.2020.3033468",,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental mechanism of transient stability of the conventional power
system can be physically understood with the rotor swing dynamics of
synchronous generators (SGs). The basic factor affecting the transient
stability is the power-angle relationship among the SGs. The integration of a
large number of inverter-based generations (IBGs) into the power system
inevitably changes the original power-angle relationship, therefore leading to
a more complicated transient stability mechanism. In this letter, the impact of
IBG on the power system transient stability is analytically investigated. It is
shown that the connection of IBG changes the original power-angle relationship
into a nonsinusoidal curve, introduces a limit on the peak of the rotor swing,
and therefore brings about a new bottleneck for the transient stability.

expressions derived for the aforementioned generic planar setup into simple and
concise expressions representing a QE mediated by a symmetric MNP

generalized nonlocal optical response (GNOR) theory that has successfully
explained plasmonic experiments to model the MNPs in our system. Due to the use
of GNOR theory, and our analytical approach, the procedure we suggest is
extremely computationally efficient. Using the derived model, we analyse the
absorption rate, resultant Rabi frequency, effective excitonic energy shift and
dephasing rate shift spectra of an exciton bearing QE at the centre of a
symmetric MNP setup. We observe that the QE experiences plasmon induced
absorption rate spectral linewidth variations that increase in magnitude with
decreasing MNP-QE centre separation and increasing number of MNPs. Our results
also suggest that, parameter regions where the QE exhibits trends of decreasing
linewidth against decreasing MNP-QE centre separation are likely to be
associated with plasmon induced excitonic energy redshifts. Similarly, regions
where the QE absorption rate linewidth tends to increase against decreasing MNP
QE centre separation are likely to be accompanied by plasmon induced excitonic
energy blueshifts. In both these cases, the magnitude of the observed
red/blueshift was seen to increase with the number of MNPs in the
constellation, due to enhancement of the plasmonic influence.

gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) can originate from binary neutron star mergers.
Moreover, some SGRBs could be detected off-axis, while the SGRB jets are highly
structured. Then, by assuming an universal angular distribution of the jet
emission for all SGRBs, we re-produce the flux and redshift distributions of
the cosmological SGRBs detected by {\it Swift} and {\it Fermi}. For
self-consistency, this angular distribution is simultaneously constrained by
the luminosity and event rate of GRB 170817A. As a result, it is found that the
universal jet structure of SGRBs could approximately have a two-Gaussian
profile. Meanwhile, the intrinsic luminosity function (LF) of the on-axis
emission of the jets can be simply described by a single power law with a
low-luminosity exponential cutoff. The usually discovered broken-power-law
apparent LF for relatively high luminosities can naturally result from the
coupling of the intrinsic LF with the angular distribution of the jet emission,
as the viewing angles to the SGRBs are arbitrarily distributed.

large spin contribution k_xx^sp in k_xx. We also find clear thermal Hall
signals in the spin liquid phase in all Cd-K samples. The magnitude of the
thermal Hall conductivity k_xy shows a significant dependence on the sample's
scattering time. On the other hand, the temperature dependence of k_xy is
similar in all Cd-K samples; k_xy shows a peak at almost the same temperature
of the peak of the phonon thermal conductivity k_xy^ph which is estimated by
k_xx at 15 T. These results indicate the presence of a dominant phonon thermal
Hall k_xy^ph at 15 T. In addition to k_xy^ph, we find that the field dependence
of k_xy at low fields turns out to be non-linear at low temperatures,
concomitantly with the appearance of the field suppression of k_xx, indicating
the presence of a spin thermal Hall k_xy^sp at low fields. Remarkably, by
assembling the k_xx dependene of k_xy^sp data of other kagome antiferromagnets,
we find that, whereas k_xy^sp stays a constant in the low-k_xx region, k_xy^sp
starts to increase as k_xx does in the high-k_xx region. This k_xx dependence
of k_xy^sp indicates the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in
the spin thermal Hall effect in kagome antiferromagnets. Furthermore, both
k_xy^ph and k_xy^sp disappear in the antiferromagnetic ordered phase at low
fields, showing that phonons alone do not exhibit the thermal Hall effect. A
high field above ~7 T induces k_xy^ph, concomitantly with a field-induced
increase of k_xx and the specific heat, suggesting a coupling of the phonons to
the field-induced spin excitations as the origin of k_xy^ph.

games of finite-fuel capacity expansion with singular controls and their
mean-field game (MFG) counterpart. We construct a solution of the MFG via a
simple iterative scheme that produces an optimal control in terms of a
Skorokhod reflection at a (state-dependent) surface that splits the state space
into action and inaction regions. We then show that a solution of the MFG of
capacity expansion induces approximate Nash equilibria for the $N$-player games

Our analysis relies entirely on probabilistic methods and extends the
well-known connection between singular stochastic control and optimal stopping
to a mean-field framework.

numeric values, have long been recognized as a very desirable extension of
description logics (DLs), and significant efforts have been invested into
adding them to usual DLs while keeping the complexity of reasoning in check.
For expressive DLs and in the presence of general TBoxes, for standard
reasoning tasks like consistency, the most general decidability results are for
the so-called $\omega$-admissible domains, which are required to be dense.
Supporting non-dense domains for features that range over integers or natural
numbers remained largely open, despite often being singled out as a highly
desirable extension. The decidability of some extensions of $\mathcal{ALC}$
with non-dense domains has been shown, but existing results rely on powerful
machinery that does not allow to infer any elementary bounds on the complexity
of the problem. In this paper, we study an extension of $\mathcal{ALC}$ with a
rich integer domain that allows for comparisons (between features, and between
features and constants coded in unary), and prove that consistency can be
solved using automata-theoretic techniques in single exponential time, and thus
has no higher worst-case complexity than standard $\mathcal{ALC}$. Our upper
bounds apply to some extensions of DLs with concrete domains known from the
literature, support general TBoxes, and allow for comparing values along paths
of ordinary (not necessarily functional) roles.

L^2(\Omega(t),\mathbb{C})\longrightarrow L^2(\Omega_0,\mathbb{C})$. We show
that the conjugation by $h^\sharp$ provides a newequation of the form

In addition, it also indicates that the correct Neumann type boundary
conditions for \eqref{eq_abstract} are not the homogeneous but the magnetic
ones$$\partial_\nu u(t)+i\langle\nu| A\rangle u(t)=0,$$even though

studied in presence of diffusion coefficients as well as magnetic and electric

investigate this issue, we run simulations of a kiloparsec cube section of a
galaxy with three kinds of stellar feedback: the formation of HII regions, the
explosion of supernovae, and the UV heating. We show that stellar feedback is
sufficient to reduce the averaged star formation rate (SFR) to the level of the
Schmidt- Kennicutt law in Milky-Way like galaxies but not in high-redshift gas
rich galaxies suggesting that another type of support should be added. We
investigate whether an external driving of the turbulence such as the one
created by the large galactic scales could diminish the SFR at the observed
level. Assuming that the Toomre parameter is close to 1 as suggested by the
observations, we infer a typical turbulent forcing that we argue should be
applied parallel to the plane of the galactic disc. When this forcing is
applied in our simulations, the SFR within our simulations closely follows the
Schmidt- Kennicutt relation. We found that the velocity dispersion is strongly
anisotropic with the velocity dispersion alongside the galactic plane being up
to 10 times larger than the perpendicular velocity.

controller (MPC) for controlling variable speed hydropower (VSHP) plants. The
MPC coordinates the turbine controller with the virtual synchronous generator
(VSG) control of the power electronics converter to optimize the plant's
performance. The main objective is to deliver a fast power response to
frequency deviations by utilizing the kinetic energy of the turbine and
generator. This is made possible by allowing the turbine rotational speed to
deviate temporarily from its optimal speed. In addition, the efficiency should
be maximized while keeping the electric and hydraulic variables within their
constraints. The simulation results show that the proposed MPC is also able to
damp power oscillations in the grid, reduce water hammering in the penstock and
improve the future estimation of turbine head, turbine power and turbine flow.
This ensures that the turbine head does not exceed its limits and that the
overshoot in the turbine speed after a disturbance is reduced. Besides, the VSG
converter control enables a fast power response by utilizing the rotational
energy of the turbine and generator. Thereby, the VSHP can provide a
significant amount of fast frequency reserves (FFR) to the grid.

Moreover, the EE-maximization problem is solved by an alternating algorithm

number of hyper-parameters to be set may lead to errors if they are set
manually. The state-of-the-art hyper-parameters tuning methods are grid search,
random search, and Bayesian Optimization. The first two methods are expensive
because they try, respectively, all possible combinations and random
combinations of hyper-parameters. Bayesian Optimization, instead, builds a
surrogate model of the objective function, quantifies the uncertainty in the
surrogate using Gaussian Process Regression and uses an acquisition function to
decide where to sample the new set of hyper-parameters. This work faces the
field of Hyper-Parameters Optimization (HPO). The aim is to improve Bayesian
Optimization applied to Deep Neural Networks. For this goal, we build a new
algorithm for evaluating and analyzing the results of the network on the

giant branch stars, in agreement with other recent work. The probability for a
star to be lithium-rich is affected by a number of factors, though the
causality in those correlations is not entirely clear. We show for the first
time that primary and secondary red clump stars have distinctly different
lithium enrichment patterns. The data set discussed here is large and

124, 181101 (2020)], a topological argument was applied for the four
dimensional stationary, axi-symmetric, asymptotically flat black hole, and the
result indicates that at least, there exists one standard light ring outside
the black hole horizon for each rotation sense. Inspired by it, in this paper,
we would like to consider a similar issue for a nonrotating, static,
spherically symmetric black hole not only with asymptotically flat behavior,
but also with AdS and dS behaviors. Following Duan's topological current
$\phi$-mapping theory, the topological current and charge for the photon
spheres are introduced. The topological current is nonzero only at the zero
point of the vector field determining the location of the photon sphere. So
each photon sphere can be assigned a topological charge. Considering the full
exterior region, we find the total topological charge always equals -1. This
result confirms that there exists at least one standard photon sphere outside
of the black hole not only in asymptotically flat spacetime, but also in
asymptotically AdS and dS spacetime. Then we apply the study to the dyonic
black holes. We observe that even when more photon spheres are included, the
total topological charge stays unchanged. Moreover, for a naked singularity, it
has a vanishing topological charge, indicating that the black hole and naked
singularity are in different topological classes. It is expected that this
novel topological argument could provide an insightful idea on the study of the
black hole photon spheres or light rings, and further cast new light on the
black hole astronomical phenomena.

Utilising dual frequency combs as active illumination sources, hyperspectral
imaging with ultra-high spectral resolution can be implemented in a scan-free
manner when a detector array is used for heterodyne detection. However, relying
on low-noise detector arrays, this approach is currently limited to the
near-infrared regime. Here, we show that dual-comb hyperspectral imaging can be
performed with an uncooled near-to-mid-infrared detector by exploiting the
detector array's high frame-rate and the combs' high-mutual coherence. The
system simultaneously acquires hyperspectral data in 30~spectral channels
across 16'384 pixel, from which molecule-specific gas concentration images can
be derived. Artificial intelligence enables rapid data reduction and real-time
image reconstruction. Owing to the detector array's sensitivity from 1~$\mu$m
to 5~$\mu$m wavelength, this demonstration lays the foundation for versatile
imaging of molecular fingerprint signatures across the infrared
wavelength-regime in real-time.

in the presence of a magnetic field is exactly known and shows first and second
order chiral symmetry restoration transitions and a critical point. Here we
extend this phase diagram to imaginary chemical potential to seek structure at
small real mu and imaginary mu that help to reconstruct the large real mu phase
structure. We also explore a phenomenologically deformed version of the theory
where the critical point can be moved into the imaginary chemical potential
plane. In particular we observe that when the transition is second order in
these theories there are naturally two distinct transitions - one for the onset
of density and one for chiral symmetry restoration. In addition, the phase
diagram has boundaries of regions where metastable vacua exist and these
boundaries, as well as the phase boundaries, converge at the critical point.
These observations may point to techniques for the study of the QCD critical

the problem becomes much more challenging when the environment changes. In
fact, if the timescale of the change is comparable to the delay, it is
impossible to learn about the environment, since the available observations are

signals are available without delay, such that given those signals, the
long-term behavior of the system is stationary. To model this situation, we
introduce the problem of stochastic, non-stationary, delayed bandits with

Polarimeter from 2000 to 2010 are analyzed with a running smooth technique. We
find that the impulsive component (with a variation timescale shorter than 1
second) of 1 GHz emission of most flares peaks at a few tens of solar flux unit
and lasts for about 1 minute and the impulsive component of 2 GHz emission
lasts a shorter period and peaks at a lower flux level, while at the three high
frequency channels the occurrence frequency of flares increases with the
decrease of the flux density up to the noise level of the corresponding
background. The gradual components of these emissions, however, have similar
duration and peak flux density distributions. We also derive the power spectrum
on different timescales and a normalized wavelet analysis is used to confirm
features on short timescales. At a time resolution of 0.1 second, more than
$\sim$ 60$\%$ of these radio light curves show significant flux variation on 1

processes are universal in solar flares. We also study the correlation between
the impulsive radio flux densities and soft X-ray fluxes obtained with the GOES

soft X-ray fluxes and this fraction increases with the radio frequency.

variations (TTVs). We used the archival Kepler photometry of Kepler-160 to
search for additional transiting planets using a combination of our Wotan
detrending algorithm and our transit least-squares (TLS) detection algorithm.
We also used the Mercury N-body gravity code to study the orbital dynamics of
the system. First, we recovered the known transit series of planets Kepler-160
b and c. Then we found a new transiting candidate with a radius of 1.91 (+0.17,
-0.14) Earth radii (R_ear), an orbital period of 378.417 (+0.028, -0.025) d,
and Earth-like insolation. The vespa software predicts that this signal has an
astrophysical false-positive probability of FPP_3 = 1.8e-3 when the
multiplicity of the system is taken into account. Kepler vetting diagnostics
yield a multiple event statistic of MES = 10.7, which corresponds to an ~85 %
reliability against false alarms due to instrumental artifacts such as rolling
bands. We are also able to explain the observed TTVs of planet c with the
presence of a previously unknown planet. The period and mass of this new
planet, however, do not match the period and mass of the new transit candidate.
Our Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of the TTVs of Kepler-160 c can be
conclusively explained by a new nontransiting planet with a mass between about
1 and 100 Earth masses and an orbital period between about 7 and 50 d. We
conclude that Kepler-160 has at least three planets, one of which is the
nontransiting planet Kepler-160 d. The expected stellar radial velocity

resource management. Specifically, deciding the response over months or several
months requires accurate long-term forecasts which is particularly challenging
as the model errors accumulate with time. A critical factor that can hinder
accurate long-term forecasts, is the number of unreported/asymptomatic cases.
While there have been early serology tests to estimate this number, more tests
need to be conducted for more reliable results. To identify the number of
unreported/asymptomatic cases, we take an epidemiology data-driven approach. We
show that we can identify lower bounds on this ratio or upper bound on actual
cases as a factor of reported cases. To do so, we propose an extension of our
prior heterogeneous infection rate model, incorporating unreported/asymptomatic
cases. We prove that the number of unreported cases can be reliably estimated
only from a certain time period of the epidemic data. In doing so, we construct
an algorithm called Fixed Infection Rate method, which identifies a reliable
bound on the learned ratio. We also propose two heuristics to learn this ratio
and show their effectiveness on simulated data. We use our approaches to
identify the upper bounds on the ratio of actual to reported cases for New York
City and several US states. Our results demonstrate with high confidence that
the actual number of cases cannot be more than 35 times in New York, 40 times

attractive surface-surface forces between a periodic (2+1)-dimensional
solid-on-solid (SOS) crystal surface and a confining flat surface. The
repulsive interaction is derived from the theory of electric double-layers, and
the attractive interactions are Van der Waals interactions between particles on
the SOS surface and the confining surface. The confinement is induced by a
constant external pressure normal to the surfaces which is in mechanical
equilibrium with the surface-surface forces. The system is in thermal
equilibrium, and particles can deposit to and dissolve from the SOS surface.
The size of stable contacts formed between the surfaces in chemical equilibrium
show a non-trivial dependency on the external pressure which is
phenomenologically similar to the dependency of oscillatory hydration forces on
the surface-surface separation. As contacts form we find classical phenomena
such as Ostwald ripening, coalescence, and primary and secondary nucleation
stages. We find contacts shaped as islands, bands or pits, depending solely on
the contact size relative to the system size. We also find the model to behave
well out of chemical equilibrium. The model is relevant for understanding

pollutants in the air we breathe. The air quality, which is degrading rapidly
across the globe, has been a source of great concern. Across the globe,
governments are taking various measures to reduce air pollution. Bringing
awareness about environmental pollution among the public plays a major role in
controlling air pollution, as the programs proposed by governments require the
support of the public. Though information on air quality is present on multiple
portals such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), which provides Air
Quality Index that could be accessed by the public. However, such portals are
scarcely visited by the general public. Visualizing air quality in the location
where an individual resides could help in bringing awareness among the public.
This visualization could be rendered using Augmented Reality techniques.
Considering the widespread usage of Android based mobile devices in India, and
the importance of air quality visualization, we present AiR, as an Android
based mobile application. AiR considers the air quality measured by CPCB, in a
locality that is detected by the user's GPS or in a locality of user's choice,
and visualizes various air pollutants present in the locality $(PM_1{}_0,
PM_2{}_.{}_5, NO_2, SO_2, CO, O_3 \& NH_3)$ and displays them in the user's
surroundings. AiR also creates awareness in an interactive manner about the
different pollutants, sources, and their impacts on health.

supernova progenitors stochastic spin-up by internal gravity waves (IGWs)
during the late burning stages can impart enough angular momentum to the core
to result in neutron star birth spin periods below 100ms, and a relatively firm
upper limit of 500ms for the spin period. We here investigate this process
using a 3D simulation of oxygen shell burning in a $3M_\odot$ He star. Our
model indicates that stochastic spin-up by IGWs is less efficient than
previously thought. We find that the stochastic angular momentum flux carried
by waves excited at the shell boundary is significantly smaller for a given
convective luminosity and turnover time than would be expected from simple
dimensional analysis. This can be explained by noting that the waves launched
by overshooting convective plumes contain modes of opposite angular wave number
with similar amplitudes, so that the net angular momentum of excited wave
packets almost cancels. We find that the wave-mediated angular momentum flux
from the oxygen shell follows a random walk, but again dimensional analysis
overestimates the random walk amplitudes since the correlation time is only a
fraction of the convective turnover time. Extrapolating our findings over the
entire life time of the last burning stages prior to collapse, we predict that
the core angular momentum from stochastic spin-up would translate into long
birth spin periods of several seconds for low-mass progenitors and no less than
100ms even for high-mass progenitors.

answer higher-order moment of relevant bosonic field operators are first
obtained for rPAQS and tPSQS, and subsequently the same is used to study the
higher-order nonclassical properties of the corresponding states. A few
witnesses of higher-order nonclassicality (e.g. Higher-Order Antibunching,
Higher-Order Squeezing of Hillery type, Higher-Order sub-Poissonian Photon

volumes of the negative part of Wigner function (nonclassical volume) of rPAQS

also reported which can be obtained experimentally and used to produce Wigner

The minimum is determined using a steepest descent, where an adjoint

fluid mechanics for this problem are nonlinear, multiple local minima could
exist. Exploiting the quadratic nature of the objective function and the
constraining differential equations, we derive and apply a ""spectral condition""

states that the optimum is global if the Hessian of the Lagrangian in the state

states show no short-term flux - photon index correlation typical for the four
other states, implying a lack of interaction between the plasma and accretion

at the ISOLDE Decay Station at ISOLDE, CERN. The $\alpha$ decay from the

half-life of $3.4^{+0.5}_{-0.4}$ s was determined. Based on the $\alpha$-decay
energy, the relative positions of the long-lived states were fixed, with the
$(2^-)$ state as the ground state, the $7^{(+)}$ state at 77(56)~keV and the
$10^{(-)}$ state at 451(56) keV. The level scheme of the internal decay of the
$^{186}$Tl($10^{(-)}$) state ($T_{1/2} = 3.40(9)$ s), which was known to decay
solely through emission of 374 keV $\gamma$-ray transition, was extended and a
lower-limit for the $\beta$-decay branching $b_\beta > 5.9(3)\%$ was
determined. The extracted retardation factors for the $\gamma$ decay of the
$10^{(-)}$ state were compared to the available data in neighboring odd-odd
thallium isotopes indicating the importance of the $\pi d_{3/2}$ shell in the
isomeric decay and significant structure differences between $^{184}$Tl and

features suggesting similar geodynamic processes of crustal differentiation on
Earth and Mars. There also exist several evidences, based on geographic
features resembling ancient shorelines, for existence of an ancient martian
ocean in the northern hemisphere which covers nearly one third of the planet's
surface. However, the interpretation of some features as ancient shorelines has
been thoroughly challenged that left the existence of a primordial martian
ocean controversial. Moreover, if oceans were formerly present on Mars, there
is still a big ambiguity about the volume of water with the estimations ranging
over $4$ orders of magnitude. Here we map the martian sea level problem onto a
percolation model that provides strong evidence that the longest iso-height
line on Mars that separates the northern and southern hemispheres, acts as a
critical level height with divergent correlation length and plays the same role
as the present mean sea level does on Earth. Our results unravel remarkable

Expectation-Maximization procedure in order to estimate the distribution of
these intensities at all scales. This provides, as validated on various
numerical examples, a simple framework to estimate the scaling laws and
therefore the multifractal properties for this class of spatial point

notably allows us to compute the statistical moments associated with the
spatial distribution of annual likelihood of fire event occurence. We show that
for each order $q$, these moments display a well defined scaling behavior with
a non-linear spectrum of scaling exponents $\zeta_q$. From our study, it thus
appears that the spatial distribution of the widlfire ignition annual risk can
be described by a non-trivial, multifractal singularity spectrum and that this
risk cannot be reduced to providing a number of events per $km^2$. Our analysis
is confirmed by a direct spatial correlation estimation of the intensity
logarithms whose the peculiar slowly decreasing shape corresponds to the
hallmark of multifractal cascades. The multifractal features appear to be
constant over time and similar over the three regions that are studied.

investigates a critical trade-off among the computation cost of the on-device

(1) model split point selection to determine the on-device model, (2)
communication-aware model compression to reduce the on-device computation and
the resulting communication overhead simultaneously, and (3) task-oriented
encoding of the intermediate feature to further reduce the communication
overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves a better

travel distance for a given amount of stored energy in the traction battery. To
achieve this, a combined control and design problem has to be solved which
results in a non-convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program. To solve this design
task more efficiently, we present a new systematic optimization approach that
leads to a convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program. The solution process is
based on a combination of Geometric Programming and a Benders decomposition.
The benefits of this approach are a fast solution time, a global convergence,
and the ability to derive local sensitivities in the optimal design point with
no extra cost, as they are computed in the optimization procedure by solving a
dual problem. The presented approach is suitable for the evaluation of a
complete driving cycle, as this is commonly done in powertrain system design,
or for usage in a stochastic approach, where multiple scenarios are sampled
from a given probability density function. The latter is useful, to account for
the uncertainty in the driving behavior to generate solutions that are optimal

the powertrain model we use a transmission model with up to two selectable

model a continuously variable transmission to show beneficial energy savings

and distrust toward science and mainstream journalism, without these users
being conscious of their role. Gab is well known to be an extremist-friendly
platform that performs little control on the posted content. Thus it represents
an ideal benchmark for studying phenomena potentially related to polarization
such as misinformation spreading. The combination of these factors may lead to
hate as well as to episodes of harm in the real world. In this work we provide
a characterization of the interaction patterns within Gab around the COVID-19
topic. To assess the spreading of different content type, we analyze
consumption patterns based on both interaction type and source reliability.
Overall we find that there are no strong statistical differences in the social
response to questionable and reliable content, both following a power law
distribution. However, questionable and reliable sources display structural and
topical differences in the use of hashtags. The commenting behaviour of users
in terms of both lifetime and sentiment reveals that questionable and reliable
posts are perceived in the same manner. We can conclude that despite evident
differences between questionable and reliable posts Gab users do not perform
such a differentiation thus treating them as a whole. Our results provide
insights toward the understanding of coordinated inauthentic behavior and on
the early-warning of information operation.

finiteness of the class $\mathcal{P}^{\mathrm{fin}}_\infty$ (of finitely

sufficient condition for validity of finitistic dimension conjectures.
Motivated by the fact that finitistic dimensions of an algebra can
alternatively be computed by Gorenstein projective dimension, in this work we
examine the Gorenstein counterpart of Auslander--Reiten condition, namely
contravariant finiteness of the class $\mathcal{GP}^{\mathrm{fin}}_\infty$ (of
finitely generated modules of finite Gorenstein projective dimension), and its
relation to validity of finitistic dimension conjectures. It is proved that
contravariant finiteness of the class $\mathcal{GP}^{\mathrm{fin}}_\infty$
implies validity of the second finitistic dimension conjecture over left
artinian rings. In the more special setting of Artin algebras, however, it is
proved that the Auslander--Reiten sufficient condition and its Gorenstein
counterpart are virtually equivalent in the sense that contravariant finiteness
of the class $\mathcal{GP}^{\mathrm{fin}}_\infty$ implies contravariant
finiteness of the class $\mathcal{P}^{\mathrm{fin}}_\infty$ over any Artin
algebra, and the converse holds for Artin algebras over which the class

therapeutic protocol followed by the young patients and provides modules to

nonspecific repulsive interactions between the enzyme and the substrate cause
the enzyme to accumulate in regions of low substrate concentration. Reactions
then amplify local substrate fluctuations, causing enzymes to further
accumulate where substrate is low. Experimental analysis of this pattern

  We first show that the distribution of $\Omega$ can be generally obtained
from an infinite linear differential system. When further assuming that the
batch size has a geometric distribution with given parameter $q \in [0,1[$,
this differential system is further analyzed by means of an associated
bivariate generating function $(x,u,v) \mapsto E(x,u,v)$. Specifically,
denoting by $s \mapsto E^*(s,u,v)$ the one-sided Laplace transform of
$E(\cdot,u,v)$ and defining $$ \Phi(s,u,v) = P(s,u) \, (1-v) \, F^*(s,u,uv),
\quad 0 < \vert u \vert < 1, \, \vert v \vert < 1, $$ for some known polynomial
$P(s,u)$ and where $$ F^*(s,u,v) = \frac{E^*(s,u,v)-E^*(s,q,v)}{u-q}, $$ we
show that the function $\Phi$ verifies an inhomogeneous linear partial
differential equation (PDE) $$ \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial u} - \left [
\frac{u - q}{P(s,u)} \right ] v(1-v) \, \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial v} +
\ell(s,u,v) = 0 $$ for given $s$, where the last term $\ell(s,u,v)$ involves
both $E^*(s,q,v)$ and the first order derivative $\partial E^*(s,q,v)/\partial
v$ at the boundary point $u = q$. Solving this PDE for $\Phi$ via its
characteristic curves and with the required analyticity properties eventually
determines the one-sided Laplace transform $E^*$.
  By means of a Laplace inversion of this transform $E^*$, the distribution
function of the sojourn time $\Omega$ of a batch is then given in an integral
form. The tail behavior of the distribution of sojourn time $\Omega$ is finally
derived.

approximately solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) and
most of the numerical approximation methods for PDEs in the scientific
literature suffer from the so-called curse of dimensionality in the sense that
the number of computational operations employed in the corresponding
approximation scheme to obtain an approximation precision $\varepsilon>0$ grows
exponentially in the PDE dimension and/or the reciprocal of $\varepsilon$.
Recently, certain deep learning based approximation methods for PDEs have been
proposed and various numerical simulations for such methods suggest that deep
neural network (DNN) approximations might have the capacity to indeed overcome
the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of real parameters
used to describe the approximating DNNs grows at most polynomially in both the
PDE dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy
$\varepsilon>0$. There are now also a few rigorous results in the scientific
literature which substantiate this conjecture by proving that DNNs overcome the
curse of dimensionality in approximating solutions of PDEs. Each of these
results establishes that DNNs overcome the curse of dimensionality in
approximating suitable PDE solutions at a fixed time point $T>0$ and on a
compact cube $[a,b]^d$ in space but none of these results provides an answer to
the question whether the entire PDE solution on $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ can be
approximated by DNNs without the curse of dimensionality. It is precisely the
subject of this article to overcome this issue. More specifically, the main
result of this work in particular proves for every $a\in\mathbb{R}$, $ b\in
(a,\infty)$ that solutions of certain Kolmogorov PDEs can be approximated by
DNNs on the space-time region $[0,T]\times [a,b]^d$ without the curse of

(mmWave) massive multi-input-multi-ouput (MIMO) has been a promising approach
for improved coverage and throughput. Most existing work assumes the ideal
channel estimation, which can be challenging due to the high-dimensional
cascaded MIMO channels and passive reflecting elements. Therefore, this paper
proposes a deep denoising neural network assisted compressive channel
estimation for mmWave IRS systems to reduce the training overhead.
Specifically, we first introduce a hybrid passive/active IRS architecture,
where very few receive chains are employed to estimate the uplink user-to-IRS
channels. At the channel training stage, only a small proportion of elements
will be successively activated to sound the partial channels. Moreover, the
complete channel matrix can be reconstructed from the limited measurements
based on compressive sensing, whereby the common sparsity of angular domain
mmWave MIMO channels among different subcarriers is leveraged for improved
accuracy. Besides, a complex-valued denoising convolution neural network
(CV-DnCNN) is further proposed for enhanced performance. Simulation results
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed solution over state-of-the-art
solutions.

for the evaluation of the transparent materials. Ultrashort pump laser pulses
via optoacoustic conversion launch in the sample picosecond coherent acoustic
pulses. The time-delayed ultrashort probe laser pulses monitor the propagation
of the coherent acoustic pulses via photo-elastic effect, which induces light
scattering. A photodetector collects acoustically scattered light and the probe
light reflected by the sample structure for the heterodyning. The scattered
probe light carriers the information on the acoustical, optical and
acousto-optical parameters of the material in the current position of the
coherent acoustic pulse. Thus, among other applications, the time-domain
Brillouin scattering is a technique for three-dimensional imaging. Sharp
focusing of the coherent acoustic pulses and probe laser pulses could increase
lateral spatial resolution of imaging, but could potentially diminish the depth
of imaging. However, the theoretical analysis presented in this manuscript
contra-intuitively demonstrates that the depth and spectral resolution of the
time-domain Brillouin scattering imaging, with collinearly propagating paraxial
sound and light beams, do not depend at all on the focusing/diffraction of
sound. The variations of the amplitude of the time-domain Brillouin scattering
signal are only due to the variations of the probe light amplitude caused by
light focusing/diffraction. Although the amplitude of the acoustically
scattered light is proportional to the product of the local acoustical and
probe light field amplitudes the temporal dynamics of the time-domain Brillouin
scattering signal amplitude is independent of the dynamics of the coherent
acoustic pulse amplitude.

fullerene cages form stable dimer structures and symmetrical sized fullerene
dimers are found more stable than asymmetrical sized dimers. The dimerization
of fullerene cages in different modes leads to change in their magnetic
properties. The non-magnetic fullerene cages become magnetic after formation of
dimer (C20-C20, C24-C24, C32-C32, C40-C40, C20-C24, C40-C44 and

  Reinforcement Learning","AAAI-21",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In value-based reinforcement learning (RL), unlike in supervised learning,
the agent faces not a single, stationary, approximation problem, but a sequence
of value prediction problems. Each time the policy improves, the nature of the
problem changes, shifting both the distribution of states and their values. In
this paper we take a novel perspective, arguing that the value prediction
problems faced by an RL agent should not be addressed in isolation, but rather
as a single, holistic, prediction problem. An RL algorithm generates a sequence
of policies that, at least approximately, improve towards the optimal policy.
We explicitly characterize the associated sequence of value functions and call
it the value-improvement path. Our main idea is to approximate the
value-improvement path holistically, rather than to solely track the value
function of the current policy. Specifically, we discuss the impact that this
holistic view of RL has on representation learning. We demonstrate that a
representation that spans the past value-improvement path will also provide an
accurate value approximation for future policy improvements. We use this
insight to better understand existing approaches to auxiliary tasks and to
propose new ones. To test our hypothesis empirically, we augmented a standard
deep RL agent with an auxiliary task of learning the value-improvement path. In

with much focus awarded to generalising Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to
graph data. CNNs are typically realised by alternating convolutional and
pooling layers where the pooling layers subsample the grid and exchange spatial
or temporal resolution for increased feature dimensionality. Whereas the
generalised convolution operator for graphs has been studied extensively and
proven useful, hierarchical coarsening of graphs is still challenging since
nodes in graphs have no spatial locality and no natural order. This paper
proposes two main contributions, the first is a differential module calculating
structural similarity features based on the adjacency matrix. These structural
similarity features may be used with various algorithms however in this paper
the focus and the second main contribution is on integrating these features
with a revisited pooling layer DiffPool arXiv:1806.08804 to propose a pooling
layer referred to as SimPool. This is achieved by linking the concept of
network reduction by means of structural similarity in graphs with the concept
of hierarchical localised pooling. Experimental results demonstrate that as
part of an end-to-end Graph Neural Network architecture SimPool calculates node
cluster assignments that functionally resemble more to the locality preserving
pooling operations used by CNNs that operate on local receptive fields in the
standard grid. Furthermore the experimental results demonstrate that these
features are useful in inductive graph classification tasks with no increase to
the number of parameters.

tunable vacancies, that are located on the same (A-A type) or different (A-B

affect the location of the main bonding and anti-bonding molecular collapse
peaks, (2) but shifts the position of the satellite peaks, because they are a
consequence of the breaking of the local sublattice symmetry, and (3) there are
vacancy characteristic collapse peaks that only occur for A-B type vacancies,
which can be employed to distinguish them experimentally from the A-A type. As
the charge, energy, and separation distance increase, the additional collapse
features merge with the main molecular collapse peaks. We show that the spatial
distribution around the vacancy site of the collapse states allows us to
differentiate the molecular from the frustrated collapse.

large hyperfragment yields are obvious with the attractive potential. The

ejections (ICMEs), as well as other interplanetary transients, are Forbush
decreases (FDs), i.e. short-term reductions in the galactic cosmic ray (GCR)
flux. A two-step FD is often regarded as a textbook example, which presumably
owes its specific morphology to the fact that the measuring instrument passed
through the ICME head-on, encountering first the shock front (if developed),
then the sheath and finally the CME magnetic structure. The interaction of GCRs
and the shock/sheath region, as well as the CME magnetic structure, occurs all
the way from Sun to Earth, therefore, FDs are expected to reflect the
evolutionary properties of CMEs and their sheaths. We apply modelling to
different ICME regions in order to obtain a generic two-step FD profile, which
qualitatively agrees with our current observation-based understanding of FDs.
We next adapt the models for energy dependence to enable comparison with
different GCR measurement instruments (as they measure in different particle
energy ranges). We test these modelling efforts against a set of
multi-spacecraft observations of the same event, using the Forbush decrease
model for the expanding flux rope (ForbMod). We find a reasonable agreement of
the ForbMod model for the GCR depression in the CME magnetic structure with
multi-spacecraft measurements, indicating that modelled FDs reflect well the
CME evolution.

nuclear transients. We detect radio emission in 12 out of 16 galaxies at a
level of >5sigma, corresponding to a detection rate of 75%. Such a high
detection is remarkably different from previous similar searches in stellar
tidal disruption events. The radio emission is compact and not resolved for the
majority of sources on scales of ~<0.5"" (<0.9 kpc at z<0.1). We find the
possibility of the star-formation contributing to the radio emission is low,
but an AGN origin remains a plausible scenario, especially for sources that
show evidence of AGN activity in their optical spectra. If the detections could
represent radio emission associated with nuclear transient phenomenon such as
jet or outflow, we use the blast wave model by analogy with the GRB afterglows
to describe the evolution of radio light curves. In this context, the
observations are consistent with a decelerating jet with an energy of
~10^{51-52} erg viewed at 30\degree-60\degree off-axis at later times,
suggesting that powerful jets may be ubiquitous among MIR-burst galaxies.
Future continuous monitoring observations will be crucial to decipher the

the design under a variety of circumstances. As wireless networks become more
complex, it is impractical to perform testing on a real deployment. As a
result, the network administrators rely on network simulators or network
emulators to validate their configurations and design. Unfortunately, network
simulation falls short per it requires users to model the network behavior
analytically. On the other hand, network emulation allows users to employ real
network applications on virtualized network devices. Despite their complex
design, the existing network emulation solutions miss full-scale automation
rather they rely on experienced users to write complex configuration scripts
making testing. Therefore, the validation process is prone to human operator
errors. Furthermore, they require a significant amount of computational
resources that might not be feasible for many users. Moreover, most network
emulators focus on lower layers of the network thus requiring users to employ
their own network applications to control and measure network performance. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a novel wireless network emulation
platform, the system, that provides users a unified, high-level configuration
interface for different layers of wireless networks to reduce management
complexities of network emulators while having a generic, fully-automated
platform. Menes is a generic, full-stack, fully-automated test and validation
platform that empowers existing state-of-the-art emulation, virtualization, and
network applications including performance measurement tools. We then provide
an implementation of Menes based on the EMANE with Docker. Our extensive
evaluations show that the system requires much less computing resources,
significantly decreases CAPEX and OPEX, and greatly extensible for different
use cases.

on the analysis of membrane vibrations induced by photon stimulations. Then,
based on the unique mathematical properties of the energy model and combined
with the gamma correction model, a new global lightness enhancement model is
proposed. Furthermore, a special relationship between image lightness and gamma

problem, without assuming an assumed energy function, would be the first step
in understanding the way nature has solved the packaging of chromosomes in
tight cellular spaces. We created a theory, based on polymer physics
characteristics of chromosomes and the maximum entropy principles, referred to
as HIPPS (Hi-C-Polymer-Physics-Structures) method, that allows us to calculate
the 3D structures solely from Hi-C contact maps. We created an ensemble of 3D
structures for the 23 chromosomes from lymphoblastoid cells using the measured
contact maps as inputs. The HIPPS method shows that conformations of
chromosomes are heterogeneous even in a single cell type. The differences in
the conformational heterogeneity of the same chromosome in different cell types
(normal as well as cancerous cells) can also be quantitatively discerned using
our theory. We validate the method by showing that the calculated volumes of
the 23 chromosomes from the predicted 3D structures are in good agreement with
experimental estimates. Because the method is general, the 3D structures for
any species may be calculated directly from the contact map without the need to
assume a specific polymer model, as is customarily done.

Kilometre Array Pathfinder survey project at a high angular resolution of 30"".
We found that the two clouds, having $\sim$40 km s$^{-1}$ velocity separation,
show complementary distribution with each other, and part of the HI gas is
dispersed by the ionization. In addition, the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations revealed clumpy CO clouds of
10$^{5}$ $M_{\odot}$ in total over an extent of 100 pc, which are also well
correlated with the HII regions. There is a hint of displacement between the
two complementary components, which indicate that the red-shifted HI cloud is
moving from the north to the south by $\sim$100 pc. This motion is similar to
what is found in NGC 602 (Fukui et al. 2020), suggesting a large scale
systematic gas flow. We frame a scenario that the two components collided with
each other and triggered the formation of N83, N84, and six O-type stars around
them in a time scale of a few Myr ($\sim$60 pc / 40 km s$^{-1}$). The
supersonic motion compressed the HI gas to form the CO clouds in the
red-shifted HI cloud, some of which are forming O-type stars ionizing the HII
regions in the last Myr. The red-shifted HI cloud probably flows to the

of filtered-velocity correlation functions. Two-point correlations-based {\it
statistical priori tests} thus enable rigorous and physically meaningful
studies of turbulence models. Using data from direct numerical simulations of
isotropic and channel flow turbulence we show that local eddy viscosity models
fail to exhibit the long tails observed in the real subfilter stress-strain
rate correlation functions. Stronger non-local correlations may be achieved by
defining the eddy-viscosity model based on fractional gradients of order
$0<\alpha<1$ rather than the classical gradient corresponding to $\alpha=1$.
Analyses of such correlation functions are presented for various orders of the
fractional gradient operators. It is found that in isotropic turbulence
fractional derivative order $\alpha \sim 0.5$ yields best results, while for
channel flow $\alpha \sim 0.2$ yields better results for the correlations in
the streamwise direction, even well into the core channel region. In the
spanwise direction, channel flow results show significantly more local
interactions. The overall results confirm strong non-locality in the
interactions between subfilter stresses and resolved-scale fluid deformation
rates, but with non-trivial directional dependencies in non-isotropic flows.

the concept of optimal discontinuous test functions of the discontinuous

however, consists of globally continuous Hilbert spaces such as H1 and H(div).
Hence, the AVS-FE approximations employ classical C0 or Raviart-Thomas FE basis
functions. The optimal test functions guarantee the numerical stability of the
AVS-FE method and lead to discrete systems that are symmetric and positive
definite. Hence, the AVS-FE method can solve the Cahn-Hilliard equation in both
space and time without a restrictive CFL condition to dictate the space-time
element size. We present numerical verifications of both one and two
dimensional problems in space. The verifications show optimal rates of
convergence in L2 and H1 norms. Results for mesh adaptive refinements using a

directly obtained from patient images is highly desirable but hindered by the
non-availability of gold standards. To address this issue, statistical
techniques have been proposed to objectively evaluate QI methods without a gold
standard. These techniques assume that the measured and true values are
linearly related by a slope, bias, and normally distributed noise term, where
it is assumed that the noise term between the different methods is independent.
However, the noise could be correlated since it arises in the process of
measuring the same true value. To address this issue, we propose a new
no-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this noise as a
multivariate normally distributed term, characterized by a covariance matrix.
In this manuscript, we derive a maximum-likelihood-based technique that,
without any knowledge of the true QI values, estimates the slope, bias, and
covariance matrix terms. These are then used to rank the methods on the basis
of precision of the measured QI values. Overall, the derivation demonstrates
the mathematical premise behind the proposed NGSE technique.

The strength of the phase stiffness is set by the Josephson coupling, which is
strongly anisotropic in layered superconducting cuprates. So far, THz light
pulses have been efficiently used to achieve non-linear control of the
out-of-plane Josephson plasma mode, whose frequency scale lies in the THz
range. However, the high-energy in-plane plasma mode has been assumed to be
insensitive to THz pumping. Here, we show that THz driving of both
low-frequency and high-frequency plasma waves is possible via a general
two-plasmon excitation mechanism. The anisotropy of the Josephson couplings
leads to marked differences in the thermal effects among the out-of-plane and
in-plane response, consistently with the experiments. Our results link the
observed survival of the in-plane THz non-linear driving above $T_c$ to
enhanced fluctuating effects in the phase stiffness in cuprates, paving the way
to THz impulsive control of phase rigidity in unconventional superconductors.

interesting valley/spin-related transport phenomena. Moir\'e pattern, which
emerges as a spatial variation at the interface of 2D atomic crystals, provides
a natural platform for investigating such real space Berry curvature effects.
Here we study moir\'e structures formed in homobilayer transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) due to twisting, various uniform strain profiles, and
their combinations, where electrons can reside in either layer with the layer
index serving as an internal degree of freedom. The layer pseudo-spin exhibits
vortex/antivortex textures in the moir\'e supercell, leading to a giant
geometric magnetic field and a scalar potential. Within a geometric picture,
the moir\'e magnetic field is found as the cross product of the gradients of
the out-of-plane pseudo-spin and the in-plane pseudo-spin orientation
respectively. We discover dual roles of uniform strain: Besides being a cause
of the moire atomic texture in the homobilayer, it also contributes a
pseudo-gauge potential that modifies the local phase of interlayer coupling.
Consequently, strain can be employed to tune the in-plane pseudo-spin texture,
while interlayer bias tunes the out-of-plane pseudo-spin, and we show how the
moir\'e magnetic field's spatial profile, intensity, and flux per supercell can
be engineered. Through the geometric scalar correction, the landscape of the
scalar potential can also be engineered along with the moir\'e magnetic field,
forming distinct effective lattice structures. These properties render TMD
moir\'e structures promising to build tunable flux lattices for transport and

formation and evolution of late-type galaxies (LTGs). The standard scenario
comprises the early assembly of the bulge followed by disk accretion. However,
recent observational evidence points to a joint formation and perpetual
co-evolution of these structural components. Our current knowledge on the
properties of bulge and disk is mostly founded on photometric decomposition
studies, which sensitively depend on the adopted methodology and enclosed
assumptions on the structure of LTGs. A critical assumption whose validity was
never questioned is that galactic disks conserve their exponential nature up to
the galactic center. This implies that bulge and disk co-exist without
significant dynamical interaction and mass exchange over nearly the entire
Hubble time. Our goal is to examine the validity of the standard assumption
that galactic disks preserve their exponential intensity profile inside the
bulge radius all the way to the galactic center. We developed a
spectrophotometric bulge-disk decomposition technique that provides an
estimation for the net spectrum of the bulge. A systematic application of our
spectrophotometric bulge-disk decomposition tool to a representative sample of
135 local LTGs from the CALIFA Survey yields a significant fraction (up to
~30%) of unphysical net-bulge spectra when a purely exponential intensity
profile is assumed for the disk. The obtained results suggest that, for a
significant fraction of LTGs, the disk component shows a down-bending beneath
the bulge. If proven to be true, such result will call for a substantial
revision of structural decomposition studies for LTGs and have far-reaching
implications in our understanding of the photometric properties of their
bulges.

variability is periodic and cannot be ascribed to binary evolution nor
pulsation. Instead, we here attribute it to the presence of magnetic spots:
superficial chemical inhomogeneities whose projected rotation induces the
variability. The second EHB variability is aperiodic and manifests itself on
time-scales of years. In two cases, the six-year light curves display
superflare events a mammoth several million times more energetic than solar
analogs. We advocate a scenario where the two spectacular EHB variability
phenomena are different manifestations of diffuse, dynamo-generated, weak
magnetic fields. Ubiquitous magnetic fields, therefore, force an admittance
into the intricate matrix governing the formation of all EHBs, and traverse to
their Galactic field counterparts. The bigger picture is one where our
conclusions bridge similar variability/magnetism phenomena in all

networks of arbitrary topology can be generalized to the case of networks
confined by hyperplanes. This in particular encompasses the case of a single
polymer chain in a bridge configuration. We further define multi-bridge
networks, where several vertices are in local bridge configurations. We
consider all cases of ordinary, mixed and special surface transitions, and
polymer chains made of self-avoiding walks, or of mutually-avoiding walks, or
at the tricritical $\Theta$-point. In the $\Theta$-point case, generalising the
good-solvent case, we relate the critical exponent for simple bridges,
$\gamma_b^{\Theta}$, to that of terminally-attached arches,
$\gamma_{11}^{\Theta},$ and to the correlation length exponent $\nu^{\Theta}.$
We find $\gamma_b^{\Theta} = \gamma_{11}^{\Theta}+\nu^{\Theta}.$ In the case of
the special transition, we find $\gamma_b^{\Theta}({\rm sp}) =
\frac{1}{2}[\gamma_{11}^{\Theta}({\rm sp})+\gamma_{11}^{\Theta}]+\nu^{\Theta}.$
For general networks, the explicit expression of configurational exponents then
naturally involve bulk and surface exponents for multiple random paths. In
two-dimensions, we describe their Euclidean exponents from a unified
perspective, using Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) in Liouville quantum gravity
(LQG), and the so-called KPZ relation between Euclidean and LQG scaling
dimensions. This is done in the case of ordinary, mixed and special surface

enough the current is carried by a single conduction band. In this regime the
classical torque model breaks down and we show that a skyrmion driven by spin
transfer torque moves in a different direction than predicted by the classical
model. However, the amount of charge current required to move a skyrmion with a
certain velocity in the single band regime is similar to a classical model of
torque where it is implicitly assumed current transport by many conduction
bands. The single band regime is more efficient creating spin current from
charge current because of the perfect polarization of the single band but is
less efficient creating torque from spin current. Nevertheless, it is possible
to take profit of the single band regime to move skyrmions even with no net
charge or spin current flowing between the device contacts. We have also been
able to recover the classical limit considering an ensemble of only a few
electronic states. In this limit we have discovered that electron diffusion

reliability and latency of the underlying communication system. Hence, they
have been mostly implemented using wired channels where the communication
service is highly predictable. Nevertheless, fulfilling such stringent demands
is envisioned with the fifth generation of mobile networks (5G). The
requirements of such applications are often defined on the application layer.
However, cyber-physical control applications can usually tolerate sparse packet
loss, and therefore it is not at all obvious what configurations and settings
these application level requirements impose on the underlying wireless network.
In this paper, we apply the fundamental metrics from reliability literature to
wireless communications and derive a mapping function between application level
requirements and network level parameters for those metrics under deterministic
arrivals. Our mapping function enables network designers to realize the
end-to-end performance (as the target application observes it). It provides
insights to the network controller to either enable more reliability

majorization theory, show that, for a general class of workers' service time

average job compute time. We next show that this balanced assignment of
non-overlapping batches achieves lower average job compute time compared to the
overlapping schemes proposed in the literature. Furthermore, we derive the
optimum redundancy level as a function of the service time distribution at
workers. We show that the redundancy level that minimizes average job compute

predictability of job compute time, and thus there exists a trade-off between
optimizing the two metrics. Finally, by running experiments on Google cluster

Flow observables are found to be insensitive to the details of pre-hydrodynamic
evolution. The main effect we observe is in the $p_T$ spectra, particularly the
mean transverse momentum. However, at least part of this effect is a
consequence of the underlying conformal invariance assumption currently present
in such approaches, which is known to be violated in the temperature regime
probed in heavy-ion collisions. This assumption of early time conformal
invariance leads to an artificially large out-of-equilibrium bulk pressure when
switching from (conformal) pre-hydrodynamic evolution to hydrodynamics (using
the non-conformal QCD equation of state), which in turn increases the
transverse momentum. Our study indicates that a consistent treatment of
pre-hydrodynamic evolution in heavy-ion collisions requires the use of

has been little development in the way of nano-scale coil inductors. This is
because of the physical limitations in miniaturization of the design of a
solenoid with wires coiled around a metallic core. So, while transistors get
steadily smaller, basic inductors in electronics remained relatively bulky. Few
methods exist for creating conductive polymer coils and graphene-based kinetic
nano-inductors, but their large-scale fabrication process is complex and mostly
beyond the current commercial technology available. So, a simpler, scalable,
and robust fabrication technique is needed to overcome this bottleneck. In this
work we demonstrate a new technique consisting of the laser lithography using a
laser engraver of a (poly)vinyl alcohol (PVA)/graphene oxide film composite
which results in a large inductive effect. We attribute this behavior to the
formation of high curvature twisted screw dislocation type conductive pathways
composed of polyacetylene chains linked by pi-pi interactions to reduced
graphene oxide flakes resulting in inductive effect.

the routing algorithm restrictions and resource reservation perspective. The
dynamic nature yielded by the transition process from one routing function to
another is often managed by restricting resource usage in a static predefined
manner, which often limits the supported routing algorithms and/or inactive
link patterns, or either requires additional resources such as virtual
channels. Exploiting compatibility between routing functions by exploring their
associated Channel Dependency Graphs (CDG) can take a great benefit from the
dynamic nature of the reconfiguration process. In this paper, we propose a new
dynamic reconfiguration process called Upstream Progressive Reconfiguration
(UPR). Our algorithm progressively performs dependency addition/removal in a
per channel basis relying on the information provided by the CDG while the
reconfiguration process takes place. This gives us the opportunity to foresee
compatible scenarios where both routing functions coexist, reducing the amount
of resource drainage as well as packet injection halting.

required to accommodate the specificities of most practical learning tasks.
However, the impact of such changes on architecture's approximation
capabilities is largely not understood. We present general conditions
describing feature and readout maps that preserve an architecture's ability to
approximate any continuous functions uniformly on compacts. As an application,
we show that if an architecture is capable of universal approximation, then
modifying its final layer to produce binary values creates a new architecture
capable of deterministically approximating any classifier. In particular, we
obtain guarantees for deep CNNs and deep feed-forward networks. Our results
also have consequences within the scope of geometric deep learning.
Specifically, when the input and output spaces are Cartan-Hadamard manifolds,
we obtain geometrically meaningful feature and readout maps satisfying our
criteria. Consequently, commonly used non-Euclidean regression models between
spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices are extended to universal DNNs.
The same result allows us to show that the hyperbolic feed-forward networks,
used for hierarchical learning, are universal. Our result is also used to show
that the common practice of randomizing all but the last two layers of a DNN
produces a universal family of functions with probability one. We also provide
conditions on a DNN's first (resp. last) few layer's connections and activation
function which guarantee that these layers can have a width equal to the input

penumbra of sunspots occurs at a canonical value of the strength of the
vertical magnetic field, independently of the size of the spot. This critical
field strength is interpreted as to be the threshold for the onset of
magnetoconvection.
  Aims. Here we investigate the reasons why this criterion, also called the
Jur\v{c}\'ak criterion in the literature, does not always identify the boundary
between umbra and penumbra.
  Methods. We perform a statistical analysis of 23 sunspots observed with
Hinode/SOT. We compare the properties of the continuum intensity and the
vertical magnetic field between filaments and spines and how they vary between
spots of different sizes.
  Results. We find that the inner boundary of the penumbra is not related to a
universal value of the vertical magnetic field. The properties of spines and
filaments vary between spots of different sizes. Both components are darker in
larger spots and the spines exhibit stronger vertical magnetic field. These
variations of the properties of filaments and spines with spot size are also
the reason for the reported invariance of the averaged vertical magnetic field
at 50% of the mean continuum intensity.
  Conclusions. The formation of filaments and the onset of magnetoconvection
are not related to a canonical value of the strength of the vertical magnetic
field. Such a seemingly unique magnetic field strength is rather an effect of
the filling factor of spines and penumbral filaments.

signals with sparsity level $s$ from $m$ binary measurements. This is a
challenging task due to the presence of nonlinearity, noises and sign flips. In
this paper, the cardinality constraint least square is proposed as a desired
decoder. We prove that, up to a constant $c$, with high probability, the
proposed decoder achieves a minimax estimation error as long as $m \geq
\mathcal{O}( s\log n)$. Computationally, we utilize a generalized Newton
algorithm (GNA) to solve the cardinality constraint minimization problem with
the cost of solving a least squares problem with small size at each iteration.
We prove that, with high probability, the $\ell_{\infty}$ norm of the
estimation error between the output of GNA and the underlying target decays to
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\frac{\log n }{m}}) $ after at most $\mathcal{O}(\log s)$
iterations. Moreover, the underlying support can be recovered with high
probability in $\mathcal{O}(\log s)$ steps provided that the target signal is
detectable. Extensive numerical simulations and comparisons with
state-of-the-art methods are presented to illustrate the robustness of our
proposed decoder and the efficiency of the GNA algorithm.

Sybil attacks. Unfortunately, current PoW defenses have two main drawbacks.
First, they require work to be done even in the absence of an attack. Second,
during an attack, they require good identities (IDs) to spend as much as the
attacker.
  Recent theoretical work by Gupta, Saia, and Young suggests the possibility of
overcoming these two drawbacks. In particular, they describe a new algorithm,
GMCom, that always ensures that a minority of IDs are Sybil. They show that
rate at which all good IDs perform computation is $O(J_G + \sqrt{T(J_G+1)})$,
where $J_G$ is the join rate of good IDs, and $T$ is the rate at which the
adversary performs computation.
  Unfortunately, this cost bound only holds in the case where (1) GMCom always
knows the join rate of good IDs; and (2) there is a fixed constant amount of
time that separates join events by good IDs. Here, we present ToGCom, which
removes these two shortcomings. To do so, we design and analyze a mechanism for
estimating the join rate of good IDs; and also devise a new method for setting
the computational cost to join the system. Additionally, we evaluate the
performance of ToGCom alongside prior PoW-based defenses. Based on our
experiments, we design heuristics that further improve the performance of
ToGCom by up to $3$ orders of magnitude over these previous Sybil defenses.

certain probability model for the outcomes of games it can be the case that the
top seeded team would be less likely to win the tournament than the second
seeded team. This raises the possibility that in certain situations it might be
advantageous for a team to intentionally lose a game in an attempt to get a
more optimal (though possibly lower) seed in the tournament. We examine this
question in the context of a four team league which consists of a round robin
""regular season"" followed by a single elimination tournament with seedings
determined by the results from the regular season [4]. Using the same
probability model as Schwenk we show that there are situations where it is
indeed optimal for a team to intentionally lose. Moreover, we show how a team
can make the decision as to whether or not it should intentionally lose. We did
two detailed analysis. One is for the situation where other teams always try to
win every game. The other is for the situation where other teams are smart
enough, namely they can also lose some games intentionally if necessary. The
analysis involves computations in both probability and (multi-player) game

C. Maxwell was the first scholar to utilize the algebra of quaternions to study
the physical properties of electromagnetic fields. The contemporary scholars
employ simultaneously the quaternions and octonions to investigate the physical
properties of electromagnetic fields, including the octonion field strength,
field source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, and force and so
forth. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to achieve eight
equations independent of each other, including the fluid continuity equation,
current continuity equation, force equilibrium equation, and second-force
equilibrium equation and so on. One of inferences derived from the second-force
equilibrium equation is that the charge gradient and current derivative are
interrelated closely, two of them must satisfy the need of the second-force
equilibrium equation synchronously. Meanwhile the electromagnetic strength and
linear momentum both may exert an influence on the current derivative to a
certain extent. The above states that the charge gradient and current
derivative are two correlative physical quantities, they must meet the
requirement of second-force equilibrium equation. By means of controlling the
charge gradients and other physical quantities, it is capable of restricting

Additionally, the approach allows to control, e.g., the uniformity of the

flux is largest between the stellar surface and the critical point. The angular
momentum flux is highly variable in time and can reach negative values,
especially at midlatitudes. At rapid rotation of up to 50 times the solar
value, most of the magnetic field is lost along the axis within the inner
tangential cylinder of the model. The model reveals unexpected features that
are not generally anticipated from models that are designed to reproduce the
solar wind: highly variable angular momentum fluxes even from just an
$\alpha^2$ dynamo in the star. A major caveat of our isothermal models with a
magnetic field produced by a dynamo is the difficulty to reach small enough
plasma betas without the dynamo itself becoming unrealistically strong inside
the star.

reduced to lower dimensional problems by conventional reduced order models

the low regularity of the solution manifold (with respect to the problem

we propose a new, nonlinear approach which exploits deep learning (DL)

the number of system parameters. Our DL approach combines deep feedforward
neural networks (NNs) and convolutional autoencoders (AEs). We show that the
proposed DL-ROM framework can efficiently provide solutions to parametrized

pathological cases. We investigate three challenging test cases in cardiac
electrophysiology and prove that DL-ROM outperforms classical projection-based

cleaning up of noise in KGs through KG refinement task is not as actively
studied. Most successful techniques for KG refinement make use of inference
rules and reasoning over ontologies. Barring a few exceptions, embeddings do
not make use of ontological information, and their performance in KG refinement
task is not well understood. In this paper, we present a KG refinement
framework called IterefinE which iteratively combines the two techniques - one
which uses ontological information and inferences rules, PSL-KGI, and the KG
embeddings such as ComplEx and ConvE which do not. As a result, IterefinE is
able to exploit not only the ontological information to improve the quality of
predictions, but also the power of KG embeddings which (implicitly) perform
longer chains of reasoning. The IterefinE framework, operates in a co-training
mode and results in explicit type-supervised embedding of the refined KG from

dynamics,and scale analysis and asymptotics are cornerstones of theoretical
meteorology. Accounting for moist processes in systematic scale analyses
therefore seems of considerable importance for the field. Klein & Majda (TCFD,
20, 525--552, (2006)) proposed a scaling regime for the incorporation of moist
bulk microphysics closures in multiscale asymptotic analyses of tropical deep
convection. This regime is refined here to allow for mixtures of ideal gases
and to establish consistency with a more general multiple scales modelling
framework for atmospheric flows. Deep narrow updrafts, so-called ""hot towers"",
constitute principal building blocks of larger scale storm systems. They are
analysed here in a sample application of the new scaling regime. A single
quasi-onedimensional columnar cloud is considered on the vertical advective (or
tower life cycle) time scale. The refined asymptotic scaling regime is
essential for this example as it reveals a new mechanism for the
self-sustainance of such updrafts. Even for strongly positive convectively
available potential energy (CAPE), a vertical balance of buoyancy forces is
found in the presence of precipitation. This balance induces a diagnostic
equation for the vertical velocity and it is responsible for the generation of
self-sustained balanced updrafts. The time dependent updraft structure is
encoded in a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the precipitation mixing ratio.
Numerical solutions of this equation suggest that the self-sustained updrafts
may strongly enhance hot tower life cycles.

Furthermore, we propose an agent-based self-protective method (ASP-UAVN) for

route from the source UAV to the destination UAV is chosen according to a
self-protective system. In this method, a multi-agent system using an

detect the existing routes. Then, once the route reply packet (RREP) is

allowed them to perform extremely well for a wide range of tasks. In fact, they
have reached human parity when performing image recognition, for example.
Unfortunately, the accuracy of these ANNs comes at the expense of a large
number of cache and/or memory accesses and compute operations. Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs), a type of neuromorphic, or brain-inspired network, have
recently gained significant interest as power-efficient alternatives to ANNs,
because they are sparse, accessing very few weights, and typically only use
addition operations instead of the more power-intensive multiply-and-accumulate
(MAC) operations. The vast majority of neuromorphic hardware designs support
rate-encoded SNNs, where the information is encoded in spike rates.
Rate-encoded SNNs could be seen as inefficient as an encoding scheme because it
involves the transmission of a large number of spikes. A more efficient
encoding scheme, Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding, encodes information in
the relative time of arrival of spikes. While TTFS-encoded SNNs are more
efficient than rate-encoded SNNs, they have, up to now, performed poorly in
terms of accuracy compared to previous methods. Hence, in this work, we aim to
overcome the limitations of TTFS-encoded neuromorphic systems. To accomplish
this, we propose: (1) a novel optimization algorithm for TTFS-encoded SNNs
converted from ANNs and (2) a novel hardware accelerator for TTFS-encoded SNNs,
with a scalable and low-power design. Overall, our work in TTFS encoding and
training improves the accuracy of SNNs to achieve state-of-the-art results on
MNIST MLPs, while reducing power consumption by 1.46$\times$ over the

large-scale heat storage when solar radiance is available, to be later
recovered for economic benefit. The concept uses solar radiance to heat water
on the surface which is then injected into a suitable subsurface formation.
This hot water elevates the ambient formation temperature creating a
high-temperature geothermal reservoir acceptable for geothermal electricity
generation or direct heat applications. The process uses produced/injected,
connate formation water and thus neither freshwater nor surface storage or
disposal of water is required. This concept has been previously presented in
several publications and presentations.
  Calculations of reservoir temperature and pressure profiles in isotropic and
homogeneous reservoirs have been published previously by the authors. These
calculations have shown that a small volume of rock mass is required for the
heat storage reservoir, of the order of tens of meters radius from an injection
well in a reservoir of one-hundred meters thickness. It was shown that over
ninety percent of heat can be recovered for certain reservoirs.
  The previous calculations for the Geothermal Battery Energy Storage
considered only isotropic and homogeneous reservoir formation properties.
However, even in a small rock mass volume, considering sedimentary depositional
environments and superimposed tectonics, the rock permeability may be
anisotropic and heterogeneous with reservoir layers of different properties.
Calculations are presented here considering anisotropic permeabilities, and
layered heterogeneous permeabilities i.e., formations with horizontal layers of
different permeabilities. Such reservoir properties create non-symmetrical
temperature and pressure profiles away from a well, which is critical for well
layout and planning for injection and production.
