  Sequences","Accepted to MICCAI 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anterior chamber angle (ACA) classification is a key step in the diagnosis of
angle-closure glaucoma in Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography
(AS-OCT). Existing automated analysis methods focus on a binary classification
system (i.e., open angle or angle-closure) in a 2D AS-OCT slice. However,
clinical diagnosis requires a more discriminating ACA three-class system (i.e.,
open, narrow, or synechiae angles) for the benefit of clinicians who seek
better to understand the progression of the spectrum of angle-closure glaucoma
types. To address this, we propose a novel sequence multi-scale aggregation
deep network (SMA-Net) for open-narrow-synechiae ACA classification based on an
AS-OCT sequence. In our method, a Multi-Scale Discriminative Aggregation (MSDA)
block is utilized to learn the multi-scale representations at slice level,
while a ConvLSTM is introduced to study the temporal dynamics of these
representations at sequence level. Finally, a multi-level loss function is used
to combine the slice-based and sequence-based losses. The proposed method is
evaluated across two AS-OCT datasets. The experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in applicability,
effectiveness, and accuracy. We believe this work to be the first attempt to
classify ACAs into open, narrow, or synechia types grading using AS-OCT
sequences.

In inhomogeneous ensembles a macroscopic optical polarization decays rapidly
due to dephasing, which, however, is reversible in photon echoes carrying
complete information about the coherent ensemble dynamics. Control of the echo
emission time is mandatory for applications. Here, we propose a novel concept
to reach this goal. In a two-pulse photon echo sequence, we apply an additional
resonant control pulse with multiple of 2pi area. Depending on its arrival
time, the control slows down dephasing or rephasing of the exciton ensemble
during its action. We demonstrate for self-assembled (In,Ga)As quantum dots
that the photon echo emission time can be retarded or advanced by 5 ps relative
to its nominal appearance time without control. This versatile protocol may be
used to obtain significantly longer temporal shifts for suitably tailored
control pulses.

behavior with regard to broader goals linked to resource efficiency, climate
change, social responsibility and other sustainability criteria. The level of
sustainability in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) hardware
procurement is analyzed for two reasons: First, ICT hardware belongs to the six
key product groups in sustainable procurement. Second, ICT in general is
expected to be an important enabler for low-carbon economies, providing
solutions to reduce Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. While the advantages of
sustainable procurement are obvious, certain barriers hinder the adoption in
day-to-day procurement. This case study on ICT hardware discusses the three
important barriers ""lack of clear definitions per product group"", ""missing
market intelligence about sustainable products"" and ""inflexible procedures and
attitudes as barriers for innovative approaches"" based on an in-depth analysis
of sustainable procurement of ICT hardware by the public sector in Switzerland.
To this end, tender data published on the national procurement platform
simap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement
Vocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects. The results
reveal to which extent such criteria as well as their determinants are
currently included in public tenders. Using two different approaches, only a
small number of tenders were found containing sustainability criteria of a wide
range from basic to comprehensive. The overall performance of Swiss public
procurement is benchmarked by comparing the identified sustainability criteria
with available criteria from international key actors in sustainable
procurement. Thus, this analysis provides novel insights on how public agencies
today take sustainability into account when procuring ICT hardware.

linked to data processing, today tree networks are hybrid network topologies in
which star networks are generally interconnected via bus networks. These
networks are, most often, hierarchical and regular, and each of their nodes can
have an arbitrary number of child nodes. At the outset, however, the notion of
tree network, introduced in 1936 by Belgian physicist Julien Pacotte, was quite
different: more general and, at the same time, more constrained, it should also
serve an ambitious objective: the reconstruction of mathematics from concrete
empirical structures. Usually poorly commented on and poorly understood
(especially by philosophers), it had no real posterity. In this article, we
first try to clarify this notion of ""tree network"" in the sense of Julien
Pacotte, which makes it possible to eliminate the bad interpretations to which
this notion has given rise. To this end, we use the language and concepts of
graph theory and formalize the main properties of these networks which,
contrary to popular belief, are not, in general, trees. In a second part, we
then try to follow and explain, step by step, how Pacotte intended, using
concepts borrowed from projective geometry, to reconstruct all of mathematics
from such a network.

the case of the 2d Ising model and considering the gauge invariant sector of

can help understand the intrinsic model working mechanism and check if the
model has undesired characteristics. A popular way of performing model
interpretation is Instance-wise Feature Selection (IFS), which provides an
importance score of each feature representing the data samples to explain how
the model generates the specific output. In this paper, we propose a
Model-agnostic Effective Efficient Direct (MEED) IFS framework for model
interpretation, mitigating concerns about sanity, combinatorial shortcuts,
model identifiability, and information transmission. Also, we focus on the
following setting: using selected features to directly predict the output of
the given model, which serves as a primary evaluation metric for
model-interpretation methods. Apart from the features, we involve the output of
the given model as an additional input to learn an explainer based on more
accurate information. To learn the explainer, besides fidelity, we propose an
Adversarial Infidelity Learning (AIL) mechanism to boost the explanation
learning by screening relatively unimportant features. Through theoretical and
experimental analysis, we show that our AIL mechanism can help learn the
desired conditional distribution between selected features and targets.
Moreover, we extend our framework by integrating efficient interpretation
methods as proper priors to provide a warm start. Comprehensive empirical
evaluation results are provided by quantitative metrics and human evaluation to
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method. Our code

amount of attention, particularly in the field of image representation
learning. However, learning the disentangled representations behind a graph
remains largely unexplored, especially for the attributed graph with both node
and edge features. Disentanglement learning for graph generation has
substantial new challenges including 1) the lack of graph deconvolution
operations to jointly decode node and edge attributes; and 2) the difficulty in
enforcing the disentanglement among latent factors that respectively influence:
i) only nodes, ii) only edges, and iii) joint patterns between them. To address
these challenges, we propose a new disentanglement enhancement framework for
deep generative models for attributed graphs. In particular, a novel
variational objective is proposed to disentangle the above three types of
latent factors, with novel architecture for node and edge deconvolutions.
Moreover, within each type, individual-factor-wise disentanglement is further
enhanced, which is shown to be a generalization of the existing framework for
images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and its
extensions.

  Components Actually Uncorrelated?",,,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Calculations of annual energy production (AEP) from a wind power
plant-whether based on preconstruction or operational data-are critical for
wind plant financial transactions. A popular industry practice is to assume
that different uncertainty components within an AEP calculation are
uncorrelated and can therefore be combined as the sum of their squares. We
assess the practical validity of this assumption for operational-based
uncertainty, by performing operational AEP estimates for more than 470 wind
plants in the United States, mostly in simple terrain. We apply a Monte Carlo
approach to quantify uncertainty in five categories: revenue meter data, wind
speed data, regression relationship, long-term correction, and future
interannual variability. We identify correlations between categories by
comparing the results across all 470 wind plants. We observe a positive
correlation between interannual variability and the linearized long-term
correction; a negative correlation between wind resource interannual
variability and linear regression; and a positive correlation between reference
wind speed uncertainty and linear regression. Then, we contrast total
operational AEP uncertainty values calculated by omitting and considering the
correlations between the uncertainty components. We quantify that ignoring
these correlations leads to an underestimation of total AEP uncertainty of, on
average, 0.1%, and as large as 0.5% for specific sites. Although these are not
large increases, these would still impact wind plant financing rates; further,
we expect these values to increase for wind plants in complex terrain. Based on
these results, we conclude that correlations between the identified uncertainty
components should be considered when computing the total AEP uncertainty.

substrates is explained by employing crystal modeling and reciprocal space
analysis. The Nagai tilt model (H. Nagai, J. Appl. Phys., 45, 3789 (1974)) is
often cited to explain the tilt of lattice planes in a pseudomorphic layer
deposited on a miscut substrate that is observed in high resolution x-ray
diffraction measurements. Here, however, we demonstrate how that model
incorrectly describes how the substrate applies biaxial stress onto the
epitaxial layer. Most importantly, the stress applied to an epitaxial layer on
a miscut substrate is not along a low index plane. For example, the surface
plane of a nominally (001) cubic substrate with a miscut of 10{\deg} towards
the [110] is the (118) plane and the stress applied is parallel along the (118)
plane and not (001). Furthermore, under the framework of reciprocal space, the
{00l} reflections would be symmetric reflections for on-axis substrates but
asymmetric reflections for miscut substrates. The tilt that is experimentally
observed between the low index substrate planes and the epitaxial layer planes
((001) for example with a miscut substrate) matches that which is predicted by
treating the low index reflections as asymmetric reflections. An epitaxial tilt
equation is provided which describes the tilt between epitaxial and substrate
layers based on the lattice parameter mismatch as well as the Poisson ratio of
the layer that is applicable to any crystal system.

behaviour lies in the use of the standard softmax operator which pushes the
posterior probabilities to be either zero or unity hence failing to model
uncertainty. The statistical derivation of the softmax operator relies on the
assumption that the distributions of the latent variables for a given class are
Gaussian with known variance. However, it is possible to use different
assumptions in the same derivation and attain from other families of
distributions as well. This allows derivation of novel operators with more
favourable properties. Here, a novel operator is proposed that is derived using
$t$-distributions which are capable of providing a better description of
uncertainty. It is shown that classifiers that adopt this novel operator can be
more robust to out of distribution samples, often outperforming NNs that use
the standard softmax operator. These enhancements can be reached with minimal
changes to the NN architecture.

combinatorial complexity of possible discrete action sequences, a large number
of optimization/motion planning problems have to be solved to find a solution,
which limits the scalability of these approaches.
  To circumvent this combinatorial complexity, we develop a neural network
which, based on an initial image of the scene, directly predicts promising
discrete action sequences such that ideally only one motion planning problem
has to be solved to find a solution to the overall TAMP problem. A key aspect
is that our method generalizes to scenes with many and varying number of

derivatives in a regression loss leads to a lower sample complexity, and
consequently better fitting. In addition, we prove that SAL enjoys a minimal

derivatives included.

structured code snippets for better understanding code functionalities.
However, automatic code summarization is challenging due to the complexity of
the source code and the language gap between the source code and natural
language summaries. Most previous approaches either rely on retrieval-based
(which can take advantage of similar examples seen from the retrieval database,
but have low generalization performance) or generation-based methods (which
have better generalization performance, but cannot take advantage of similar
examples). This paper proposes a novel retrieval-augmented mechanism to combine
the benefits of both worlds. Furthermore, to mitigate the limitation of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) on capturing global graph structure information of
source code, we propose a novel attention-based dynamic graph to complement the
static graph representation of the source code, and design a hybrid message
passing GNN for capturing both the local and global structural information. To
evaluate the proposed approach, we release a new challenging benchmark, crawled
from diversified large-scale open-source C projects (total 95k+ unique

the model also uses the two main parallel lines as an assistant to determine
the position of the dominant VP. The proposed method was tested using a public

first principle laws by only observing the system's output? Can deep learning
learn the underlying physics and honor the physics when making predictions? The
answers are both positive. In an effort to simulate two-dimensional subsurface
fluid dynamics in porous media, we found that an accurate deep-learning-based
proxy model can be taught efficiently by a computationally expensive
finite-volume-based simulator. We pose the problem as an image-to-image
regression, running the simulator with different input parameters to furnish a
synthetic training dataset upon which we fit the deep learning models. Since
the data is spatiotemporal, we compare the performance of two alternative
treatments of time; a convolutional LSTM versus an autoencoder network that
treats time as a direct input. Adversarial methods are adopted to address the
sharp spatial gradient in the fluid dynamic problems. Compared to traditional
simulation, the proposed deep learning approach enables much faster forward
computation, which allows us to explore more scenarios with a much larger
parameter space given the same time. It is shown that the improved forward
computation efficiency is particularly valuable in solving inversion problems,
where the physics model has unknown parameters to be determined by history
matching. By computing the pixel-level attention of the trained model, we
quantify the sensitivity of the deep learning model to key physical parameters

acceleration. We assess the efficacy of the machine learning surrogate in terms
of its training speed and accuracy. The network can be trained within minutes
using limited training data and achieve accuracy that scales desirably with the

precision of $1\%$ in $T_\text{eff}$. We observed ten late-type metal-poor

(HD103095, HD122563, and HD140283) have previously been used as benchmarks. For
the observations, we used the high angular resolution optical interferometric
instrument PAVO at the CHARA array. We modelled angular diameters using 3D limb
darkening models and determined $T_\text{eff}$ directly from the
Stefan-Boltzmann relation, with an iterative procedure to interpolate over
tables of bolometric corrections. Surface gravities ($\log(g)$) were estimated
from comparisons to Dartmouth stellar evolution model tracks. We collected
spectroscopic observations from the ELODIE and FIES spectrographs and estimated
metallicities ($\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$) from a 1D non-LTE abundance analysis of
unblended lines of neutral and singly ionized iron. We inferred $T_\text{eff}$
to better than $1\%$ for five of the stars (HD103095, HD122563, HD127243,
HD140283, and HD224930). The $T_\text{eff}$ of the other five stars are
reliable to between $2-3\%$; the higher uncertainty on the $T_\text{eff}$ for
those stars is mainly due to their having a larger uncertainty in the
bolometric fluxes. We also determined $\log(g)$ and $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ with
median uncertainties of $0.03\,\mathrm{dex}$ and $0.09\,\mathrm{dex}$,
respectively. These ten stars can, therefore, be adopted as a new, reliable set
of metal-poor benchmarks.

entanglement offers a potential for implementing large-scale fault-tolerant

computation (MBQC). However, existing protocols for MBQC inevitably impose a
polynomial overhead cost in implementing quantum computation due to geometrical
constraints of entanglement structures used in the protocols, and the
polynomial overhead potentially cancels out useful polynomial speedups in
quantum computation. To implement quantum computation without this
cancellation, we construct a protocol for photonic MBQC that achieves as low as
poly-logarithmic overhead, by introducing an entanglement structure for
low-overhead qubit permutation. Based on this protocol, we design a
fault-tolerant photonic MBQC protocol that can be performed by experimentally
tractable homodyne detection and Gaussian entangling operations combined with
the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum error-correcting code, which we
concatenate with the $7$-qubit code. Our fault-tolerant protocol achieves the
threshold $7.8$ dB in terms of the squeezing level of the GKP code,
outperforming $8.3$ dB of the best existing protocol for fault-tolerant quantum
computation with the GKP surface code. Thus, bridging a gap between theoretical
progress on MBQC and photonic experiments towards implementing MBQC, our
results open a new way towards realization of a large class of quantum speedups
including those polynomial.

However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint

time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,
which may render generative modeling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,
we integrate GANs with mathematically principled and efficient path feature
extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a graded
sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a stream of
data, and its expected value characterizes the law of the time-series model. In
particular, we a develop new metric, (conditional) Sig-$W_1$, that captures the

The signature feature space enables the explicit representation of the proposed
discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive training. Furthermore,
we develop a novel generator, called the conditional AR-FNN, which is designed
to capture the temporal dependence of time series and can be efficiently

co-evolve across cosmic time, especially for the non-local universe ($z \gtrsim
0.5$). The High-$z$ Universe probed via Lensing by QSOs (HULQ) project proposes
to utilize quasi-stellar object (QSO) host galaxies acting as gravitational
lenses (QSO lenses) to investigate this topic. This paper focuses on the
feasibility of this project, i.e., whether sufficiently large numbers of QSO
lenses are expected to be found in various concurrent and future imaging
surveys. We find that $\sim 440$ QSO lenses will reside in the Hyper
Suprime-Cam Wide survey (HSC/Wide), which is expected to be the most prolific
concurrent survey, with this number being boosted by one to two orders of
magnitude (to $\sim 10000$) with upcoming surveys such as that conducted with
the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We discuss several methods of how
to study the redshift evolution of the $M_{\rm BH} - \sigma_*$ relation, which
is a stand-out illustration of the co-evolution. In addition, we demonstrate
how the intimacy of lensed images to the bright deflector QSO for most systems
will affect the \textit{detectability} of QSO lenses. We estimate that only
$\sim 82$ and $900$ will be detectable for HSC/Wide and LSST, respectively; the
decrease is significant yet still yields an acceptable sample for the main
objective. This decrease will be less of a problem for space-based imaging
surveys, for their small point spread function FWHMs will allow detections of
lensed images lying relatively close to the deflector QSO, and thus unveil the
less massive yet more numerous QSO hosts.

Thermodynamic cycles can, in principle, be designed to extract work from this

coherent contribution to the ergotropy (the maximum amount of unitarily
extractable work via cyclical variation of Hamiltonian parameters). We show
this by dividing the optimal transformation into an incoherent operation and a
coherence extraction cycle. We obtain bounds for both the coherent and
incoherent parts of the extractable work and discuss their saturation in

finite-dimensional systems and bosonic Gaussian states that describe recent

coreset smaller than the one for least squares regression. We propose a
modified version of the lasso problem and obtain for it a coreset of size
smaller than the least square regression. We empirically show that the modified
version of lasso also induces sparsity in solution, similar to the original
lasso. We also obtain smaller coresets for $\ell_p$ regression with $\ell_p$
regularization. We extend our methods to multi response regularized regression.
Finally, we empirically demonstrate the coreset performance for the modified

technique targeted at processor designs. It leverages bounded model checking
(BMC) to check a design for counterexamples to a self-consistency property:
given the instruction set architecture (ISA) of the design, executing an
instruction sequence twice on the same inputs must always produce the same
outputs. Self-consistency is a universal, implementation-independent property.
Consequently, in contrast to traditional verification approaches that use
implementation-specific assertions (often generated manually), SQED does not
require a full formal design specification or manually-written properties. Case
studies have shown that SQED is effective for commercial designs and that SQED
substantially improves design productivity. However, until now there has been
no formal characterization of its bug-finding capabilities. We aim to close
this gap by laying a formal foundation for SQED. We use a transition-system
processor model and define the notion of a bug using an abstract specification
relation. We prove the soundness of SQED, i.e., that any bug reported by SQED
is in fact a real bug in the processor. Importantly, this result holds
regardless of what the actual specification relation is. We next describe
conditions under which SQED is complete, that is, what kinds of bugs it is
guaranteed to find. We show that for a large class of bugs, SQED can always
find a trace exhibiting the bug. Ultimately, we prove full completeness of a
variant of SQED that uses specialized state reset instructions. Our results
enable a rigorous understanding of SQED and its bug-finding capabilities and
give insights on how to optimize implementations of SQED in practice.

one-bit compressed measurements is proposed, which is then extended for the
case where the receiver has access to a signal that aids signal reconstruction,
i.e., side-information. Two different scenarios of side-information are
considered-a) side-information consisting of support information only, and b)
side information consisting of support and amplitude information. SI is either
a noisy version of the signal or a noisy estimate of the support of the signal.
We develop reconstruction algorithms from one-bit measurements using noisy SI
available at the receiver. Laplacian distribution and Bernoulli distribution
are used to model the two types of noises which, when applied to the signal and
the support, yields the SI for the above two cases, respectively. The
Expectation-Maximization algorithm is used to estimate the noise parameters
using noisy one-bit compressed measurements and the SI. We show that one-bit

majority vote. In fact, Mossel, O'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz proved in 2005 that
the majority voting method is most stable to this random vote corruption, among
voting methods where each person has a small influence on the election. We
discuss some recent progress on the analogous result for elections between more
than two candidates. In this case, plurality should be most stable to
corruption in votes. We also survey results on adversarial election
manipulation (where an adversary can select particular votes to change, perhaps
in a non-random way), and we briefly discuss ranked choice voting methods
(where a vote is a ranked list of candidates).

selected from the stellar mass catalog of galaxies in SDSS DR7, according to
their locations on the u-r color-stellar mass diagram. We find that red spirals
harbor compact cores with high stellar mass surface densities measured by
$\Sigma_1$ and they are bulge-dominated. Particularly, the red spirals,
especially their bulges follow the $\Sigma_1$-$M_{\ast}$ ridgeline for quenched
galaxies. Furthermore, the red spirals show similarly large central
D$_n(4000)$, high [Mg/Fe] and dark matter halo mass to ellipticals. These
results suggest that the bulges of red spirals formed within a short timescale
before redshift ~ 1-2 and were quenched via a fast mode, similar to
ellipticals. Careful examinations of the optical morphologies reveal that ~70%
of red spirals show strong bars, rings/shells and even merging features, which
suggests that interactions or mergers might have played an important role in
the formation of red spirals. In contrast, most of the massive blue spirals
have completely different spectral and structural properties from red spirals.
However, the blue spirals with high $\Sigma_1$ ($\Sigma_1 > 10^{9.5} M_\odot \,
{\rm kpc}^{-2}$) show similar structural and morphological properties, as well
as similar halo mass and HI mass to red spirals. We discuss rejuvenation from
red to blue as a possible explanation for these high $\Sigma_1$ blue spirals.

due to potential savings in time, memory and energy both during training and at
test time. Recent works have identified, through an expensive sequence of
training and pruning cycles, the existence of winning lottery tickets or sparse
trainable subnetworks at initialization. This raises a foundational question:
can we identify highly sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization, without
ever training, or indeed without ever looking at the data? We provide an
affirmative answer to this question through theory driven algorithm design. We
first mathematically formulate and experimentally verify a conservation law
that explains why existing gradient-based pruning algorithms at initialization
suffer from layer-collapse, the premature pruning of an entire layer rendering
a network untrainable. This theory also elucidates how layer-collapse can be
entirely avoided, motivating a novel pruning algorithm Iterative Synaptic Flow
Pruning (SynFlow). This algorithm can be interpreted as preserving the total
flow of synaptic strengths through the network at initialization subject to a
sparsity constraint. Notably, this algorithm makes no reference to the training
data and consistently competes with or outperforms existing state-of-the-art
pruning algorithms at initialization over a range of models (VGG and ResNet),
datasets (CIFAR-10/100 and Tiny ImageNet), and sparsity constraints (up to
99.99 percent). Thus our data-agnostic pruning algorithm challenges the
existing paradigm that, at initialization, data must be used to quantify which
synapses are important.

have been commercially produced for many decades using standard semiconductor
fabrication processes. For the applications of gamma-ray imaging and particle
tracking, however, interaction position measurement within the detector as well

more complex detector often with the electrical contacts divided into a large

The reliable and cost-effective implementation of contact segmentation with the

technology based on thin film amorphous semiconductor layers was developed at
Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and can be used to produce finely

we introduce the Probabilistic Autoencoder (PAE) that learns the probability

PAE is fast and easy to train and achieves small reconstruction errors, high
sample quality, and good performance in downstream tasks. We compare the PAE to
Variational AE (VAE), showing that the PAE trains faster, reaches a lower
reconstruction error, and produces good sample quality without requiring
special tuning parameters or training procedures. We further demonstrate that
the PAE is a powerful model for performing the downstream tasks of
probabilistic image reconstruction in the context of Bayesian inference of
inverse problems for inpainting and denoising applications. Finally, we
identify latent space density from NF as a promising outlier detection metric.

several advantages for the early detection and diagnosis of diabetic
retinopathy (DR). However, automated, complete DR classification frameworks
based on both OCT and OCTA data have not been proposed. In this study, a
convolutional neural network (CNN) based method is proposed to fulfill a DR
classification framework using en face OCT and OCTA. Methods: A densely and
continuously connected neural network with adaptive rate dropout (DcardNet) is
designed for the DR classification. In addition, adaptive label smoothing was
proposed and used to suppress overfitting. Three separate classification levels
are generated for each case based on the International Clinical Diabetic
Retinopathy scale. At the highest level the network classifies scans as
referable or non-referable for DR. The second level classifies the eye as
non-DR, non-proliferative DR (NPDR), or proliferative DR (PDR). The last level
classifies the case as no DR, mild and moderate NPDR, severe NPDR, and PDR.
Results: We used 10-fold cross-validation with 10% of the data to assess the
networks performance. The overall classification accuracies of the three levels
were 95.7%, 85.0%, and 71.0% respectively. Conclusion/Significance: A reliable,
sensitive and specific automated classification framework for referral to an
ophthalmologist can be a key technology for reducing vision loss related to DR.

estimating the weight of a metric minimum spanning tree (MST), it is known that
for any $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists an $\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{O(1)})$

challenge is to actuate an antenna not at the resonance of the emitted wave,
but at the resonance of a different excitation that has a much shorter
wavelength at the same frequency. We have actuated an electromagnetic (EM)
antenna with a surface acoustic wave (SAW) whose wavelength is about five
orders of magnitude smaller than the EM wavelength at the same frequency. This
allowed us to implement an extreme sub-wavelength EM antenna, radiating an EM
wave of wavelength lambda = 2 m, whose emitting area is ~10^-8 m2 (A/lambda^2 =

deposited on a piezoelectric substrate. A SAW launched in the substrate with an
alternating electrical voltage periodically strained the nanomagnets and
rotated their magnetizations owing to the Villari effect. The oscillating

way to address such problems provided that a suitable parametric family of
biasing densities is employed. Although some existing parametric distribution
families are designed to perform efficiently in high dimensions, their
applicability within the cross-entropy method is limited to problems with
dimension of O(1e2). In this work, rather than directly building sampling
densities in high dimensions, we focus on identifying the intrinsic

exploit a connection between rare event simulation and Bayesian inverse

inference to construct new, effectively low-dimensional, biasing distributions
within the cross-entropy method. In particular, we employ the approach in [47],

We compare the results of our ansatz to solutions of Einstein gravity in

not exactly the same. However, we currently lack a principled way to measure
the benefits of these signals to a given target task, and the common practice
of evaluating these benefits is through exhaustive experiments with various

given target task without going through combinatorial experiments. We propose a
unified PAC-Bayesian motivated informativeness measure, PABI, that
characterizes the uncertainty reduction provided by incidental supervision
signals. We demonstrate PABI's effectiveness by quantifying the value added by
various types of incidental signals to sequence tagging tasks. Experiments on
named entity recognition (NER) and question answering (QA) show that PABI's
predictions correlate well with learning performance, providing a promising way
to determine, ahead of learning, which supervision signals would be beneficial.

harmonic oscillators. This system-bath model can describe the time-irreversible
dynamics through which the system evolves toward a thermal equilibrium state at

dynamics can be studied easily by using simple quantum master equations under
the assumption that the system-bath interaction is weak (perturbative

physics and biochemical physics problems, where environmental materials are
complex and strongly coupled with environments. The hierarchical equations of
motion (HEOM) can describe numerically ""exact"" dynamics of a reduced system
under nonperturbative and non-Markovian system--bath interactions, which has
been verified on the basis of exact analytical solutions (non-Markovian tests)
with any desired numerical accuracy. The HEOM theory has been used to treat
systems of practical interest, in particular to account for various linear and
nonlinear spectra in molecular and solid state materials, to evaluate charge

tunneling and quantum ratchet processes in nanodevices, and to explore quantum

corrected cosmological theories confronted the non-viability peril. This was
due to the fact that most of these theories produce massive gravitons
primordially. Among these theories were the ones containing a non-minimal
kinetic coupling correction term in the Lagrangian, which belong to a subclass
of Horndeski theories. In this work we demonstrate how these theories may be
revived and we show how these theories can produce primordial gravitational
waves with speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, thus complying with the GW170817
event. As we show, if the gravitational action of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet
theory also contains a kinetic coupling of the form $\sim \xi(\phi)
G^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$, the condition of having primordial
massless gravitons, or equivalently primordial gravitational waves with speed
$c_T^2=1$ in natural units, results to certain conditions on the scalar field
dependent coupling function of the Gauss-Bonnet term, which is also the
non-minimal coupling of the kinetic coupling. We extensively study the
phenomenological implications of such a theory focusing on the inflationary
era, by only assuming slow-roll dynamics for the scalar field. Accordingly, we
briefly study the case that the scalar field evolves in a constant-roll way. By
using some illustrative examples, we demonstrate that the viability of the
theoretical framework at hand may easily be achieved. Also, theories containing
terms of the form $\sim \xi(\phi)\Box\phi
g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$ and $\sim
\xi(\phi)\left(g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\right)^2$ also lead
to the same gravitational wave speed as the theory we shall study in this
paper, so this covers a larger class of Horndeski theories.

developed a 3D image segmentation method based on V-Net, an end-to-end fully

automatically. The proposed V-net methodology adopts a compound loss function,
which includes a Dice loss and a L2 regularizer. We performed experiments to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed segmentation method. In the
experiments, a QCT dataset which included 397 QCT subjects was used. For the
QCT image of each subject, the ground truth for the proximal femur was
delineated by a well-trained scientist. During the experiments for the entire
cohort then for male and female subjects separately, 90% of the subjects were
used in 10-fold cross-validation for training and internal validation, and to
select the optimal parameters of the proposed models; the rest of the subjects
were used to evaluate the performance of models. Results: Visual comparison
demonstrated high agreement between the model prediction and ground truth
contours of the proximal femur portion of the QCT images. In the entire cohort,
the proposed model achieved a Dice score of 0.9815, a sensitivity of 0.9852 and
a specificity of 0.9992. In addition, an R2 score of 0.9956 (p<0.001) was
obtained when comparing the volumes measured by our model prediction with the
ground truth. Conclusion: This method shows a great promise for clinical
application to QCT and QCT-based finite element analysis of the proximal femur
for evaluating osteoporosis and hip fracture risk.

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and in the usage of low accuracy scores. Since
hospital wards are given less attention compared to the Intensive Care Unit,
ICU, we hypothesized that when a platform is connected to a stream of EHR,
there would be a drastic improvement in dangerous situations awareness and
could thus assist the healthcare team. With the application of machine
learning, the system is capable to consider all patient's history and through
the use of high-performing predictive models, an intelligent early warning
system is enabled. In this work we used 121,089 medical encounters from six
different hospitals and 7,540,389 data points, and we compared popular ward
protocols with six different scalable machine learning methods (three are
classic machine learning models, logistic and probabilistic-based models, and
three gradient boosted models). The results showed an advantage in AUC (Area
Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of 25 percentage points in
the best Machine Learning model result compared to the current state-of-the-art
protocols. This is shown by the generalization of the algorithm with
leave-one-group-out (AUC of 0.949) and the robustness through cross-validation
(AUC of 0.961). We also perform experiments to compare several window sizes to
justify the use of five patient timestamps. A sample dataset, experiments, and

intrathecal (IT) route for the delivery of biopharmaceuticals to the central
nervous system (CNS). Our earlier data exhibited that both the infused volume
and the infusion rate can regulate the initial disposition of the administered
solute within the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). On the other hand, fast additions
of large volumes of liquid to the CSF inevitably raise the intracranial
pressure (ICP), which may in turn lead to adverse reactions if the
physiologically delimited threshold is exceeded. While long-term biological
effects of elevated ICP (hydrocephalus) are known, the safety thresholds
pertaining to short-term ICP elevations caused by IT infusions have not yet
been characterized. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of ICP in rats
and non-human primates (NHPs) with respect to IT infusion rates and volumes.
The data revealed that the addition of a liquid to the CSF raised the ICP in a
rate and volume-dependent manner. At low infusion rates (<0.12 ml/min in rats
and <2 ml/min in NHPs), NHPs and rats displayed similar tolerance patterns for
extended durations. Specifically, safe accommodations of such added volumes
were mainly facilitated by the accelerated pressure-dependent CSF drainage into
the blood, with ICPs stabilizing at different levels below the safety threshold
of 28+/-4 mm Hg in rats and 50+/-5 mm Hg in NHPs. High infusion rates caused

to solve a Markov decision process (MDP) formulation for the admission control
of elective patients. To manage the elective patients from multiple specialties
equitably and efficiently, we establish a waiting list and assign each patient
a time-dependent dynamic priority score. Then, taking the random arrivals of
patients into account, sequential decisions are made on a weekly basis. At the
end of each week, we select the patients to be treated in the following week
from the waiting list. By minimizing the cost function of the MDP over an
infinite horizon, we seek to achieve the best trade-off between the patients'
waiting times and the over-utilization of surgical resources. Considering the
curses of dimensionality resulting from the large scale of realistically sized
problems, we first analyze the structural properties of the MDP and propose an
algorithm that facilitates the search for best actions. We then develop a novel
reinforcement-learning-based ADP algorithm as the solution technique.
Experimental results reveal that the proposed algorithms consume much less
computation time in comparison with that required by conventional dynamic
programming methods. Additionally, the algorithms are shown to be capable of
computing high-quality near-optimal policies for realistically sized problems.

regularizers for image denoising. Sparsity-promoting regularization is a key
ingredient in solving modern image reconstruction problems; however, the
operators underlying these regularizers are usually either designed by hand or
learned from data in an unsupervised way. The recent success of supervised
learning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in solving image reconstruction
problems suggests that it could be a fruitful approach to designing
regularizers. As a first experiment in this direction, we propose to denoise
images using a variational formulation with a parametric, sparsity-promoting
regularizer, where the parameters of the regularizer are learned to minimize
the mean squared error of reconstructions on a training set of (ground truth
image, measurement) pairs. Training involves solving a challenging bilievel
optimization problem; we derive an expression for the gradient of the training
loss using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and provide an accompanying gradient
descent algorithm to minimize it. Our experiments on a simple synthetic,
denoising problem show that the proposed method can learn an operator that
outperforms well-known regularizers (total variation, DCT-sparsity, and
unsupervised dictionary learning) and collaborative filtering. While the
approach we present is specific to denoising, we believe that it can be adapted
to the whole class of inverse problems with linear measurement models, giving
it applicability to a wide range of image reconstruction problems.

in plane-waves and periodic boundary conditions (Pavanello et al. J. Chem.

formulation of real-time time-dependent Kohn-Sham method based on localized
basis set functions and developed within the Psi4NumPy framework (De Santis et
al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2020, 16, 2410) to the FDE scheme. The latter has
been implemented in its ""uncoupled"" flavor (in which the time evolution is only
carried out for the active subsystem, while the environment subsystems remain
at their ground state), using and adapting the FDE implementation already
available in the PyEmbed module of the scripting framework PyADF. The
implementation was facilitated by the fact that both Psi4NumPy and PyADF, being
native Python API, provided an ideal framework of development using the Python
advantages in terms of code readability and reusability. We demonstrate that
the inclusion of the FDE potential does not introduce any numerical instability
in time propagation of the density matrix of the active subsystem and in the
limit of weak external field, the numerical results for low-lying transition
energies are consistent with those obtained using the reference FDE
calculations based on the linear response TDDFT. The method is found to give
stable numerical results also in the presence of strong external field inducing
non-linear effects.

disc around $\alpha$ Centauri B including the effect of the eccentric orbit
binary companion $\alpha$ Centauri A. The initially circular orbit disc
undergoes two types of eccentricity growth. First, the eccentricity oscillates
on the orbital period of the binary, $P_{\rm orb}$, due to the eccentricity of
the binary orbit. Secondly, for a sufficiently small disc aspect ratio, the
disc undergoes global forced eccentricity oscillations on a time-scale of
around $20\,P_{\rm orb}$. These oscillations damp out through viscous
dissipation leaving a quasi-steady eccentricity profile for the disc that
oscillates only on the binary orbital period. The time-averaged global
eccentricity is in the range 0.05-0.1, with no precession in the steady state.
The periastrons of the gas particles are aligned to one another. The higher the
disc viscosity, the higher the disc eccentricity. With $N$-body simulations we
examine the evolution of a disc of planetesimals that forms with the orbital
properties of the quasi-steady protoplanetary disc. We find that the average
magnitude of the eccentricity of particles increases and their periastrons
become misaligned to each other once they decouple from the gas disc. The low
planetesimal collision velocity required for planet formation suggests that for
planet formation to have occurred in a disc of planetesimals formed from a
protoplanetary disc around $\alpha$ Centauri B, said disc's viscosity must be
have been small and planet formation must have occurred at orbital radii
smaller than about $2.5\,\rm au$. Planet formation may be easier with the
presence of gas.

topological materials. Here, we introduce a new topological classification of
two-dimensional matter -- the optical $N$-phases $N\in\mathbb{Z}$. The $C$ and
$\nu$ phases are related to charge and spin transport respectively, whereas the
$N$-phases are connected to polarization transport. In all three cases,
transportation of charge/spin/polarization quanta is forbidden in the bulk but
permitted on the edge. One fundamental difference is that the $N$-invariant is
defined for dynamical electromagnetic waves over all Matsubara frequencies and
wavevectors. We show this topological quantum number is captured solely by the
spatiotemporal dispersion of the susceptibility tensor
$\chi(\omega,\mathbf{q})$. We also prove $N\neq 0$ is nontrivial in graphene's

$\eta_H$. In the nontrivial phase, we discover a deep sub-wavelength phenomenon

completely expelled from the viscous Hall fluid. We propose a new probe of

While numerous techniques have been proposed for privacy-preserving deep
learning over non-relational data, there is less work addressing the privacy
issues pertained to applying deep learning algorithms on graphs. In this paper,
we study the problem of node data privacy, where graph nodes have potentially
sensitive data that is kept private, but they could be beneficial for a central
server for training a GNN over the graph. To address this problem, we develop a
privacy-preserving, architecture-agnostic GNN learning algorithm with formal
privacy guarantees based on Local Differential Privacy (LDP). Specifically, we
propose an LDP encoder and an unbiased rectifier, by which the server can
communicate with the graph nodes to privately collect their data and
approximate the GNN's first layer. To further reduce the effect of the injected
noise, we propose to prepend a simple graph convolution layer, called KProp,
which is based on the multi-hop aggregation of the nodes' features acting as a
denoising mechanism. Finally, we propose a robust training framework, in which
we benefit from KProp's denoising capability to increase the accuracy of

single class label is assigned to a bag of instances while the instance-level
labels are not available. Training classifiers to accurately determine the bag
label and instance labels is a challenging but critical task in many practical
scenarios, such as computational histopathology. Recently, MIL models fully
parameterized by neural networks have become popular due to the high
flexibility and superior performance. Most of these models rely on attention
mechanisms that assign attention scores across the instance embeddings in a bag
and produce the bag embedding using an aggregation operator. In this paper, we
proposed a dual-stream maximum self-attention MIL model (DSMIL) parameterized
by neural networks. The first stream deploys a simple MIL max-pooling while the
top-activated instance embedding is determined and used to obtain
self-attention scores across instance embeddings in the second stream.
Different from most of the previous methods, the proposed model jointly learns
an instance classifier and a bag classifier based on the same instance
embeddings. The experiments results show that our method achieves superior
performance compared to the best MIL methods and demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance on benchmark MIL datasets.

foundation of many change point detection algorithms. However, randomness in
the test statistic as a function of time makes them susceptible to false
positives and localization ambiguity. We address these issues by deriving and
applying filters matched to the expected temporal signatures of a change for
various sliding window, two-sample tests under IID assumptions on the data.
These filters are derived asymptotically with respect to the window size for
the Wasserstein quantile test, the Wasserstein-1 distance test, Maximum Mean
Discrepancy squared (MMD^2), and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The matched
filters are shown to have two important properties. First, they are
distribution-free, and thus can be applied without prior knowledge of the
underlying data distributions. Second, they are peak-preserving, which allows
the filtered signal produced by our methods to maintain expected statistical
significance. Through experiments on synthetic data as well as activity
recognition benchmarks, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for
mitigating false positives and improving the test precision. Our method allows
for the localization of change points without the use of ad-hoc post-processing
to remove redundant detections common to current methods. We further highlight
the performance of statistical tests based on the Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q)
function and show how the invariance property of the Q-Q function to
order-preserving transformations allows these tests to detect change points of
different scales with a single threshold within the same dataset.

by a scalp electric field which is of greater magnitude than anywhere within

deleterious effects including peripheral nerve stimulation and heating which
consequently limit the spatial and temporal characteristics of the brain
electric field. Presently the electromagnetic NIBS literature has produced an
accurate but non-generalized understanding of the differences between the TEP

understanding of the differences between the two methods which may open doors
to novel TEP or TMP methods and translating advances, when possible, between
the two methods. This article employs a three shell spherical conductor head

the spatial scale of the brain electric fields and: (1) the scalp-to-brain

most general result given is an asymptotic limit to the TEP-to-TMP ratio of

to best search for evidence when updating SLRs in SE, and to evaluate these
guidelines using an SLR that was not employed during the formulation of the
guidelines. Method: To propose our guidelines, we compare and discuss outcomes
from applying different search strategies to identify primary studies in a
published SLR, an SLR update, and two replications in the area of effort
estimation. These guidelines are then evaluated using an SLR in the area of
software ecosystems, its update and a replication. Results: The use of a single
iteration forward snowballing with Google Scholar, and employing as a seed set
the original SLR and its primary studies is the most cost-effective way to
search for new evidence when updating SLRs. Furthermore, the importance of
having more than one researcher involved in the selection of papers when
applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria is highlighted through the
results. Conclusions: Our proposed guidelines formulated based upon an effort

the Martian atmosphere, making the surface uninhabitable. Therefore, any
terraforming attempt will require an artificial Martian magnetic shield. The
fundamental challenge of building an artificial magnetosphere is to condense
planetary-scale currents and magnetic fields down to the smallest mass
possible. Superconducting electromagnets offer a way to do this. However, the
underlying physics of superconductors and electromagnets limits this
concentration. Based upon these fundamental limitations, we show that the
amount of superconducting material is proportional to $B_c^{-2}a^{-3}$, where
$B_c$ is the critical magnetic field for the superconductor and $a$ is the loop
radius of a solenoid. Since $B_c$ is set by fundamental physics, the only truly
adjustable parameter for the design is the loop radius; a larger loop radius
minimizes the amount of superconducting material required. This non-intuitive
result means that the ""intuitive"" strategy of building a compact electromagnet
and placing it between Mars and the Sun at the first Lagrange point is
unfeasible. Considering reasonable limits on $B_c$, the smallest possible loop
radius is $\sim$10 km, and the magnetic shield would have a mass of $\sim
10^{19}$ g. Most high-temperature superconductors are constructed of rare
elements; given solar system abundances, building a superconductor with $\sim
10^{19}$ g would require mining a solar system body with several times
$10^{25}$ g; this is approximately 10% of Mars. We find that the most feasible
design is to encircle Mars with a superconducting wire with a loop radius of
$\sim$ 3400 km. The resulting wire diameter can be as small as $\sim$5 cm. With
this design, the magnetic shield would have a mass of $\sim 10^{12}$ g and
would require mining $\sim 10^{18}$ g, or only 0.1\% of Olympus Mons.

electrons gain energy via inverse Bremsstrahlung on neutral atoms, enabling
impact ionization and extensive collisional excitation of the atoms. A kinetic
model of these processes produces the radial density distributions in the
immediate wake of the laser pulse. After the pulse, the thermalized electron
gas drives the system evolution via impact ionization (from the ground and
excited states) and collisional excitation of the residual neutral atoms, while
the excited atoms are engaged in Penning ionization. The interplay of these
three processes determines the electron gas cooling dynamics. The local
imbalance of the free-electron and ion densities induces a transient radial
electric field, which depends critically on the electron temperature. The

explicitly by electrovibration on touch screens, it is important to understand
how we perceive the virtual textures displayed by friction modulation via
electrovibration. We investigated the roughness perception of real gratings
made of plexiglass and virtual gratings displayed by electrovibration through a
touch screen for comparison. In particular, we conducted two psychophysical
experiments with 10 participants to investigate the effect of spatial period
and the normal force applied by finger on roughness perception of real and
virtual gratings in macro size. We also recorded the contact forces acting on
the participants' finger during the experiments. The results showed that the
roughness perception of real and virtual gratings are different. We argue that
this difference can be explained by the amount of fingerpad penetration into
the gratings. For real gratings, penetration increased tangential forces acting
on the finger, whereas for virtual ones where skin penetration is absent,
tangential forces decreased with spatial period. Supporting our claim, we also
found that increasing normal force increases the perceived roughness of real
gratings while it causes an opposite effect for the virtual gratings. These
results are consistent with the tangential force profiles recorded for both
real and virtual gratings. In particular, the rate of change in tangential
force ($dF_t/dt$) as a function of spatial period and normal force followed
trends similar to those obtained for the roughness estimates of real and
virtual gratings, suggesting that it is a better indicator of the perceived

the classical DMD, using a publicly available test dataset that consists of
velocity field snapshots obtained by direct numerical simulation of a wake flow

important dynamical features of the flow; our calculations also highlight its

which is ubiquitous in many real-world situations. The missing value will
significantly impair the performance and even make the causal discovery
algorithms fail. In this paper, we propose an approach to discover causal
structures from incomplete data by using a novel encoder and reinforcement
learning (RL). The encoder is designed for missing data imputation as well as
feature extraction. In particular, it learns to encode the currently available
information (with missing values) into a robust feature representation which is
then used to determine where to search the best graph. The encoder is
integrated into a RL framework that can be optimized using the actor-critic
algorithm. Our method takes the incomplete observational data as input and
generates a causal structure graph. Experimental results on synthetic and real
data demonstrate that our method can robustly generate causal structures from
incomplete data. Compared with the direct combination of data imputation and
causal discovery methods, our method performs generally better and can even

experimental results from LHC have shown further evidence for the formation of
the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), a phase that is thought to permeate the early
Universe and is formed in the high-density neutron-star cores. Various QCD
predictions that model the behavior of the low-$x$ gluon nuclear density, a
poorly explored region, are also tested. Since the photon flux per ion scales
as the square of the emitting electric charge $Z^2$, cross sections of so far
elusive photon-induced processes are extremely enhanced as compared to
nucleon-nucleon collisions. Here, we review recent progress on CMS measurements
of particle production with large transverse momentum or mass, photon-initiated
processes, jet-induced medium response, and heavy quark production. These
high-precision data, along with novel approaches, offer stringent constraints
on initial state, QGP formation and transport parameters, and even

using the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in B-configuration, reveal the
presence of a radio counterpart to the nebula with a spectral slope of -0.56

source associated with the ULX itself, and we set an upper limit on any 5 GHz
radio core emission of 6.6 $\mu$Jy ($4.1\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$). This is
20 times fainter than what we expect if the bubble is energized by a jet. If a
jet exists its core component is unlikely to be responsible for the infrared
excess unless it is variable. Strong winds which are expected in
super-Eddington sources could also play an important role in inflating the
radio bubble. We discuss possible interpretations of the radio/optical bubble

trajectories in road networks. In particular, we focus on the subtrajectory
similarity search problem, which involves finding in a database the
subtrajectories similar to a query trajectory. A key feature of our approach is
that we do not focus on a specific similarity function; instead, we consider
weighted edit distance (WED), a class of similarity functions which allows
user-defined cost functions and hence includes several important similarity
functions such as EDR and ERP. We model trajectories as strings, and propose a
generic solution which is able to deal with any similarity function belonging
to the class of WED. By employing the filter-and-verify strategy, we introduce
subsequence filtering to efficiently prunes trajectories and find candidates.
In order to choose a proper subsequence to optimize the candidate number, we
model the choice as a discrete optimization problem (NP-hard) and compute it
using a 2-approximation algorithm. To verify candidates, we design
bidirectional tries, with which the verification starts from promising
positions and leverage the shared segments of trajectories and the sparsity of
road networks for speed-up. Experiments are conducted on large datasets to
demonstrate the effectiveness of WED and the efficiency of our method for
various similarity functions under WED.

converting a toroidal field to a poloidal field in Babcock-Leighton dynamo
models. In thin flux tube models the Coriolis force causes Joy's law, acting on
east-west flows as they rise towards the surface. Our goal is to measure the
evolution of the average tilt angle of hundreds of active regions as they
emerge, so that we can constrain the origins of Joy's law. We measured the tilt
angle of the primary bipoles in 153 emerging active regions in the Solar
Dynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging Active Region survey. We used
line-of-sight magnetic field measurements averaged over 6 hours to define the
polarities and measure the tilt angle up to four days after emergence. We find
that at the time of emergence the polarities are on average aligned east-west,
and that neither the separation nor the tilt depends on latitude. We do find,
however, that ARs at higher latitudes have a faster north-south separation
speed than those closer to the equator at the emergence time. After emergence,
the tilt angle increases and Joy's law is evident about two days later. The
scatter in the tilt angle is independent of flux until about one day after
emergence, when higher-flux regions have a smaller scatter in tilt angle than
lower-flux regions. Our finding that active regions emerge with an east-west
alignment is surprising since thin flux tube models predict that tilt angles of
rising flux tubes are generated below the surface. Previously reported tilt
angle relaxation of deeply anchored flux tubes can be largely explained by the
change in east-west separation. We conclude that Joy's law is caused by an
inherent north-south separation speed present when the flux first reaches the
surface, and that the scatter in the tilt angle is consistent with buffeting of
the polarities by supergranulation.

from a flaring T-Tauri star. A flux tube, connecting the star with its
circumstellar disk, is populated with a distribution of non-thermal electrons
which is allowed to decay exponentially after a heating event in the disk and
the system is allowed to evolve. The energy distribution of the electrons, as
well as the non-thermal power law index and loss rate, are varied to see their
effect on the overall flux. Spectra are generated from different lines of
sight, giving different views of the flux tube and disk. The peak flux
typically occurs around 20$-$30 GHz and the radio luminosity is consistent with
that observed from T-Tauri stars. For all simulations, the peak flux is found
to decrease and move to lower frequencies with elapsing time. The
frequency-dependent circular polarisation can reach 10$-$30$\%$ but has a
complex structure which evolves as the flare evolves. Our models show that

people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has
changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and
quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at
international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international
level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has
plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of
flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United
States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating
countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major
city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).
Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We
also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of
posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in
the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram
doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among

strategies. In this paper, we propose a model-free approach by training
Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents in a realistic market simulation environment
with multiple agents. First, we configure a multi-agent historical order book
simulation environment for execution tasks built on an Agent-Based Interactive
Discrete Event Simulation (ABIDES) [arXiv:1904.12066]. Second, we formulate the
problem of optimal execution in an RL setting where an intelligent agent can
make order execution and placement decisions based on market microstructure
trading signals in High Frequency Trading (HFT). Third, we develop and train an
RL execution agent using the Double Deep Q-Learning (DDQL) algorithm in the
ABIDES environment. In some scenarios, our RL agent converges towards a
Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP) strategy. Finally, we evaluate the
simulation with our RL agent by comparing it with a market replay simulation
using real market Limit Order Book (LOB) data.

utilising segmentation neural networks is proposed to identify impacted areas
and accessible roads in post-disaster scenarios. The effectiveness of
pretraining with ImageNet on the task of aerial image segmentation has been
analysed and performances of popular segmentation models compared. Experimental
results show that pretraining on ImageNet usually improves the segmentation
performance for a number of models. Open data available from OpenStreetMap
(OSM) is used for training, forgoing the need for time-consuming manual
annotation. The method also makes use of graph theory to update road network
data available from OSM and to detect the changes caused by a natural disaster.
Extensive experiments on data from the 2018 tsunami that struck Palu, Indonesia
show the effectiveness of the proposed framework. ENetSeparable, with 30% fewer

representation learning adopts self-defined signals as supervision and uses the
learned representation for downstream tasks, such as object detection and image
captioning. Many proposed approaches for self-supervised learning follow
naturally a multi-view perspective, where the input (e.g., original images) and
the self-supervised signals (e.g., augmented images) can be seen as two
redundant views of the data. Building from this multi-view perspective, this
paper provides an information-theoretical framework to better understand the
properties that encourage successful self-supervised learning. Specifically, we
demonstrate that self-supervised learned representations can extract
task-relevant information and discard task-irrelevant information. Our
theoretical framework paves the way to a larger space of self-supervised
learning objective design. In particular, we propose a composite objective that
bridges the gap between prior contrastive and predictive learning objectives,
and introduce an additional objective term to discard task-irrelevant
information. To verify our analysis, we conduct controlled experiments to
evaluate the impact of the composite objectives. We also explore our
framework's empirical generalization beyond the multi-view perspective, where
the cross-view redundancy may not be clearly observed.

diffusion systems with state constraints. In general, the value function of
such problems is a discontinuous viscosity solution of the
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, since the regularity cannot be
guaranteed at the boundary of the state constraint. By adapting approaches of
\cite{Bokanowski_SICON_2016} and the stochastic target theory, we obtain an
equivalent representation of the original value function as the backward
reachable set. We then show that this backward reachable can be characterized
by the zero-level set of the auxiliary value function for the unconstrained
stochastic control problem, which includes two additional unbounded controls as
a consequence of the martingale representation theorem. We prove that the
auxiliary value function is a unique continuous viscosity solution of the
associated HJB equation, which is the second-order nonlinear integro-partial
differential equation (IPDE). Our paper provides an explicit way to
characterize the original (possibly discontinuous) value function as a
zero-level set of the continuous solution of the auxiliary HJB equation. The
proof of the existence and uniqueness requires a new technique due to the
unbounded control sets, and the presence of the singularity of the
corresponding L\'evy measure in the nonlocal operator of the HJB equation.

binary BHs at wide orbits that are complementary to gravitational wave
observations. By monitoring highly populated regions of source stars like the
MW bulge region, one can pursue microlensing events due to these BHs. We find
that if BHs have a Salpeter-like mass function extended beyond $30M_\odot$ and
a similar velocity and spatial structure to stars in the Galactic bulge and
disk regions, the BH population is a dominant source of the microlensing events
at long timescales of the microlensing light curve $\gtrsim 100~$days. This is
due to a boosted sensitivity of the microlensing event rate to lens mass, given
as $M^2$, for such long-timescale events. A monitoring observation of $2 \times

control relies on interactions with its environment with a goal-oriented
objective to achieve optimal immediate or delayed rewards. This allows the
optical system to recognize bi-stable structures and navigate, via trajectory
planning, to optimally performing solutions, the first such algorithm
demonstrated to do so in optical systems. We specifically demonstrate the deep
RL architecture on a mode-locked laser, where robust self-tuning and control
can be established through access of the deep RL agent to its waveplates and
polarizers. We further integrate transfer learning to help the deep RL agent
rapidly learn new parameter regimes and generalize its control authority.
Additionally, the deep RL learning can be easily integrated with other control
paradigms to provide a broad framework to control any optical system.

However, these methods are limited in the sense that they can be trained only

The use of real-world data in training image deraining networks is relatively

semi-supervised learning framework which enables the network in learning to
derain using synthetic dataset while generalizing better using unlabeled
real-world images. Through extensive experiments and ablations on several

applications, often surpassing prior approaches, particularly as end-to-end

constrained by low sample rates, noise, narrow domains of signal types, and/or
lack of parameterized controls (i.e. ""knobs""), making their suitability for
professional audio engineering workflows still lacking. This work expands on
prior research published on modeling nonlinear time-dependent signal processing

which includes the ability to emulate the parameterized settings you would see
on an analog piece of equipment, with the goal of eventually producing
commercially viable, high quality audio, i.e. 44.1 kHz sampling rate at 16-bit

computational efficiency, lowering signal-to-noise ratio, and extending to a
larger variety of nonlinear audio effects. Toward these ends, the strategies
employed involved a three-pronged approach: model speed, model accuracy, and
model generalizability. Most of the presented methods provide marginal or no
increase in output accuracy over the original model, with the exception of
dataset manipulation. We found that limiting the audio content of the dataset,

images. Deep hashing is an efficient indexing technique to support large-scale
social image retrieval, due to its deep representation capability, fast
retrieval speed and low storage cost. Particularly, unsupervised deep hashing
has well scalability as it does not require any manually labelled data for
training. However, owing to the lacking of label guidance, existing methods
suffer from severe semantic shortage when optimizing a large amount of deep
neural network parameters. Differently, in this paper, we propose a Dual-level
Semantic Transfer Deep Hashing (DSTDH) method to alleviate this problem with a
unified deep hash learning framework. Our model targets at learning the
semantically enhanced deep hash codes by specially exploiting the
user-generated tags associated with the social images. Specifically, we design
a complementary dual-level semantic transfer mechanism to efficiently discover
the potential semantics of tags and seamlessly transfer them into binary hash
codes. On the one hand, instance-level semantics are directly preserved into
hash codes from the associated tags with adverse noise removing. Besides, an
image-concept hypergraph is constructed for indirectly transferring the latent
high-order semantic correlations of images and tags into hash codes. Moreover,
the hash codes are obtained simultaneously with the deep representation
learning by the discrete hash optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on
two public social image retrieval datasets validate the superior performance of
our method compared with state-of-the-art hashing methods. The source codes of
our method can be obtained at https://github.com/research2020-1/DSTDH

data samples as small as possible, given the desired error upper-bound.
However, the original SPRT makes two critical assumptions that limit its
application in real-world scenarios: (i) samples are independently and
identically distributed, and (ii) the likelihood of the data being derived from

deep neural network-based SPRT algorithm that overcomes the above two
obstacles. The SPRT-TANDEM sequentially estimates the log-likelihood ratio of
two alternative hypotheses by leveraging a novel Loss function for
Log-Likelihood Ratio estimation (LLLR) while allowing correlations up to $N

e.g., two different matching algorithms in a ridesharing system, or two
different inventory management algorithms in an online retail site. Standard
randomized controlled trials are typically not feasible, since the goal is to
estimate policy performance on the entire system. Instead, the typical current
practice involves dynamically alternating between the two policies for fixed
lengths of time, and comparing the average performance of each over the
intervals in which they were run as an estimate of the treatment effect.
However, this approach suffers from *temporal interference*: one algorithm
alters the state of the system as seen by the second algorithm, biasing
estimates of the treatment effect. Further, the simple non-adaptive nature of
such designs implies they are not sample efficient.
  We develop a benchmark theoretical model in which to study optimal
experimental design for this setting. We view testing the two policies as the
problem of estimating the steady state difference in reward between two unknown
Markov chains (i.e., policies). We assume estimation of the steady state reward
for each chain proceeds via nonparametric maximum likelihood, and search for
consistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) experimental designs that are
efficient (i.e., asymptotically minimum variance). Characterizing such designs
is equivalent to a Markov decision problem with a minimum variance objective;
such problems generally do not admit tractable solutions. Remarkably, in our
setting, using a novel application of classical martingale analysis of Markov
chains via Poisson's equation, we characterize efficient designs via a succinct
convex optimization problem. We use this characterization to propose a
consistent, efficient online experimental design that adaptively samples the
two Markov chains.

that this same model leads to exact low-dimensional factorizations of many

very low-dimensional embeddings to capture local structure in real-world

hyperdimensional computing (HDC) mimics brain cognition and leverages random
hypervectors (i.e., vectors with a dimensionality of thousands or even more) to
represent features and to perform classification tasks. The unique hypervector
representation enables HDC classifiers to exhibit high energy efficiency, low
inference latency and strong robustness against hardware-induced bit errors.
Consequently, they have been increasingly recognized as an appealing
alternative to or even replacement of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs)
for local on device classification, especially on low-power Internet of Things
devices. Nonetheless, unlike their DNN counterparts, state-of-the-art designs
for HDC classifiers are mostly security-oblivious, casting doubt on their
safety and immunity to adversarial inputs. In this paper, we study for the
first time adversarial attacks on HDC classifiers and highlight that HDC
classifiers can be vulnerable to even minimally-perturbed adversarial samples.
Concretely, using handwritten digit classification as an example, we construct
a HDC classifier and formulate a grey-box attack problem, where an attacker's
goal is to mislead the target HDC classifier to produce erroneous prediction
labels while keeping the amount of added perturbation noise as little as
possible. Then, we propose a modified genetic algorithm to generate adversarial
samples within a reasonably small number of queries. Our results show that
adversarial images generated by our algorithm can successfully mislead the HDC
classifier to produce wrong prediction labels with a high probability (i.e.,
78% when the HDC classifier uses a fixed majority rule for decision). Finally,
we also present two defense strategies -- adversarial training and retraining--
to strengthen the security of HDC classifiers.

well-known to be intractable in general, and a non-elementary lower bound has
been recently uncovered. In order to alleviate this difficulty, various
structural and behavioral restrictions have been considered, allowing to relate
reachability to properties that are easier to check. For a given initial
marking, the set of potentially reachable markings is described by the state
equation solutions and over-approximates the set of reachable markings.
  In this paper, we delineate several subclasses of weighted Petri nets in
which the set of reachable markings equals the set of potentially reachable
ones, a property we call the PR-R equality. When fulfilled, this property
allows to use linear algebra to answer the reachability questions, avoiding a
brute-force analysis of the state space. Notably, we provide conditions under
which this equality holds in classes much more expressive than marked graphs,
adding places with several ingoing and outgoing transitions, which allows to
model real applications with shared buffers. To achieve it, we investigate the
relationship between liveness, reversibility, boundedness and potential
reachability in Petri nets. We also show that this equality does not hold in
classes with close modeling capability when the conditions are relaxed.

we propose to replace Euclidean distance (L2) by a dissimilarity measure named
Expert Deviation (ED). Based on the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence,
the ED integrates the properties of the observed physical parameters and
climate knowledge. This measure helps comparing histograms of four patches,
corresponding to geographical zones, that are influenced by atmospheric
structures. The combined evaluation of the internal homogeneity and the
separation of the clusters obtained using ED and L2 was performed. The results,
which are compared using the silhouette index, show five clusters with high
indexes. For the two available datasets one can see that, unlike KMS-L2, KMS-ED
discriminates the daily situations favorably, giving more physical meaning to
the clusters discovered by the algorithm. The effect of patches is observed in
the spatial analysis of representative elements for KMS-ED. The ED is able to
produce different configurations which makes the usual atmospheric structures
clearly identifiable. Atmospheric physicists can interpret the locations of the
impact of each cluster on a specific zone according to atmospheric structures.
KMS-L2 does not lead to such an interpretability, because the situations
represented are spatially quite smooth. This climatological study illustrates
the advantage of using ED as a new approach.

use local three-dimensional simulations of the vertically-stratified,
self-gravitating, differentially-rotating, interstellar medium (ISM) subject to
a stellar spiral potential to study the effects of spiral arms on star
formation and formation of arm spurs/feathers. We adopt the TIGRESS framework
of Kim & Ostriker (2017) to handle radiative heating and cooling, star
formation, and ensuing supernova (SN) feedback. We find that more than 90% of
star formation takes place in spiral arms, but the global star formation rate
(SFR) in models with spiral arms is enhanced by less than a factor of 2
compared to the no-arm counterpart. This results from a quasi-linear
relationship between the SFR surface density Sigma_SFR and the gas surface
density Sigma, and supports the picture that spiral arms do not trigger star
formation but rather concentrate star-forming regions. Correlated SN feedback
produces gaseous spurs/feathers downstream from arms in both magnetized and
unmagnetized models. These spurs/feathers are short-lived and have magnetic
fields parallel to their length, in contrast to the longer-lived features with
perpendicular magnetic fields induced by gravitational instability. SN feedback
drives the turbulent component of magnetic fields, with the total magnetic
field strength sublinearly proportional to Sigma. The total midplane pressure
varies by a factor of ~10 between arm and interarm regions but agrees locally
with the total vertical ISM weight, while Sigma_SFR is locally consistent with
the prediction of pressure-regulated, feedback-modulated theory.

central task in decision support systems. To build a prediction model in real
situations, learning from biased observational data is a critical issue due to
the lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased
observational data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual
machine learning have focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes
on a binary action space and the difference between them, namely, the
individual treatment effect. When it comes to a large action space (e.g.,
selecting an appropriate combination of medicines for a patient), however, the
regression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no longer sufficient in
practical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance. This is because
the mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee the nonexistence
of a single potential outcome misestimation that might mislead the whole
decision. Our proposed loss minimizes a classification error of whether or not
the action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible
actions, which further improves the decision-making performance, as we prove.
We also propose a network architecture and a regularizer that extracts a
debiased representation not only from the individual feature but also from the
biased action for better generalization in large action spaces. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the

sensitive to the initialization of weights and bias, which brings difficulties
in training. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) has become
a promising algorithm to train neural networks beyond traditional stochastic
gradient algorithms with the gradient-free features and immunity to
unsatisfactory conditions. However, ADMM could not be applied to train RNN
directly since the state in the recurrent unit is repetitively updated over
timesteps. Therefore, this work builds a new framework named ADMMiRNN upon the
unfolded form of RNN to address the above challenges simultaneously. We also
provide novel update rules and theoretical convergence analysis. We explicitly

features. Increasing the dimension of embedding vectors improves model accuracy
but comes at a high cost to model size. We introduce a multi-layer embedding
training (MLET) architecture that trains embeddings via a sequence of linear
layers to derive superior embedding accuracy vs. model size trade-off.
  Our approach is fundamentally based on the ability of factorized linear
layers to produce superior embeddings to that of a single linear layer. We
focus on the analysis and implementation of a two-layer scheme. Harnessing the
recent results in dynamics of backpropagation in linear neural networks, we
explain the ability to get superior multi-layer embeddings via their tendency
to have lower effective rank. We show that substantial advantages are obtained
in the regime where the width of the hidden layer is much larger than that of
the final embedding (d). Crucially, at conclusion of training, we convert the
two-layer solution into a single-layer one: as a result, the inference-time
model size scales as d.

we want to deploy large, powerful models in production and/or edge devices. One
common technique used to achieve this goal is knowledge distillation.
Typically, the output of a static pre-defined teacher (a large base network) is
used as soft labels to train and transfer information to a student (or smaller)
network. In this paper, we introduce Adjoined Networks, or AN, a learning
paradigm that trains both the original base network and the smaller compressed
network together. In our training approach, the parameters of the smaller
network are shared across both the base and the compressed networks. Using our
training paradigm, we can simultaneously compress (the student network) and
regularize (the teacher network) any architecture. In this paper, we focus on
popular CNN-based architectures used for computer vision tasks. We conduct an
extensive experimental evaluation of our training paradigm on various
large-scale datasets. Using ResNet-50 as the base network, AN achieves 71.8%
top-1 accuracy with only 1.8M parameters and 1.6 GFLOPs on the ImageNet
data-set. We further propose Differentiable Adjoined Networks (DAN), a training
paradigm that augments AN by using neural architecture search to jointly learn
both the width and the weights for each layer of the smaller network. DAN
achieves ResNet-50 level accuracy on ImageNet with $3.8\times$ fewer parameters
and $2.2\times$ fewer FLOPs.

this proposed policy evaluation scheme. Leveraging this evaluation scheme, we
further propose a novel learning algorithm that is able to learn a policy that
is robust to adversarial perturbations and unknown covariate shifts with a
performance guarantee based on the theory of uniform convergence. Finally, we
empirically test the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in synthetic

combine long-lived and multimode memories into a single QI. Here, by
establishing multimode, magnetic-field-insensitive and long-wavelength
spin-wave storage in laser-cooled atoms that are placed inside a
phase-passively-stabilized polarization interferometer, we constructed a
multiplexed QI that stores up to three long-lived spin-wave qubits. Using a

rise to a 3-fold increase in the atom-photon (photon-photon)
entanglement-generation probability compared to single-mode QIs. The measured
Bell parameter is 2.5+/-0.1 combined with a memory lifetime up to 1ms. The
presented work represents a key step forward in realizing fiber-based

not been included in previous surveys, but it might present the biggest
challenge for theoretical models and it might be a large contributor to
feedback due to the outflows' potentially large kinetic power. Using the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, we find 40 quasar spectra with broad EHVO CIV absorption,
10 times more than the number of previously known cases. We characterize the
EHVO absorption and find that in 26 cases, CIV is accompanied by NV and/or OVI
absorption. We find that EHVO quasars lack HeII emission and have overall
larger bolometric luminosities and black hole masses than those of their parent
sample and BALQSOs, while we do not find significant differences in their
Eddington ratios. We also report a trend toward larger black hole masses as the
velocity of the outflowing gas increases in the BALQSOs in our sample. The
overall larger Lbol and lack of HeII emission of EHVO quasars suggest that
radiation is likely driving these outflows. We find a potential evolutionary
effect as EHVO quasars seem to be more predominant at large redshifts. We
estimate that the kinetic power of these outflows may be similar to or even
larger than that of the outflows from BALQSOs as the velocity factor increases
this parameter by 1-2.5 orders of magnitude. Further study of EHVO quasars will
help improve our understanding of quasar physics.

output is error-prone; however, the downstream dialog models are often trained

time. To bridge the gap and make dialog models more robust to ASR errors, we
leverage an ASR error simulator to inject noise into the error-free text data,
and subsequently train the dialog models with the augmented data. Compared to
other approaches for handling ASR errors, such as using ASR lattice or
end-to-end methods, our data augmentation approach does not require any
modification to the ASR or downstream dialog models; our approach also does not
introduce any additional latency during inference time. We perform extensive
experiments on benchmark data and show that our approach improves the
performance of downstream dialog models in the presence of ASR errors, and it
is particularly effective in the low-resource situations where there are
constraints on model size or the training data is scarce.

MIMN proposed by Alibaba, achieves SOTA with the co-design of both learning
algorithm and serving system. MIMN is the first industrial solution that can
model sequential user behavior data with length scaling up to 1000. However,
MIMN fails to precisely capture user interests given a specific candidate item
when the length of user behavior sequence increases further, say, by 10 times
or more. This challenge exists widely in previously proposed approaches. In
this paper, we tackle this problem by designing a new modeling paradigm, which
we name as Search-based Interest Model (SIM). SIM extracts user interests with
two cascaded search units: (i) General Search Unit acts as a general search
from the raw and arbitrary long sequential behavior data, with query
information from candidate item, and gets a Sub user Behavior Sequence which is
relevant to candidate item; (ii) Exact Search Unit models the precise
relationship between candidate item and SBS. This cascaded search paradigm
enables SIM with a better ability to model lifelong sequential behavior data in
both scalability and accuracy. Apart from the learning algorithm, we also
introduce our hands-on experience on how to implement SIM in large scale
industrial systems. Since 2019, SIM has been deployed in the display
advertising system in Alibaba, bringing 7.1\% CTR and 4.4\% RPM lift, which is
significant to the business. Serving the main traffic in our real system now,
SIM models user behavior data with maximum length reaching up to 54000, pushing

attention to utilize current limited quantum devices. The VQE algorithm
requires a quantum circuit with parameters, called a parameterized quantum
circuit (PQC), to prepare a quantum state, and the quantum state is used to
calculate the expectation value of a given Hamiltonian. Creating sophisticated
PQCs is important from the perspective of the convergence speed. Thus, we
propose problem-specific PQCs of the VQE algorithm for optimization problems.
Our idea is to dynamically create a PQC that reflects the constraints of an
optimization problem. With a problem-specific PQC, it is possible to reduce a
search space by restricting unitary transformations in favor of the VQE
algorithm. As a result, we can speed up the convergence of the VQE algorithm.
Experimental results show that the convergence speed of the proposed PQCs is
significantly faster than that of the state-of-the-art PQC.

expertise in a particular task while at the same time maintaining diversity of
skills within each group. Here, we view the problem of finding diverse and
experienced groups as clustering in hypergraphs with multiple edge types. The
input data is a hypergraph with multiple hyperedge types -- representing
information about past experiences of groups of individuals -- and the output
is groups of nodes. In contrast to related problems on fair or balanced
clustering, we model diversity in terms of variety of past experience (instead
of, e.g., protected attributes), with a goal of forming groups that have both
experience and diversity with respect to participation in edge types. In other
words, both diversity and experience are measured from the types of the
hyperedges.
  Our clustering model is based on a regularized version of an edge-based
hypergraph clustering objective, and we also show how naive objectives actually
have no diversity-experience tradeoff. Although our objective function is
NP-hard to optimize, we design an efficient 2-approximation algorithm and also
show how to compute bounds for the regularization hyperparameter that lead to
meaningful diversity-experience tradeoffs. We demonstrate an application of
this framework in online review platforms, where the goal is to curate sets of
user reviews for a product type. In this context, ""experience"" corresponds to
users familiar with the type of product, and ""diversity"" to users that have

One approach is to utilize squeezed/anti-squeezed vacuum noise of OPOs below

noise correlation, which could enable the machine to access either true ground

bounds. Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by
Nayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of
$ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$ for random permutations against classical advice,
leaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover's search can be sped up to
time $\tilde O(\sqrt{N/S})$. Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019),

quantum advice, but the lower bound remains $ST^2 = \tilde\Omega(N)$.
  In this work, we prove that even with quantum advice, $ST + T^2 =

demonstrates that Grover's search is optimal for $S = \tilde O(\sqrt{N})$,
ruling out any substantial speed-up for Grover's search even with quantum

lower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019).

proving quantum time-space lower bounds for Yao's box problem and salted

numerical models for planetary evolution, incorporating the physical complexity
of Earth's interior, and use them to generate statistically-based Nu-Ra

subduction have $\beta$ varying between ~0.26 during the Hadean, when external
factors such as impacts facilitate tectonics, to ~0.12 during the Archaean,
when the system is dominated by long periods of quiescence, and systems driven
by external forcings (eg. due to impacts in the first 100Myr of Earth's
history) may exhibit much higher exponents. We also find a time-lag between Ra

that attention-as-importance interpretations often do not work as we expected.
For example, learned attention weights sometimes highlight less meaningful
tokens like ""[SEP]"", "","", and ""."", and are frequently uncorrelated with other
feature importance indicators like gradient-based measures. A recent debate
over whether attention is an explanation or not has drawn considerable
interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that one root cause of this phenomenon
is the combinatorial shortcuts, which means that, in addition to the
highlighted parts, the attention weights themselves may carry extra information
that could be utilized by downstream models after attention layers. As a
result, the attention weights are no longer pure importance indicators. We
theoretically analyze combinatorial shortcuts, design one intuitive experiment

conduct empirical studies on attention-based interpretation models. The results

kinetically, negative $\eta_{yx}$ are obtained with exponential growth in both
the radial and azimuthal mean magnetic field components. Using isotropic
magnetic forcing, the field growth is no longer exponential, while NLTFM yields
positive $\eta_{yx}$. By employing an alternative forcing from which
wavevectors having small components are removed, the exponential growth is
recovered, but the NLTFM results do not change significantly. Analyzing the
dynamo excitation conditions for the coherent SC and incoherent $\alpha$ and SC
effects shows that the incoherent effects are the main drivers of the dynamo in
the majority of cases. We find no evidence for MSC-effect-driven dynamos in our
simulations.

introducing pseudo controls and risk-sensitive input and state penalty terms,
the constrained robust stabilization problem of the original system is
converted into an equivalent optimal control problem of an auxiliary system.
Then, aiming at the transformed optimal control problem, we adopt adaptive

convergence, online and offline algorithms are developed to serve as principled
ways to record informative experience data. The equivalence proof demonstrates
that the optimal control strategy of the auxiliary system robustly stabilizes
the original system without violating input and state constraints. The proofs

We show how to convert the predicted geometric primitives into object proposals

This distance function enables continuous optimization of object proposals, and
its local minimums provide high-fidelity object proposals. H3DNet then utilizes
a matching and refinement module to classify object proposals into detected

hybrid set of geometric primitives not only provides more accurate signals for
object detection than using a single type of geometric primitives, but it also
provides an overcomplete set of constraints on the resulting 3D layout.

design (Rubinstein and Weinberg, 2018) to introduce a time-independent
Lagrangian. This not only circumvents the need for an expensive hyper-parameter
search (as in prior work), but also provides a principled metric to compare the
performance of two auctions (absent from prior work). Second, the optimization
procedure in previous work uses an inner maximization loop to compute optimal
misreports. We amortize this process through the introduction of an additional
neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by learning
competitive or strictly improved auctions compared to prior work. Both results
together further imply a novel formulation of Auction Design as a two-player
game with stationary utility functions.

cell by interacting with organelles and molecular motors. We proceed to
understand the general pattern forming potential of aster-motor systems using a
computational model of multiple MT asters interacting with motors in a cellular
confinement. In this model dynein motors are attached to the cell cortex and
plus-ended motors resembling kinesin-5 diffuse in the cell interior. The
introduction of 'noise' in the form of MT length fluctuations spontaneously
results in the emergence of coordinated, achiral vortex-like rotation of
asters. The coherence and persistence of rotation requires a threshold density
of both cortical dyneins and coupling kinesins, while the onset of rotation if
diffusion-limited with relation to cortical dynein mobility. The coordinated
rotational motion arises due to the resolution of the 'tug-of-war' of the
rotational component due to cortical motors by 'noise' in the form of MT
dynamic instability, and such transient symmetry breaking is amplified by local
coupling by kinesin-5 complexes. The lack of widespread aster rotation across
cell types suggests biophysical mechanisms that suppress such intrinsic
dynamics may have evolved. This model is analogous to more general models of
locally coupled self-propelled particles (SPP) that spontaneously undergo
collective transport in presence of 'noise' that have been invoked to explain
swarming in birds and fish. However, the aster-motor system is distinct from
SPP models with regard to particle density and 'noise' dependence, providing a
set of experimentally testable predictions for a novel sub-cellular pattern

simultaneously produced by dynamics of the same PQ field via kinetic

asymmetry is tied to the mass of the PQ field. In simple supersymmetric
theories, it is independent of UV parameters and predicts the supersymmtry
breaking mass scale to be $\mathcal{O}(10-10^4)$ TeV, depending on the masses
of the neutrinos and whether the condensate is thermalized during a radiation

($\beta$) based on a Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) and axisymmetric Jeans
Anisotropic Methods (JAM, cylindrically- and spherically-aligned). We
explicitly include a dark matter halo mass component, which is constrained by
weak gravitational lensing measurements for these clusters. We find a strong
correlation between anisotropy and velocity dispersion profile slope, with
rising velocity dispersion profiles corresponding to tangential anisotropy and
decreasing velocity dispersion profiles corresponding to radial anisotropy. The
rising velocity dispersion profiles can also indicate a significant
contribution from the intracluster light (ICL) to the total light (in
projection) in the centre of the galaxy. For a small number of BCGs with rising
velocity dispersion profiles, a variable stellar mass-to-light ratio can also
account for the profile shape, instead of tangential anisotropy or a
significant ICL contribution. We note that, for some BCGs, a variable
$\beta_{z}(r)$ (from radial to tangential anisotropy) can improve the model fit
to the observed kinematic profiles. The observed diversity in these properties
illustrates that BCGs are not the homogeneous class of objects they are often

effects of buoyancy gradients on incompressible stratified flows are said to be
`thermal'. The thermal rotating shallow water (TRSW) model equations contain
three small nondimensional parameters. These are the Rossby number, the Froude
number and the buoyancy parameter. Asymptotic expansion of the TRSW model
equations in these three small parameters leads to the deterministic thermal
versions of the Salmon's L1 (TL1) model and the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG)
model, upon expanding in the neighbourhood of thermal quasi-geostrophic balance
among the flow velocity and the gradients of free surface elevation and
buoyancy. The linear instability of TQG at high wave number tends to create
circulation at small scales. Such a high wave number instability could be
unresolvable in many computational simulations, but its presence at small
scales may contribute significantly to fluid transport at resolvable scales.
Sometimes such effects are modelled via `stochastic backscatter of kinetic
energy'. Here we try another approach. Namely, we model `stochastic transport'
in the hierarchy of models TRSW/TL1/TQG. The models are derived via the
approach of stochastic advection by Lie transport (SALT) as obtained from a
recently introduced stochastic version of the Euler--Poincar\'e variational
principle. We also indicate the potential next steps for applying these models
in uncertainty quantification and data assimilation of the rapid, high
wavenumber effects of buoyancy fronts at these three levels of description by
using the data-driven stochastic parametrisation algorithms derived previously

weights and determines a lack of reliability in the retrieved explanations,
making LIME adoption problematic. In Medicine especially, clinical

two circumstellar disks (CSDs) associated with the binary protostars are
separated from the circumbinary disk (CBD). The CBD is resolved into two spiral
arms, one connecting to the CSD around the northern binary source, Source N,
and the other to Source S. As compared to the CBD in the neighboring
protobinary system L1551 NE, the CBD in L1551 IRS 5 is more compact (r ~150 au)
and the m=1 mode of the spirals found in L1551 NE is less obvious in L1551 IRS
5. Furthermore, the dust and molecular-line brightness temperatures of CSDs and
CBD reach >260 K and >100 K, respectively, in L1551 IRS 5, much hotter than
those in L1551 NE. The gas motions in the spiral arms are characterized by
rotation and expansion. Furthermore, the transitions from the CBD to the CSD
rotations at around the L2 and L3 Lagrangian points and gas motions around the
L1 point are identified. Our numerical simulations reproduce the observed two
spiral arms and expanding gas motion as a result of gravitational torques from
the binary, transitions from the CBD to the CSD rotations, and the gas motion

we deeply investigate these issues showing how they are both addressable

increased acceptance, to perform detailed morphological and spectral studies of
the $\gamma$-ray emission toward CTB 37A from 200 MeV to 200 GeV. The best fit
of the source extension is obtained for a very compact Gaussian model with a
significance of 5.75$\sigma$ and a 68\% containment radius of $0.116^{\circ}$
$\pm$ $0.014^{\circ}_{\rm stat}$ $\pm$ $0.017^{\circ}_{\rm sys}$ above 1 GeV,
which is larger than the TeV emission size. The energy spectrum is modeled as a
LogParabola, resulting in a spectral index $\alpha$ = 1.92 $\pm$ 0.19 at 1 GeV
and a curvature $\beta$ = 0.18 $\pm$ 0.05, which becomes softer than the TeV
spectrum above 10 GeV. The SNR properties, including a dynamical age of 6000
yr, are derived assuming the Sedov phase. From the multiwavelength modeling of
emission toward the remnant, we conclude that the nonthermal radio and GeV
emission is mostly due to the reacceleration of preexisting cosmic rays (CRs)

allow us to constrain the total kinetic energy transferred to the trapped CRs

the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the
worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of
newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict
containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains
close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can
only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article,
using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment
strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of
susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that
minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The
existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is
fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead
theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an
infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary

feature extracted by using convolutional neural network (CNN), where the dense
correspondences between the mesh surface and the image pixels are missing,
leading to suboptimal solution. This paper proposes a model-free 3D human mesh
estimation framework, named DecoMR, which explicitly establishes the dense
correspondence between the mesh and the local image features in the UV space
(i.e. a 2D space used for texture mapping of 3D mesh). DecoMR first predicts
pixel-to-surface dense correspondence map (i.e., IUV image), with which we
transfer local features from the image space to the UV space. Then the
transferred local image features are processed in the UV space to regress a
location map, which is well aligned with transferred features. Finally we
reconstruct 3D human mesh from the regressed location map with a predefined
mapping function. We also observe that the existing discontinuous UV map are
unfriendly to the learning of network. Therefore, we propose a novel UV map
that maintains most of the neighboring relations on the original mesh surface.

automatically identify from data relevant triadic interactions between modal
structures in large Galerkin-based models of two-dimensional unsteady flows.
The approach produces interpretable, sparsely-connected models that reproduce
the original dynamical behaviour at a much lower computational cost, as fewer
triadic interactions need to be evaluated. The key feature of the approach is
that dominant interactions are selected systematically from the solution of a
convex optimisation problem, with a unique solution, and no a priori
assumptions on the structure of scale interactions are required. We demonstrate
this approach on models of two-dimensional lid-driven cavity flow at Reynolds
number $Re = 2 \times 10^4$, where fluid motion is chaotic. To understand the
role of the subspace utilised for the Galerkin projection on sparsity
characteristics, we consider two families of models obtained from two different
modal decomposition techniques. The first uses energy-optimal Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition modes, while the second uses modes oscillating at a single
frequency obtained from Discrete Fourier Transform of the flow snapshots. We
show that, in both cases, and despite no \textit{a-priori} physical knowledge
is incorporated into the approach, relevant interactions across the hierarchy
of modes are identified in agreement with the expected picture of scale
interactions in two-dimensional turbulence. Yet, substantial structural changes
in the interaction pattern and a quantitatively different sparsity are
observed. Finally, although not directly enforced in the procedure, the
sparsified models have excellent long-term stability properties and correctly
reproduce the spatio-temporal evolution of dominant flow structures in the

  in Magnetic Particle Imaging using a Dictionary Approach",,,,,"eess.IV physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background signals are a primary source of artifacts in magnetic particle
imaging and limit the sensitivity of the method since background signals are
often not precisely known and vary over time. The state-of-the art method for
handling background signals uses one or several background calibration
measurements with an empty scanner bore and subtracts a linear combination of
these background measurements from the actual particle measurement. This
approach yields satisfying results in case that the background measurements are
taken in close proximity to the particle measurement and when the background
signal drifts linearly. In this work, we propose a joint estimation of particle
distribution and background signal based on a dictionary that is capable of
representing typical background signals and allows for precise estimation of
the background even when the latter is drifting non-linearly over time. Using a
singular-value decomposition, the dictionary is derived from a large number of
background calibration scans that do not need to be recorded in close proximity
to the particle measurement. The dictionary is sufficiently expressive and
represented by its principle components. The proposed joint estimation of
particle distribution and background signal is expressed as a linear
Tikhonov-regularized least squares problem, which can be efficiently solved. In
phantom experiments it is shown that the method strongly suppresses background
artifacts and even allows to estimate and remove the direct feed-through of the
excitation field.

Duan \emph{et al}. proposed a quantum version of the A-optimal projection

exponential dependence on $s$, the quantum algorithm can only be beneficial for
high dimensional problems with a small number of iterations $s$. To get a

our algorithm achieves at least a polynomial speedup compared to Duan \emph{et

stragglers, we propose an online distributed optimization method called Anytime
Minibatch. In this approach, all nodes are given a fixed time to compute the

per-node minibatch size. Workers then get a fixed communication time to average
their minibatch gradients via several rounds of consensus, which are then used

stragglers from holding up the system without wasting the work that stragglers

types as well as non-differentiable convex cost functionals. Via a novel
representer theorem, we characterise their solution sets in terms of spherical
splines with sparse innovations. We use this result to derive an approximate
canonical spline-based discretisation scheme, with vanishing approximation
error. To solve the resulting finite-dimensional optimisation problem, we
propose an efficient and provably convergent primal-dual splitting algorithm.
We illustrate the versatility of our framework on real-life examples from the

interval satisfying the heat equation for positive time in the interior of this
interval. Such functions were characterised as being analytic on a square with
the original interval as its diagonal. In this short note we provide a direct
argument that the analogue of this result holds in any dimension. For the heat
equation on a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ at
positive time all solutions are analytically extendable to a geometrically
determined subdomain $\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ of $\mathbb{C}^d$ containing
$\Omega$. This domain is sharp in the sense that there is no larger domain for
which this is true. If $\Omega$ is a ball we prove an almost converse of this
theorem. Any function that is analytic in an open neighborhood of
$\mathcal{E}(\Omega)$ is reachable in the sense that it can be obtained from a
solution of the heat equation at positive time. This is based on an analysis of
the convergence of heat equation solutions in the complex domain using the
boundary layer potential method for the heat equation. The converse theorem is
obtained using a Wick rotation into the complex domain that is justified by our
results. This gives a simple explanation for the shapes appearing in the
one-dimensional analysis of the problem in the literature. It also provides a
new short and conceptual proof in that case.

infer stellar ages. We aim to provide empirical relations between stellar ages

open clusters and field stars. We analyse high-resolution and high-S/N HARPS
spectra of a sample of solar-like stars to obtain precise determinations of
their atmospheric parameters and abundances through differential spectral
analysis and age through isochrone fitting. We investigate the relations
between ages and abundance ratios. For the abundance ratios with a steeper
dependence on age, we perform multivariate linear regressions, including the
dependence on metallicity. We apply our relations to a sample of open clusters
located in 4<R$_{GC}$<16 kpc. Using them, we are able to recover the literature
ages only for clusters located at R$_{GC}$>7 kpc. In these clusters, the
content of s-elements is lower than expected from chemical evolution models,
and consequently the [s/$\alpha$] are lower than in clusters of the same age
located in the solar neighbourhood. With our chemical evolution model and a set
of empirical yields, we suggest that a strong dependence on the star formation
history and metallicity-dependent yields of s-elements can substantially modify
the slope of the [s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age relation in different regions of the
Galaxy. Our results point towards a non-universal relation
[s/$\alpha$]-[Fe/H]-age, indicating the existence of relations at different
R$_{GC}$ or for different star formation history. A better understanding of the
s-process at high metallicity is necessary to fully understand the origin of

ultra-clean conditions (ultrahigh vacuum). We show that intercalation decouples
MoS$_2$ from its substrate. We reveal electron transfer from Cs to MoS$_2$,
relative changes in the energy of the valence band maxima, and electronic
disorder induced by structural disorder in the intercalated Cs layer. Besides,
we find an abnormal lattice expansion of MoS$_2$, which we relate to immediate
vicinity of Cs. Intercalation is thermally activated, and so is the reverse
process of de-intercalation. Our work opens the route to a microscopic
understanding of a process of relevance in several possible future

$P(\Lambda)=\delta(\Lambda)$. Should there be an IR cutoff (for whatever

the theory based on the Pontryagin invariant (which only has a parity-odd

calculated electronic properties demonstrate several benefits, including (i)
large hole ionisation energies, mitigating thermionic emission from the

these overlaps via the QR morphology so as to manage the trade-off between

interactions such as clicks, purchases etc. The current state-of-the-art
supervised approaches fail to model them appropriately. Casting sequential
recommendation task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem is a promising
direction. A major component of RL approaches is to train the agent through
interactions with the environment. However, it is often problematic to train a
recommender in an on-line fashion due to the requirement to expose users to
irrelevant recommendations. As a result, learning the policy from logged
implicit feedback is of vital importance, which is challenging due to the pure
off-policy setting and lack of negative rewards (feedback). In this paper, we
propose self-supervised reinforcement learning for sequential recommendation
tasks. Our approach augments standard recommendation models with two output
layers: one for self-supervised learning and the other for RL. The RL part acts
as a regularizer to drive the supervised layer focusing on specific
rewards(e.g., recommending items which may lead to purchases rather than
clicks) while the self-supervised layer with cross-entropy loss provides strong
gradient signals for parameter updates. Based on such an approach, we propose
two frameworks namely Self-Supervised Q-learning(SQN) and Self-Supervised
Actor-Critic(SAC). We integrate the proposed frameworks with four
state-of-the-art recommendation models. Experimental results on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Therefore, exploring DL-based CV may yield useful information about objects,

DL-based CV can also facilitate and improve the designs of wireless

work is rare in the literature. The primary purpose of this article, then, is
to introduce ideas about applying DL-based CV in wireless communications to
bring some novel degrees of freedom to both theoretical research and
engineering applications. To illustrate how DL-based CV can be applied in
wireless communications, an example of using a DL-based CV with a
millimeter-wave (mmWave) system is given to realize optimal mmWave
multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming in mobile scenarios. In
this example, we propose a framework to predict future beam indices from
previously observed beam indices and images of street views using ResNet,
3-dimensional ResNext, and a long short-term memory network. The experimental
results show that our frameworks achieve much higher accuracy than the baseline
method, and that visual data can significantly improve the performance of the
MIMO beamforming system. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and challenges
of applying DL-based CV in wireless communications.

we investigate whether and how the economic recession has affected the total

Moreover, since the number of overnight stays is typically concentrated on
specific lengths (week-end, week, fortnight) we observe multiple peculiar
spikes in its distribution. To take into account these two distinctive
characteristics, we generalise the usual hurdle regression model by specifying
a multiple inflated truncated negative binomial distribution for the positive
responses. Results show that the economic recession impacted negatively on both
components of the decision process and that, by controlling for the inflated
nature of the response variable's distribution, the proposed formulation
provides a better representation of the Italians' tourism behaviour in

model can be a useful tool for policy makers who are trying to forecast the
effects of new targeted policies to support tourism economy.

fulfill these requirements. However, for 2D materials prepared in this way it
is generally assumed that they are of inferior quality in comparison to the
exfoliated 2D materials commonly used in basic research. In this work we
challenge this assumption and aim to quantify the differences in quality for
the prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide MoS$_2$. To this end single
layers of MoS$_2$ prepared by different techniques (exfoliation, grown by
different chemical vapor deposition methods, transfer techniques, and as
vertical heterostructure with graphene) are studied by Raman and
photoluminescence spectroscopy, complemented by atomic force microscopy. We
demonstrate that as-prepared MoS$_2$, directly grown on SiO$_2$, differs from
exfoliated MoS$_2$ in terms of higher photoluminescence, lower electron
concentration, and increased strain. As soon as a water film is intercalated
(e.g., by transfer) underneath the grown MoS$_2$, in particular the
(opto-)electronic properties become practically identical to those of
exfoliated MoS$_2$. A comparison of the two most common precursors shows that
the growth with MoO$_3$ causes greater strain and/or defect density deviations
than growth with ammonium heptamolybdate. As part of a heterostructure directly
grown MoS$_2$ interacts much stronger with the substrate, and in this case an
intercalated water film does not lead to the complete decoupling, which is
typical for exfoliation or transfer. Our work shows that the supposedly poorer
quality of grown 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is indeed a misconception.

reconnection show that the minimum separation distance {\delta} between
interacting vortices follows a 1/2 scaling. Due to the complex nature of the
dynamics (e.g., the formation of bridges and threads as well as successive
reconnections and avalanche), such scaling has never been reported for
(classical) viscous vortex reconnection. Using the direct numerical simulation
of the Navier-Stokes equations, we study viscous reconnection of slender
vortices, whose core size is much smaller than the radius of the vortex
curvature. For separations that are large compared to the vortex core size, we
discover that {\delta}(t) between the two interacting viscous vortices
surprisingly also follows the 1/2 power scaling for both pre- and
post-reconnection events. The prefactors in this 1/2-power law are found to
depend not only on the initial configuration but also on the vortex Reynolds
number (or viscosity). Our finding in the viscous reconnection, complementing
numerous works on quantum vortex reconnection, suggests that there is indeed a
universal route for reconnection -- an essential result for understanding the
various facets of the viscous vortex reconnection phenomena and their potential
modeling, as well as possibly explaining turbulence cascade physics.

this definition allows the formulation of a separation-based lemma to handle

is reduced in a twofold sense: the control gain of each virtual control law

parameter $\lambda$ and confirm the implicit $\ell_2$ regularization effect of
overparameterization, which theoretically justifies the surprising empirical
observation that $\lambda_{\rm opt}$ can be negative in the overparameterized
regime. We also characterize the double descent phenomenon for principal
component regression (PCR) when both $\mathbf{X}$ and $\mathbf{\beta}_\star$
are anisotropic. Finally, we determine the optimal weighting matrix
$\mathbf{\Sigma}_w$ for both the ridgeless ($\lambda\to 0$) and optimally
regularized ($\lambda = \lambda_{\rm opt}$) case, and demonstrate the advantage
of the weighted objective over standard ridge regression and PCR.

including molecular and gas detection. Absorption or intercalation of the
target species varies the lattice parameters and an effective thickness of thin

general and the sensor response in particular. Here, we explore the case of
palladium-based thin films absorbing hydrogen and demonstrate that expansion of
thickness is an important mechanism determining the magnitude and the very
polarity of the resistance response to hydrogenation in high resistivity films.
The model of the resistance response that takes into account modifications of
thickness was tested and confirmed in three Pd-based systems with variable
resistivity: thin Pd films above and below the percolation threshold, thick
Pd-SiO2 granular composite films with different content of silica, and Pd-rich
CoPd alloys where resistivity depends on Co concentration. Superposition of the
bulk resistivity increase due to hydride formation and decrease of film
resistance due to thickness expansion provides a consistent explanation of the
hydrogenation response in both continuous and discontinuous films with
different structures and compositions.

fundamental reason is that the embeddings of the neighbors or learned weights

the derivation of an optimal variance reduced samplers non-trivial. In this
paper, we formulate the optimization of the sampling variance as an adversary

variance information about more neighbors (exploration) while at the same time
optimizing the immediate sampling variance (exploit). We theoretically show

volume of data in a streaming way that often need to be processed in real time.
Therefore, streaming data computing technology plays an indispensable role in
the real-time processing of sensor data in high throughput but low latency. In
view of the above problems, the proposed framework is implemented on top of
Spark Streaming, which builds up a gray model based traffic flow monitor, a
traffic prediction orientated prediction layer and a fuzzy control based Batch
Interval dynamic adjustment layer for Spark Streaming. It could forecast the
variation of sensors data arrive rate, make streaming Batch Interval adjustment
in advance and implement real-time streaming process by edge. Therefore, it can
realize the monitor and prediction of the data flow changes of the autonomous
driving vehicle sensor data in geographical coverage of edge computing node
area, meanwhile minimize the end-to-end latency but satisfy the application
throughput requirements. The experiments show that it can predict short-term
traffic with no more than 4% relative error in a whole day. By making batch
consuming rate close to data generating rate, it can maintain system stability
well even when arrival data rate changes rapidly. The Batch Interval can be
converged to a suitable value in two minutes when data arrival rate is doubled.
Compared with vanilla version Spark Streaming, where there has serious task
accumulation and introduces large delay, it can reduce 35% latency by squeezing
Batch Interval when data arrival rate is low; it also can significantly improve
system throughput by only at most 25% Batch Interval increase when data arrival

based observations to predict the SW speed from the NASA OMNIWEB dataset,
measured at Lagragian point 1. We evaluate our model against autoregressive and

prediction ($\approx$ 3 to 4 days prior to prediction), and at the active
regions for slow wind prediction. These trends bear an uncanny similarity to
the influence of regions potentially being the sources of fast and slow wind,
as reported in literature. This suggests that our model was able to learn some

Operators (TSOs), have announced the North Sea Wind Power Hub (NSWPH) project.
The project aims at increasing by 36 GW the North Sea offshore wind capacity,
with an artificial island collecting all the power produced by wind turbines
and several HVDC links transmitting this power to the onshore grids. This
project brings together new opportunities and new challenges, both from a
technical and economic point of view. In this regard, this paper presents three
analyses regarding the design and operation of such an offshore system. First,
we perform a techno-economic assessment of different grid configurations for
the collection of the power produced by wind farms and its transmission to the
hub. In this analysis, two frequencies and two voltage levels for the operation
of the offshore grid are investigated. Our findings show that the
nominal-frequency high-voltage option is the more suitable, as low-frequency
does not bring any advantage and low-voltage would results in higher costs. The
second analysis is related to the differences in operating the system with low-
or zero-inertia; different dynamic studies are performed for each configuration
to identify proper control actions and their stability properties. Comparing
the outcomes of the simulations, we observed that voltage and frequency
oscillations are better damped in the zero-inertia system; however, the risk of
propagating offshore faults in the connected onshore grids is mitigated with
the inclusion of the synchronous condensers. Lastly, a comparison of
ElectroMagnetic Transient (EMT) and phasor-mode (also known as RMS) models is
presented, in order to understand their appropriateness of simulating low- and
zero- inertia systems. The results show that phasor approximation modelling can
be used, as long as eigen-frequencies in power network are well damped.

enables the generation of coherence waves of collective molecular motion in the

delivered by a commercial solid-state laser. The approach may enable access to
tunable VUV light to any laboratory and therefore boost progress in many

models. They effectively model the joint-distribution between the data and the

in terms of a prior over the latent space. Despite their advantages, such as
stability in training, the performance of AE based models has not reached the
superior standards as that of the other generative models such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs). Motivated by this, we examine the effect of the
latent prior on the generation quality of deterministic AE models in this
paper. Specifically, we consider the class of RAEs with deterministic
Encoder-Decoder pairs, Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE), and show that having a
fixed prior distribution, \textit{a priori}, oblivious to the dimensionality of
the `true' latent space, will lead to the infeasibility of the optimization
problem considered. Further, we show that, in the finite data regime, despite
knowing the correct latent dimensionality, there exists a bias-variance
trade-off with any arbitrary prior imposition. As a remedy to both the issues
mentioned above, we introduce an additional state space in the form of flexibly
learnable latent priors, in the optimization objective of the WAEs. We
implicitly learn the distribution of the latent prior jointly with the AE
training, which not only makes the learning objective feasible but also
facilitates operation on different points of the bias-variance curve. We show
the efficacy of our model, called FlexAE, through several experiments on
multiple datasets, and demonstrate that it is the new state-of-the-art for the

(SMDC) (Yeung-Zhang 1999). In the current paper, we consider weakly secure SMDC
where security constraints are injected on each individual message, and provide
a complete characterization of the conditions under which superposition coding
is sum-rate optimal. Two joint coding strategies, which lead to rate savings
compared to superposition coding, are proposed, where some coding components
for one message can be used as the encryption key for another. By applying
different variants of Han's inequality, we show that the lack of opportunity to
apply these two coding strategies directly implies the optimality of
superposition coding. It is further shown that under a set of particular
security constraints, one of the proposed joint coding strategies can be used
to construct a code that achieves the optimal rate region.

floods in Italy in which property-owners, the insurer and the government
co-operate in risk financing. Our model departs from the existing literature by
describing a public-private insurance intended to relieve the financial burden
that natural events place on governments, while at the same time assisting
individuals and protecting the insurance business. Hence, the business is
aiming at maximizing social welfare rather than profits. Given the limited
amount of data available on natural risks, expected losses per individual have
been estimated through risk-modeling. In order to evaluate the insurer's loss
profile, spatial correlation among insured assets has been evaluated by means
of the Hoeffding bound for r-dependent random variables. Though earthquakes
generate expected losses that are almost six times greater than floods, we
found that the amount of public funds needed to manage the two perils is almost
the same. We argue that this result is determined by a combination of the risk
aversion of individuals and the shape of the loss distribution. Lastly, since
earthquakes and floods are uncorrelated, we tested whether jointly managing the
two perils can counteract the negative impact of spatial correlation. Some
benefit from risk diversification emerged, though the probability of the
government having to inject further capital might be considerable. Our findings
suggest that, when not supported by the government, private insurance might
either financially over-expose the insurer or set premiums so high that
individuals would fail to purchase policies.

x-ray detectors operate in the current-integrating mode. This physical process

However, the non-linear model is not invertible with a computationally
efficient solution, and is often approximated as a linear integral model in the
form of the Radon transform. Such approximation basically ignores
energy-dependent information and would generate beam hardening artifacts.
Dual-energy CT (DECT) scans one object using two different x-ray energy spectra
for the acquisition of two spectrally distinct projection datasets to improve
imaging performance. Thus, DECT can reconstruct energy and material-selective
images, realizing monochromatic imaging and material decomposition.
Nevertheless, DECT would increase radiation dose, system complexity, and
equipment cost relative to single-spectrum CT. In this paper, a
machine-learning-based CT reconstruction method is proposed to perform
monochromatic image reconstruction using a single-spectrum CT scanner.
Specifically, a residual neural network (ResNet) model is adapted to map a CT
image to a monochromatic counterpart at a pre-specified energy level. This
ResNet is trained on clinical dual-energy data, showing an excellent
convergence to a minimal loss. The trained network produces high-quality
monochromatic images on testing data, with a relative error of less than 0.2%.

enhance the intrinsic reward and promote the emergence of individuality, two

halos as a population is very fast (average speed 1464 km s-1), cycle-24 halos
are slower by 26 percent than the cycle-23 halos. We introduce a new parameter,
the heliocentric distance of the CME leading edge at the time a CME becomes a
full halo; this height is significantly shorter in cycle 24 (by 20 percent) and
has a lower cutoff at 6 Rs. These results show that cycle-24 CMEs become halos
sooner and at a lower speed than the cycle-23 ones. On the other hand, the
flare sizes are very similar in the two cycles, ruling out the possibility of
eruption characteristics contributing to the differing CME properties. In
summary, this study reveals the effect of the reduced total pressure in the

(e.g., DSM) for enhancing the performance of the semantic segmentation of

as additional inputs. While in many real-world applications, one does not have
the corresponding DSM information at hand and the spatial resolution of
acquired DSM images usually do not match the aerial images. To alleviate this
data constraint and also take advantage of 3D elevation information, in this
paper, we introduce a geometry-aware segmentation model that achieves accurate
semantic labeling of aerial images via joint height estimation. Instead of
using a single-stream encoder-decoder network for semantic labeling, we design
a separate decoder branch to predict the height map and use the DSM images as
side supervision to train this newly designed decoder branch. In this way, our
model does not require DSM as model input and still benefits from the helpful
3D geometric information during training. Moreover, we develop a new
geometry-aware convolution module that fuses the 3D geometric features from the
height decoder branch and the 2D contextual features from the semantic
segmentation branch. The fused feature embeddings can produce geometry-aware
segmentation maps with enhanced performance. Our model is trained with DSM
images as side supervision, while in the inference stage, it does not require
DSM data and directly predicts the semantic labels in an end-to-end fashion.
Experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method for the semantic segmentation of aerial

relation head to discriminate how entities relate to themselves

can be used in downstream tasks such as classification and image retrieval. We
evaluate the proposed method following a rigorous experimental procedure, using
standard datasets, protocols, and backbones. Self-supervised relational
reasoning outperforms the best competitor in all conditions by an average 14%
in accuracy, and the most recent state-of-the-art model by 3%. We link the
effectiveness of the method to the maximization of a Bernoulli log-likelihood,

absorbing mesons, and where the mesons are treated explicitly. A nucleus in

  The model---in its simplest incarnation---is applied to the deuteron, where
the latter becomes a superposition of a neutron-proton state and a
neutron-proton-meson state. Coupling between these states leads to an effective
attraction between the nucleons and results in a bound state with negative
energy, the deuteron. The model is able to reproduce the accepted values for
the binding energy and the charge radius of the deuteron.

spatially located in several clusters by following the Poisson Cluster Process
and each cluster is served by a hovering UAV with NOMA. For practical
considerations, we assume that only imperfect CSI of each user is available at
the UAVs. Based on this model, the problem of joint user clustering and robust
beamforming design is formulated to minimize the sum transmission power, and
meanwhile, guarantee the QoS requirements of users. Due to the integer
variables of user clustering, coupling effects of beamformers, and infinitely
many constraints caused by the imperfect CSI, the formulated problem is
challenging to solve. For computational complexity reduction, the original
problem is divided into user clustering subproblem and robust beamforming
design subproblem. By utilizing the users' position information, we propose a
k-means++ based unsupervised clustering algorithm to first deal with the user
clustering problem. Then, we focus on the robust beamforming design problem. To
attain insights on solving the robust beamforming design problem, we firstly
investigate the problem with perfect CSI, and the associated problem is shown
can be solved optimally. Secondly, for the problem in the general case with
imperfect CSI, an SDR based method is proposed to produce a suboptimal solution
efficiently. Moreover, we provide a sufficient condition under which the SDR
based approach can guarantee to obtain an optimal rank-one solution, which is
theoretically analyzed. Finally, an alternating direction method of multipliers
based algorithm is proposed to allow the UAVs to perform robust beamforming
design in a decentralized fashion efficiently. Simulation results demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and transmission scheme.

models classifying them as $\psi$-ontic or $\psi$-epistemic if the quantum
state describes respectively either a physical reality or mere observers'
knowledge. Moreover, they claimed that Einstein - who was a supporter of the
statistical interpretation of quantum mechanics - endorsed an epistemic view of
$\psi$. In this essay we critically assess such a classification and some of
its consequences by proposing a two-fold argumentation. Firstly, we show that
Harrigan and Spekkens' categorization implicitly assumes that a complete
description of a quantum system (its ontic state, $\lambda$) only concerns
single, individual systems instantiating absolute, intrinsic properties.
Secondly, we argue that such assumptions conflict with some current
interpretations of quantum mechanics, which employ different ontic states as a
complete description of quantum systems. In particular, we will show that,
since in the statistical interpretation ontic states describe ensembles rather
than individuals, such a view cannot be considered psi-epistemic. As a
consequence, the authors misinterpreted Einstein's view concerning the nature
of the quantum state. Next, we will focus on Relationalist Quantum Mechanics
and Perspectival Quantum Mechanics, which in virtue of their relational and
perspectival metaphysics employ ontic states lambda dealing with relational
properties. We conclude that Harrigan and Spekkens' categorization is too
narrow and entails an inadequate classification of the mentioned
interpretations of quantum theory. Hence, any satisfactory classification of
quantum ontological models ought to take into account the variations of
$\lambda$ across different interpretations of quantum mechanics.

statistical fluctuations are automatically taking in account even when the

$\chi^2$-function for fitting binned data in counting experiment when signal

estimated previously, either by Monte Carlo events, ``idle"" run events or any
other reasonable way. The here studied method applies only when the background
and signal are completely independent events, i.e, they are non-coherent
events. The profile $\chi^2$-function has shown to have a fast convergence,
with fewer events, to the ``true'' values for counting experiments as shown in
MC toy tests. It works properly even when the bin contents are low and also
when the signal to background ratio is small. Other interesting points are also
presented and discussed. One of them is that the background parameter does not
need to be estimated with very high precision even when there are few signal
events during a fitting procedure. An application to Higgs boson discovery is

practiced less social-distancing. This relationship also was more salient among

of the time lag between reported cases and deaths versus time, that yields the
optimal correlation between them is a specific sense. We find that the
resulting corrected CFR (deaths shifted back by this time lag, divided by

applications to neuromorphic hardware, with the aim of improving system-wide
reliability without compromising key performance metrics such as execution time
of these applications on the hardware. Fundamental to RENEU is a novel
formulation of the aging of CMOS-based circuits in a neuromorphic hardware
considering different failure mechanisms. Using this formulation, RENEU
develops a system-wide reliability model which can be used inside a
design-space exploration framework involving the mapping of neurons and
synapses to the hardware. To this end, RENEU uses an instance of Particle Swarm
Optimization (PSO) to generate mappings that are Pareto-optimal in terms of
performance and reliability. We evaluate RENEU using different machine learning
applications on a state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware with NVM synapses. Our
results demonstrate an average 38\% reduction in circuit aging, leading to an
average 18% improvement in the lifetime of the hardware compared to current
practices. RENEU only introduces a marginal performance overhead of 5% compared
to a performance-oriented state-of-the-art.

precomputed queries at non terminal symbols, reports the frequencies for the
${\tt ndoc}$ distinct documents in which the pattern of length $m$ occurs in

Existing solutions to the problem of speech2face renders limited image quality
and fails to preserve facial similarity due to the lack of quality dataset for
training and appropriate integration of vocal features. In this paper, we
investigate these key technical challenges and propose Speech Fusion to Face,
or SF2F in short, attempting to address the issue of facial image quality and
the poor connection between vocal feature domain and modern image generation

dramatic performance boost over state-of-the-art solution, by doubling the

creates offspring either from mutation or by recombining two randomly chosen

fully mutation-only algorithm towards a fully crossover-based GA. We analyze,
by empirical means, how the performance depends on the interplay of population
size and the crossover probability.
  Our comparison on 25 pseudo-Boolean optimization problems reveals an
advantage of crossover-based configurations on several easy optimization tasks,
whereas the picture for more complex optimization problems is rather mixed.
Moreover, we observe that the ``fast'' mutation scheme with its are power-law
distributed mutation strengths outperforms standard bit mutation on complex
optimization tasks when it is combined with crossover, but performs worse in
the absence of crossover.
  We then take a closer look at the surprisingly good performance of the
crossover-based $(\mu+\lambda)$ GAs on the well-known LeadingOnes benchmark
problem. We observe that the optimal crossover probability increases with
increasing population size $\mu$. At the same time, it decreases with
increasing problem dimension, indicating that the advantages of the crossover
are not visible in the asymptotic view classically applied in runtime analysis.
We therefore argue that a mathematical investigation for fixed dimensions might
help us observe effects which are not visible when focusing exclusively on
asymptotic performance bounds.

space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web of changing
dependencies. We formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution
to an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of
signal boundaries and byte orderings. We provide two novel, state-of-the-art
signal boundary classifiers-both superior to previous approaches in precision
and recall in three different test scenarios-and the first signedness
classification algorithm which exhibits a $>$97\% F-score. CAN-D is the only
solution with the potential to extract any CAN signal. In evaluation on 10
vehicles, CAN-D's average $\ell^1$ error is 5x better than all previous methods
and exhibits lower ave. error, even when considering only signals that meet
prior methods' assumptions. CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware,
allowing for an OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.

models of human driving behavior in simulation. This work presents an approach
to learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We
model human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is
characterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost
functions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent
behavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building
upon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems
with large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human
driving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver
modeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where
the interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a
parameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver
modeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode
specific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper
describes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward
signal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human
demonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by
GAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of
latent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are
performed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show
that these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving
behavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic,
emergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between
driving agents.

synthesis of DNA is synonymous with the chemical origin of life, and theories
have been developed along many lines of reasoning, but resolving all
requirements remains a challenge, such as defining an objective path to produce
sequences of encoded nucleotides paired as adenine to thymine and guanine to
cytosine. Here, a new theory for the origin of DNA is presented. The theory is
based upon three lines of experimental evidence and agreement of structural
symmetry between DNA nucleotides and steroid hormones, and introduces a new
concept of synthesizing both structural and functional characteristics of DNA
at the same time within a single unified complex of interleaved tetra-ringed
structures, steroid molecules which form reaction vessels that serve as
co-enzymatic building blocks. The new theory indicates that the establishment
of the DNA nucleotide code is among the very first synthesis steps. Moreover,
as a consequence of the intermolecular synthesis of both structural and
functional characteristics within a unified complex, there is a culminating
process step that sets forth in motion both DNA and the steroid structures that
subsequently trigger replication and transcription, as well as protein
translation, thereby resulting in the instantaneous release of life function.

approach for a fully automated slice-based measurement of muscle mass for
assessing sarcopenia on CT scans of the abdomen without any case exclusion
criteria.
  Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was conducted using a
collection of public and privately available CT images (n = 1070). The method
consisted of two stages: slice detection from a CT volume and single-slice CT
segmentation. Both stages used Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN) and
were based on a UNet-like architecture. Input data consisted of CT volumes with
a variety of fields of view. The output consisted of a segmented muscle mass on
a CT slice at the level of L3 vertebra. The muscle mass is segmented into
erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus muscle groups. The output was
tested against manual ground-truth segmentation by an expert annotator.
  Results: 3-fold cross validation was used to evaluate the proposed method.
The slice detection cross validation error was 1.41+-5.02 (in slices). The
segmentation cross validation Dice overlaps were 0.97+-0.02, 0.95+-0.04,
0.94+-0.04 for erector spinae, psoas, and rectus abdominus, respectively, and
0.96+-0.02 for the combined muscle mass.
  Conclusion: A deep learning approach to detect CT slices and segment muscle
mass to perform slice-based analysis of sarcopenia is an effective and
promising approach. The use of FCNN to accurately and efficiently detect a
slice in CT volumes with a variety of fields of view, occlusions, and slice
thicknesses was demonstrated.

simulating the impact of different tariffs schemes. This paper proposes a novel
method based on conditional variational autoencoders (CVAE) to generate, from
an electricity tariff profile combined with exogenous weather and calendar
variables, daily consumption profiles of consumers segmented in different
clusters. First, a large set of consumers is gathered into clusters according
to their consumption behavior and price-responsiveness. The clustering method
is based on a causality model that measures the effect of a specific tariff on
the consumption level. Then, daily electrical energy consumption profiles are
generated for each cluster with CVAE. This non-parametric approach is compared
to a semi-parametric data generator based on generalized additive models and
that uses prior knowledge of energy consumption. Experiments in a publicly
available data set show that, the proposed method presents comparable
performance to the semi-parametric one when it comes to generating the average
value of the original data. The main contribution from this new method is the
capacity to reproduce rebound and side effects in the generated consumption
profiles. Indeed, the application of a special electricity tariff over a time
window may also affect consumption outside this time window. Another
contribution is that the clustering approach segments consumers according to
their daily consumption profile and elasticity to tariff changes. These two
results combined are very relevant for an ex-ante testing of future DR policies
by system operators, retailers and energy regulators.

present study reports a model of inflation under the consideration that the
inflationary regime is originated by a type of holographic energy density. The
infrared cutoff has been selected based on the modified holographic model that
is a particular case of Nojiri-Odintsov holographic dark energy \cite{odi1}
that unifies phantom inflation with the acceleration of the universe on
late-time. On getting an analytical solution for Hubble parameter we considered
the presence of bulk viscosity and the effective equation of state parameter
appeared to be consistent with the inflationary scenario with some constraints.
It has also been observed that in the inflationary scenario the contribution of
bulk viscosity is not of much significance and its influence is increasing with
the evolution of the universe. Inflationary observables have been computed for
the model and the slow-roll parameters have been computed. Finally, it has been
observed that the trajectories in $n_s - r$ are compatible with the
observational bound found by Planck. It has been concluded that the tensor to
scalar ratio for this model can explain the primordial fluctuation in the early
universe as well.

work, Zero Shot Translation (ZST) is inspected for a low resource language
pair. By working on high resource language pairs for which benchmarks are
available, namely Spanish to Portuguese, and training on data sets
(Spanish-English and English-Portuguese) we prepare a state of proof for ZST
system that gives appropriate results on the available data. Subsequently the
same architecture is tested for Sanskrit to Hindi translation for which data is
sparse, by training the model on English-Hindi and Sanskrit-English language
pairs. In order to prepare and decipher with ZST system, we broaden the
preparation and interpretation pipelines of NMT seq2seq model in tensorflow,
incorporating ZST features. Dimensionality reduction of word embedding is
performed to reduce the memory usage for data storage and to achieve a faster
training and translation cycles. In this work existing helpful technology has
been utilized in an imaginative manner to execute our NLP issue of Sanskrit to

are domains where data-driven and ubiquitous computing exhibits the potential
of a profound impact in the future. Existing techniques use data extracted from
questionnaires, sensors (wearable, computer, etc.), or other traits, to assess
well-being and cognitive attributes of individuals. However, these techniques
can neither predict individual's well-being and psychological traits in a
global manner nor consider the challenges associated to processing the data
available, that is incomplete and noisy. In this paper, we create a benchmark
for predictive analysis of individuals from a perspective that integrates:
physical and physiological behavior, psychological states and traits, and job
performance. We design data mining techniques as benchmark and uses real noisy
and incomplete data derived from wearable sensors to predict 19 constructs
based on 12 standardized well-validated tests. The study included 757
participants who were knowledge workers in organizations across the USA with
varied work roles. We developed a data mining framework to extract the
meaningful predictors for each of the 19 variables under consideration. Our
model is the first benchmark that combines these various instrument-derived
variables in a single framework to understand people's behavior by leveraging
real uncurated data from wearable, mobile, and social media sources. We verify
our approach experimentally using the data obtained from our longitudinal
study. The results show that our framework is consistently reliable and capable
of predicting the variables under study better than the baselines when
prediction is restricted to the noisy, incomplete data.

used for shuffle play in media players. These algorithms treat all items being
shuffled equally regardless of how similar the items are to each other. While
this may be desirable for many applications, this is problematic for shuffle
play due to the clustering illusion, which is the tendency for humans to
erroneously consider 'streaks' or 'clusters' that may arise from samplings of
random distributions to be non-random. This thesis attempts to address this
issue with a family of biased shuffling algorithms called cluster diffusing
(CD) shuffles which are based on disordered hyperuniform systems such as the
distribution of cone cells in chicken eyes, the energy levels of heavy atomic
nuclei, the eigenvalue distributions of various types of random matrices, and
many others which appear in a variety of biological, chemical, physical, and
mathematical settings. These systems suppress density fluctuations at large
length scales without appearing ordered like lattices, making them ideal for
shuffle play. The CD shuffles range from a random matrix based shuffle which
takes $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space to more efficient approximations which
take $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space.

the recommended items and enable fine-grained understanding of their
preferences. Extensive studies have shown that modeling such data greatly
improves the effectiveness and explainability of the recommendations. However,
as ranking is essential in recommendation, there is no principled solution yet
for collectively generating multiple item rankings over different aspects. In
this work, we propose a directional multi-aspect ranking criterion to enable a
holistic ranking of items with respect to multiple aspects. Specifically, we
view multi-aspect evaluation as an integral effort from a user that forms a
vector of his/her preferences over aspects. Our key insight is that the
direction of the difference vector between two multi-aspect preference vectors
reveals the pairwise order of comparison. Hence, it is necessary for a
multi-aspect ranking criterion to preserve the observed directions from such
pairwise comparisons. We further derive a complete solution for the
multi-aspect ranking problem based on a probabilistic multivariate tensor
factorization model. Comprehensive experimental analysis on a large TripAdvisor
multi-aspect rating dataset and a Yelp review text dataset confirms the
effectiveness of our solution.
