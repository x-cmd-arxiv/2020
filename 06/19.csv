quantum internet. However, exponential loss in optical fibres precludes any
realistic application beyond few hundred kilometres. Quantum repeaters and
space-based systems offer to overcome this limitation. Here, we analyse the use
of quantum memory (QM)-equipped satellites for quantum communication focussing
on global range repeaters and Measurement-Device-Independent (MDI) QKD. We
demonstrate that satellites equipped with QMs provide three orders of magnitude
faster entanglement distribution rates than existing protocols based on
fibre-based repeaters or space systems without QMs. We analyse how entanglement
distribution performance depends on memory characteristics, determine
benchmarks to assess performance of different tasks, and propose various
architectures for light-matter interfaces. Our work provides a practical
roadmap to realise unconditionally secure quantum communications over global
distances with current technologies.

their ability to learn complex systems of relations or interactions arising in
a broad spectrum of problems ranging from biology and particle physics to
social networks and recommendation systems. Despite the plethora of different
models for deep learning on graphs, few approaches have been proposed thus far
for dealing with graphs that present some sort of dynamic nature (e.g. evolving
features or connectivity over time). In this paper, we present Temporal Graph
Networks (TGNs), a generic, efficient framework for deep learning on dynamic
graphs represented as sequences of timed events. Thanks to a novel combination
of memory modules and graph-based operators, TGNs are able to significantly
outperform previous approaches being at the same time more computationally
efficient. We furthermore show that several previous models for learning on
dynamic graphs can be cast as specific instances of our framework. We perform a
detailed ablation study of different components of our framework and devise the
best configuration that achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
transductive and inductive prediction tasks for dynamic graphs.

sensor networks secured by the random pairwise key predistribution scheme, and
payment channel networks. The random K-out graph with $n$ nodes is constructed
as follows. Each node draws an edge towards $K$ distinct nodes selected
uniformly at random. The orientation of the edges is then ignored, yielding an
undirected graph. An interesting property of random K-out graphs is that they
are connected almost surely in the limit of large $n$ for any $K \geq2$. This
means that they attain the property of being connected very easily, i.e., with
far fewer edges ($O(n)$) as compared to classical random graph models including
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs ($O(n \log n)$). This work aims to reveal to what
extent the asymptotic behavior of random K-out graphs being connected easily
extends to cases where the number $n$ of nodes is small. We establish upper and
lower bounds on the probability of connectivity when $n$ is finite. Our lower
bounds improve significantly upon the existing results, and indicate that
random K-out graphs can attain a given probability of connectivity at much
smaller network sizes than previously known. We also show that the established
upper and lower bounds match order-wise; i.e., further improvement on the order
of $n$ in the lower bound is not possible. In particular, we prove that the
probability of connectivity is $1-\Theta({1}/{n^{K^2-1}})$ for all $K \geq 2$.
Through numerical simulations, we show that our bounds closely mirror the
empirically observed probability of connectivity.

find the right balance between coherence, qubit addressability, qubit-qubit

Leading all-microwave approaches for coupling two qubits require comparatively
few control lines and benefit from high coherence but suffer from frequency
crowding and limited addressability in multi-qubit settings. Here, we overcome
these limitations by realizing an all-microwave controlled-phase gate between
two transversely coupled transmon qubits which are far detuned compared to the
qubit anharmonicity. The gate is activated by applying a single, strong
microwave tone to one of the qubits, inducing a coupling between the two-qubit
$|f,g\rangle$ and $|g,e\rangle$ states, with $|g\rangle$, $|e\rangle$, and
$|f\rangle$ denoting the lowest energy states of a transmon qubit. Interleaved
randomized benchmarking yields a gate fidelity of $97.5\pm 0.3 \%$ at a gate
duration of $126\,\rm{ns}$, with the dominant error source being decoherence.
We model the gate in presence of the strong drive field using Floquet theory
and find good agreement with our data. Our gate constitutes a promising
alternative to present two-qubit gates and could have hardware scaling
advantages in large-scale quantum processors as it neither requires additional
drive lines nor tunable couplers.

general stringent conditions on the localization of fields in braneworlds by
imposing that its zero-mode must satisfy Einstein's equations (EE). Here, we
continue this study by considering free $p$-form. These fields present an
on-shell equivalency relation between a $p$-form and a $(D-p-2)$-form, provided
by Hodge duality (HD). This symmetry will impose a new consistency condition,
namely, confinement of a $p$-form must imply the localization of its dual. We
apply the above conditions to $6$D braneworlds. With this, we find that in
global string-like defects, for example, the $1$-form has a normalizable
zero-mode. By using the HD, we show that its bulk dual $3$-form also has a
normalizable zero-mode, making the confinement consistent with HD. However,
these solutions cannot be made consistent with EE, therefore, these fields must
be ruled out. In fact, by imposing both conditions, only the scalar and its
dual field can be consistently localized. In this way, all the literature so
far in which the free $1$-form is localized in codimension two models should be
reviewed. These results also point to the fact that the symmetries of the
fields can be used to verify the consistency of their localization and even
prohibit it.

that in our simulations stars always form in relatively thin discs, and at ages
below 100 Myr are contained within half-mass height $z_{1/2}$ ~ 0.1 kpc and
short-to-long axis ratio $z_{1/2}/x_{1/2}$ ~ 0.15. Disc thickness increases

contributes to the observed disc thickness: rapid changes in the orientation of
the galactic plane mix the configuration of young stars. The frequently

additional mechanism of quick disc inflation. The actual formation of stars

that the cluster centroids should evolve steadily in keeping the classifier

centroids memory for centroids evolution. We break down the abrupt global
clustering into steady memory update and batch-wise label re-assignment. The
process is integrated into network update iterations. In this way, labels and

The optical gain threshold can be reduced by electronic doping of the QDs,

BaZrS3 versus Ruddlesden-Popper Ba3Zr2S7 is primarily due to enhanced IR
mode-effective charges, and variations in phonon frequencies along $\langle 001

principled and numerically efficient algorithm that unfolds underlying Unions

is capable of identifying more complex trends in data sets than simple linear

data modalities individually. We propose a novel multi-modal data fusion
approach based on group sparsity which we refer to as Robust Group Subspace

optimization techniques, the introduced framework learns a new joint
representation of the time series from different data modalities, respecting an
underlying UoS model. We subsequently integrate the obtained structures to form
a unified subspace structure. The proposed approach exploits the structural
dependencies between the different modalities data to cluster the associated
target objects. The resulting fusion of the unlabeled sensors' data from
experiments on audio and magnetic data has shown that our method is competitive
with other state of the art subspace clustering methods. The resulting UoS

along their evolution. Understanding the dependence of the turbulent transport
triggered by the shear instabilities due to the differential rotation in
stellar radiation zones is mandatory. Indeed, it constitutes one of the
cornerstones of the rotational transport and mixing theory which is implemented
in stellar evolution codes to predict the rotational and chemical evolutions of
stars. We investigate horizontal shear instabilities in stellar radiation zones
by considering the full Coriolis acceleration with both the dimensionless
horizontal component $\tilde{f}$ and the vertical component $f$. We performed a
linear stability analysis for a horizontal shear flow with a hyperbolic tangent
profile, both numerically and asymptotically using the WKBJ approximation. As
in the traditional approximation, we identified the inflectional and inertial
instabilities. The inflectional instability is destabilized as $\tilde{f}$
increases and its maximum growth rate increases significantly, while the
thermal diffusivity stabilizes the inflectional instability similarly to the
traditional case. The inertial instability is also strongly affected; for
instance, the inertially unstable regime is extended in the non-diffusive limit
as $0<f<1+\tilde{f}^{2}/N^{2}$, where $N$ is the dimensionless
Brunt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency. More strikingly, in the high-thermal-diffusivity
limit, it is always inertially unstable at any colatitude $\theta$ except at
the poles (i.e., $0^{\circ}<\theta<180^{\circ}$). Using the asymptotic and
numerical results, we propose a prescription for the effective turbulent
viscosities induced by the instabilities to be possibly used in stellar
evolution models. The characteristic time of this turbulence is short enough to
redistribute efficiently angular momentum and mix chemicals in the radiation
zones.

estimate the threats of epidemic diseases (i.e., the COVID-19 pandemic) as well
as to evaluate epidemic control interventions. The indoor place is considered
to be a significant epidemic spreading risk origin, but existing widely-used
epidemic spreading models are usually limited for indoor places since the
dynamic physical distance changes between people are ignored, and the empirical
features of the essential and non-essential travel are not differentiated. In
this paper, we introduce a pedestrian-based epidemic spreading model that is
capable of modeling indoor transmission risks of diseases during people's
social activities. Taking advantage of the before-and-after mobility data from
the University of Maryland COVID-19 Impact Analysis Platform, it's found that
people tend to spend more time in grocery stores once their travel frequencies
are restricted to a low level. In other words, an increase in dwell time could
balance the decrease in travel frequencies and satisfy people's demand. Based
on the pedestrian-based model and the empirical evidence, combined
non-pharmaceutical interventions from different operational levels are
evaluated. Numerical simulations show that restrictions on people's travel
frequency and open-hours of indoor places may not be universally effective in
reducing average infection risks for each pedestrian who visit the place. Entry
limitations can be a widely effective alternative, whereas the decision-maker
needs to balance the decrease in risky contacts and the increase in queue
length outside the place that may impede people from fulfilling their travel
needs.

threshold invariant fairness, which enforces equitable performances across

this paper proposes to equalize the risk distributions among the groups via two

breathing and speaking, including phonetic features, using order-of-magnitudes
estimates, numerical simulations, and laboratory experiments. We document the
spatio-temporal structure of the expelled air flow. Phonetic characteristics of
plosive sounds like 'P' lead to enhanced directed transport, including jet-like
flows that entrain the surrounding air. We highlight three distinct temporal

transport over a short distance ($<$ 0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with
large angular variations due to the complexity of speech, (ii) a longer

broadcasts the current global model to the devices for local training, and
aggregates the local model updates from the devices to update the global model.
Previous work on the communication efficiency of FL has mainly focused on the
aggregation of model updates from the devices, assuming perfect broadcasting of
the global model. In this paper, we instead consider broadcasting a compressed
version of the global model. This is to further reduce the communication cost
of FL, which can be particularly limited when the global model is to be

quantizes the global model update (with respect to the global model estimate at

other existing schemes studying quantization of the global model at the

survey efficiency of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) and
Pan-STARRS1. We find that the libration amplitude of the stable Neptunian
Trojan population can be well modeled as a Rayleigh distribution with a
libration amplitude width $\sigma_{A_phi}$ of 15$^\circ$. When taken as a
whole, the Neptune Trojan population can be acceptably modeled with a Rayleigh
eccentricity distribution of width $\sigma_e$ of 0.045 and a typical sin(i) x
Gaussian inclination distribution with a width $\sigma_i$ of 14 +/- 2 degrees.
However, these distributions are only marginally acceptable. This is likely
because, even after accounting for survey detection biases, the known large Hr
< 8 and small Hr >= 8 Neptune Trojans appear to have markedly different
eccentricities and inclinations. We propose that like the classical Kuiper
belt, the stable intrinsic Neptunian Trojan population have dynamically `hot'
and dynamically `cold' components to its eccentricity/inclination distribution,
with $\sigma_{e-cold}$ ~ 0.02 / $\sigma_{i-cold}$ ~ 6$^\circ$ and
$\sigma_{e-hot}$~ 0.05 / $\sigma_{i-hot}$ ~ 18$^\circ$. In this scenario, the
`cold' L4 Neptunian Trojan population lacks the Hr >= 8 members and has 13
+11/-6 `cold' Trojans with Hr < 8. On the other hand, the `hot' L4 Neptunian
Trojan population has 136 +57/-48 Trojans with Hr < 10 -- a population 2.4
times greater than that of the L4 Jovian Trojans in the same luminosity range.

applied to dextran molecules of varying size which penetrate into hydrogels of
polyethylene-glycol (PEG) chains with different lengths that are covalently
cross-linked by hyperbranched polyglycerol (hPG) hubs. Extracted dextran bulk
diffusivities agree well with fluorescence correlation spectroscopy data

inside the hydrogel are identified as a function of the dextran mass. An
elastic free-volume model that includes dextran as well as PEG linker
flexibility describes the repulsive dextran-hydrogel interaction free energy,
which is of steric origin, quantitatively and furthermore suggests that the
hydrogel mesh-size distribution is rather broad and particle penetration is
dominated by large hydrogel pores. Particle penetration into hydrogels is for
steric particle-hydrogel interactions thus suggested to be governed by an
elastic size-filtering mechanism that involves the tail of the hydrogel

Specifically, we devise an ensemble of these generative classifiers that

difficulty of estimating the gradients accurately. Much of the recent progress
has been achieved by taking advantage of continuous relaxations of the system,
which are not always available or even possible. The Augment-REINFORCE-Merge
(ARM) estimator provides an alternative that, instead of relaxation, uses
continuous augmentation. Applying antithetic sampling over the augmenting
variables yields a relatively low-variance and unbiased estimator applicable to
any model with binary latent variables. However, while antithetic sampling
reduces variance, the augmentation process increases variance. We show that ARM
can be improved by analytically integrating out the randomness introduced by
the augmentation process, guaranteeing substantial variance reduction. Our
estimator, DisARM, is simple to implement and has the same computational cost
as ARM. We evaluate DisARM on several generative modeling benchmarks and show
that it consistently outperforms ARM and a strong independent sample baseline
in terms of both variance and log-likelihood. Furthermore, we propose a local

great challenges to the control. The results show that the DRL agent can still
find effective control strategies, but requires much more episodes in the

accompanied by elongation of the recirculation bubble and reduction of
turbulent fluctuations in the cylinder wake. To our best knowledge, this study

derive and discuss new quantitative bounds to characterize the solution map and

explicit expressions for the local and global Lipschitz constants of the
solution map of non-convex or convex optimization problems, respectively. Our
results are geared towards the study of time-varying optimization problems
which are commonplace in various applications of online optimization, including
power systems, robotics, signal processing and more. In this context, our
results can be used to bound the rate of change of the optimizer. To illustrate
the use of our sensitivity bounds we generalize existing arguments to quantify
the tracking performance of continuous-time, monotone running algorithms.
Further, we introduce a new continuous-time running algorithm for time-varying
constrained optimization which we model as a so-called perturbed sweeping
process. For this discontinuous scheme, we establish an explicit bound on the
asymptotic solution tracking for a class of convex problems.

countries with monthly local prices and real-time conflict data reported in the
Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (ACLED) from January 2015 until
early May 2020. Lockdowns and recent welfare policies have been implemented in
light of COVID-19, but in some contexts also likely in response to ongoing
conflicts. To mitigate the potential risk of endogeneity, we use instrumental
variables. We exploit the exogeneity of global commodity prices, and three
variables that increase the risk of COVID-19 and efficiency in response such as
countries colonial heritage, male mortality rate attributed to air pollution
and prevalence of diabetes in adults. We find that the probability of
experiencing riots, violence against civilians, food-related conflicts and food
looting has increased since lockdowns. Food vulnerability has been a
contributing factor. A 10% increase in the local price index is associated with
an increase of 0.7 percentage points in violence against civilians.
Nonetheless, for every additional anti-poverty measure implemented in response
to COVID-19 the probability of experiencing violence against civilians, riots
and food-related conflicts declines by approximately 0.2 percentage points.
These anti-poverty measures also reduce the number of fatalities associated
with these conflicts. Overall, our findings reveal that food vulnerability has
increased conflict risks, but also offer an optimistic view of the importance

selecting users to produce blocks (e.g., proof-of-work vs. proof-of-stake) and
the method to establish consensus (e.g., longest chain rules vs. BFT-inspired
protocols). These fundamental differences have hindered ""apples-to-apples""
comparisons between different categories of blockchain protocols and, in turn,
the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits.
  This paper presents a parsimonious abstraction sufficient for capturing and
comparing properties of many well-known permissionless blockchain protocols,
simultaneously capturing essential properties of both proof-of-work and
proof-of-stake protocols, and of both longest-chain-type and BFT-type

process, allowing us to isolate the properties of the selection process which
are significant for protocol design.
  We illustrate our framework's utility with two results. First, we prove an

partially synchronous setting. This theorem shows that a fundamental dichotomy
holds between protocols (such as Bitcoin) that are adaptive, in the sense that
they can function given unpredictable levels of participation, and protocols
(such as Algorand) that have certain finality properties. Second, we formalize
the idea that proof-of-work (PoW) protocols and non-PoW protocols can be

omnipresent in star formation regions, which is still not fully understood. In
addressing this issue, we find that the computation method of the HIA by the
ratio of the peak intensities may have defects, especially when being used to
process the spectra with low velocity dispersions. Therefore we define the
integrated HIAs of the ISLs (HIA$_{\rm IS}$) and OSLs (HIA$_{\rm OS}$) by the
ratio of their redshifted to blueshifted integrated intensities and develop a
procedure to calculate them. Based on this procedure, we present a systematic

that integrated HIA$_{\rm IS}$ and HIA$_{\rm OS}$ are commonly present in the
Orion A MC and no clear distinction is found at different locations of the MC.
The medians of the integrated HIA$_{\rm IS}$ and HIA$_{\rm OS}$ are
0.921$\pm$0.003 and 1.422$\pm$0.009, respectively, which is consistent with the
HIA core model and inconsistent with the CE model. Selecting those 170
positions where both integrated HIAs deviate by more than 3-$\sigma$ from
unity, most (166) are characterized by HIA$_{\rm IS}$<1 and HIA$_{\rm OS}$>1,
which suggests that the HIA core model plays a more significant role than the
CE model. The remaining four positions are consistent with the CE model. We
compare the integrated HIAs with the para-NH$_{3}$ column density

dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm v}$), non-thermal velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{\rm

gravity has been obtained where dilaton field is coupled with nonlinear Maxwell
invariant. The background space-time is a stationary axisymmetric geometry.
Here, it has been shown that the dilaton potential can be written in the form
of generalized three Liouville-type potentials. In the presence of this three
Liouville-type dilaton potential, the asymptotic behavior of the obtained
solutions are neither flat nor (A)dS. One bizarre property of the electric
field is that the electric field goes to zero when $r\rightarrow 0$ and
diverges at $r\rightarrow\infty$. We show the validity of the first law of
thermodynamics in thermodynamic investigations. The local and global
thermodynamical stability are investigated through the use of heat capacity and
Gibbs free-energy. Also, the bounded, phase transition and the Hawking-Page
phase transition points as well as the ranges of black hole stability have been
shown in the corresponding diagrams. From these diagrams, we can say that the
presence of the dilaton field makes the solutions to be locally stable near
origin and vanishes the global stability of our solutions. In final
thermodynamics analysis, we obtain the Smarr formula for our solution. We will
show that the presence of dilaton field brings a new term in the Smarr formula.
Also, we find that the dilaton field makes the black hole(AdS) mass to decrease

involves solving an ODE which can become arbitrarily complex during training.
Recent works have shown that regularizing the dynamics of the ODE can partially
alleviate this. In this paper we propose a new regularization technique:
randomly sampling the end time of the ODE during training. The proposed
regularization is simple to implement, has negligible overhead and is effective
across a wide variety of tasks. Further, the technique is orthogonal to several
other methods proposed to regularize the dynamics of ODEs and as such can be
used in conjunction with them. We show through experiments on normalizing
flows, time series models and image recognition that the proposed
regularization can significantly decrease training time and even improve
performance over baseline models.

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the recent years, researchers proposed a number of successful methods to
perform out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in deep neural networks (DNNs). So
far the scope of the highly accurate methods has been limited to image level
classification tasks. However, attempts for generally applicable methods beyond
classification did not attain similar performance. In this paper, we address
this limitation by proposing a simple yet effective task-agnostic OOD detection
method. We estimate the probability density functions (pdfs) of intermediate
features of a pre-trained DNN by performing kernel density estimation (KDE) on
the training dataset. As direct application of KDE to feature maps is hindered
by their high dimensionality, we use a set of lower-dimensional marginalized
KDE models instead of a single high-dimensional one. At test time, we evaluate
the pdfs on a test sample and produce a confidence score that indicates the
sample is OOD. The use of KDE eliminates the need for making simplifying
assumptions about the underlying feature pdfs and makes the proposed method
task-agnostic. We perform extensive experiments on classification tasks using
benchmark datasets for OOD detection. Additionally, we perform experiments on
medical image segmentation tasks using brain MRI datasets. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves high OOD detection
performance in both classification and segmentation tasks and improves
state-of-the-art in almost all cases. Code is available at

n-dodecane is modeled as a sinusoidal function parametrized by stratification

one-dimensional setup is investigated by hundreds of chemical kinetics
simulations in (Y,$\lambda$) parameter space. Further, the concepts by Sankaran

accuracy, yet the further improvement is restricted by the lagged tracking
robustness. We find the underlying reason is that the regression network in

\geq0.6$). This mechanism makes it difficult to refine the anchors whose
overlap with the target objects are small. In this paper, we propose a novel
object-aware anchor-free network to address this issue. First, instead of
refining the reference anchor boxes, we directly predict the position and scale
of target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in groundtruth
boxes is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying inexact predictions
of target objects during inference. Second, we introduce a feature alignment
module to learn an object-aware feature from predicted bounding boxes. The
object-aware feature can further contribute to the classification of target
objects and background. Moreover, we present a novel tracking framework based

Repeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and

Chabauty) in the unipotent case by adding a reductive quotient of the

allows one to apply Chabauty-type methods to fundamental groups with trivial

Umklapp electron-electron scattering and (2) attractive interaction between
free electrons in transition metals because of screening of the d-band
electrons by the s-band electrons. [1] However, there is no experimental

model complexity and improve the generalization performance of deep neural
networks. The spherical CNNs are successful examples, producing
SO(3)-equivariant representations of spherical inputs. There are two main types
of spherical CNNs. The first type lifts the inputs to functions on the rotation
group SO(3) and applies convolutions on the group, which are computationally
expensive since SO(3) has one extra dimension. The second type applies
convolutions directly on the sphere, which are limited to zonal (isotropic)
filters, and thus have limited expressivity. In this paper, we present a new
type of spherical CNN that allows anisotropic filters in an efficient way,
without ever leaving the spherical domain. The key idea is to consider
spin-weighted spherical functions, which were introduced in physics in the
study of gravitational waves. These are complex-valued functions on the sphere
whose phases change upon rotation. We define a convolution between
spin-weighted functions and build a CNN based on it. The spin-weighted
functions can also be interpreted as spherical vector fields, allowing
applications to tasks where the inputs or outputs are vector fields.
Experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods on tasks like
classification of spherical images, classification of 3D shapes and semantic
segmentation of spherical panoramas.

speed up optimization, their effect on generalization has been called into
question. This work presents a more nuanced view on how the \textit{implicit
bias} of first- and second-order methods affects the comparison of
generalization properties. We provide an exact asymptotic bias-variance
decomposition of the generalization error of overparameterized ridgeless
regression under a general class of preconditioner $\boldsymbol{P}$, and
consider the inverse population Fisher information matrix (used in NGD) as a
particular example. We determine the optimal $\boldsymbol{P}$ for both the bias
and variance, and find that the relative generalization performance of
different optimizers depends on the label noise and the ""shape"" of the signal
(true parameters): when the labels are noisy, the model is misspecified, or the
signal is misaligned with the features, NGD can achieve lower risk; conversely,
GD generalizes better than NGD under clean labels, a well-specified model, or
aligned signal. Based on this analysis, we discuss several approaches to manage
the bias-variance tradeoff, and the potential benefit of interpolating between
GD and NGD. We then extend our analysis to regression in the reproducing kernel
Hilbert space and demonstrate that preconditioned GD can decrease the
population risk faster than GD. Lastly, we empirically compare the
generalization error of first- and second-order optimizers in neural network
experiments, and observe robust trends matching our theoretical analysis.

Floquet insulator, which exhibits topologically quantized chiral edge states

the response of this topological system to time-dependent noise, which breaks
the topologically protecting Floquet symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that the
quantized response, given by partially filling the fermionic system and
measuring charge pumped per cycle, remains quantized up to finite noise

Pauli blocking of edge state decay, which we expect should be robust against
interactions. We determine the boundaries of the topological phase for a system
with spatial disorder numerically through level statistics, and corroborate our
results in the limit of vanishing disorder through an analytical Floquet

$70.0 \pm 9.9$ mJy at the wavelength of 350 $\mu$m. A close investigation into
its radio-to-optical spectrum indicates that the mid-infrared excess over the
radio synchrotron component, detected with WISE and Spitzer, significantly
contributes to the far-infrared band. Thanks to the SPIRE data, it is revealed
that the spectrum of the excess is described by a broken power-law model
subjected to a high-energy cutoff. By applying the radiative cooling break
under continuous energy injection ($\Delta \alpha = 0.5$), the broken power-law
model supports an idea that the excess originates in 10-pc scale substructures
within the hot spot. From the break frequency, $\nu_{\rm b} = 1.6_{-1.0}^{+3.0}
\times 10^{12}$ Hz, the magnetic field was estimated as $B\simeq1$-$4$ mG. This
is higher than the minimum-energy magnetic field of the substructures by a
factor of $3$--$10$. Even if the origin of the excess is larger than $\sim 100$
pc, the magnetic field stronger than the minimum-energy field is confirmed. It
is proposed that regions with a magnetic field locally boosted via plasma
turbulence are observed as the substructures. The derived energy index below
the break, $\alpha \sim 0.22$ (conservatively $<0.42$), is difficult to be
attributed to the strong-shock acceleration ($\alpha = 0.5$). Stochastic
acceleration and magnetic reconnection are considered as a plausible

the Doppler cross-correlation technique to search for the molecular signatures
of TiO and H$_2$O in these spectra, using models based on the TiO line list of
Plez (2012). Though we cannot exclude line-list-dependent effects, our data do
not corroborate previous indications of a thermal inversion. Instead we place a
$3\sigma$ upper limit of $10^{-9}$ on the volume mixing ratio of TiO for the
T-P profile we consider. While we are unable to constrain the volume mixing
ratio of water, our strongest constraint on TiO comes from day-side emission
spectra. This apparent absence of a stratosphere sits in stark contrast to
previous observations of WASP-33b as well as theoretical predictions for the

unknown parameters of Kerr black holes, giving us a new window into their

studies because it is thought their properties can be reconstructed more
precisely and with less systematics. As relaxed clusters are desirable, there
exist a plethora of criteria for classifying a galaxy cluster as relaxed. In
this work, we examine $9$ commonly used observational and theoretical
morphological metrics extracted from $54,000$ Mock-X synthetic X-ray images of
galaxy clusters taken from the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulation
suites. We find that the simulated criteria distributions are in reasonable
agreement with the observed distributions. Many criteria distributions evolve
as a function of redshift, cluster mass, numerical resolution and subgrid
physics, limiting the effectiveness of a single relaxation threshold value. All
criteria are positively correlated with each other, however, the strength of
the correlation is sensitive to redshift, mass and numerical choices. Driven by
the intrinsic scatter inherent to all morphological metrics and the arbitrary
nature of relaxation threshold values, we find the consistency of relaxed
subsets defined by the different metrics to be relatively poor. Therefore, the
use of relaxed cluster subsets introduces significant selection effects that
are non-trivial to resolve.

the SMGs are shown to lie along the line of sight towards DRC; one SMG is
spurious. Although at first sight this rate of association is consistent with
earlier predictions, associations with the bright SMGs are rarer than expected,
which suggests caution when interpreting continuum over-densities. We consider
the implications of all 14 confirmed DRC components passing simultaneously
through an active phase of star formation. In the simplest explanation, we see
only the tip of the iceberg in terms of star formation and gas available for
future star formation, consistent with our remarkable finding that the majority
of newly confirmed DRC galaxies are not the brightest continuum emitters in
their immediate vicinity. Thus while ALMA continuum follow-up of SMGs
identifies the brightest continuum emitters in each field, it does not
necessarily reveal all the gas-rich galaxies. To hunt effectively for
protocluster members requires wide and deep spectral-line imaging to uncover
any relatively continuum-faint galaxies that are rich in atomic or molecular
gas. Searching with short-baseline arrays or single-dish facilities, the true

explore multiple magnetic field strengths and equations of state. We use a new
H$_2$ cooling function for $n_{\rm H} \leq 10^5\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, $T\leq
5000\,{\rm K}$, and variable H$_2$ fraction. We make two important simplifying
assumptions: (i) the ${\rm H}_2/{\rm H}$ fraction is fixed everywhere, and (ii)
we exclude from our analysis regions where the ion-neutral drift velocity is
calculated to be greater than 5 km/s. Our models produce H$_2$ emission lines

an irregular galaxy. Among its principal defining morphological features, its
off-centred bar and single spiral arm stand out, defining a whole family of
galaxies known as the Magellanic spirals (Sm). These structures are thought to
be triggered by tidal interactions and possibly maintained via gas accretion.
However, it is still unknown whether they are long-lived stable structures. In
this work, by combining photometry that reaches down to the oldest main
sequence turn-off in the colour-magnitude diagrams (CMD, up to a distance of
$\sim$4.4 kpc from the LMC centre) from the SMASH survey and CMD fitting
techniques, we find compelling evidence supporting the long-term stability of
the LMC spiral arm, dating the origin of this structure to more than 2~Gyr ago.
The evidence suggests that the close encounter between the LMC and the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC) that produced the gaseous Magellanic Stream and its
Leading Arm (LA) also triggered the formation of the LMC's spiral arm. Given
the mass difference between the Clouds and the notable consequences of this
interaction, we can speculate that this should have been one of their closest
encounters. These results set important constraints on the timing of LMC-SMC
collisions, as well as on the physics behind star formation induced by tidal
encounters.

host star. Such free-floating planetary mass objects (FFPs) will be detected as
isolated microlensing events with timescales shorter than a few days. A
measurement of the abundance and mass function of FFPs is a powerful diagnostic
of the formation and evolution of planetary systems, as well as the physics of
the formation of isolated objects via direct collapse. We show that Roman will
be sensitive to FFP lenses that have masses from that of Mars ($0.1 M_\oplus$)
to gas giants ($M\gtrsim100M_\oplus$) as isolated lensing events with
timescales from a few hours to several tens of days, respectively. We
investigate the impact of the detection criteria on the survey, especially in
the presence of finite-source effects for low-mass lenses. The number of
detections will depend on the abundance of such FFPs as a function of mass,
which is at present poorly constrained. Assuming that FFPs follow the fiducial
mass function of cold, bound planets adapted from Cassan et al. (2012), we
estimate that Roman will detect $\sim250$ FFPs with masses down to that of Mars
(including $\sim 60$ with masses $\le M_\oplus$). We also predict that Roman
will improve the upper limits on FFP populations by at least an order of
magnitude compared to currently-existing constraints.

$\Delta t=1.3$ days) red ($g-r\approx0.6$ mag) and luminous ($M_{1626}=-25.9$)
optical transient at $z=2.9$ discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF).
AT2020blt shares several features in common with afterglows to long-duration
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs): (1) an optical light curve well-described by a broken
power-law with a break at $t_\mathrm{j}=1$ day (observer-frame); (2) a luminous
$(L_X = 10^{46}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{s}^{-1})$ X-ray counterpart; and (3)
luminous ($L_\nu = 4 \times 10^{31}$ $\mathrm{erg}$ $\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$
$\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 10 GHz) radio emission. However, no GRB was detected in
the 0.74d between the last ZTF non-detection ($r > 20.64$) and the first ZTF
detection ($r = 19.57$), with an upper limit on the isotropic-equivalent
gamma-ray energy release of $E_{\gamma,\mathrm{iso}} < 7 \times 10^{52}$ erg.
AT2020blt is thus the third afterglow-like transient discovered without a
detected GRB counterpart (after PTF11agg and ZTF19abvizsw) and the second
(after ZTF19abvizsw) with a redshift measurement. We conclude that the
properties of AT2020blt are consistent with a classical (initial Lorentz factor
$\Gamma_0 \gtrsim 100$) on-axis GRB that was missed by high-energy satellites.
Furthermore, by estimating the rate of transients with light curves similar to
that of AT2020blt in ZTF high-cadence data, we agree with previous results that
there is no evidence for an afterglow-like phenomenon that is significantly
more common than classical GRBs. We conclude by discussing the status and
future of fast-transient searches in wide-field high-cadence optical surveys.

ATLAS component associated with the broadening in the stream width (the
""broadening"" feature). These gaps have likely been created by small mass
perturbers, such as dark matter halos, as the AAU stream is the most distant
cold stream known with severe variations in both the stream surface density and
the stream track on the sky. With the stream track, stream distance and

much debate on which mechanism can energetically maintain this turbulence.
Among the possible candidates, supernova (SN) explosions are likely the primary
drivers but doubts remain on whether they can be sufficient in regions of
moderate star formation activity, in particular in the outer parts of discs. In
this paper, we measure the SN efficiency $\eta$, namely the fraction of the
total SN energy needed to sustain turbulence in galaxies, and verify that SNe
can indeed be the sole driving mechanism. The key novelty of our approach is
that we take into account the increased turbulence dissipation timescale
associated to the flaring in outer regions of gaseous discs. We analyse the
distribution and kinematics of HI and CO in 10 nearby star-forming galaxies to
obtain the radial profiles of the kinetic energy per unit area, for both the
atomic gas and the molecular gas. We use a theoretical model to reproduce the
observed energy with the sum of turbulent energy from SNe, as inferred from the
observed star formation rate (SFR) surface density, and the gas thermal energy.
We find that the observed kinetic energy is remarkably well reproduced by our
model across the whole extent of the galactic discs, assuming $\eta$ constant
with the galactocentric radius. Taking into account the uncertainties on the
SFR surface density and on the atomic gas phase, we obtain that the median SN
efficiencies for our sample of galaxies are $\langle \eta_\mathrm{atom}
\rangle=0.015_{-0.008}^{+0.018}$ for the atomic gas and $\langle
\eta_\mathrm{mol} \rangle = 0.003_{-0.002}^{+0.006}$ for the molecular gas. We
conclude that SNe alone can sustain gas turbulence in nearby galaxies with only
few percent of their energy and that there is essentially no need for any
further source of energy.

our software code to the Barclay et al. (2018) predicted TESS discoveries, as
well as to TOIs downloaded from the ExoFOP-TESS website. We estimate that
MuSCAT (MuSCAT2 values in parentheses) will be able to use its multi-color

all TESS discoveries, and $\sim$13% ($\sim$15%) of $R_{\rm pl} < 4R_\oplus$

chemical inhomogeneities of this level may be attributable to the removal of

B-type giant + black hole binary with an orbital period of 40d and an outer Be
tertiary. This interpretation is mainly based on two inferences: that the
emission attributed to the outer Be star is stationary, and that the inner
star, which is used as mass calibrator for the black hole, is a B-type giant.
We re-investigate the properties of HR 6819 by spectral disentangling and an
atmosphere analysis of the disentangled spectra to search for a possibly
simpler alternative explanation for HR 6819. Disentangling implies that the Be
component is not a static tertiary, but rather a component of the binary in the
40-d orbit. The inferred radial velocity amplitudes imply an extreme mass ratio
of M_2/M_1 = 15 +/- 3. We infer spectroscopic masses of 0.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$
Msun and 6$^{+5}_{-3}$ Msun for the primary and secondary, which agree well
with the dynamical masses for an inclination of i = 32 deg. This indicates that
the primary might be a stripped star rather than a B-type giant. Evolutionary
modelling suggests that a possible progenitor system would be a tight (P_i ~
2d) B+B binary system that experienced conservative mass transfer. While the
observed nitrogen enrichment of the primary conforms with the predictions of
the evolutionary models, we find no indications for the predicted He
enrichment. We suggest that HR 6819 is a binary system consisting of a stripped
B-type primary and a rapidly-rotating Be star that formed from a previous
mass-transfer event. In the framework of this interpretation, HR 6819 does not
contain a black hole. Interferometry can distinguish between these two
scenarios by providing an independent measurement of the separation between the
visible components.

dense star clusters, dynamical channels may exist that allow construction of
BHs with masses in excess of those allowed from single star evolution. The
detection of BHs in this so-called ""upper-mass gap"" would provide strong
evidence for the dynamical processing of BHs prior to their eventual merger.
Here, we explore in detail the formation of BHs with masses within or above the
pair-instability gap through collisions of young massive stars in dense star
clusters. We run a suite of 68 independent cluster simulations, exploring a
variety of physical assumptions pertaining to growth through stellar
collisions, including primordial cluster mass segregation and the efficiency of
envelope stripping during collisions. We find that as many as $\sim20\%$ of all
BH progenitors undergo one or more collisions prior to stellar collapse and up
to $\sim1\%$ of all BHs reside within or above the pair-instability gap through
the effects of these collisions. We show that these BHs readily go on to merge
with other BHs in the cluster, creating a population of massive BH mergers at a
rate that may compete with the ""multiple-generation"" merger channel described
in other analyses. This has clear relevance for the formation of very massive
BH binaries as recently detected by LIGO/Virgo in GW190521. Finally, we
describe how stellar collisions in clusters may provide a unique pathway to
pair-instability supernovae and briefly discuss the expected rate of these
events and other electromagnetic transients.

astrophysical constraints are completely washed out for mediators lighter than

also weaken, but in a complementary fashion; they supersede the astrophysical
capture bounds for small or large DM mass, respectively for asymmetric or
annihilating DM. Repulsive self-interactions of DM have an insignificant impact
on the total capture rate, but a significant impact on the black hole formation
criterion. This further weakens the constraints on DM-nucleon interaction
strength for asymmetric self-repelling DM, whereas constraints remain unaltered
for annihilating self-repelling DM. We use the correct Hawking evaporation rate

generally depend on both the microscopic polarization and magnetization fields,

from the latter vanish in linear response for the class of insulators we

""site"" polarization and magnetization fields, from which ""site multipole

follow, and we identify the relevant contributions to them; for electromagnetic
fields varying little over a lattice constant these are the electric and

unit volume. A description of optical activity and related magneto-optical
phenomena follows from the response of these macroscopic quantities to the
electromagnetic field and, while in this paper we work within the independent
particle and frozen-ion approximations, both optical rotary dispersion and
circular dichroism can be described with this strategy. Earlier expressions
describing the magnetoelectric effect are recovered as the zero frequency limit
of our more general equations. Since our site quantities are introduced with
the use of Wannier functions, the site multipole moments and their macroscopic

numerical ray-tracing simulations, specifically through Millennium Simulation

construct a matched pair of adapted filter functions for the galaxy density and
the tangential shear signal. We compare the performance of our new filter to
the previously used top-hat filter, applying both to a different and
independent set of numerical simulations (SLICS, cosmo-SLICS). Results. We show
that the adapted filter yields a better correlation between the total matter

signal-to-noise ratio to constrain the bias between the total matter and the
galaxy distribution, and we show that it is, in general, a more sensitive
discriminator between different cosmologies, with the exception of cosmologies
with very large $\sigma_8$ values. All analyses lead to the conclusion that our

single site of the one-dimensional XXZ model is enough to bring this
interacting integrable spin-1/2 system to the chaotic regime. Here, we show
that this is not unique to this model, but happens also to the Ising model in a
transverse field and to the spin-1 Lai-Sutherland chain. The larger the system
is, the smaller the amplitude of the local perturbation for the onset of chaos.
We focus on two indicators of chaos, the correlation hole, which is a dynamical
tool, and the distribution of off-diagonal elements of local observables, which
is used in the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Both methods avoid
spectrum unfolding and can detect chaos even when the eigenvalues are not
separated by symmetry sectors.

spectro-interferometry with an astrometric accuracy of 1 $\mu$as

photocenter displacement associated with the stellar rotation. Taking
inclination constraints from astroseismology into account, we constrain the
3-dimensional orientation of the stellar spin axis and find that $\beta$ Pic b
orbits its host star on a prograde orbit. The angular momentum vectors of the
stellar photosphere, the planet, and the outer debris disk are well-aligned
with mutual inclinations $<3\pm5^{\circ}$, which indicates that $\beta$ Pic b
formed in a system without significant primordial misalignments. Our results
demonstrate the potential of infrared interferometry to measure the spin-orbit
alignment for wide-separation planetary systems, probing a highly complementary
regime to the parameter space accessible with the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect.
If the low obliquity is confirmed by measurements on a larger sample of

electromagnetic fields to small dimensions. This property makes them ideal
platforms for subwavelength optical control and manipulation at the nanoscale.
The momenta of these plasmons are even further increased if a scheme of
metal-insulator-metal and graphene-insulator-metal are used for SPPs and GPs,
respectively. However, with such large momenta, their far-field excitation
becomes challenging. In this work, we consider hybrids of graphene and metallic
nanostructures and study the physical mechanisms behind the interaction of
far-field light with the supported high momenta plasmon modes. While there are
some similarities in the properties of GPs and SPPs, since both are of the
plasmon-polariton type, their physical properties are also distinctly
different. For GPs we find two different physical mechanism related to either
GPs confined to isolated cavities, or large area collective grating couplers.
Strikingly, we find that although the two systems are conceptually different,
under specific conditions they can behave similarly. By applying the same study
to SPPs, we find a different physical behavior, which fundamentally stems from
the different dispersion relations of SPPs as compared to GPs. Furthermore,
these hybrids produce large field enhancements that can also be electrically
tuned and modulated making them the ideal candidates for a variety of plasmonic
devices.

observe positive rotation measures (RMs) when the radio line of sight first
encounters the CME, and that the sign should reverse to negative within a

reversal is not, but the VLA data unfortunately end too soon to be sure of the

centralised training and decentralised execution paradigm. In order to enable
easy decentralisation, QMIX restricts the joint action $Q$-values it can
represent to be a monotonic mixing of each agent's utilities. However, this
restriction prevents it from representing value functions in which an agent's
ordering over its actions can depend on other agents' actions. To analyse this
representational limitation, we first formalise the objective QMIX optimises,
which allows us to view QMIX as an operator that first computes the
$Q$-learning targets and then projects them into the space representable by
QMIX. This projection returns a representable $Q$-value that minimises the
unweighted squared error across all joint actions. We show in particular that
this projection can fail to recover the optimal policy even with access to
$Q^*$, which primarily stems from the equal weighting placed on each joint
action. We rectify this by introducing a weighting into the projection, in
order to place more importance on the better joint actions. We propose two
weighting schemes and prove that they recover the correct maximal action for
any joint action $Q$-values, and therefore for $Q^*$ as well. Based on our
analysis and results in the tabular setting, we introduce two scalable versions
of our algorithm, Centrally-Weighted (CW) QMIX and Optimistically-Weighted (OW)
QMIX and demonstrate improved performance on both predator-prey and challenging
multi-agent StarCraft benchmark tasks.

depiction of very small vessels in the brain. Non-Deep Learning-based

often fail to segment small vessels. The sensitivity of these methods to small

larger datasets. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture to
automatically segment small vessels in 7 Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) Magnetic

qualitatively against the test set and achieved a Dice score of 80.44 $\pm$

supermassive black hole appears to limit star formation. Abundant
circumstantial evidence suggests that accumulation of cold gas near the central
black hole strongly boosts the feedback output, keeping the ambient medium in a
state marginally unstable to condensation and formation of cold gas clouds.
However, the ability of that mechanism to self-regulate may depend on numerous
environmental factors, including the depth of the potential well and the
pressure of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we present a
suite of numerical simulations that explores the dependence of cold-fuelled
bipolar kinetic feedback on those environmental factors. Halo mass in this
simulation suite ranges from $2 \times 10^{12} \, M_\odot$ to $8 \times 10^{14}
\, M_\odot$. We include the spatially extended mass and energy input from the
massive galaxy's old stellar population, which is capable of sweeping gas out
of the galaxy and away from the central black hole if the confining CGM
pressure is sufficiently low. Our simulations show that this feedback mechanism
is tightly self-regulating in a massive galaxy with a deep central potential
and low CGM pressure, permitting only small amounts of multiphase gas to
accumulate and allowing almost no star formation. In a massive galaxy of
similar mass but a shallower central potential and greater CGM pressure the
same feedback mechanism is more episodic, producing extended multiphase gas and
occasionally allowing small rates of star formation ($\sim 0.1 \, M_\odot \,
{\rm yr}^{-1}$). At the low-mass end of the explored range the mechanism
becomes implausibly explosive, perhaps because the ambient gas initially has no
angular momentum, which would have reduced the amount of condensed gas capable
of fueling feedback.

also use Spitzer photometry at 3.6 um to decompose the rotation curves into the

Unfortunately, this process comes at a large computational cost because the

black-box or simulation-based learning and control problems, where the gradient

using the objective function values. Many existing ZO algorithms adopt
two-point feedback schemes due to their fast convergence rate compared to
one-point feedback schemes. However, two-point schemes require two evaluations
of the objective function at each iteration, which can be impractical in
applications where the data are not all available a priori, e.g., in online
optimization. In this paper, we propose a novel one-point feedback scheme that
queries the function value once at each iteration and estimates the gradient
using the residual between two consecutive points. When optimizing a
deterministic Lipschitz function, we show that the query complexity of ZO with
the proposed one-point residual feedback matches that of ZO with the existing
two-point schemes. Moreover, the query complexity of the proposed algorithm can
be improved when the objective function has Lipschitz gradient. Then, for
stochastic bandit optimization problems where only noisy objective function
values are given, we show that ZO with one-point residual feedback achieves the
same convergence rate as that of two-point scheme with uncontrollable data
samples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed one-point residual
feedback via extensive numerical experiments.

zeroth-order policy optimization method is that it allows the agents to compute
the local policy gradients needed to update their local policy functions using
local estimates of the global accumulated rewards that depend on partial state

to calculate the local policy gradients, we develop a new distributed
zeroth-order policy gradient estimator that relies on one-point
residual-feedback which, compared to existing zeroth-order estimators that also
rely on one-point feedback, significantly reduces the variance of the policy
gradient estimates improving, in this way, the learning performance. We show
that the proposed distributed zeroth-order policy optimization method with

depends on the number of consensus steps used to calculate the local estimates

that our formulation correctly tracks local turbulent motions, produces
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and generates a super-rotating jet on hot

great potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors usually based on

quantum dot transitions and tunnelling barriers asymmetries results in a narrow
linewidth photocurrent response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak
THz radiation. That device was sensitive to one frequency, corresponding to
transitions between equidistant quantized states. In this work we show, using
numerical together with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy studies of a
defect-induced metallic zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot that
simultaneously breaking various symmetries in metallic nanotube quantum dots of
arbitrary chirality strongly relaxes the selection rules in the electric dipole
approximation, and removes energy degeneracies. This leads to a richer set of
allowed optical transitions spanning frequencies from 1 THz to several tens of

that the device is largely unaffected by temperatures up to 100 K, making
carbon nanotube quantum dots with broken symmetries a promising platform to

of Turbul. 2020), that dipoles are as important to the dynamics of decaying
two-dimensional turbulence as individual vortex cores, it is found that the
kinetic energy of this flow is carried by elongated streams formed by the
concatenation of dipoles. Vortices separate into a family of small fast-moving
cores, and another family of larger slowly moving ones, which can be described
as `frozen' into a slowly evolving `crystal'. The kinematics of both families
are very different, and only the former is self-similar. The latter is
responsible for most of the kinetic energy of the flow, and its vortices form
the dipoles and the streams. Mechanisms are discussed for the growth of this
slow component.

As of June 18, 2020, in total, there are now over 8,400,000 cases and over
450,000 related deaths. This causes massive losses in the economy and jobs
globally and confining about 58% of the global population. In this paper, we
introduce SenWave, a novel sentimental analysis work using 105+ million
collected tweets and Weibo messages to evaluate the global rise and falls of
sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. To make a fine-grained analysis on the
feeling when we face this global health crisis, we annotate 10K tweets in
English and 10K tweets in Arabic in 10 categories, including optimistic,
thankful, empathetic, pessimistic, anxious, sad, annoyed, denial, official
report, and joking. We then utilize an integrated transformer framework, called
simpletransformer, to conduct multi-label sentimental classification by
fine-tuning the pre-trained language model on the labeled data. Meanwhile, in
order for a more complete analysis, we also translate the annotated English
tweets into different languages (Spanish, Italian, and French) to generated
training data for building sentiment analysis models for these languages.
SenWave thus reveals the sentiment of global conversation in six different
languages on COVID-19 (covering English, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic and
Chinese), followed the spread of the epidemic. The conversation showed a
remarkably similar pattern of rapid rise and slow decline over time across all
nations, as well as on special topics like the herd immunity strategies, to
which the global conversation reacts strongly negatively. Overall, SenWave
shows that optimistic and positive sentiments increased over time, foretelling
a desire to seek, together, a reset for an improved COVID-19 world.

dataset like CIFAR10 often assign high likelihoods to images from datasets with
different objects (e.g., SVHN). We refine previous investigations of this
failure at anomaly detection for invertible generative networks and provide a
clear explanation of it as a combination of model bias and domain prior:
Convolutional networks learn similar low-level feature distributions when
trained on any natural image dataset and these low-level features dominate the
likelihood. Hence, when the discriminative features between inliers and
outliers are on a high-level, e.g., object shapes, anomaly detection becomes
particularly challenging. To remove the negative impact of model bias and
domain prior on detecting high-level differences, we propose two methods,
first, using the log likelihood ratios of two identical models, one trained on
the in-distribution data (e.g., CIFAR10) and the other one on a more general
distribution of images (e.g., 80 Million Tiny Images). We also derive a novel
outlier loss for the in-distribution network on samples from the more general
distribution to further improve the performance. Secondly, using a multi-scale
model like Glow, we show that low-level features are mainly captured at early
scales. Therefore, using only the likelihood contribution of the final scale
performs remarkably well for detecting high-level feature differences of the
out-of-distribution and the in-distribution. This method is especially useful
if one does not have access to a suitable general distribution. Overall, our
methods achieve strong anomaly detection performance in the unsupervised
setting, and only slightly underperform state-of-the-art classifier-based
methods in the supervised setting. Code can be found at

systematic error called confirmation bias, has long been an integral part of
data analysis in many research areas. In cosmology, blind analysis is recently
making its entrance, as the field progresses into a fully fledged
high-precision science. The credibility, reliability and robustness of results
from future sky-surveys will dramatically increase if the effect of
confirmation bias is kept under control by using an appropriate blinding
procedure. Here, we present a catalog-level blinding scheme for galaxy
clustering data apt to be used in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We shift
the individual galaxy positions along the line of sight based on 1) a geometric
shift mimicking the Alcock-Paczynski effect and 2) a perturbative shift akin to
redshift-space distortions. This procedure has several advantages. After
combining the two steps above, it is almost impossible to accidentally unblind.
The procedure induces a shift in cosmological parameters without changing the
galaxies' angular positions, hence without interfering with the effects of
angular systematics. Since the method is applied at catalog level, there is no
need to adopt several blinding schemes tuned to different summary statistics,
likelihood choices or types of analyses. By testing the method on mock catalogs
and the BOSS DR12 catalog we demonstrate its performance in blinding galaxy
clustering data for relevant cosmological parameters sensitive to the
background expansion rate and the growth rate of structures.

high-dimensional feature vectors lie on a low-dimensional manifold, then
attempt to exploit manifold structure to obtain useful low-dimensional
Euclidean representations of the data. Isomap, a seminal manifold learning
technique, is an elegant synthesis of two simple ideas: the approximation of
Riemannian distances with shortest path distances on a graph that localizes
manifold structure, and the approximation of shortest path distances with
Euclidean distances by multidimensional scaling. We revisit the rationale for
Isomap, clarifying what Isomap does and what it does not. In particular, we
explore the widespread perception that Isomap should only be used when the
manifold is parametrized by a convex region of Euclidean space. We argue that
this perception is based on an extremely narrow interpretation of manifold
learning as parametrization recovery, and we submit that Isomap is better
understood as constructing Euclidean representations of geodesic structure. We
reconsider a well-known example that was previously interpreted as evidence of
Isomap's limitations, and we re-examine the original analysis of Isomap's

businesses. One of its latest incarnations is cryptocurrency mining, where a
website instructs the visitor's browser to participate in building a
cryptocurrency ledger (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) in exchange for a small reward in
the same currency. In its essence, this practice trades the user's electric
bill (or battery level) for cryptocurrency. With user consent, this exchange
can be a legitimate funding source - for example, UNICEF has collected over 27k
charity donations on a website dedicated to this purpose, thehopepage.org.
Regrettably, this practice also easily lends itself to abuse: in this form,
called cryptojacking, attacks surreptitiously mine in the users browser, and
profits are collected either by website owners or by hackers that planted the
mining script into a vulnerable page. Cryptojackers have been bettering their
evasion techniques, incorporating in their toolkits domain fluxing, content
obfuscation, the use of WebAssembly, and throttling. Whereas most
state-of-the-art defenses address multiple of these evasion techniques, none is
resistant against all. In this paper, we offer a novel detection method,
CoinPolice, that is robust against all of the aforementioned evasion
techniques. CoinPolice flips throttling against cryptojackers, artificially
varying the browser's CPU power to observe the presence of throttling. Based on
a deep neural network classifier, CoinPolice can detect 97.87% of hidden miners
with a low false positive rate (0.74%). We compare CoinPolice performance with
the current state of the art and show our approach outperforms it when
detecting aggressively throttled miners. Finally, we deploy Coinpolice to
perform the largest-scale cryptoming investigation to date, identifying 6700

commensurate with their proliferation in real-world applications: both
unanticipated as well as adversarial misclassifications can result in fatal
outcomes. As a consequence, techniques of formal verification have been
recognized as crucial to the design and deployment of safe NNs. In this paper,
we introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered
safety specifications for ReLU NNs -- i.e. polytopic specifications on the
input and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a
relaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem.
However, unique in our approach is the way we use a convex solver not only as a
linear feasibility checker, but also as a means of penalizing the amount of
relaxation allowed in solutions. In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of
the usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function
that penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its
relaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest
relaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further
benefit that the most problematic neurons are conditioned as early as possible,
when conditioning layer by layer. This paradigm can be leveraged to create a
verification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing
approaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties; we
evaluated PEREGRiNN on a standard MNIST robustness verification suite to
substantiate these claims.

learning approaches increasingly used to solve inverse problems.
  In this paper, we provide one such way via an analysis of the generalisation
error of deep learning methods applicable to inverse problems. In particular,
by building on the algorithmic robustness framework, we offer a generalisation
error bound that encapsulates key ingredients associated with the learning
problem such as the complexity of the data space, the size of the training set,
the Jacobian of the deep neural network and the Jacobian of the composition of
the forward operator with the neural network. We then propose a 'plug-and-play'
regulariser that leverages the knowledge of the forward map to improve the
generalization of the network. We likewise also propose a new method allowing
us to tightly upper bound the Lipschitz constants of the relevant functions
that is much more computational efficient than existing ones. We demonstrate
the efficacy of our model-aware regularised deep learning algorithms against

analyze it from the perspective of the data manifold and the presentation of

transformation technique reduces the vulnerability to adversarial examples only
if it approximates the dataset's intrinsic dimension, minimizes codimension,

approach for solving high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems based on
function evaluations. We employ a directional Gaussian smoothing of the target
function that generates a surrogate of the gradient and assists in avoiding bad
local optima by utilizing nonlocal information of the loss landscape. Applying
a deterministic quadrature scheme results in a massively scalable technique
that is sample-efficient and achieves spectral accuracy. At each step we
randomly generate the search directions while primarily following the surrogate
of the smoothed gradient. This enables exploitation of the gradient direction
while maintaining sufficient space exploration, and accelerates convergence
towards the global extrema. In addition, we make use of a local approximation
of the Lipschitz constant in order to adaptively adjust the values of all
hyperparameters, thus removing the careful fine-tuning of current algorithms
that is often necessary to be successful when applied to a large class of
learning tasks. As such, the ASGF strategy offers significant improvements when
solving high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems when compared to other
gradient-free methods (including the so called ""evolutionary strategies"") as
well as iterative approaches that rely on the gradient information of the
objective function. We illustrate the improved performance of this method by
providing several comparative numerical studies on benchmark global
optimization problems and reinforcement learning tasks.

a mere category. The left adjoint of the emerging generalized Guitart
2-adjunction factors through the 2-equivalence of split Grothendieck

time or economic pressures, code developers are often unable to write documents
for all modules in a project. Recently, a supervised artificial neural network
(ANN) approach is proposed to prioritize important modules for documentation
effort. However, as a supervised approach, there is a need to use labeled
training data to train the prediction model, which may not be easy to obtain in
practice. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the ANN approach is generalizable,
as it is only evaluated on several small data sets. In this paper, we propose
an unsupervised approach based on PageRank to prioritize documentation effort.
This approach identifies ""important"" modules only based on the dependence
relationships between modules in a project. As a result, the PageRank approach
does not need any training data to build the prediction model. In order to
evaluate the effectiveness of the PageRank approach, we use six additional
large data sets to conduct the experiments in addition to the same data sets
collected from open-source projects as used in prior studies. The experimental
results show that the PageRank approach is superior to the state-of-the-art ANN
approach in prioritizing important modules for documentation effort. In
particular, due to the simplicity and effectiveness, we advocate that the
PageRank approach should be used as an easy-to-implement baseline in future
research on documentation effort prioritization, and any new approach should be
compared with it to demonstrate its effectiveness.

quantify corneal elasticity ex vivo, they cannot be used clinically. Optical
coherence elastography (OCE), which launches and tracks shear waves to estimate
stiffness, provides an attractive non-contact probe of corneal elasticity. To
date, however, OCE studies report corneal moduli around tens of kPa,
orders-of-magnitude less than those (few MPa) obtained by tensile/inflation
testing. This large discrepancy impedes OCE's clinical adoption. Based on
corneal microstructure, we introduce and fully characterize a
nearly-incompressible transversally isotropic (NITI) model depicting corneal
biomechanics. We show that the cornea must be described by two shear moduli,
contrary to current single-modulus models, decoupling tensile and shear
responses. We measure both as a function of IOP in ex vivo porcine cornea,
obtaining values consistent with both tensile and shear tests. At pressures
above 30 mmHg, the model begins to fail, consistent with non-linear changes in

lakes and a hydrological cycle. Titan's lakes predominantly contain liquid
methane, ethane, and nitrogen, with methane evaporation driving its

non-ideal behavior that causes Titan's lakes to behave differently than Earth's
lakes. Here, we numerically investigate how methane evaporation and non-ideal
interactions affect the physical properties, structure, dynamics, and evolution
of shallow lakes on Titan. We find that, under certain temperature regimes,
methane-rich mixtures are denser than relatively ethane-rich mixtures. This
allows methane evaporation to stratify Titan's lakes into ethane-rich upper
layers and methane-rich lower layers, separated by a strong compositional
gradient. At temperatures above 86K, lakes remain well-mixed and unstratified.
Between 84 and 86K, lakes can stratify episodically. Below 84K, lakes
permanently stratify, and develop very methane-depleted epilimnia. Despite
small seasonal and diurnal deviations (<5K) from typical surface temperatures,
Titan's rain-filled ephemeral lakes and ""phantom lakes"" may nevertheless

operations, and therefore, customer reviews pertaining to the former can enable
us to obtain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the short-distance
aviation service, in general. A four-stage sequential approach is used in this
research, wherein the online reviews are mined in Stage 1, analyzed using the
bigram and trigram models in Stage 2, 7S internal assessment is conducted for
helicopter services in Stage 3, and managerial recommendations for air taxis
are proposed in Stage 4. The insights obtained in this paper could assist any
air taxi companies in providing better customer service when they venture into

computationally-efficient machine learning models. A key feature of a good
pruning algorithm is that it accurately quantifies the relative importance of
the model weights. While model pruning has a rich history, we still don't have
a full grasp of the pruning mechanics even for relatively simple problems
involving linear models or shallow neural nets. In this work, we provide a
principled exploration of pruning by building on a natural notion of
importance. For linear models, we show that this notion of importance is
captured by covariance scaling which connects to the well-known Hessian-based
pruning. We then derive asymptotic formulas that allow us to precisely compare
the performance of different pruning methods. For neural networks, we
demonstrate that the importance can be at odds with larger magnitudes and
proper initialization is critical for magnitude-based pruning. Specifically, we
identify settings in which weights become more important despite becoming
smaller, which in turn leads to a catastrophic failure of magnitude-based
pruning. Our results also elucidate that implicit regularization in the form of
Hessian structure has a catalytic role in identifying the important weights,

The study begins with a theoretical analysis, for arbitrary vibration and any
scanning configuration, which shows that the only measurement required is of
the vibration velocity at the incident point on the final steering mirror in
the direction of the outgoing laser beam and this underpins the two correction
options investigated. Correction sensor location is critical; the first scheme
uses an accelerometer pair located on the SLDV front panel, either side of the
emitted laser beam, while the second uses a single accelerometer located along
the optical axis behind the final steering mirror. Initial experiments with a
vibrating sensor head and stationary target confirmed the sensitivity to sensor
head vibration together with the effectiveness of the correction schemes which
reduced overall error by 17 dB (accelerometer pair) and 27 dB (single

vibration, conducted across a range of scan angles, the correction schemes
reduced error by typically 14 dB (accelerometer pair) and 20 dB (single
accelerometer). RMS phase error was also up to 30% lower for the single
accelerometer option, confirming it as the preferred option. The theory
suggests a geometrical weighting of the correction measurements and this
provides a small additional improvement. Since the direction of the outgoing
laser beam and its incident point on the final steering mirror both change as
the mirrors scan the laser beam, the use of fixed axis correction transducers
mounted in fixed locations makes the correction imperfect. The associated
errors are estimated and expected to be generally small, and the theoretical

stochastic gradient descent based on the Differential Privacy (DP) paradigm,
which can mitigate privacy threats that arise from the presence of sensitive
information in training data. However, one major drawback of training deep
neural networks with DPSGD is a reduction in the models accuracy. In this
paper, we study the effect of normalization layers on the performance of DPSGD.
We demonstrate that normalization layers significantly impact the utility of
deep neural networks with noisy parameters and should be considered essential
ingredients of training with DPSGD. In particular, we propose a novel method
for integrating batch normalization with DPSGD without incurring an additional
privacy loss. With our approach, we are able to train deeper networks and
achieve a better utility-privacy trade-off.

  ordered phase of ice VI",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  More than 20 crystalline and amorphous phases have been reported for ice so
far. This extraordinary polymorphism of ice arises from the geometric
flexibility of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen ordering, and makes ice a unique
presence with its universality in the wide fields of material and earth and
planetary science. A prominent unsolved question concerning the diversity is
whether a hydrogen-disordered phase of ice transforms into only one
hydrogen-ordered phase, as inferred from the current phase diagram of ice,
although its possible hydrogen configurations have close energies. Recent
experiments on a high-pressure hydrogen-disordered phase, ice VI, revealed an
unknown hydrogen-ordered form ($\beta$-XV) besides the known ordered phase, ice
XV, which would be a counterexample of the question. However, due to lack of
experimental evidence, it has not been clarified whether $\beta$-XV is a
distinct crystalline phase. Herein we report a second hydrogen-ordered phase
for ice VI, ice XIX, unambiguously demonstrated by neutron diffraction
measurements. The phase boundary between ice VI and ice XIX shows that ice VI
contracts upon the hydrogen ordering, which thermodynamically stabilizes ice
XIX in higher-pressure region than ice XV because of its smaller volume than
ice XV. The pressure-driven phase competition between hydrogen-ordered phases,
also theoretically suggested in other ice polymorphs, can induce hydrogen
ordering of ice in different manners. Thus, this study demonstrates a hitherto
undiscovered polymorphism of ice.

divergence between the posterior and prior. For so-called linear PAC-Bayes risk
bounds based on the empirical risk of a fixed posterior kernel, it is possible
to minimize the expected value of the bound by choosing the prior to be the
expected posterior, which we call the oracle prior on the account that it is
distribution dependent. In this work, we show that the bound based on the
oracle prior can be suboptimal: In some cases, a stronger bound is obtained by
using a data-dependent oracle prior, i.e., a conditional expectation of the
posterior, given a subset of the training data that is then excluded from the
empirical risk term. While using data to learn a prior is a known heuristic,
its essential role in optimal bounds is new. In fact, we show that using data
can mean the difference between vacuous and nonvacuous bounds. We apply this
new principle in the setting of nonconvex learning, simulating data-dependent
oracle priors on MNIST and Fashion MNIST with and without held-out data, and
demonstrating new nonvacuous bounds in both cases.

computational models are most effective in the accurate detection of lying

machine learning algorithms based on deep learning and traditional
classification with handcrafted features to detect lying postures. We also
investigate what wearing sites are most effective in accurate detection of
lying postures. We extensively evaluate the performance of the proposed
algorithms on nine different body locations and four human lying postures using
two datasets. Our results show that a system with a single accelerometer can be

transient accreting black hole binary systems and feature simultaneous changes
in the spectral hardness and the Power Density Spectrum (PDS). They occur at a
crucial time in the evolution of these systems, when the accretion disk
emission starts to dominate over coronal emission. Flip-flops have only rarely
been observed and are poorly understood.
  Methods: We detect 15 flip-flops in the 2018 outburst of Swift J1658.2-4242,
in observations by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Astrosat, Swift, Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL,
and ATCA. We analyse their light curves, search for periodicities, compute
their PDS, and fit their X-ray spectra, to investigate the source behaviour
during flip-flop transitions, and how the interval featuring flip-flops differs
from the rest of the outburst.
  Results: The flip-flops of Swift J1658.2-4242 are of an extreme variety,
exhibiting flux differences of up to 77% within ~100s, much larger than has
been seen so far. We observe radical changes in the PDS simultaneous with the
sharp flux variations, featuring transitions between the Quasi-Periodic
Oscillation types C and A, which have never been observed before. Changes to
the PDS are delayed, but more rapid than changes in the light curve. Flip-flops
occur in two intervals, separated by two weeks in which these phenomena were
not seen. Transitions between the two flip-flop states occurred at random
integer multiples of a fundamental period, of 2.761ks in the first interval,
and 2.61ks in the second. Spectral analysis reveals the high and low flux
flip-flop states to be similar, but distinct from intervals lacking flip-flops.
A change in the inner temperature of the accretion disk is responsible for most
of the flux difference in the flip-flops. We highlight the importance of
correcting for the influence of the dust scattering halo on the X-ray spectra.

structures need a confinement mechanism to constrain their spreading due to
collisions, dissipative forces, and differential keplerian motion. Here we
report the results of a set of numerical simulations of the system formed by
Neptune, the satellite Galatea, dust ring particles, and hypothetical
co-orbital satellites. This dynamical system depicts a recent confinement
mechanism formed by four co-orbital satellites being responsible for the
azimuthal confinement of the arcs, while Galatea responds for their radial
confinement. After the numerical simulations, the particles were divided into
four groups: particles that stay in the arcs, transient particles, particles
that leave the arcs to the Adams ring, and particles that collide with the
co-orbital satellites. Our results showed that in all arcs the lifetime of the
smaller particles is at most 50 years. After 100 years about 20% of the total
amount of larger particles is still present in the arcs. From our numerical
simulations, the particles should be present in all arcs after 30 years, the
period between the discovery of the arcs up to now. Our results can not explain
the disappearance of the leading arcs, Liberte and Courage unless the arcs are
formed by different particle sizes. Analysis of the dust production, due to
collisions between interplanetary debris onto the surface of the co-orbital
satellites, ruled out the hypothesis that small satellites close to or in the
arc the structure could be its source.

large Fourier dimension that avoid nontrivial solutions of certain classes of
linear equations. In particular, given any finite collection of
translation-invariant linear equations of the form \begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^v m_ix_i=m_0x_0, \; \text{ with } (m_0, m_1, \cdots, m_v) \in
\mathbb N^{v+1}, m_0 = \sum_{i=1}^{v} m_i \text{ and } v \geq 2,

dimension 1 that contains no nontrivial solution of any of these equations; in
other words, there does not exist a vector $(x_0, x_1, \cdots, x_v) \in
E^{v+1}$ with distinct entries that satisfies any of the given equations.
Variants of this construction can also be used to obtain Salem sets that avoid
solutions of translation-invariant linear equations of other kinds, for
instance, when the collection of linear equations to be avoided is uncountable
or has irrational coefficients. While such constructions seem to suggest that
Salem sets can avoid many configurations, our second type of results offers a
counterpoint. We show that a set in $\mathbb R$ whose Fourier dimension exceeds
$2/(v+1)$ cannot avoid nontrivial solutions of all equations of the above form.
In particular, a set of positive Fourier dimension must contain a nontrivial
linear pattern of the above form for some $v$, and hence cannot be rationally
independent. This is in stark contrast with known results \cite{M17} that
ensure the existence of rationally independent sets of full Hausdorff
dimension. The latter class of results may be viewed as quantitative evidence
of the structural richness of Salem sets of positive dimension, even if the
dimension is arbitrarily small.

black-box functions. In real-world applications, BO often faces a major problem
of missing values in inputs. The missing inputs can happen in two cases. First,
the historical data for training BO often contain missing values. Second, when
performing the function evaluation (e.g. computing alloy strength in a heat
treatment process), errors may occur (e.g. a thermostat stops working) leading
to an erroneous situation where the function is computed at a random unknown
value instead of the suggested value. To deal with this problem, a common
approach just simply skips data points where missing values happen. Clearly,
this naive method cannot utilize data efficiently and often leads to poor
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel BO method to handle missing
inputs. We first find a probability distribution of each missing value so that
we can impute the missing value by drawing a sample from its distribution. We
then develop a new acquisition function based on the well-known Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) acquisition function, which considers the uncertainty of
imputed values when suggesting the next point for function evaluation. We
conduct comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world applications
to show the usefulness of our method.

coalescence of oriented domains to form a continuous monolayer. The domains
must be oriented in the same crystallographic direction on the substrate to
avoid the formation of metallic inversion domain boundaries (IDBs) which are a
common feature of layered chalcogenides. Here we demonstrate fully-coalesced
single orientation tungsten sulfide monolayers on 2-inch diameter c-plane
sapphire by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition using a multi-step growth
process. High growth temperatures and sulfur/metal ratios were required to
reduce domain misorientation and achieve epitaxial tungsten sulfide monolayers
with low in-plane rotational twist (0.09 deg). Transmission electron microscopy
analysis reveals that the tungsten sulfide monolayers lack IDBs but instead
have translational boundaries that arise when tungsten sulfide domains with
slightly off-set lattices merge together. By adjusting the monolayer growth
rate, the density of translational boundaries and bilayer coverage were
significantly reduced. The preferred orientation of domains is attributed to
the presence of steps on the sapphire surface coupled with growth conditions
promote surface diffusion and oriented attachment. The transferred tungsten
sulfide monolayers show neutral and charged exciton emission at 80K with

simple yet surprisingly effective mechanical squeezing scheme in a standard
optomechanical system. By merely introducing a specific kind of periodic
modulation into the single-tone driving field to cool down the mechanical
Bogoliubov mode, the far beyond 3-dB strong mechanical squeezing can be
engineered without requiring any additional techniques. Specifically, we find
that the amount of squeezing is not simply dependent on the order of magnitude
of the effective optomechanical coupling but strongly on the ratio of sideband
strengths for it. To maximize the mechanical squeezing, we numerically and
analytically optimize this ratio in the steady-state regime, respectively. The
mechanical squeezing engineered in our scheme also has strong robustness and
can survive at a high bath temperature. Compared with previous schemes based on
the two-tone pump technique, our scheme involves fewer external control laser
source and can be extended to other quantum systems to achieve strong squeezing
effect.

caused more than 7.4 million cases and over 418,000 deaths. The highly dynamic
and rapidly evolving situation with COVID-19 has made it difficult to access
accurate, on-demand information regarding the disease. Online communities,

questions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members.
However, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of
relevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are
rarely answered immediately. With the advancements in the field of natural
language processing, particularly in the domain of language models, it has
become possible to design chatbots that can automatically answer consumer

healthcare domain, to meet the information needs with accurate and up-to-date

automatically answering questions related to COVID-19 and qualitatively

applied transfer learning to retrain it on the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset

we applied 4 different approaches, namely tf-idf, BERT, BioBERT, and USE to

developed in this work. The numerical accuracy of interface normal vectors is
improved by utilizing a preconditioning procedure based on the level set method
with localized artificial viscosity stabilization. The developed method was
implemented in the framework of the multi-platform Flux Reconstruction

high accuracy and locality of the proposed method offer a promising route to
carrying out massively-parallel, high accuracy simulations of multi-phase,

which results heavy feedback overhead. To lower complexity, channel statistics
can be utilized such that only infrequent update of the channel information is
needed. To reduce the complexity and provide robustness, in this work, we
propose a deep learning (DL) framework to deal with both hybrid beamforming and
channel estimation. For this purpose, we introduce three deep convolutional
neural network (CNN) architectures. We assume that the base station (BS) has
the channel statistics only and feeds the channel covariance matrix into a CNN
to obtain the hybrid precoders. At the receiver, two CNNs are employed. The
first one is used for channel estimation purposes and the another is employed
to design the hybrid combiners. The proposed DL framework does not require the
instantaneous feedback of the CSI at the BS. We have shown that the proposed
approach has higher spectral efficiency with comparison to the conventional
techniques. The trained CNN structures do not need to be re-trained due to the
changes in the propagation environment such as the deviations in the number of
received paths and the fluctuations in the received path angles up to 4
degrees. Also, the proposed DL framework exhibits at least 10 times lower

first construction of a PoSW in the random oracle model though the construction
relied on expensive depth-robust graphs. In a recent breakthrough, Cohen and
Pietrzak (EUROCRYPT 2018) gave an efficient PoSW construction that does not
require expensive depth-robust graphs.
  In the classical parallel random oracle model, it is straightforward to argue
that any successful PoSW attacker must produce a long $\mathcal{H}$-sequence
and that any malicious party running in sequential time $T-1$ will fail to
produce an $\mathcal{H}$-sequence of length $T$ except with negligible
probability. In this paper, we prove that any quantum attacker running in

with negligible probability -- even if the attacker submits a large batch of
quantum queries in each round. The proof is substantially more challenging and
highlights the power of Zhandry's recent compressed oracle technique (CRYPTO

  Weight Adjustment for Exploration",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep reinforcement learning has been applied more and more widely nowadays,
especially in various complex control tasks. Effective exploration for noisy
networks is one of the most important issues in deep reinforcement learning.
Noisy networks tend to produce stable outputs for agents. However, this
tendency is not always enough to find a stable policy for an agent, which
decreases efficiency and stability during the learning process. Based on
NoisyNets, this paper proposes an algorithm called NROWAN-DQN, i.e., Noise
Reduction and Online Weight Adjustment NoisyNet-DQN. Firstly, we develop a
novel noise reduction method for NoisyNet-DQN to make the agent perform stable
actions. Secondly, we design an online weight adjustment strategy for noise
reduction, which improves stable performance and gets higher scores for the
agent. Finally, we evaluate this algorithm in four standard domains and analyze
properties of hyper-parameters. Our results show that NROWAN-DQN outperforms
prior algorithms in all these domains. In addition, NROWAN-DQN also shows
better stability. The variance of the NROWAN-DQN score is significantly
reduced, especially in some action-sensitive environments. This means that in
some environments where high stability is required, NROWAN-DQN will be more
appropriate than NoisyNets-DQN.

which manifests a characteristic of robustness to deviation of interatomic
distance, fluctuation of F\""{o}ster resonance defect, and spontaneous emission
of double-excited Rydberg states. As applications of this mechanism, we discuss
in detail the preparation of the maximally entangled symmetric state for two

the key location and filter the discrepancy under various noise-contaminant

class-imbalanced cross learning using most confident predictions at the

means that any perturbation should blow up sufficiently badly when approaching

precise form of the divergence was only calculated for a small number of

formulate this problem as a special Orienteering Problem where the cost
function is a measure of the quality of the estimation. This approach provides
a Mixed-Integer Semi-Definite formulation to the problem which can be optimally
solved for small instances. For larger instances, two heuristics are proposed
which provide good sub-optimal results. To conclude, numerical simulations are
shown to prove the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed path planning
strategy. We believe this approach has the potential to increase dramatically
the area that a drone can monitor, thus increasing the number of applications
where monitoring with drones can become economically convenient.

models to adversarial examples. It attracts increasing attention to adversarial
attacks, which can be used to evaluate the security and robustness of models
before they are deployed. However, to our best knowledge, there is no specific
research on the adversarial attacks for multi-view deep models. This paper
proposes two multi-view attack strategies, two-stage attack (TSA) and
end-to-end attack (ETEA). With the mild assumption that the single-view model
on which the target multi-view model is based is known, we first propose the
TSA strategy. The main idea of TSA is to attack the multi-view model with
adversarial examples generated by attacking the associated single-view model,
by which state-of-the-art single-view attack methods are directly extended to
the multi-view scenario. Then we further propose the ETEA strategy when the
multi-view model is provided publicly. The ETEA is applied to accomplish direct
attacks on the target multi-view model, where we develop three effective
multi-view attack methods. Finally, based on the fact that adversarial examples
generalize well among different models, this paper takes the adversarial attack
on the multi-view convolutional neural network as an example to validate that
the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view attacks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our multi-view attack strategies are capable of
attacking the multi-view deep models, and we additionally find that multi-view
models are more robust than single-view models.

refines these pseudo-labels which hopefully coincides with the actual labels.
This work provides theoretical insights into self-training algorithm with a
focus on linear classifiers. We first investigate Gaussian mixture models and
provide a sharp non-asymptotic finite-sample characterization of the

rejecting samples with low confidence and demonstrates that self-training

sub-optimal fixed points. We then demonstrate that regularization and class
margin (i.e. separation) is provably important for the success and lack of

the data. Finally, we discuss statistical aspects of empirical risk
minimization with self-training for general distributions. We show how a purely

and accelerating the training of deep neural networks. However, it has also
shown to be a cause of adversarial vulnerability, i.e., networks without it are
more robust to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we investigate how BatchNorm
causes this vulnerability and proposed new normalization that is robust to
adversarial attacks. We first observe that adversarial images tend to shift the
distribution of BatchNorm input, and this shift makes train-time estimated
population statistics inaccurate. We hypothesize that these inaccurate
statistics make models with BatchNorm more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.
We prove our hypothesis by replacing train-time estimated statistics with
statistics calculated from the inference-time batch. We found that the
adversarial vulnerability of BatchNorm disappears if we use these statistics.
However, without estimated batch statistics, we can not use BatchNorm in the
practice if large batches of input are not available. To mitigate this, we
propose Robust Normalization (RobustNorm); an adversarially robust version of
BatchNorm. We experimentally show that models trained with RobustNorm perform
better in adversarial settings while retaining all the benefits of BatchNorm.

ensure that each cluster contains groups in (roughly) the same proportion in
which they exist in the population. The normative principle at play is balance:
any cluster might act as a representative of the data, and thus should reflect
its diversity.
  But clustering also captures a different form of representativeness. A core
principle in most clustering problems is that a cluster center should be
representative of the cluster it represents, by being ""close"" to the points
associated with it. This is so that we can effectively replace the points by
their cluster centers without significant loss in fidelity, and indeed is a
common ""use case"" for clustering. For such a clustering to be fair, the centers
should ""represent"" different groups equally well. We call such a clustering a
group-representative clustering.
  In this paper, we study the structure and computation of group-representative
clusterings. We show that this notion naturally parallels the development of
fairness notions in classification, with direct analogs of ideas like
demographic parity and equal opportunity. We demonstrate how these notions are
distinct from and cannot be captured by balance-based notions of fairness. We
present approximation algorithms for group representative $k$-median clustering
and couple this with an empirical evaluation on various real-world data sets.

However, observational interaction data could result from users' conformity

tracks this problem as eliminating popularity bias, e.g., by re-weighting
training samples or leveraging a small fraction of unbiased data. However, the
variety of user conformity is ignored by these approaches, and different causes
of an interaction are bundled together as unified representations, hence
robustness and interpretability are not guaranteed when underlying causes are
changing. In this paper, we present DICE, a general framework that learns
representations where interest and conformity are structurally disentangled,
and various backbone recommendation models could be smoothly integrated. We
assign users and items with separate embeddings for interest and conformity,
and make each embedding capture only one cause by training with cause-specific
data which is obtained according to the colliding effect of causal inference.
Our proposed methodology outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with remarkable
improvements on two real-world datasets on top of various backbone models. We
further demonstrate that the learned embeddings successfully capture the

targeting label-efficient learning to resolve the mentioned problem. Existing
active learning methods only focus on selecting a set of informative samples
under a labeling budget. One step further, we suggest that the training
efficiency can be further improved by utilizing the unlabeled samples,
exceeding the labeling budget, by introducing sophisticatedly configured
unsupervised loss complementing supervised loss effectively. We propose new
unsupervised loss based on consistency regularization, and we configure
appropriate augmentation techniques for utterances to adopt consistency
regularization in the automatic speech recognition task. From the qualitative
and quantitative experiments on the real-world dataset and under real-usage
scenarios, we show that the proposed training pipeline can boost the efficacy
of active learning approaches, thus successfully reducing a sustainable amount
of human labeling cost.

studied, particularly in order to explain the origin and the properties of the
scattering pre-peak in the k-vector range 0.3A^{-1}-1A^{-1}. The experimental
I(k) show two apparent features: the pre-peak position kP decreases with
increasing n, and more intriguingly, the amplitude AP goes through a maximum at
1-butanol (n=4). The first feature is well reproduced by all force field
models, while the second shows a strong model dependence. The simulations
reveal various shapes of clusters of the hydroxyl head-group, from n>2. kP is
directly related to the size of the \emph{meta-objects} corresponding to such
clusters surrounded by their alkyl tails. The explanation of the Ap turnover at
n=4 is more involved, in terms of cancellations of atom-atom S(k) contributions
related to domain ordering. The flexibility of the alkyl tails tend to reduce
the cross contributions, thus revealing the crucial importance of this
parameter in the models. Force fields with all-atom representation are less
successful in reproducing the pre-peak features for smaller alkanols n<6,
possibly because they blur the charge ordering process since all atoms bear
partial charges. The analysis clearly shows that it is not possible to obtain a
model free explanation of the features of I(k)

measured as the average number of times a linear chain appears to cross itself
when viewed under all projections, and is irrespective of the physical knotted
state. The key discovery of our work is that these two forms of entanglement
are uncoupled and evolve with distinct dynamics. While geometrical entanglement
is typically in phase with the compression-elongation cycles and it is
primarily sensitive to its force f, the topological measure is mildly sensitive
to cyclic modulation but strongly depends on both compression force f and
duration k. The findings could assist the interpretation of experiments using
fluorescence molecular tracers to track physical knots in polymers.
Furthermore, we identify optimal regions in the experimentally-controllable

redundancy, or mitigated via techniques such as task migration, NoCs are
especially vulnerable to hardware faults as a single link breakdown may cause
inter-tile communication to halt indefinitely, rendering the whole multicore
chip inoperable. As such, NoCs impose the risk of becoming the pivotal point of
failure in chip multicores that utilize them. Aiming towards seamless NoC
operation in the presence of faulty links we propose Hermes, a near-ideal
fault-tolerant routing algorithm that meets the objectives of exhibiting high
levels of robustness, operating in a distributed mode, guaranteeing freedom
from deadlocks, and evening-out traffic, among many. Hermes is a
limited-overhead deadlock-free hybrid routing algorithm, utilizing
load-balancing routing on fault-free paths to sustain high-throughput, while
providing pre-reconfigured escape path selection in the vicinity of faults.
Under such online mechanisms, Hermes's performance degrades gracefully with
increasing faulty link counts, a crucially desirable response lacking in
prior-art. Additionally, Hermes identifies non-communicating network partitions
in scenarios where faulty links are topologically densely distributed such that
packets being routed to physically isolated regions cause no network stagnation
due to indefinite chained blockages starting at sub-network boundaries. An
extensive experimental evaluation, including utilizing traffic workloads
gathered from full-system chip multi-processor simulations, shows that Hermes
improves network throughput by up to $3\times$ when compared against the
state-of-the-art. Further, hardware synthesis results prove Hermes's efficacy.

aggregated unfitted finite element method for large-scale interface elliptic
problems. The new method is based on a recent distributed-memory implementation
of the aggregated finite element method atop a highly-scalable Cartesian
forest-of-trees mesh engine. It follows the classical approach of weakly
coupling nonmatching discretisations at the interface to model internal
discontinuities at the interface. We propose a natural extension of a
single-domain parallel cell aggregation scheme to problems with a finite number
of interfaces; it straightforwardly leads to aggregated finite element spaces
that have the structure of a Cartesian product. We demonstrate, through
standard numerical analysis and exhaustive numerical experimentation on several
complex Poisson and linear elasticity benchmarks, that the new technique enjoys
the following properties: well-posedness, robustness with respect to cut
location and material contrast, optimal ($h$-adaptive) approximation
properties, high scalability and easy implementation in large-scale finite
element codes. As a result, the method offers great potential as a useful
finite element solver for large-scale interface problems modelled by partial
differential equations.

protection governance. We focus on what accountability means in the context of
cybersecurity management in smart homes, considering the EU General Data
Protection Law requirements to secure personal data. This discussion sits
against the backdrop of two key new developments in data protection law.
Firstly, the law is moving into the home, due to narrowing of the so called
household exemption. Concurrently, household occupants may now have legal
responsibilities to comply with the GDPR, as they find themselves jointly
responsible for compliance, as they are possibly held to determine the means
and purposes of data collection with IoT device vendors. As a complex
socio-technical space, we consider the interactions between accountability
requirements and the competencies of this new class of domestic data
controllers (DDCs). Specifically, we consider the value and limitations of
edge-based security analytics to manage smart home cybersecurity risks,
reviewing a range of prototypes and studies of their use. We also reflect on
interpersonal power dynamics in the domestic setting e.g. device control;
existing social practices around privacy and security management in smart
homes; and usability issues that may hamper DDCs ability to rely on such
solutions. We conclude by reflecting on 1) the need for collective security
management in homes and 2) the increasingly complex divisions of responsibility
in smart homes between device users, account holders, IoT
device/software/firmware vendors, and third parties.

domain of computational design, allowing designers to generate large pools of
valid solutions by defining a set of goals and constraints. However, analyzing
and narrowing down the generated solution space, which usually consists of
various high-dimensional properties, has been a major challenge in current
generative workflows. By taking advantage of the interactive unbounded spatial
exploration, and the visual immersion offered in virtual reality platforms, we
propose V-Dream, a virtual reality generative analysis framework for exploring
large-scale solution spaces. V-Dream proposes a hybrid search workflow in which
a spatial stochastic search approach is combined with a recommender system
allowing users to pick desired candidates and eliminate the undesired ones
iteratively. In each cycle, V-Dream reorganizes the remaining options in
clusters based on the defined features. Moreover, our framework allows users to
inspect design solutions and evaluate their performance metrics in various
hierarchical levels, assisting them in narrowing down the solution space
through iterative cycles of search/select/re-clustering of the solutions in an
immersive fashion. Finally, we present a prototype of our proposed framework,
illustrating how users can navigate and narrow down desired solutions from a
pool of over 16000 monitor stands generated by Autodesk's Dreamcatcher
software.

active galactic nuclei (AGNs) by using data on low redshift AGNs selected from
the Swift/BAT catalog and having black hole (BH) masses larger than
$10^{8.5}\,M_{\odot}$. Most of these AGNs accrete at intermediate rates and
have bolometric luminosities dominated by mid-IR radiation. Our sample contains
$14\%$ radio-loud (RL), $6\%$ radio-intermediate (RI), and $80\%$ radio-quiet
(RQ) AGNs. All RL objects are found to have extended radio structures and most
of them have classical FR II morphology. Converting their radio loudness to the
jet production efficiency, we find that the median of this efficiency is on the
order of $(\epsilon_d/0.1)\%$, where $\epsilon_d=L_{\rm bol}/\dot{M}c^2$ is the
radiation efficiency of the accretion disk. Without knowing the contribution of
jets to the radio emission in the RQ AGNs, we are only able to estimate their
efficiencies using upper limits. Their median is found to be
$0.002(\epsilon_d/0.1)\%$. Our results suggest that some threshold conditions
must be satisfied to allow production of strong, relativistic jets in RL AGNs.
We discuss several possible scenarios and argue that the production of
collimated, relativistic jets must involve the Blandford-Znajek mechanism and
can be activated only in those AGNs whose lifetime is longer than the time
required to enter the magnetically arrested disk (MAD). Presuming that MAD is
required to collimate relativistic jets, we expect that the weak
nonrelativistic jets observed in some RQ AGNs are produced by accretion disks
rather than by rotating BHs.

than Mars. Their chemical compositions were established by nebular
fractionation, with negligible contributions from post-accretionary losses of
moderately volatile elements. The degree of planetary volatile element
depletion might correlate with the abundances of chondrules in the accreted
materials, planetary size, and their accretion timescale, which provides
insights into composition and origin of Mercury, Venus, the Moon-forming giant
impactor, and the proto-Earth. During its formation before and after the
nebular disk's lifetime, the Earth likely accreted more chondrules and less
matrix-like materials than Mars and chondritic asteroids, establishing its
marked volatile depletion. A giant impact of an oxidized, differentiated
Mars-like (i.e., composition and mass) body into a volatile-depleted, reduced
proto-Earth produced a Moon-forming debris ring with mostly a proto-Earth's
mantle composition. Chalcophile and some siderophile elements in the silicate
Earth added by the Mars-like impactor were extracted into the core by a sulfide
melt. In contrast, the composition of Mars indicates its rapid accretion of
lesser amounts of chondrules under nearly uniform oxidizing conditions. Mars'
rapid cooling and early loss of its dynamo likely led to the absence of plate
tectonics and surface water, and the present-day low surface heat flux. These
similarities and differences between the Earth and Mars made the former

contribution towards a deeper understanding of how RNNs process input signals

class of continuous-time stochastic RNNs (SRNNs) driven by an input signal, we
derive a Volterra type series representation for their output. This
representation is interpretable and disentangles the input signal from the SRNN
architecture. The kernels of the series are certain recursively defined
correlation functions with respect to the unperturbed dynamics that completely
determine the output. Exploiting connections of this representation and its
implications to rough paths theory, we identify a universal feature -- the
response feature, which turns out to be the signature of tensor product of the
input signal and a natural support basis. In particular, we show that SRNNs,
with only the weights in the readout layer optimized and the weights in the
hidden layer kept fixed and not optimized, can be viewed as kernel machines
operating on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the response
feature.

were prepared with or without Ti interface at \Ei~=~1.0 or 0.5\,keV. They were
characterized using x-ray reflectivity (XRR) to deduce thickness, roughness and
density. The roughness of TiN thin films was found to be below 1\,nm, when
deposited at the lower \Ei~of 0.5\,keV and when interfaced with a layer of Ti.
Under these conditions, the density of TiN sample reaches to
5.80($\pm$0.03)\,g~cm$^{-3}$, a value highest hitherto for any TiN sample.
X-ray diffraction and electrical resistivity measurements were performed. It
was found that the cumulative effect of the reduction in \Ei~from 1.0 to
0.5\,keV and the addition of Ti interface favors (111) oriented growth leading
to dense and smooth TiN films and a substantial reduction in the electrical
resistivity. The reduction in \Ei~has been attributed to the surface kinetics
mechanism (simulated using SRIM) where the available energy of the sputtered
species (\Esp) leaving the target at \Ei~= 0.5\,keV is the optimum value
favoring the growth of defects free homogeneously distributed films. The
electronic structure of samples was probed using N K-edge absorption
spectroscopy and the information about the crystal field and spin-orbit
splitting confirmed TiN phase formation. In essence, through this work, we
demonstrate the role of \Esp~and Ti interface in achieving highly dense and
smooth TiN thin films with low resistivity without the need of a high
temperature or substrate biasing during the thin film deposition process.

perplexing ideologies in law, in the areas of economic law, tort law, contract
law, procedural law and many others. Most legal systems require the parties
involved in a legal dispute to exchange information through a process called
discovery. The purpose is to reduce the relative optimisms developed by
asymmetric information between the parties. Like a head or tail phenomenon in
stochastic processes, uncertainty in the adjudication affects the decisions of
the parties in a legal negotiation. This paper therefore applies the principles
of aleatory analysis to determine how negotiations fail in the legal process,
introduce the axiological concept of optimal transaction cost and formulates a
numerical methodology based on backwards induction and stochastic options
pricing economics in estimating the reasonable and fair bargain in order to
induce settlements thereby increasing efficiency and reducing social costs.

Constraining some of these decisions reduces the solution space, i.e. may
increase energy consumption, but may also reduce scheduling time or give the
chance to tackle larger task sets. We investigate the influence of different
constraints that lead from an unrestricted scheduler via two intermediate steps
to the crown scheduler, by presenting integer linear programs for all four
schedulers. We compare scheduling time and energy consumption for a benchmark

responsible for faster scheduling when task sets are small, and lower energy

the presence of acceleration and surface tension. We employ the general matrix
method to find the fundamental solutions for the linearized boundary value
problem conserving mass, momentum and energy. We find that the dynamics can be
stable or unstable depending on the values of the acceleration, the surface
tension and the density ratio. In the stable regime, the flow has the
non-perturbed fields in the bulk, is shear-free at the interface, and has the
constant interface velocity. The dynamics is unstable only when it is
accelerated, and when the acceleration value exceeds a threshold combining
contributions of the inertial stabilization mechanism and the surface tension.
The properties of this instability unambiguously differentiate it from other
fluid instabilities. Particularly, its velocity field has potential and
vortical components in the bulk and is shear free at the interface. Its
dynamics describes the standing wave with the growing amplitude, and has the
growing interface velocity. For strong accelerations, this fluid instability of
the conservative dynamics has the fastest growth-rate and the largest
stabilizing surface tension value when compared to the classical Landau and
Rayleigh-Taylor dynamics. We find the values of the initial perturbation
wavelength at which the fluid instability can be stabilized and at which it has
the fastest growth. We identify theory benchmarks for experiments and
simulations in high energy density plasmas and its outcomes for application
problems in nature and technology.

over a wide range of timescales. For most pharmaceutically relevant inhibitors,
these timescales are far beyond those that are accessible by conventional
molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Consequently, to explore ligand egress
mechanisms and compute dissociation rates, it is necessary to enhance the
sampling of ligand unbinding. Random Acceleration MD (RAMD) is a simple method
to enhance ligand egress from a macromolecular binding site, which enables the
exploration of ligand egress routes without prior knowledge of the reaction
coordinates. Furthermore, the tauRAMD procedure can be used to compute the
relative residence times of ligands. When combined with a machine-learning
analysis of protein-ligand interaction fingerprints (IFPs), molecular features
that affect ligand unbinding kinetics can be identified. Here, we describe the
implementation of RAMD in GROMACS 2020, which provides significantly improved
computational performance, with scaling to large molecular systems. For the
automated analysis of RAMD results, we developed MD-IFP, a set of tools for the
generation of IFPs along unbinding trajectories and for their use in the
exploration of ligand dynamics. We demonstrate that the analysis of ligand
dissociation trajectories by mapping them onto the IFP space enables the

complex models such as hypergraphs. For instance, a research article could have
multiple collaborating authors, and therefore the co-authorship network is best
represented as a hypergraph. In this work, we focus on the problem of hyperedge
prediction. This problem has immense applications in multiple domains, such as
predicting new collaborations in social networks, discovering new chemical
reactions in metabolic networks, etc. Despite having significant importance,
the problem of hyperedge prediction hasn't received adequate attention, mainly
because of its inherent complexity. In a graph with $n$ nodes the number of
potential edges is $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$, whereas in a hypergraph, the number of
potential hyperedges is $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$. To avoid searching through such a
huge space, current methods restrain the original problem in the following two
ways. One class of algorithms assume the hypergraphs to be $k$-uniform.
However, many real-world systems are not confined only to have interactions
involving $k$ components. Thus, these algorithms are not suitable for many
real-world applications. The second class of algorithms requires a candidate
set of hyperedges from which the potential hyperedges are chosen. In the
absence of domain knowledge, the candidate set can have $\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$
possible hyperedges, which makes this problem intractable. We propose HPRA -
Hyperedge Prediction using Resource Allocation, the first of its kind
algorithm, which overcomes these issues and predicts hyperedges of any
cardinality without using any candidate hyperedge set. HPRA is a
similarity-based method working on the principles of the resource allocation
process. In addition to recovering missing hyperedges, we demonstrate that HPRA
can predict future hyperedges in a wide range of hypergraphs.

likely to get samples of sizes $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ in
the near future. Because of their extragalactic origin can help us in
understanding the epoch of helium reionization.
  Aims. We try to identify the epoch of Helium II (HeII) reionization, via the
observations of early FRBs in range of $z=3$ to $4$.
  Methods. We build a model of FRB Dispersion Measure following the HeII
reionization model, density fluctuation in large scale structure, host galaxy
interstellar medium and local environment of FRB contribution. The model is fit
to the ideal intergalactic medium (IGM) dispersion measure model to check the
goodness of constraining the HeII reionization via FRB measurement statistics.
  Conclusion. We report our findings under two categories, accuracy in
detection of HeII reionization via FRBs assuming no uncertainty in the redshift
measurement and alternatively assuming a varied level of uncertainty in
redshift measurement of the FRBs. We show that under the first case, a
detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O} (10^2)$ FRBs give an uncertainty of $\sigma
(z_{r, fit})\sim0.5$ from the fit model, and a detection of $N\sim\mathcal{O}
(10^3)$ gives an uncertainty of $\sigma (z_{r, fit})\sim0.1$. While assuming a
redshift uncertainty of level $5-20\%$, changes the $\sigma (z_{r,

damage and instead degrades significantly with increasing Cr content in the
material. We find significant lattice strains even in samples exposed to a
nominal displacement damage of 0.01 dpa. The defect density predicted from the

optimization algorithms to be implemented on distributed compute systems. A key
bottleneck of such systems is the communication overhead for exchanging
information across the workers, such as stochastic gradients. Among the many
techniques proposed to remedy this issue, one of the most successful is the
framework of compressed communication with error feedback (EF). EF remains the
only known technique that can deal with the error induced by contractive
compressors which are not unbiased, such as Top-$K$. In this paper, we propose
a new and theoretically and practically better alternative to EF for dealing

can transform any contractive compressor into an induced unbiased compressor.
Following this transformation, existing methods able to work with unbiased
compressors can be applied. We show that our approach leads to vast
improvements over EF, including reduced memory requirements, better
communication complexity guarantees and fewer assumptions. We further extend
our results to federated learning with partial participation following an

vulnerability of deep learning models: minor changes of the input can force a
model failure. Most of the state of the art frameworks focus on adversarial
attacks for images and other structured model inputs, but not for categorical
sequences models.
  Successful attacks on classifiers of categorical sequences are challenging
because the model input is tokens from finite sets, so a classifier score is
non-differentiable with respect to inputs, and gradient-based attacks are not
applicable. Common approaches deal with this problem working at a token level,
while the discrete optimization problem at hand requires a lot of resources to
solve.
  We instead use a fine-tuning of a language model for adversarial attacks as a
generator of adversarial examples. To optimize the model, we define a
differentiable loss function that depends on a surrogate classifier score and
on a deep learning model that evaluates approximate edit distance. So, we
control both the adversability of a generated sequence and its similarity to
the initial sequence.
  As a result, we obtain semantically better samples. Moreover, they are
resistant to adversarial training and adversarial detectors. Our model works
for diverse datasets on bank transactions, electronic health records, and NLP

in an electrolyte solution to move in a thermal gradient. When these
coefficients differ between cations and anions, an electric field can be
generated. For this so-called electrolyte Seebeck effect to occur, the
different thermodiffusive fluxes need to be blocked by boundaries --
electrodes, for example. Local charge neutrality is then broken in the
Debye-length vicinity of the electrodes. Confusingly, many authors point to
these regions as the source of the thermoelectric field yet ignore them in
derivations of the time-dependent Seebeck coefficient $S(t)$, giving a false
impression that the electrolyte Seebeck effect is purely a bulk phenomenon.
Without enforcing local electroneutrality, we derive $S(t)$ generated by a
binary electrolyte with arbitrary ionic valencies subject to a time-dependent
thermal gradient. Next, we experimentally measure $S(t)$ for five acids, bases,
and salts near titanium electrodes. For the steady state we find
$S\approx2~\mathrm{mV~K}^{-1}$ for many electrolytes, roughly one order of
magnitude larger than predictions based on literature $\alpha_{i}$. We fit our
expression for $S(t)$ to the experimental data, treating the $\alpha_{i}$ as
fit parameters, and also find larger-than-literature values, accordingly.

on the original (aluminum) surface, but now plastically deformed. The roughness
at short length scale, in the plastically deformed macroasperity contact
regions, result from the roughness on the hard ball, and from inhomogeneous
plastic flow.
  We model the contact mechanics using the boundary element method, combined
with a simple numerical procedure to take into account the plastic flow. The
theory can semi-quantitatively describe the modification of the roughness by
the plastic flow. Since the fluid leakage of metallic seals in most cases is
determined by the long wavelength roughness, we predict that the leakage can be
estimated based on the elastoplastic contact mechanics model employed here.
  The plastic deformations of surfaces of some glassy polymers is very
different from what we observed for aluminum, which we attribute to strong
work-hardening and to inhomogeneous plastic flow for the polymers. Thus the
numerical procedure to account for the plastic flow proposed here cannot be
applied to glassy polymers in general.

aspects. One of them is the axion-graviton coupling to test the axion-dark
matter model. Moreover, by extending Chern-Simons (CS) gravity to include
derivatives of a scalar field up to the second order, a more general class of
PV gravity theory, which we call the CNCL model, has been proposed~[M.
Crisostomi {\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. D, {\bf 97}, 044034 (2018)]. The model can
be further extended by including even higher derivatives of the scalar field
and/or higher curvature terms. In this paper, we discuss the effect of parity
violation in the gravitational sector on the propagation of gravitational waves
from binary coalescence by introducing a model-independent parametrization of
modification. Our parametrization includes the CNCL model as well as CS
gravity. The effect of parity violation on the gravitational waveform is
maximum when the source binary orientation to our line of sight is edge-on,
while the modified waveform reduces to the parity-symmetric one when the source
is face-on. We perform a search for the signature of such modification by using
the LIGO/Virgo O1/O2 catalog. We find that the catalog data is consistent with
general relativity and obtain constraints on parity violation in gravity for
various post-Newtonian order modifications for the first time. The obtained
constraint on CS gravity is consistent with the results in previous works. On
the other hand, the constraint on the CNCL model that we obtain is tighter than
the previous results by roughly 7 orders of magnitude.

learning face depth enhancement method in this context of facial biometrics,
which adds a security aspect to the topic. U-Net-like architectures are
utilized, and the networks are compared against hand-crafted enhancer types, as
well as a similar depth enhancer network from related work trained for an
adjacent application scenario. All tested enhancer types exclusively use depth
data as input, which differs from methods that enhance depth based on
additional input data such as visible light color images. Synthetic face depth
ground truth images and degraded forms thereof are created with help of PRNet,
to train multiple deep learning enhancer models with different network sizes
and training configurations. Evaluations are carried out on the synthetic data,
on Kinect v1 images from the KinectFaceDB, and on in-house RealSense D435

occluded face depth input, which is relevant to biometric security. The
proposed deep learning enhancers yield noticeably better results than the

Binaries are identified photometrically as overluminous sources. In order to
define a sample that is unbiased with respect to multiplicity we use distance
limits that are a function of $G-J$ colour to define a volume-complete sample
of 2706 systems. The $G-J$ colours are very precise, with random errors all
less than 0.02. We measure absolute magnitudes $M_J$ that are on average 0.5
mag. brighter than previous determinations. We find evidence that the
discrepancies arise from differences in spectral types in different samples.
The measured binary fraction is $16.5\pm0.8\%$, of which $98\%$ are unresolved:
both values are consistent with results of previous studies. The distribution
of excess flux in the binaries, compared to the singles, is used to infer the
mass ratio distribution $f(q)\propto q^\gamma$, where $q=M_s/M_p$. We infer a
very steep distribution over this spectral range, with $\gamma>10$ ($99\%$
probability). This says that unresolved ultracool M dwarf binaries reside
almost exclusively in equal mass systems, and implies that the spectral types
of the unresolved binaries match to with 0.5 spectral subtypes. The intrinsic

Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithms for Mixtures of GGM have been proposed
to estimate both each sub-population's graph and the class labels. However, we
argue that, with most real data, class affiliation cannot be described with a
Mixture of Gaussian, which mostly groups data points according to their
geometrical proximity. In particular, there often exists external co-features

sub-population corresponding clusters. We develop a penalised EM algorithm to
estimate graph-sparse model parameters. We demonstrate on synthetic and real

Then, some of the questions raised are: Which agent(s) to cooperate with? What

human linguistic abilities. However, its underlying neural mechanisms remain
largely unknown. We studied whether a modern artificial neural network trained
with ""deep learning"" methods mimics a central aspect of human sentence
processing, namely the storing of grammatical number and gender information in
working memory and its use in long-distance agreement (e.g., capturing the
correct number agreement between subject and verb when they are separated by
other phrases). Although the network, a recurrent architecture with Long
Short-Term Memory units, was solely trained to predict the next word in a large
corpus, analysis showed the emergence of a very sparse set of specialized units
that successfully handled local and long-distance syntactic agreement for
grammatical number. However, the simulations also showed that this mechanism
does not support full recursion and fails with some long-range embedded
dependencies. We tested the model's predictions in a behavioral experiment
where humans detected violations in number agreement in sentences with
systematic variations in the singular/plural status of multiple nouns, with or
without embedding. Human and model error patterns were remarkably similar,
showing that the model echoes various effects observed in human data. However,
a key difference was that, with embedded long-range dependencies, humans
remained above chance level, while the model's systematic errors brought it
below chance. Overall, our study shows that exploring the ways in which modern
artificial neural networks process sentences leads to precise and testable
hypotheses about human linguistic performance.

evolutionary pressure to represent this uncertainty in order to respond
appropriately. Often, this requires visiting multiple interpretations of the

gives rise to the so-called mixing problem: since all of these ""valid"" states
represent powerful attractors, but between themselves can be very dissimilar,
switching between such states can be difficult. We propose that cortical
oscillations can be effectively used to overcome this challenge. By acting as
an effective temperature, background spiking activity modulates exploration.
Rhythmic changes induced by cortical oscillations can then be interpreted as a
form of simulated tempering. We provide a rigorous mathematical discussion of
this link and study some of its phenomenological implications in computer
simulations. This identifies a new computational role of cortical oscillations
and connects them to various phenomena in the brain, such as sampling-based
probabilistic inference, memory replay, multisensory cue combination, and place

from meteorites and carry the detailed composition of their astronomical sites
of origin. We present evidence that the majority of large ($\mu$m-sized)
meteoritic silicon carbide (SiC) grains formed in C-rich asymptotic giant
branch (AGB) stars that were more metal-rich than the Sun. In the framework of
the slow neutron-captures (the s process) that occurs in AGB stars the
lower-than-solar 88Sr/86Sr isotopic ratios measured in the large SiC grains can
only be accompanied by Ce/Y elemental ratios that are also lower than solar,
and predominately observed in metal-rich barium stars - the binary companions
of AGB stars. Such an origin suggests that these large grains represent the
material from high-metallicity AGB stars needed to explain the s-process
nucleosynthesis variations observed in bulk meteorites (Ek et al. 2020). In the
outflows of metal-rich, C-rich AGB stars SiC grains are predicted to be small
($\simeq$ 0.2 $\mu$m-sized); large ($\simeq$ $\mu$m-sized) SiC grains can grow
if the number of dust seeds is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the
standard value of $10^{-13}$ times the number of H atoms. We therefore predict
that with increasing metallicity the number of dust seeds might decrease,
resulting in the production of larger SiC grains.

whether this core-cusp problem can be solved by fuzzy dark matter (FDM), a
hypothetical particle with a mass of order m$\approx$10$^{-22}$eV and a
corresponding de Broglie wavelength on astrophysical scales. We show that
galaxies with CDM halo virial masses M$_{vir} \leq 10^{11}$M$_{\odot}$ follow
two core scaling relations. In addition to the well known universal core column
density $\Sigma_0 \equiv \rho_0 \times$r$_0$ = 75 M$_{\odot}$pc$^{-2}$ core
radii increase with virial masses as r$_0 \sim$ M$_{vir}^{\gamma}$ with
$\gamma$ of order unity. Using the simulations by Schive et al. (2014) we
demonstrate that FDM can explain the r$_0$-M$_{vir}$ scaling relation if the
virial masses of the observed galaxy sample scale with formation redshift z as
M$_{vir}\sim$(1+z)$^{-0.4}$. The observed constant $\Sigma_0$ is however in
complete disagreement with FDM cores which are characterised by a steep
dependence $\Sigma_0 \sim$r$_0^{-3}$, independent of z. More high-resolution
simulations are now required to confirm the Schive et al. simulations and
explore especially the transition region between the soliton core and the
surrounding halo. If these results hold, FDM can be ruled out as the origin of
observed dark matter cores and other physical processes are required to account

Numerical tests show that the method is capable of predicting shock structures

cases. Given the possible acceleration of AFW at almost no extra cost, it is
thus a competitive alternative to FW. Numerical experiments on benchmarked
machine learning tasks further validate our theoretical findings.

fascicles. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based technique that
can accurately estimate the number and orientations of fascicles in a voxel.
Our method can be trained with either simulated or real diffusion-weighted
imaging data. Our method estimates the angle to the closest fascicle for each
direction in a set of discrete directions uniformly spread on the unit sphere.
This information is then processed to extract the number and orientations of
fascicles in a voxel. On realistic simulated phantom data with known ground
truth, our method predicts the number and orientations of crossing fascicles
more accurately than several existing methods. It also leads to more accurate
tractography. On real data, our method is better than or compares favorably
with standard methods in terms of robustness to measurement down-sampling and
also in terms of expert quality assessment of tractography results.

learning of graph data in recent works. In complement to graph convolution
operators, graph pooling is crucial for extracting hierarchical representation
of graph data. However, most recent graph pooling methods still fail to
efficiently exploit the geometry of graph data. In this paper, we propose a
novel graph pooling strategy that leverages node proximity to improve the
hierarchical representation learning of graph data with their multi-hop
topology. Node proximity is obtained by harmonizing the kernel representation
of topology information and node features. Implicit structure-aware kernel
representation of topology information allows efficient graph pooling without
explicit eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. Similarities of node
signals are adaptively evaluated with the combination of the affine
transformation and kernel trick using the Gaussian RBF function. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed graph pooling strategy is able to achieve
state-of-the-art performance on a collection of public graph classification

of feature maps. This is done either by strided convolution (donwscaling) or

filter moving at predetermined integer steps (strides). Spatial sizes of
consecutive layers are related by integer scale factors, predetermined at
architectural design, and remain fixed throughout training and inference time.
We propose a generalization of the common Conv-layer, from a discrete layer to
a Continuous Convolution (CC) Layer. CC Layers naturally extend Conv-layers by
representing the filter as a learned continuous function over sub-pixel
coordinates. This allows learnable and principled resizing of feature maps, to
any size, dynamically and consistently across scales. Once trained, the CC
layer can be used to output any scale/size chosen at inference time. The scale
can be non-integer and differ between the axes. CC gives rise to new freedoms
for architectural design, such as dynamic layer shapes at inference time, or
gradual architectures where the size changes by a small factor at each layer.
This gives rise to many desired CNN properties, new architectural design
capabilities, and useful applications. We further show that current Conv-layers
suffer from inherent misalignments, which are ameliorated by CC layers.

relativistic code was used to model a $E = 10^{52}$~erg relativistic jet-like
explosion hitting the stellar mantle. The jet-induced nucleosynthesis was
calculated in post-processing with a network of 1812 nuclei. During the star's
life, heavy elements from $30 \lesssim Z \lesssim 82$ are produced thanks to an
efficient s-process, which is boosted by rotation. At the end of evolution, the
helium shell is largely enriched in trans-iron elements and in (unburnt)
$^{22}$Ne, whose abundance is $\sim 20$ times higher than in a non-rotating

$^{22}$Ne($\alpha,n$), and leads to a strong n-process with neutron densities
of $\sim 10^{19} - 10^{20}$~cm$^{-3}$ during $0.1$~second. This has the effect
of shifting the s-process pattern towards heavier elements (e.g. Eu). The

molecules (COMs) involves formation on warm dust-grain surfaces, via the
diffusion and reaction of radicals produced through grain-surface
photodissociation of stable molecules. However, some gas-phase O-bearing COMs,
notably acetaldehyde(CH$_3$CHO), methyl formate(CH$_3$OCHO), and dimethyl
ether(CH$_3$OCH$_3$), are now observed at very low temperatures, challenging
the warm scenario. Here, we introduce a selection of new non-diffusive
mechanisms into an astrochemical model, to account for the failure of the
standard diffusive picture and to provide a more generalized scenario of COM
formation on interstellar grains. New generic rate formulations are provided
for cases where: (i) radicals are formed by reactions occurring close to
another reactant, producing an immediate follow-on reaction; (ii) radicals are
formed in an excited state, allowing them to overcome activation barriers to
react with nearby stable molecules; (iii) radicals are formed through
photo-dissociation close to a reaction partner, followed by immediate reaction.
Each process occurs without the diffusion of large radicals. The new mechanisms
significantly enhance cold COM abundances, successfully reproducing key
observational results for prestellar core L1544. H-abstraction from
grain-surface COMs, followed by recombination, plays a crucial role in
amplifying chemical desorption into the gas phase. The UV-induced chemistry
produces significant COM abundances in the bulk ices, which are retained on the
grains and may persist to later stages. O$_2$ is also formed strongly in the
mantle though photolysis, suggesting cometary O$_2$ could indeed be
interstellar.

user behavior (e.g. streaming duration, choice of end device and resolution)

and develop two approaches to directly attack these problems. The first
approach is to show that the test case for this problem, the Frechet algebra of
all entire functions on the Banach space of all bounded complex sequences, is,
in fact, a Frechet algebra of all complex formal power series in one
indeterminate, if there exists a discontinuous character. In the second
approach, the existence of a discontinuous character would allow us to generate
other Frechet algebra topology, inequivalent to the usual Frechet algebra
topology, by applying the method of Read (he used this method to show that the
famous Singer-Wermer conjecture (1955) fails in the Frechet case). In both the
approaches, an important tool is a topological version of the (symmetric)
tensor algebra over a Banach space; the elementary, but crucial, idea is to
express the test algebra as a weighted Frechet symmetric algebra over the
Banach space of all absolutely summable complex sequences. Several
mathematicians have worked on two problems of Michael since 1952, giving
affirmative solutions for special classes of Frechet algebras under various

representation is not available, the feature values need to be approximated
from a small number of sample points. In practice, uniformly sampled random
point sets and Latin hypercube constructions are commonly used sampling
strategies. In this work, we analyze how the sampling method and the sample
size influence the quality of the feature value approximations and how this
quality impacts the accuracy of a standard classification task. While, not
unexpectedly, increasing the number of sample points gives more robust
estimates for the feature values, to our surprise we find that the feature
value approximations for different sampling strategies do not converge to the
same value. This implies that approximated feature values cannot be interpreted
independently of the underlying sampling strategy. As our classification
experiments show, this also implies that the feature approximations used for
training a classifier must stem from the same sampling strategy as those used
for the actual classification tasks. As a side result we show that classifiers
trained with feature values approximated by Sobol' sequences achieve higher

requirements in increasingly demanding levels, either individually or in
combinations in small groups. This trend has spurred recent research activities
on transceiver hardware architectures and novel wireless connectivity concepts.
Among the emerging wireless hardware architectures belong the Reconfigurable
Intelligent Surfaces (RISs), which are artificial planar structures with
integrated electronic circuits that can be programmed to manipulate an incoming
ElectroMagnetic (EM) field in a wide variety of functionalities. Incorporating
RISs in wireless networks has been recently advocated as a revolutionary means
to transform any naturally passive wireless communication environment to an
active one. This can be accomplished by deploying cost-effective and easy to
coat RISs to the environment's objects (e.g., building facades and indoor
walls/ceilings), thus, offering increased environmental intelligence for the
scope of diverse wireless networking objectives. In this paper, we first
provide a brief history on wave propagation control for optics and acoustics,
and overview two representative indoor wireless trials at 2.47GHz for spatial
EM modulation with a passive discrete RIS. The first trial dating back to 2014
showcases the feasibility of highly accurate spatiotemporal focusing and
nulling, while the second very recent one demonstrates that passive RISs can
enrich multipath scattering, thus, enabling throughput boosted communication
links. Motivated by the late research excitement on the RIS potential for
intelligent EM wave propagation modulation, we describe the status on RIS
hardware architectures and present key open challenges and future research
directions for RIS design and RIS-empowered 6G wireless communications.

reading comprehension models on a low-resource language like Vietnamese.
Besides, machine reading comprehension (MRC) for the health domain offers great
potential for practical applications; however, there is still very little MRC
research in this domain. This paper presents ViNewsQA as a new corpus for the
Vietnamese language to evaluate healthcare reading comprehension models. The
corpus comprises 22,057 human-generated question-answer pairs. Crowd-workers
create the questions and their answers based on a collection of over 4,416
online Vietnamese healthcare news articles, where the answers comprise spans
extracted from the corresponding articles. In particular, we develop a process
of creating a corpus for the Vietnamese machine reading comprehension.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our corpus requires abilities beyond
simple reasoning, such as word matching and demanding difficult reasoning based
on single-or-multiple-sentence information. We conduct experiments using
different types of machine reading comprehension methods to achieve the first
baseline performances, compared with further models' performances. We also
measure human performance on the corpus and compared it with several powerful
neural network-based and transfer learning-based models. Our experiments show
that the best machine model is ALBERT, which achieves an exact match score of
65.26% and an F1-score of 84.89% on our corpus. The significant differences
between humans and the best-performance model (14.53% of EM and 10.90% of

spectral features, raw-waveforms employed in WVAD contain more comprehensive
information and thus are supposed to facilitate more accurate speech/non-speech
predictions. Second, based on the multi-branched architecture, WVAD can be
extended by using an ensemble of encoders, referred to as WEVAD, that
incorporate multiple attribute information in utterances, and thus can yield
better VAD performance for specified acoustic conditions. We evaluated the
presented WVAD and WEVAD for the VAD task in two datasets: First, the
experiments conducted on AURORA2 reveal that WVAD outperforms many
state-of-the-art VAD algorithms. Next, the TMHINT task confirms that through
combining multiple attributes in utterances, WEVAD behaves even better than
WVAD.

inherently represent a loss of information regarding dislocation-dislocation
interactions. In the present work, we consider a coarse-graining framework
capable of re-capturing these interactions by means of the
dislocation-dislocation correlation functions. The framework depends on a
coarse-graining length to define slip-system-specific dislocation densities.
Following a statistical definition of this coarse-graining process, we define a
spatial correlation function which will allow relative positions of dislocation
pairs, and thus the strength of their interactions at short range, to be
recaptured into a mean field description of dislocation dynamics. Through a
statistical homogeneity argument, we present a method of evaluating this
correlation function from discrete dislocation dynamics simulations. Finally,
results of this evaluation are shown in the form of self-correlation of
dislocation densities on the same slip-system. These correlation functions are
seen to depend weakly on plastic strain (and, in turn, the total dislocation
density), but are seen to depend strongly on the coarse-graining length.
Implications of these correlation functions in regard to continuum dislocation
dynamics as well as future directions of investigation are also discussed.

schedules. Subsequently, going beyond existing positive probability guarantees,
we show that SGD avoids strict saddle points/manifolds with probability $1$ for
the entire spectrum of step-size policies considered. Finally, we prove that
the algorithm's rate of convergence to Hurwicz minimizers is
$\mathcal{O}(1/n^{p})$ if the method is employed with a $\Theta(1/n^p)$

performance metrics in future wireless networks, covering both design and
operational requirements. For previous conventional resource allocation
techniques, these two performance metrics have been considered in isolation,
resulting in severe performance degradation in either of these metrics.
Motivated by this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel beamforming design
that jointly considers the trade-off between the two performance metrics in a
multiple-input single-output non-orthogonal multiple access system. In
particular, we formulate a joint SE-EE based design as a multi-objective
optimization (MOO) problem to achieve a good tradeoff between the two
performance metrics. However, this MOO problem is not mathematically tractable
and, thus, it is difficult to determine a feasible solution due to the
conflicting objectives, where both need to be simultaneously optimized. To
overcome this issue, we exploit a priori articulation scheme combined with the
weighted sum approach. Using this, we reformulate the original MOO problem as a
conventional single objective optimization (SOO) problem. In doing so, we
develop an iterative algorithm to solve this non-convex SOO problem using the
sequential convex approximation technique. Simulation results are provided to
demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach over the

Standard optical approaches require long trajectories of nanoparticles
dispersed in a medium with known viscosity to characterise their diffusion
constant and, thus, their size. However, often only short trajectories are
available, while the medium viscosity is unknown, e.g., in most biomedical
applications. In this work, we demonstrate a label-free method to quantify size

assumptions about the physicochemical properties of the medium. We achieve this
by developing a weighted average convolutional neural network to analyse the

  In this paper we extend and generalize their results for \emph{all} relevant
graphs $H$, i.e., those, for which the LHom{H} problem is NP-hard. For every
such $H$ we find a constant $k = k(H)$, such that LHom($H$) on instances with
$n$ vertices and treewidth $t$
  * can be solved in time $k^{t} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$, provided that the
input graph is given along with a tree decomposition of width $t$,
  * cannot be solved in time $(k-\varepsilon)^{t} \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$,
for any $\varepsilon >0$, unless the SETH fails.
  For some graphs $H$ the value of $k(H)$ is much smaller than the trivial
upper bound, i.e., $|V(H)|$.
  Obtaining matching upper and lower bounds shows that the set of algorithmic
tools we have discovered cannot be extended in order to obtain faster
algorithms for LHom($H$) in bounded-treewidth graphs. Furthermore, neither the
algorithm, nor the proof of the lower bound, is very specific to treewidth. We
believe that they can be used for other variants of LHom($H$), e.g. with
different parameterizations.

source of Li variation among stars of differing mass and age. While the LD is
well established in OC of this age, stars on the hot side of the LD can exhibit
Li ranging from the apparent primordial cluster value to upper limits similar
to those found at the LD center, despite occupying the same region of the

post-processing is the lack of knowledge on the system point spread function

like objects such as stars. Its prediction using AO telemetry also suffers from
serious limitations and requires complex and yet not fully operational
algorithms. A very attractive solution consists in a direct PSF estimation
using the scientific images themselves thanks to blind or myopic
post-processing approaches. We demonstrate that such approaches suffer from
severe limitations when a joint restitution of object and PSF parameters is
performed. As an alternative we propose here a marginalized PSF identification
that overcomes this limitation. Then the PSF is used for image post-processing.
Here we focus on deconvolution, a post-processing technique to restore the
object, given the image and the PSF. We show that the PSF estimated by
marginalisation provides good quality deconvolution. The full process of
marginalized PSF estimation and deconvolution constitutes a successful blind
deconvolution technique. It is tested on simulated data to measure its
performance. It is also tested on experimental adaptive optics images of the
asteroid 4-Vesta by VLT/SPHERE/Zimpol to demonstrate application to on-sky

conducted experiments with Particle Image Velocimetry to quantify this
streaming flow through the influence of liquid viscosity $\nu$, from 1 mm$^2$/s
to 30 mm$^2$/s, and acoustic frequency $f$ from 500 Hz to 3500 Hz. Both
quantities supposedly influence the thickness of the viscous boundary layer
$\delta = \left(\frac{\nu}{\pi f}\right)^{1/2}$. For all situations, the
streaming flow appears as a main central jet from the tip, generating two
lateral vortices beside the tip and outside the boundary layer. As a
characteristic streaming velocity, the maximal velocity is located at a
distance of $\delta$ from the tip, and it increases as the square of the
acoustic velocity. We then provide empirical scaling laws to quantify the
influence of $\nu$ and $f$ on the streaming velocity. Globally, the streaming
velocity is dramatically weakened by a higher viscosity, whereas the flow
pattern and the disturbance distance remain similar regardless of viscosity.
Besides viscosity, the frequency also strongly influences the maximal streaming

performed on publicly available datasets including the largest modern Aff-Wild2

of overfitting of the model on an unbalanced dataset with an illustrative

balance the dataset, thereby, the overall performance of the model is improved.

other constraints, primordial black hole (PBH) dark matter would lead to orders
of magnitude larger merger rates than observed. We revisit the calculation of
the present PBH merger rate. Solar mass PBHs form clusters at fairly high
redshifts, which evaporate at lower redshifts. We consider in detail the
evolution of binary properties in such clusters due to three-body interactions
between the two PBH binary members and a third by-passing PBH, for the first
time, by full numerical integration. A Monte-Carlo analysis shows that formerly
predicted merger rates are reduced by orders of magnitude due to such
interactions. The natural prediction of PBH dark matter formed during the QCD
epoch yields a pronounced peak around $1M_{\odot}$ with a small mass fraction
of PBHs on a shoulder around $30M_{\odot}$, dictated by the well-determined
equation of state during the QCD epoch. We employ this fact to make a tentative
prediction of the merger rate of $\sim 30M_{\odot}$ PBH binaries, and find it
very close to that determined by LIGO/Virgo. Furthermore we show that current
LIGO/Virgo limits on the existence of $\sim M_{\odot}$ binaries do not exclude
QCD PBHs to make up all of the cosmic dark matter. Neither do constraints on
QCD PBHs from the stochastic gravitational background, pre-recombination

the first energy-resolved morphological study of the PWN HESS J1825-137 at GeV
energies, which provide new insights into the gamma-ray characteristics of the
nebula. An optimised analysis of the source returns an extended emission region
larger than 2$^{\circ}$, corresponding to an intrinsic size of about 150 pc,
making HESS J1825-137 the most extended gamma-ray PWN currently known. The
nebula presents a strong energy dependent morphology within the GeV range,
moving from a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$ below 10 GeV to a radius of
$\sim$0.8$^\circ$ above 100 GeV, with a shift in the centroid location. Thanks
to the large extension and peculiar energy-dependent morphology, it is possible
to constrain the particle transport mechanisms inside the PWN HESS J1825-137.
Using the variation of the source extension and position, as well as the
constraints on the particle transport mechanisms, we present a scheme for the
possible evolution of the system. Finally, we provide an estimate of the
electron energy density and we discuss its nature in the PWN and TeV halo-like

strong tidal forces. OGLE16aaa is one such tidal disruption event (TDE) which
rapidly brightened and peaked in the optical/UV bands in early 2016 and
subsequently decayed over the rest of the year. OGLE16aaa was detected in an
XMM-Newton X-ray observation on June 9, 2016 with a flux slightly below the
Swift/XRT upper limits obtained during the optical light curve peak. Between
June 16-21, 2016, Swift/XRT also detected OGLE16aaa and based on the stacked
spectrum, we could infer that the X-ray luminosity had jumped up by more than a
factor of ten in just one week. No brightening signal was seen in the
simultaneous optical/UV data to cause the X-ray luminosity to exceed the
optical/UV one. A further XMM-Newton observation on November 30, 2016 showed
that almost a year after the optical/UV peak, the X-ray emission was still at
an elevated level, while the optical/UV flux decay had already leveled off to
values comparable to those of the host galaxy. In all X-ray observations, the
spectra were nicely modeled with a 50-70 eV thermal component with no intrinsic
absorption, with a weak X-ray tail seen only in the November 30 XMM-Newton
observation. The late-time X-ray behavior of OGLE16aaa strongly resembles the
tidal disruption events ASASSN-15oi and AT2019azh. We were able to pinpoint the
time delay between the initial optical TDE onset and the X-ray brightening to
$182 \pm 5$ days, which may possibly represent the timescale between the
initial circularization of the disrupted star around the super-massive black
hole and the subsequent delayed accretion. Alternatively, the delayed X-ray
brightening could be related to a rapid clearing of a thick envelope that
covers the central X-ray engine during the first six months.

two alternative CNN based architectures as the second module in our framework,
to reduce deep feature dimensions effectively. After extensive experiments, we
show that using pretrained Resnet50 features and one of our CNN based dimension
reduction models, HMMs can classify isolated signs with 90.15% accuracy in
Montalbano dataset using RGB and Skeletal data. This performance is comparable
with the current LSTM based models. HMMs have fewer parameters and can be
trained and run on commodity computers fast, without requiring GPUs. Therefore,
our analysis with deep features show that HMMs could also be utilized as well

measuring their desorption free energy, i.e., the mechanical work required to
detach the particle from a fluid interface. Here, we consider rubber-like
elastic as well as microgel particles, using coarse-grained molecular dynamics
simulations. The energy of desorption is computed for two and three-dimensional
configurations by means of the mean thermodynamic integration method. It is
shown that the softness affects the particle-interface binding in two opposing
directions as compared to rigid particles. On the one hand, a soft particle
spreads at the interface and thereby removes a larger unfavorable liquid-liquid
contact area compared to rigid particles. On the other hand, softness provides
the particle with an additional degree of freedom to get reshaped instead of
deforming the interface, resulting in a smaller restoring force during the
detachment. It is shown that the first effect prevails so that a soft spherical
particle attaches to the fluid interface more strongly than rigid spheres.
Finally, we consider microgel particles both in the swollen and in the
collapsed state. Surprisingly, we find that the latter has a larger binding
energy. All results are rationalised using thermodynamic arguments and thereby

semantic segmentation, while being efficient. Such efficiency results from the
capability of segmenting several voxels in a single forward pass. So, there is
a direct spatial correspondence between a unit in a feature map and the voxel
in the same location. In a convolutional layer, the kernel spans over all
channels and extracts information from them. We observe that linear
recombination of feature maps by increasing the number of channels followed by
compression may enhance their discriminative power. Moreover, not all feature
maps have the same relevance for the classes being predicted. In order to learn
the inter-channel relationships and recalibrate the channels to suppress the
less relevant ones, Squeeze and Excitation blocks were proposed in the context
of image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this is
not well adapted for segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks since they
segment several objects simultaneously, hence a feature map may contain
relevant information only in some locations. In this paper, we propose
recombination of features and a spatially adaptive recalibration block that is
adapted for semantic segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks - the SegSE
block. Feature maps are recalibrated by considering the cross-channel
information together with spatial relevance. Experimental results indicate that
Recombination and Recalibration improve the results of a competitive baseline,

offering potential for users to better understand and trust a model, and to
recognize and correct AI predictions that are incorrect. Prior research on
human and explainable AI interactions has focused on measures such as
interpretability, trust, and usability of the explanation. Whether explainable
AI can improve actual human decision-making and the ability to identify the
problems with the underlying model are open questions. Using real datasets, we
compare and evaluate objective human decision accuracy without AI (control),
with an AI prediction (no explanation), and AI prediction with explanation. We
find providing any kind of AI prediction tends to improve user decision
accuracy, but no conclusive evidence that explainable AI has a meaningful
impact. Moreover, we observed the strongest predictor for human decision
accuracy was AI accuracy and that users were somewhat able to detect when the
AI was correct versus incorrect, but this was not significantly affected by
including an explanation. Our results indicate that, at least in some
situations, the ""why"" information provided in explainable AI may not enhance
user decision-making, and further research may be needed to understand how to
integrate explainable AI into real systems.

series modeling. Echo State Networks (ESNs), as a prime example of Reservoir
Computing (RC) models, are known for their fast and precise one-shot learning,
that often benefit from good hyper-parameter tuning. This makes them ideal to
change the status quo.
  Methods: We discuss CV of time series for predicting a concrete time interval
of interest, suggest several schemes for cross-validating ESNs and introduce an
efficient algorithm for implementing them. This algorithm is presented as two
levels of optimizations of doing $k$-fold CV. Training an RC model typically
consists of two stages: (i) running the reservoir with the data and (ii)
computing the optimal readouts. The first level of our optimization addresses
the most computationally expensive part (i) and makes it remain constant
irrespective of $k$. It dramatically reduces reservoir computations in any type
of RC system and is enough if $k$ is small. The second level of optimization
also makes the (ii) part remain constant irrespective of large $k$, as long as
the dimension of the output is low. We discuss when the proposed validation
schemes for ESNs could be beneficial, three options for producing the final
model and empirically investigate them on six different real-world datasets, as
well as do empirical computation time experiments. We provide the code in an
online repository.
  Results: Proposed CV schemes give better and more stable test performance in
all the six different real-world datasets, three task types. Empirical run
times confirm our complexity analysis.
  Conclusions: In most situations $k$-fold CV of ESNs and many other RC models
can be done for virtually the same time and space complexity as a simple
single-split validation. This enables CV to become a standard practice in RC.

  their Nesterov Smoothings",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The motivation to study the behavior of limited-memory BFGS (L-BFGS) on
nonsmooth optimization problems is based on two empirical observations: the
widespread success of L-BFGS in solving large-scale smooth optimization
problems, and the effectiveness of the full BFGS method in solving small to
medium-sized nonsmooth optimization problems, based on using a gradient, not a
subgradient, oracle paradigm. We first summarize our theoretical results on the
behavior of the scaled L-BFGS method with one update applied to a simple convex
nonsmooth function that is unbounded below, stating conditions under which the
method converges to a non-optimal point regardless of the starting point. We
then turn to empirically investigating whether the same phenomenon holds more
generally,focusing on a difficult problem of Nesterov, as well as eigenvalue
optimization problems arising in semidefinite programming applications. We find
that when applied to a nonsmooth function directly, L-BFGS, especially its
scaled variant, often breaks down with a poor approximation to an optimal
solution, in sharp contrast to full BFGS. Unscaled L-BFGS is less prone to
breakdown but conducts far more function evaluations per iteration than scaled
L-BFGS does, and thus it is slow. Nonetheless, it is often the case that both
variants obtain better results than the provably convergent, but slow,
subgradient method. On the other hand, when applied to Nesterov's smooth
approximation of a nonsmooth function, scaled L-BFGS is generally much more
efficient than unscaled L-BFGS, often obtaining good results even when the
problem is quite ill-conditioned. Summarizing, for large-scale nonsmooth
optimization problems for which full BFGS and other methods for nonsmooth
optimization are not practical, it is often better to apply L-BFGS to a smooth
approximation of a nonsmooth problem than to apply it directly to the nonsmooth
problem.

mixed-dimensional models arising from the composition of graphs and continuous
domains. Such models are becoming popular in applications, in particular, to
model the human vasculature. We first discuss the model equations in the strong
form which describes the conservation of mass and Darcy's law in the continuum
and network as well as the coupling between them. By introducing proper
scaling, we propose a weak form that avoids degeneracy. Well-posedness of the
weak form is shown through standard Babu\v{s}ka-Brezzi theory. We also develop
the mixed formulation finite-element method and prove its well-posedness. A
mass-lumping technique is introduced to derive the two-point flux approximation
type discretization as well, due to its importance in applications. Based on
the Babu\v{s}ka-Brezzi theory, error estimates can be obtained for both the
finite-element scheme and the TPFA scheme. We also discuss efficient linear
solvers for discrete problems. Finally, we present some numerical examples to
verify the theoretical results and demonstrate the robustness of our proposed
discretization schemes.

has become a large area of research over the past years. Increasingly
sophisticated hardware accelerators are proposed that exploit e.g. the sparsity
in computations and make use of reduced precision arithmetic to scale down the
energy consumption. However, future platforms require more than just energy
efficiency: Scalability is becoming an increasingly important factor. The
required effort for physical implementation grows with the size of the
accelerator making it more difficult to meet target constraints. Using
many-core platforms consisting of several homogeneous cores can alleviate the
aforementioned limitations with regard to physical implementation at the
expense of an increased dataflow mapping effort. While the dataflow in CNNs is
deterministic and can therefore be optimized offline, the problem of finding a
suitable scheme that minimizes both runtime and off-chip memory accesses is a
challenging task which becomes even more complex if an interconnect system is
involved. This work presents an automated mapping strategy starting at the
single-core level with different optimization targets for minimal runtime and
minimal off-chip memory accesses. The strategy is then extended towards a
suitable many-core mapping scheme and evaluated using a scalable system-level
simulation with a network-on-chip interconnect. Design space exploration is
performed by mapping the well-known CNNs AlexNet and VGG-16 to platforms of
different core counts and computational power per core in order to investigate
the trade-offs. Our mapping strategy and system setup is scaled starting from
the single core level up to 128 cores, thereby showing the limits of the
selected approach.

disease, novel Coronavirus also known as COVID-19, which spread in more than
200 countries with around 3.3 million active cases and 4.4 lakh deaths
approximately. Due to rapid increase in number of cases and limited supply of
testing kits, availability of alternative diagnostic method is necessary for
containing the spread of COVID-19 cases at an early stage and reducing the
death count. For making available an alternative diagnostic method, we proposed
a deep neural network based diagnostic method which can be easily integrated
with mobile devices for detection of COVID-19 and viral pneumonia using Chest
X-rays (CXR) images. Methods:In this study, we have proposed a method named
COVIDLite, which is a combination of white balance followed by Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and depth-wise separable convolutional
neural network (DSCNN). In this method, white balance followed by CLAHE is used
as an image preprocessing step for enhancing the visibility of CXR images and
DSCNN trained using sparse cross entropy is used for image classification with
lesser parameters and significantly lighter in size, i.e., 8.4 MB without
quantization. Results:The proposed COVIDLite method resulted in improved
performance in comparison to vanilla DSCNN with no pre-processing. The proposed
method achieved higher accuracy of 99.58% for binary classification, whereas
96.43% for multiclass classification and out-performed various state-of-the-art
methods. Conclusion:Our proposed method, COVIDLite achieved exceptional results
on various performance metrics. With detailed model interpretations, COVIDLite
can assist radiologists in detecting COVID-19 patients from CXR images and can
reduce the diagnosis time significantly.

  Decomposition",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CE eess.SP physics.comp-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Training of deep neural networks (DNNs) frequently involves optimizing
several millions or even billions of parameters. Even with modern computing
architectures, the computational expense of DNN training can inhibit, for
instance, network architecture design optimization, hyper-parameter studies,
and integration into scientific research cycles. The key factor limiting
performance is that both the feed-forward evaluation and the back-propagation
rule are needed for each weight during optimization in the update rule. In this
work, we propose a method to decouple the evaluation of the update rule at each
weight. At first, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used to identify a
current estimate of the principal directions of evolution of weights per layer
during training based on the evolution observed with a few backpropagation
steps. Then, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is used to learn the dynamics of
the evolution of the weights in each layer according to these principal
directions. The DMD model is used to evaluate an approximate converged state
when training the ANN. Afterward, some number of backpropagation steps are
performed, starting from the DMD estimates, leading to an update to the
principal directions and DMD model. This iterative process is repeated until
convergence. By fine-tuning the number of backpropagation steps used for each
DMD model estimation, a significant reduction in the number of operations
required to train the neural networks can be achieved. In this paper, the DMD
acceleration method will be explained in detail, along with the theoretical
justification for the acceleration provided by DMD. This method is illustrated
using a regression problem of key interest for the scientific machine learning

We show that the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport allows to control
the distribution of various possible features, even if these features live in a
high-dimensional space. We then study the resulting minimax optimization
problem, which corresponds to a Wasserstein generative model, for which the
inner concave maximization problem can be solved with standard stochastic

beyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease
an epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and
