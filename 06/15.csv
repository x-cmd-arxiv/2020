strong form of invertibility of the truth rules, cut is eliminable in the
systems via a standard strategy supplemented by a suitable measure of the
number of applications of truth rules to formulas in derivations. Next, we
notice that cut remains eliminable when suitable arithmetical axioms are added
to the system. Finally, we establish a direct link between cut-free
derivability in infinitary formulations of the systems considered and
fixed-point semantics. Noticeably, unlike what happens with other background
logics, such links are established without imposing any restriction to the

SolarWinds hack have shown that traditional defense techniques are becoming
insufficient to deter adversaries of growing sophistication. Proactive and
deceptive defenses are an emerging class of methods to defend against zero-day
and advanced attacks. This work develops a new game-theoretic framework called
the duplicity game to design deception mechanisms that consist of a generator,
an incentive modulator, and a trust manipulator, referred to as the GMM
mechanism. We formulate a mathematical programming problem to compute the
optimal GMM mechanism, quantify the upper limit of enforceable security
policies, and characterize conditions on user's identifiability and
manageability for cyber attribution and user management. We develop a
separation principle that decouples the design of the modulator from the GMM
mechanism and an equivalence principle that turns the joint design of the
generator and the manipulator into the single design of the manipulator. A case
study of dynamic honeypot configurations is presented to mitigate insider
threats. The numerical experiments corroborate the results that the optimal GMM
mechanism can elicit desirable actions from both selfish and adversarial
insiders and consequently improve the security posture of the insider network.
In particular, a proper modulator can reduce the \textcolor{black}{incentive
misalignment} between the players and achieve win-win situations for the
selfish insider and the defender. Meanwhile, we observe that the defender
always benefits from faking the percentage of honeypots when the optimal
generator is presented.

device applications and an interplay between the Weyl nodes and FM domain

In the ground state, we obtain expressions for the MO phase and amplitude. From
this we use a Fourier expansion to write the MO, with the first term being a
sawtooth oscillation. We also consider the effects of finite temperature,
impurities or lattice imperfections, assuming a general broadening of the
Landau levels. We develop two methods for describing these damping effects in
the MO. One in terms of the occupancy of the Landau levels, the other in terms
of reduction factors, which results in a generalization of the
Lifshits-Kosevich (LK) formula. We show that the first approach is particularly
useful at very low damping, when only the states close to the Fermi energy are
excited. In contrast, the LK formula may be more convenient at higher damping,
when only few terms are needed in its harmonic expansion. We compare different
damping situations, showing how the MO are broadened in each case. The general
formulation presented allows to relate the properties of the MO with those of
the 2D systems.

a key to comprehend the characteristics of the sequence of earthquakes, which
enables us to predict seismic activities and hazard assessments. However,
identifying the number of aftershocks immediately after the main shock is
practically difficult due to contaminations of arriving seismic waves. To
overcome the difficulty, we construct a likelihood based on the detected data
incorporating a detection function to which the Gaussian process regression
(GPR) is applied. The GPR is capable of estimating not only the parameters of
the distribution of aftershocks together with the detection function but also
credible intervals for both of the parameters and the detection function. A
property that distributions of both the Gaussian process and aftershocks are
exponential functions leads to an efficient Bayesian computational algorithm to
estimate the hyperparameters. After the validations through numerical tests,
the proposed method is retrospectively applied to the catalog data related to
the 2004 Chuetsu earthquake towards early forecasting of the aftershocks. The
result shows that the proposed method stably estimates the parameters of the
distribution simultaneously their credible intervals even within three hours
after the main shock.

the query search time is proportional to the number of occurrences of the

systems to evaluate queries that contain frequently occurring words much more
slowly than queries that contain less frequently occurring, ordinary words. For

we consider the problem of minimizing a finite sum of nondifferentiable convex
functions where each component function is associated with an agent and a
hard-to-project constraint set. Among well-known avenues to address finite sum
problems is the class of incremental gradient (IG) methods where a single
component function is selected at each iteration in a cyclic or randomized
manner. When the problem is constrained, the existing IG schemes (including
projected IG, proximal IAG, and SAGA) require a projection step onto the
feasible set at each iteration. Consequently, the performance of these schemes
is afflicted with costly projections when the problem includes: (1) nonlinear
constraints, or (2) a large number of linear constraints. Our focus in this
paper lies in addressing both of these challenges. We develop an algorithm

linearly-polarized off-resonance and high-frequency dressing field, and
demonstrate the anomalous Klein paradox for a nonzero incident angle, resulted
from the misalignment of optically-controllable elliptical dispersion for
Dirac-cone dressed states and the direction of incoming kinetic particles in
our system. This finite incident angle is found depending on the type of light

strength of electron-light coupling. Meanwhile, we also observe much larger
off-peak transmission amplitudes in dice lattices in comparison with graphene.
We expect the theoretical results in this paper could be used for wide range of

examine the role of dislocations, cooling rates, void, and their interactions
governing the material properties and failure mechanism in Inconel-718 using
Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential. Three different structures: nanowire
(NW), nanopillar, and nanoplate are used throughout this work. Initially,
strain rates are varied from 10^8s^-1 to 10^10s^-1 keeping the NW diameter and
temperature constant at 3.17 nm and 300K respectively. Compressive loading is
applied to a 7.04 nm nanopillar by applying a constant strain rate of 109 s^-1
while temperature is varied from 100K to 700K. Different cooling rates ranging
from 0.5x10^10 K/s to 1 x 10^14 K/s are applied to nanoplates (with and without
a central void). The size of the central void is kept fixed at 2.12 nm.
Increasing strain rates in tension not only results in strain hardening but
also increase in dislocation density. Our computational method is successful to
capture extensive sliding on {111} shear plane, which leads to significant
necking of the alloy before fracture due to dislocation. The high cooling rates
creating non-equilibrium structure leads to high strength and ductile behavior.
On the other hand, the low cooling rate forming well defined crystalline
structure causes low strength and brittle behavior. This brittle to ductile
transition is observed solely due to cooling rate. Cooling rate may diminish
the void by healing the structure during solidifications process. Subsequent
mechanical properties by varying temperature and size are also presented in
detail.

models remains a challenging task. Classification models for high-dimensional
data, like images, are often inherently complex. To reduce this complexity,
individual predictions may be explained locally, either in terms of a simpler
local surrogate model or by communicating how the predictions contrast with
those of another class. However, existing approaches still fall short in the
following ways: a) they measure locality using a (Euclidean) metric that is not
meaningful for non-linear high-dimensional data; or b) they do not attempt to
explain the decision boundary, which is the most relevant characteristic of
classifiers that are optimized for classification accuracy; or c) they do not
give the user any freedom in specifying attributes that are meaningful to them.
We address these issues in a new procedure for local decision boundary
approximation (DBA). To construct a meaningful metric, we train a variational
autoencoder to learn a Euclidean latent space of encoded data representations.
We impose interpretability by exploiting attribute annotations to map the
latent space to attributes that are meaningful to the user. A difficulty in
evaluating explainability approaches is the lack of a ground truth. We address
this by introducing a new benchmark data set with artificially generated Iris
images, and showing that we can recover the latent attributes that locally
determine the class. We further evaluate our approach on tabular data and on
the CelebA image data set.

important. While quantifying disparity is essential, sometimes the needs of an
occupation may require the use of certain features that are critical in a way
that any disparity that can be explained by them might need to be exempted.
E.g., in hiring a software engineer for a safety-critical application,
coding-skills may be weighed strongly, whereas name, zip code, or reference
letters may be used only to the extent that they do not add disparity. In this
work, we propose an information-theoretic decomposition of the total disparity
(a quantification inspired from counterfactual fairness) into two components: a
non-exempt component which quantifies the part that cannot be accounted for by
the critical features, and an exempt component that quantifies the remaining
disparity. This decomposition allows one to check if the disparity arose purely
due to the critical features (inspired from the business necessity defense of
disparate impact law) and also enables selective removal of the non-exempt
component if desired. We arrive at this decomposition through canonical
examples that lead to a set of desirable properties (axioms) that a measure of
non-exempt disparity should satisfy. Our proposed measure satisfies all of
them. Our quantification bridges ideas of causality, Simpson's paradox, and a
body of work from information theory called Partial Information Decomposition.
We also obtain an impossibility result showing that no observational measure
can satisfy all the desirable properties, leading us to relax our goals and
examine observational measures that satisfy only some of them. We perform case
studies to show how one can audit/train models while reducing non-exempt
disparity.

approximate any target neural network by only pruning the weights of a
sufficiently over-parameterized random network. A recent work by Malach et al.
\cite{MalachEtAl20} establishes the first theoretical analysis for the strong
LTH: one can provably approximate a neural network of width $d$ and depth $l$,
by pruning a random one that is a factor $O(d^4l^2)$ wider and twice as deep.
This polynomial over-parameterization requirement is at odds with recent
experimental research that achieves good approximation with networks that are a
small factor wider than the target. In this work, we close the gap and offer an
exponential improvement to the over-parameterization requirement for the
existence of lottery tickets. We show that any target network of width $d$ and
depth $l$ can be approximated by pruning a random network that is a factor
$O(\log(dl))$ wider and twice as deep. Our analysis heavily relies on
connecting pruning random ReLU networks to random instances of the
\textsc{SubsetSum} problem. We then show that this logarithmic
over-parameterization is essentially optimal for constant depth networks.
Finally, we verify several of our theoretical insights with experiments.

texture-like encoding in the periphery. To do so, we introduce models
consisting of a first-stage \textit{fixed} image transform followed by a
second-stage \textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the
first stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,
which we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with
spatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and
a final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)
the foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the
reference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.
generalization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater
sensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to
occlusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a
stronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with
a weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over
different classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.
Altogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based
computations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format
of scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the
representational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have
for processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the
next generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.

memristive response is tunable by proximity to the glass transition, while
current-induced Joule heating facilitates nonvolatile operation and
second-order memristive functionality beneficial for neuromorphic applications.
Ideal memristive behaviors can be achieved in other systems characterized by
viscous dynamics of physical, electronic, or magnetic degrees of freedom.

We establish a stability result for both the regularized and unregularized

We validate our theoretical results empirically through a simulation study,
demonstrating that the approximate algorithm exhibits faster overall runtime

importance in many areas of machine learning, computer science, physics and
biology. Most of the existing work in this domain has focused on settings that
assume perfectly accurate sampling approaches, which is seldom true in
practical data science. Here we introduce the first known approach to support
estimation in the presence of sampling artifacts and errors where each sample
is assumed to arise from a Poisson repeat channel which simultaneously captures
repetitions and deletions of samples. The proposed estimator is based on
regularized weighted Chebyshev approximations, with weights governed by
evaluations of so-called Touchard (Bell) polynomials. The supports in the
presence of sampling artifacts are calculated using discretized semi-infite
programming methods. The estimation approach is tested on synthetic and textual
data, as well as on GISAID data collected to address a new problem in
computational biology: mutational support estimation in genes of the SARS-Cov-2
virus. In the later setting, the Poisson channel captures the fact that many
individuals are tested multiple times for the presence of viral RNA, thereby
leading to repeated samples, while other individual's results are not recorded
due to test errors. For all experiments performed, we observed significant
improvements of our integrated methods compared to those obtained through
adequate modifications of state-of-the-art noiseless support estimation
methods.

nonlinear as the first time in the literature. The proposed classifier operates
on a binary labeled data stream in an online manner, and maximizes the
detection power about a user-specified and controllable false positive rate.
Our NP classifier is a single hidden layer feedforward neural network (SLFN),
which is initialized with random Fourier features (RFFs) to construct the
kernel space of the radial basis function at its hidden layer with sinusoidal
activation. Not only does this use of RFFs provide an excellent initialization
with great nonlinear modeling capability, but it also exponentially reduces the
parameter complexity and compactifies the network to mitigate overfitting while
improving the processing efficiency substantially. We sequentially learn the
SLFN with stochastic gradient descent updates based on a Lagrangian NP
objective. As a result, we obtain an expedited online adaptation and powerful
nonlinear Neyman-Pearson modeling. Our algorithm is appropriate for large scale
data applications and provides a decent false positive rate controllability
with real time processing since it only has O(N) computational and O(1) space
complexity (N: number of data instances). In our extensive set of experiments

allows to regularize the interest rates in the long horizon. We apply both

developing measures of accuracy and operational efficiency for them, has been
an active area of research for almost two decades. Despite calls for rigorous
and independent evaluations of model performance, such studies have been few
and far between. In this paper, we argue that studies should focus not on
finding the one predictive model or the one measure that is the most
appropriate at all times, but instead on careful consideration of several
factors that affect the choice of the model and the choice of the measure, to
find the best measure and the best model for the problem at hand. We argue that
because each problem is unique, it is important to develop measures that
empower the practitioner with the ability to input the choices and preferences
that are most appropriate for the problem at hand. We develop a new measure
called the penalized predictive accuracy index (PPAI) which imparts such
flexibility. We also propose the use of the expected utility function to
combine multiple measures in a way that is appropriate for a given problem in
order to assess the models against multiple criteria. We further propose the
use of the average logarithmic score (ALS) measure that is appropriate for many
crime models and measures accuracy differently than existing measures. These
measures can be used alongside existing measures to provide a more
comprehensive means of assessing the accuracy and potential utility of
spatio-temporal crime prediction models.

grown in recent decades. While research has documented the role of individual
cognition and social structure in understanding information search in
organizations, this article emphasizes the importance of formal hierarchy. We
argue that the structural attributes of bureaucracies are too important to be
neglected when modeling knowledge flows in public organizations. Empirically,
we examine interpersonal information seeking patterns among 143 employees in a
small city government, using exponential random graph modeling (ERGM). The
results suggest that formal structure strongly shapes information search
patterns while accounting for social network variables and individual level
perceptions. We find that formal status, permission pathways, and departmental
membership all affect the information search of employees. Understanding the
effects of organizational structure on information search networks will offer
opportunities to improve information flows in public organizations via design
choices.

  Networks",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial attacks have exposed serious vulnerabilities in Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) through their ability to force misclassifications through
human-imperceptible perturbations to DNN inputs. We explore a new direction in
the field of adversarial attacks by suggesting attacks that aim to degrade the
computational efficiency of DNNs rather than their classification accuracy.
Specifically, we propose and demonstrate sparsity attacks, which adversarial
modify a DNN's inputs so as to reduce sparsity (or the presence of zero values)
in its internal activation values. In resource-constrained systems, a wide
range of hardware and software techniques have been proposed that exploit
sparsity to improve DNN efficiency. The proposed attack increases the execution
time and energy consumption of sparsity-optimized DNN implementations, raising
concern over their deployment in latency and energy-critical applications.
  We propose a systematic methodology to generate adversarial inputs for
sparsity attacks by formulating an objective function that quantifies the
network's activation sparsity, and minimizing this function using iterative
gradient-descent techniques. We launch both white-box and black-box versions of
adversarial sparsity attacks on image recognition DNNs and demonstrate that
they decrease activation sparsity by up to 1.82x. We also evaluate the impact
of the attack on a sparsity-optimized DNN accelerator and demonstrate
degradations up to 1.59x in latency, and also study the performance of the
attack on a sparsity-optimized general-purpose processor. Finally, we evaluate
defense techniques such as activation thresholding and input quantization and
demonstrate that the proposed attack is able to withstand them, highlighting
the need for further efforts in this new direction within the field of
adversarial machine learning.

approaches for estimating free-flow speed use geometric properties of the
underlying road segment, such as grade, curvature, lane width, lateral

free-flow speed without the need for explicit geometric features. RasterNet is
a neural network that fuses large-scale overhead imagery and aerial LiDAR point

atmosphere at 11 unique wavelengths between 0.7 mm (ALMA band 8) and 10 cm (VLA
S band). The projected angular diameter is found to continually increase with
increasing wavelength, from a low of 50.7 mas at 0.7 mm up to a diameter of 431
mas at 10 cm, which corresponds to 1.35 and 11.6 times the photospheric angular
diameter, respectively. All four ALMA measurements show that the shape of the
atmosphere is elongated, with a flattening of 15% at a similar position angle.
The disk-averaged gas temperature of the atmosphere initially rises from a
value of 2700 K at 1.35 $R_{\star}$ (i.e., 0.35 $R_{\star}$ above the
photosphere) to a peak value of 3800 K at $\sim$2.5 $R_{\star}$, after which it
then more gradually decreases to 1650 K at 11.6 $R_{\star}$. The rise in gas
temperature between 1.35 $R_{\star}$ and $\sim$2.5 $R_{\star}$ is evidence for
a chromospheric temperature rise above the photosphere of a red supergiant. We
detect a clear change in the spectral index across the sampled wavelength
range, with the flux density ${S_{\nu}} \propto {\nu}^{1.42}$ between 0.7 mm
and 1.4 cm, which we associate with chromosphere-dominated emission, while the
flux density ${S_{\nu}} \propto {\nu}^{0.8}$ between 4.3 cm and 10 cm, which we
associate with wind-dominated emission. We then perform nonlocal thermal
equilibrium modeling of the far-ultraviolet radiation field of another early-M

transmits one bit per each OFDM subcarrier broadcasted from a WiFi access

exploit the special spectrum structure of OFDM to transmit more data over its

higher data rate compared to existing AmBC methods. Analytical and numerical

Robust ST can be
simply understood as a (slow) time-varying subspace extension of robust PCA. It
assumes that the true data lies in a low-dimensional subspace that is either
fixed or changes slowly with time. The goal is to track the changing subspaces
over time in the presence of additive sparse outliers and to do this quickly
(with a short delay). We introduce a ""fast"" mini-batch robust ST solution that
is provably correct under mild assumptions. Here ""fast"" means two things: (i)
the subspace changes can be detected and the subspaces can be tracked with
near-optimal delay, and (ii) the time complexity of doing this is the same as
that of simple (non-robust) PCA. Our main result assumes piecewise constant
subspaces (needed for identifiability), but we also provide a corollary for the
case when there is a little change at each time.
  A second contribution is a novel non-asymptotic guarantee for PCA in linearly
data-dependent noise. An important setting where this is useful is for linearly
data dependent noise that is sparse with support that changes enough over time.
The analysis of the subspace update step of our proposed robust ST solution
uses this result.

sources that contain sensitive information may have immense potential which
could be unlocked using the right privacy enhancing transformations, but
current methods often fail to produce convincing output. Furthermore, finding
the right balance between privacy and utility is often a tricky trade-off. In
this work, we propose a novel approach for data privatization, which involves
two steps: in the first step, it removes the sensitive information, and in the
second step, it replaces this information with an independent random sample.
Our method builds on adversarial representation learning which ensures strong
privacy by training the model to fool an increasingly strong adversary. While
previous methods only aim at obfuscating the sensitive information, we find
that adding new random information in its place strengthens the provided
privacy and provides better utility at any given level of privacy. The result
is an approach that can provide stronger privatization on image data, and yet
be preserving both the domain and the utility of the inputs, entirely
independent of the downstream task.

  Besides its simplicity, our approach enjoys several advantages. First, the
obtained high-probability regret bounds are data-dependent and could be much
smaller than the worst-case bounds, which resolves an open problem asked by Neu

Abernethy and Rakhlin (2009), our approach leads to the first general and
efficient algorithm with a high-probability regret bound for adversarial linear

adversarial Markov Decision Processes and provides the first algorithm with a

speed, accuracy, visibility, and robustness to variable lighting conditions.
Regarding these issues, Basler acA1920-40uc camera with an LM6HC lens were

The sensing module was tested in four orchards and captured 9128 images.
According to the saturation rate parameter, the captured images were typical in
96% of conditions and the rest were glare due to the sunny weather and early

of the robot a flower can be seen at least in three images in normal

\frac{3}{5}H^{2}+\frac{8}{3}K$ when $n=3$. This condition is related to a
famous theorem of Simons, which states that the only minimal hypersurfaces
satisfying $\vert A\vert^2<nK$ are the totally geodesic hyperspheres. It is
related to but distinct from two-convexity. Notably, in contrast to
two-convexity, it allows the mean curvature to change sign. We show that the
pinching condition is preserved by mean curvature flow, and obtain a
cylindrical estimate and corresponding pointwise derivative estimates for the
curvature. As a result, we find that the flow becomes either uniformly convex
or quantitatively cylindrical in regions of high curvature. This allows us to
apply the surgery apparatus developed by Huisken and Sinestrari. We conclude
that any smoothly, properly, isometrically immersed hypersurface $\mathcal{M}$

$\mathbb S^n$ or the connected sum of a finite number of copies of $\mathbb

includes the coupling of the nonlinear acoustic field with structural responses

recent work by Hashimoto et al. reported a local 'blue cluster' with high

They ascribed this blue cluster to the feeding of gas along a filamentary
structure around the cluster. In this work we use group catalog from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) and the state-of-art of
semi-analytic model (SAM) to investigate the formation of blue clusters in

  SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts",,,,,"q-bio.GN","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Genomics has become an essential technology for surveilling emerging
infectious disease outbreaks. A wide range of technologies and strategies for
pathogen genome enrichment and sequencing are being used by laboratories
worldwide, together with different, and sometimes ad hoc, analytical procedures
for generating genome sequences. As a result, public repositories now contain
non-standard entries of varying quality. A standardized analytical process for
consensus genome sequence determination, particularly for outbreaks such as the
ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is critical to provide a solid genomic basis for
epidemiological analyses and well-informed decision making. To address this
need, we have developed a bioinformatic workflow to standardize the analysis of
SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data generated with either the Illumina or Oxford
Nanopore platforms. Using an intuitive web-based interface, this workflow
automates SARS-CoV-2 reference-based genome assembly, variant calling, lineage
determination, and provides the ability to submit the consensus sequence and
necessary metadata to GenBank or GISAID. Given a raw Illumina or Oxford
Nanopore FASTQ read file, this web-based platform enables non-bioinformatics
experts to automatically produce a SARS-CoV-2 genome that is ready for
submission to GISAID or GenBank.

favoured means of capturing images from their camera application, with Android
devices such as the Galaxy S10 providing support more recently. The format is
positioned to replace JPEG as the de facto image compression file type, touting
many modern features and better compression ratios over the aging standard.
However, while millions of devices across the world are already able to produce
HEIF files, digital forensics research has not given the format much attention.
As HEIF is a complex container format, much different from traditional still
picture formats, this leaves forensics practitioners exposed to risks of
potentially mishandling evidence. This paper describes the forensically
relevant features of the HEIF format, including those which could be used to
hide data, or cause issues in an investigation, while also providing commentary
on the state of software support for the format. Finally, suggestions for
current best-practice are provided, before discussing the requirements of a

  Convolution",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generating non-existing frames from a consecutive video sequence has been an
interesting and challenging problem in the video processing field. Typical
kernel-based interpolation methods predict pixels with a single convolution
process that convolves source frames with spatially adaptive local kernels,
which circumvents the time-consuming, explicit motion estimation in the form of
optical flow. However, when scene motion is larger than the pre-defined kernel
size, these methods are prone to yield less plausible results. In addition,
they cannot directly generate a frame at an arbitrary temporal position because
the learned kernels are tied to the midpoint in time between the input frames.
In this paper, we try to solve these problems and propose a novel non-flow
kernel-based approach that we refer to as enhanced deformable separable
convolution (EDSC) to estimate not only adaptive kernels, but also offsets,
masks and biases to make the network obtain information from non-local
neighborhood. During the learning process, different intermediate time step can
be involved as a control variable by means of an extension of coord-conv trick,
allowing the estimated components to vary with different input temporal
information. This makes our method capable to produce multiple in-between
frames. Furthermore, we investigate the relationships between our method and
other typical kernel- and flow-based methods. Experimental results show that
our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods across a
broad range of datasets. Code will be publicly available on URL:

to embeddings with rich structure once trained on downstream tasks like

faithfully interpolating numbers not seen during training.

destroy `Oumuamua-size objects in less than 10 Myr. Thermal sublimation by
collisional heating in GMCs could destroy H$_2$ objects of `Oumuamua-size
before their escape into the ISM. Most importantly, the formation of icy grains
rich in H$_2$ is unlikely to occur in dense environments because collisional
heating raises the temperature of the icy grains, so that thermal sublimation
rapidly destroys the H$_2$ mantle before grain growth.

precoding design in multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems.
Although the resultant optimization algorithms are able to provide excellent
performance, they generally require considerable computational complexity,
which gets in the way of their practical application in real-time systems. In
this work, in order to address this issue, we first propose a framework for
deep-unfolding, where a general form of iterative algorithm induced
deep-unfolding neural network (IAIDNN) is developed in matrix form to better
solve the problems in communication systems. Then, we implement the proposed
deepunfolding framework to solve the sum-rate maximization problem for
precoding design in MU-MIMO systems. An efficient IAIDNN based on the structure
of the classic weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) iterative algorithm
is developed. Specifically, the iterative WMMSE algorithm is unfolded into a
layer-wise structure, where a number of trainable parameters are introduced to
replace the highcomplexity operations in the forward propagation. To train the
network, a generalized chain rule of the IAIDNN is proposed to depict the
recurrence relation of gradients between two adjacent layers in the back
propagation. Moreover, we discuss the computational complexity and
generalization ability of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the
proposed IAIDNN efficiently achieves the performance of the iterative WMMSE
algorithm with reduced computational complexity.

evidence for an event from a large text corpus, and leverages the evidence to
guide the generation of inferential texts. Our approach works in an
encoder-decoder manner and is equipped with a Vector Quantised-Variational
Autoencoder, where the encoder outputs representations from a distribution over
discrete variables. Such discrete representations enable automatically
selecting relevant evidence, which not only facilitates evidence-aware
generation, but also provides a natural way to uncover rationales behind the
generation. Our approach provides state-of-the-art performance on both
Event2Mind and ATOMIC datasets. More importantly, we find that with discrete

incorporates three algorithmic advances: an impact-aware DDP step addressing
the impact event in legged locomotion, an Augmented Lagrangian (AL) method
dealing with the switching constraint, and a Switching Time Optimization (STO)

Further, a Relaxed Barrier (ReB) method is used to manage inequality

the slip plane only depends on the shear displacement along the Burgers vector,
a reduced non-local scalar Ginzburg-Landau equation with an anisotropic
positive (if Poisson ratio belongs to $(-1/2,1/3)$) singular kernel is derived
on the slip plane. We first prove that minimizers of the PN energy for this
reduced scalar problem exist. Starting from $H^{1/2}$ regularity, we prove that
these minimizers are smooth 1D profiles only depending on the shear direction,
monotonically and uniformly converge to two stable states at far fields in the
direction of the Burgers vector. Then a De Giorgi-type conjecture of
single-variable symmetry for both minimizers and layer solutions is
established. As a direct corollary, minimizers and layer solutions are unique
up to translations. The proof of this De Giorgi-type conjecture relies on a
delicate spectral analysis which is especially powerful for nonlocal
pseudo-differential operators with strong maximal principle. All these results
hold in any dimension since we work on the domain periodic in the transverse
directions of the slip plane. The physical interpretation of this rigidity
result is that the equilibrium dislocation on the slip plane only admits shear
displacements and is a strictly monotonic 1D profile provided exclusive
dependence of the misfit potential on the shear displacement.

methodologies for modeling the regression problem. It is completely determined
by its mean and covariance functions. And its linear property makes it
relatively straightforward to solve the prediction problem. Although Gaussian
process has been successfully applied in many fields, it is still not enough to
deal with physical systems that satisfy inequality constraints. This issue has
been addressed by the so-called constrained Gaussian process in recent years.
In this paper, we extend the core ideas of constrained Gaussian process.
According to the range of training or test data, we redefine the hat basis
functions mentioned in the constrained Gaussian process. Based on hat basis
functions, we propose a new sparse Gaussian process method to solve the
unconstrained regression problem. Similar to the exact Gaussian process and
Gaussian process with Fully Independent Training Conditional approximation, our
method obtains satisfactory approximate results on open-source datasets or
analytical functions. In terms of performance, the proposed method reduces the
overall computational complexity from $O(n^{3})$ computation in exact Gaussian
process to $O(nm^{2})$ with $m$ hat basis functions and $n$ training data
points.

flexibility in demand response applications in power systems. In this paper, we
propose a transactive control based optimization framework for coordinating the
power grid network and the train network. This is accomplished by coordinating
dispatchable distributed energy resources and demand profiles of trains using a
two-step optimization. A railway based dynamic market mechanism (rDMM) is
proposed for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DER) in the power
network along the electric railway using an iterative negotiation process, and
generates profiles of electricity prices, and constitutes the first step. The
train dispatch attempts minimize the operational costs of trains that ply along
the railway, while subject to constraints on their acceleration profiles, route
schedules, and the train dynamics, and generates demand profiles of trains and
constitutes the second step. The rDMM seeks to optimize the operational costs
of the underlying DERs while ensuring power balance. Together, they form an
overall framework that yields the desired transactions between the railway and
power grid infrastructures. This overall optimization approach is validated
using simulation studies of the Southbound Amtrak service along the Northeast
Corridor (NEC) in the United States, which shows a 25% reduction in energy
costs when compared to standard trip optimization based on minimum work, and a
75% reduction in energy costs when compared to the train cost calculated using
a field dataset.

solutocapillary flow induced in a waterbody due to the presence of a solute
source on its surface and the mixing induced by this flow of the solutes and
gases dissolved at and near the surface into the waterbody. According to the
analytic solution, the induced flow is analogous to a doublet flow in the sense
that the flow is directed towards the source within a conical region with its
vertex at the source, and outside the conical region the flow moves away from
the source. The half cone angle for a negative source increases from $\sim$60
degrees with increasing source strength and Schmidt number reaching values
greater than 80 degrees. When the cone angle is large, the outflow is
restricted to a thin annular boundary layer region. These analytic results are
in agreement with our experimental data obtained by the PIV (Particle Image
Velocimetry) and PLIF (planar laser-induced fluorescence) techniques. As the
solute gradient at the surface gives rise to the force that drives the flow,
when the solute diffusion coefficient is reduced the flow becomes stronger and
persists longer because the solute gradient is maintained for a longer time and
distance. In experiments, the flow changes direction into the waterbody and the
surface flow stops when the solute induced surface tension gradient driving the
flow becomes comparable to the surface tension gradients that exist on the
surface due to temperature gradients.

trigger patterns inserted by malicious hackers. We propose a training-free
attack approach which is different from previous work, in which trojaned
behaviors are injected by retraining model on a poisoned dataset. Specifically,
we do not change parameters in the original model but insert a tiny trojan
module (TrojanNet) into the target model. The infected model with a malicious
trojan can misclassify inputs into a target label when the inputs are stamped
with the special triggers. The proposed TrojanNet has several nice properties
including (1) it activates by tiny trigger patterns and keeps silent for other
signals, (2) it is model-agnostic and could be injected into most DNNs,
dramatically expanding its attack scenarios, and (3) the training-free
mechanism saves massive training efforts comparing to conventional trojan
attack methods. The experimental results show that TrojanNet can inject the
trojan into all labels simultaneously (all-label trojan attack) and achieves
100% attack success rate without affecting model accuracy on original tasks.
Experimental analysis further demonstrates that state-of-the-art trojan
detection algorithms fail to detect TrojanNet attack. The code is available at

distribution, which is defined as the solution of a certain linear system,
infeasible using classical methods. We consider Markov chains whose transition
rates are separable functions, which allows for an efficient low-rank tensor
representation of the operator of this linear system. Typically, the right-hand
side also has low-rank structure, and thus we can reduce the cost for
computation and storage from exponential to linear. Previously known iterative
methods also allow for low-rank approximations of the solution but are unable
to guarantee that its entries sum up to one as required for a probability
distribution. We derive a convergent iterative method using low-rank formats
satisfying this condition. We also perform numerical experiments illustrating
that the marginal distribution is well approximated with low rank.

theoretical support, even though considerable effort has been expended in
attempting to provide it. Against that criticism, MOND irrefutably enjoys an
expanding portfolio of success and so is almost certainly tapping into
something fundamental. But what?
  Over roughly the same period that MOND has been a topic of controversy,
Baryshev, Sylos Labini and others have been claiming, with equal controversy in
earlier years, that, on medium scales at least, material in the universe is
distributed in a quasi-fractal $D\approx 2$ fashion. There is a link: if the
idea of a quasi-fractal $D\approx 2$ universe on medium scales is taken
seriously, then there is an associated characteristic mass surface density,
$\Sigma_F$ say, and an associated characteristic acceleration scale $a_F = 4\pi
G \,\Sigma_F$.
  The whole success of MOND is predicated upon the idea of a critical
acceleration scale, $a_0$. It is an obvious step to make the association $a_0
\sim a_F$ and then to consider the MOND critical acceleration boundary simply
as a marker for a characteristic mass surface density boundary separating
'galaxy' from an environment characterized by $\Sigma_F$. This provides a route
to the synthesis of conservative MOND from first principles.
  The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for conservative MOND when applied to
the SPARC sample is the unity line. There is no mass discrepancy.

develop GNNGuard, a general algorithm to defend against a variety of
training-time attacks that perturb the discrete graph structure. GNNGuard can
be straight-forwardly incorporated into any GNN. Its core principle is to
detect and quantify the relationship between the graph structure and node
features, if one exists, and then exploit that relationship to mitigate
negative effects of the attack.GNNGuard learns how to best assign higher
weights to edges connecting similar nodes while pruning edges between unrelated
nodes. The revised edges allow for robust propagation of neural messages in the
underlying GNN. GNNGuard introduces two novel components, the neighbor
importance estimation, and the layer-wise graph memory, and we show empirically
that both components are necessary for a successful defense. Across five GNNs,
three defense methods, and five datasets,including a challenging human disease
graph, experiments show that GNNGuard outperforms existing defense approaches
by 15.3% on average. Remarkably, GNNGuard can effectively restore
state-of-the-art performance of GNNs in the face of various adversarial
attacks, including targeted and non-targeted attacks, and can defend against

a MADM problem and a MADM model. Normalization is the first, also necessary,
step in solving, i.e. the application of a MADM method. It is a fact that the
selection of normalization methods has a direct effect on the results. One of
the latest normalization methods introduced is the Logarithmic Normalization
(LN) method. This new method has a distinguished advantage, reflecting in that
a sum of the normalized values of criteria always equals 1. This normalization
method had never been applied in any MADM methods before. This research study
is focused on the analysis of the classical MADM methods based on logarithmic
normalization. VIKOR and TOPSIS, as the two famous MADM methods, were selected
for this reanalysis research study. Two numerical examples were checked in both
methods, based on both the classical and the novel ways based on the LN. The

the farmers have to agree on one solution. We combine two approaches in order

reinforcement learning MAF approach that endows agents with implicit
communication abilities via their shared environment. However, learning
efficient policies with stigmergic interactions is highly nontrivial, since
agents need to perform well to send each other useful signals, but also need to
sense others' signals to perform well. In this work, we develop several key
learning techniques for training policies with stigmergic interactions, where
such a circular dependency is present. By relying on clever curriculum learning
design, action filtering, and the introduction of non-learning agents to
increase the agent density at training time at low computational cost, we
develop a minimal learning framework that leads to the stable training of
efficient stigmergic policies. We present simulation results which demonstrate

crimes committed worldwide. In Brazil it is no different. High crime rates have
encouraged government authorities involved in public safety to identify
solutions to minimize crimes. In this context, one way to plan and manage
security is in the division of neighborhoods in ISA (Integrated Security
Areas). Each ISA has a neighborhood conglomerates taking into account their
geolocation. From this it becomes possible to maximize security management and
combat crime. Based on that, one of the main points that generate great
discussion at the governmental level is the choice of a certain integrated
security area for the installation of a certain police battalion. This choice
involves multiple decision makers since several hierarchies are involved. Thus,
this paper aims to identify the best ISA to deploy a police battalion using
group decision techniques and tools. For this work the Group Decision Support
System (GDSS) called GRoUp Support (GRUS) was used from two main Vote
techniques: Condorcet and Borda. With this it was possible to identify the best
ISA taking into account the pre-established criteria.

  Multi-Objective Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In general, a multi-objective optimization problem does not have a single
optimal solution but a set of Pareto optimal solutions, which forms the Pareto
front in the objective space. Various evolutionary algorithms have been
proposed to approximate the Pareto front using a pre-specified number of
solutions. Hundreds of solutions are obtained by their single run. The
selection of a single final solution from the obtained solutions is assumed to
be done by a human decision maker. However, in many cases, the decision maker
does not want to examine hundreds of solutions. Thus, it is needed to select a
small subset of the obtained solutions. In this paper, we discuss subset
selection from a viewpoint of the final decision making. First we briefly
explain existing subset selection studies. Next we formulate an expected loss
function for subset selection. We also show that the formulated function is the
same as the IGD plus indicator. Then we report experimental results where the
proposed approach is compared with other indicator-based subset selection
methods.

algorithmic stability and generalization for stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
However, the existing stability analysis requires to impose restrictive
assumptions on the boundedness of gradients, strong smoothness and convexity of
loss functions. In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of stability
and generalization for SGD by substantially relaxing these assumptions.
Firstly, we establish stability and generalization for SGD by removing the
existing bounded gradient assumptions. The key idea is the introduction of a
new stability measure called on-average model stability, for which we develop
novel bounds controlled by the risks of SGD iterates. This yields
generalization bounds depending on the behavior of the best model, and leads to
the first-ever-known fast bounds in the low-noise setting using stability
approach. Secondly, the smoothness assumption is relaxed by considering loss
functions with Holder continuous (sub)gradients for which we show that optimal
bounds are still achieved by balancing computation and stability. To our best
knowledge, this gives the first-ever-known stability and generalization bounds
for SGD with even non-differentiable loss functions. Finally, we study learning
problems with (strongly) convex objectives but non-convex loss functions.

Gaussian sketches, we show that the sketched solution has a conditional
Gaussian distribution with the true solution as its mean. Firstly, tight worst
case error lower bounds with explicit constants are derived for any estimator
using the Gaussian sketch, and the classical sketching is shown to be the
optimal unbiased estimator. For biased estimators, the lower bound also
incorporates prior knowledge about the true solution.
  Secondly, we use the James-Stein estimator to derive an improved estimator
for the least squares solution using the Gaussian sketch. An upper bound on the
expected error of this estimator is derived, which is smaller than the error of
the classical Gaussian sketch solution for any given data. The upper and lower
bounds match when the SNR of the true solution is known to be small and the
data matrix is well conditioned. Empirically, this estimator achieves smaller
error on simulated and real datasets, and works for other common sketching

Hilbert space, an interesting open problem is to determine the conditions under
which the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty X_n$ is almost surely convergent. For
independent random variables, it is well-known that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty
\mathbb{E}(\|X_n\|^2) <\infty$, then $\sum_{n=1}^\infty X_n$ converges almost
surely. This has been extended to some cases of dependent variables (namely
negatively associated random variables) but in the general setting of dependent
variables, the problem remains open. This paper considers the case where each
variable $X_n$ is given as a linear combination $a_{n,1}Z_1+ \ldots

the almost sure convergence of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty X_n$ which is also sufficient
for the almost sure convergence of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \pm X_n$ for all

for a variety of applications. So far, operations of high power and
brightness-enhanced RFLs have absorbed enormous interests along with rapid
progress. Nevertheless, the stable Raman lasing at high power levels remains
challenged by the thermal effects. In an effort to realize more effective
thermal management in high power RFLs, here we demonstrate, for the first time,
an all-fiberized RFA employing metal-coated passive fiber enabling high power
lasing. By employing aluminum to the cladding of graded-index (GRIN) passive
fiber, the thermal abstraction of the laser devices is more sufficient to
support low-temperature operation. The maximum output power reaches 3.083 kW at
1130 nm with a conversion efficiency of 78.7%. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first Raman laser generation based on metal-coated passive fiber.
Meanwhile, it is also the highest power attained in the fields of all kinds of
Raman lasers based on merely nonlinear gain.

field of autonomous driving (AD), such as ground-plane detection, obstacle

networks can be easily forgone and replaced with smaller networks for faster
inference on embedded systems. The driveable area detection, posed as a two

This paper proposes a novel binarized driveable area detection network (binary
DAD-Net), which uses only binary weights and activations in the encoder, the
bottleneck, and the decoder part. The latent space of the bottleneck is
efficiently increased (x32 -> x16 downsampling) through binary dilated
convolutions, learning more complex features. Along with automatically
generated training data, the binary DAD-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
semantic segmentation networks on public datasets. In comparison to a
full-precision model, our approach has a x14.3 reduced compute complexity on an
FPGA and it requires only 0.9MB memory resources. Therefore, commodity
SIMD-based AD-hardware is capable of accelerating the binary DAD-Net.

evaluate the values of paths (i.e., feature subsets) of arbitrary lengths,
eventually go to infinite, from which we dub our framework Infinite Feature
Selection (Inf-FS). Going to infinite allows to constrain the computational
complexity of the selection process, and to rank the features in an elegant
way, that is, considering the value of any path (subset) containing a
particular feature. We also propose a simple unsupervised strategy to cut the
ranking, so providing the subset of features to keep. In the experiments, we
analyze diverse settings with heterogeneous features, for a total of 11
benchmarks, comparing against 18 widely-known comparative approaches. The
results show that Inf-FS behaves better in almost any situation, that is, when
the number of features to keep are fixed a priori, or when the decision of the
subset cardinality is part of the process.

population of agents from observations of pairwise games in a tournament. These
games are played among randomly drawn agents from the population. The agents in
our model can be individuals, sports teams, or Wall Street fund managers.
Formally, we postulate that the likelihoods of game outcomes are governed by
the Bradley-Terry-Luce (or multinomial logit) model, where the probability of
an agent beating another is the ratio between its skill level and the pairwise
sum of skill levels, and the skill parameters are drawn from an unknown skill
density of interest. The problem is, in essence, to learn a distribution from
noisy, quantized observations. We propose a simple and tractable algorithm that
learns the skill density with near-optimal minimax mean squared error scaling
as $n^{-1+\varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon>0$, when the density is smooth.
Our approach brings together prior work on learning skill parameters from
pairwise comparisons with kernel density estimation from non-parametric
statistics. Furthermore, we prove minimax lower bounds which establish minimax
optimality of the skill parameter estimation technique used in our algorithm.
These bounds utilize a continuum version of Fano's method along with a covering
argument. We apply our algorithm to various soccer leagues and world cups,
cricket world cups, and mutual funds. We find that the entropy of a learnt
distribution provides a quantitative measure of skill, which provides rigorous
explanations for popular beliefs about perceived qualities of sporting events,
e.g., soccer league rankings. Finally, we apply our method to assess the skill
distributions of mutual funds. Our results shed light on the abundance of low
quality funds prior to the Great Recession of 2008, and the domination of the

  distributions",,,,,"q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inherent stochasticity in gene expression leads to distributions of mRNA copy
numbers in a population of identical cells. These distributions are determined
primarily by the multitude of states of a gene promoter, each driving
transcription at a different rate. In an era where single-cell mRNA copy number
data are more and more available, there is an increasing need for fast
computations of mRNA distributions. In this paper, we present a method for
computing separate distributions for each species of mRNA molecules, i. e.
mRNAs that have been either partially or fully processed post-transcription.
The method involves the integration over all possible realizations of promoter
states, which we cast into a set of linear ordinary differential equations of
dimension $M\times n_j$, where $M$ is the number of available promoter states
and $n_j$ is the mRNA copy number of species $j$ up to which one wishes to
compute the probability distribution. This approach is superior to solving the
Master equation (ME) directly in two ways: a) the number of coupled
differential equations in the ME approach is
$M\times\Lambda_1\times\Lambda_2\times ...\times\Lambda_L$, where $\Lambda_j$
is the cutoff for the probability of the $j^{\text{th}}$ species of mRNA; and
b) the ME must be solved up to the cutoffs $\Lambda_j$, which are {\it ad hoc}
and must be selected {\it a priori}. In our approach, the equation for the
probability to observe $n$ mRNAs of any species depends only on the the
probability of observing $n-1$ mRNAs of that species, thus yielding a correct
probability distribution up to an arbitrary $n$. To demonstrate the validity of
our derivations, we compare our results with Gillespie simulations for ten
randomly selected system parameters.

fix of this problem, we propose a new activation, namely, $x + \sin^2(x)$,
which achieves the desired periodic inductive bias to learn a periodic function
while maintaining a favorable optimization property of the ReLU-based
activations. Experimentally, we apply the proposed method to temperature and
financial data prediction.

Here, we instead use satellite observations together with bottom-up information

Specifically, we use TROPOMI observations of NO$_2$ to deduce ten-day moving

by sector and province. Between January and April 2020, China's CO$_2$
emissions fell by 11.5% compared to the same period in 2019, but emissions have
since rebounded to pre-pandemic levels owing to the fast economic recovery in

attention, due to the increasing demand for deploying GANs into mobile devices
for numerous applications such as image translation, enhancement and editing.
However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models,
the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its
infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling
specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML
in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an
AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed
efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient
generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is
guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore
fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing
no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models.
We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super
resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet
more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing
alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/TAMU-VITA/AGD.

a wide distribution of inflowing angular momentum. We further calculate
radiation spectra from radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto the

Variational autoencoders (VAE) and their variations are popular frameworks for

representations for normal patterns via VAEs and any deviation from that can
indicate anomalies. However, the training data itself can contain outliers. The
source of outliers in training data include the data collection process itself
(random noise) or a malicious attacker (data poisoning) who may target to
degrade the performance of the machine learning model. In either case, these
outliers can disproportionately affect the training process of VAEs and may
lead to wrong conclusions about what the normal behavior is. In this work, we
derive a novel form of a variational autoencoder for tabular data sets with
categorical and continuous features that is robust to outliers in training

ConvLSTM) is 4.03 cm (4.51 cm), the 15th-day anomaly correlation coefficient is

given latency bound during overload situations when there is a limitation on

(QoR). Therefore, it is crucial to perform load shedding in a way that has the
lowest impact on QoR. Researchers, in the CEP domain, propose to drop either
events or partial matches (PMs) in overload cases. They assign utilities to
events or PMs by considering either the importance of events or the importance
of PMs but not both together. In this paper, we propose a load shedding
approach for CEP systems that combines these approaches by assigning a utility
to an event by considering both the event importance and the importance of PMs.
We adopt a probabilistic model that uses the type and position of an event in a
window and the state of a PM to assign a utility to an event corresponding to
each PM. We, also, propose an approach to predict a utility threshold that is
used to drop the required amount of events to maintain a given latency bound.
By extensive evaluations on two real-world datasets and several representative

outperforms state-of-the-art load shedding approaches, w.r.t. QoR.

lattice can be holographically described through a Chern-Simons theory for
$U\left(1\right)^{D}\times U\left(1\right)^{D}$ with a precise prescription to
sum over three-dimensional handlebodies. We show that a gravitational dual of
these averaged CFT's would be provided by Einstein gravity on AdS$_{3}$ with
$U\left(1\right)^{D-1}\times U\left(1\right)^{D-1}$ gauge fields, endowed with
a precise set of boundary conditions closely related to the ""soft hairy"" ones.
Gravitational excitations then go along diagonal $SL\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)$
generators, so that the asymptotic symmetries are spanned by
$U\left(1\right)^{D}\times U\left(1\right)^{D}$ currents. The stress-energy
tensor can then be geometrically seen as composite of these currents through a
twisted Sugawara construction. Our boundary conditions are such that for the
reduced phase space, there is a one-to-one map between the configurations in
the gravitational and the purely abelian theories. The partition function in
the bulk could then also be performed either from a non-abelian Chern-Simons
theory for two copies of $SL\left(2,\mathbb{R}\right)\times
U\left(1\right)^{D-1}$ generators, or formally through a path integral along
the family of allowed configurations for the metric. The new boundary
conditions naturally accommodate BTZ black holes, and the microscopic number of
states then appears to be manifestly positive and suitably accounted for from
the partition function in the bulk. The inclusion of higher spin currents
through an extended twisted Sugawara construction in the context of higher spin
gravity is also briefly addressed.

weights converge more quickly with often better generalization performances. It
has been argued that the normalization-induced scale invariance among the
weights provides an advantageous ground for gradient descent (GD) optimizers:
the effective step sizes are automatically reduced over time, stabilizing the
overall training procedure. It is often overlooked, however, that the
additional introduction of momentum in GD optimizers results in a far more
rapid reduction in effective step sizes for scale-invariant weights, a
phenomenon that has not yet been studied and may have caused unwanted side
effects in the current practice. This is a crucial issue because arguably the
vast majority of modern deep neural networks consist of (1) momentum-based GD
(e.g. SGD or Adam) and (2) scale-invariant parameters. In this paper, we verify
that the widely-adopted combination of the two ingredients lead to the
premature decay of effective step sizes and sub-optimal model performances. We
propose a simple and effective remedy, SGDP and AdamP: get rid of the radial
component, or the norm-increasing direction, at each optimizer step. Because of
the scale invariance, this modification only alters the effective step sizes
without changing the effective update directions, thus enjoying the original
convergence properties of GD optimizers. Given the ubiquity of momentum GD and
scale invariance in machine learning, we have evaluated our methods against the
baselines on 13 benchmarks. They range from vision tasks like classification
(e.g. ImageNet), retrieval (e.g. CUB and SOP), and detection (e.g. COCO) to
language modelling (e.g. WikiText) and audio classification (e.g. DCASE) tasks.
We verify that our solution brings about uniform gains in those benchmarks.

setting. This work introduces a new class of constraints in which the same
black-box function occurs multiple times evaluated at different domain points.
Such constraints are important in applications where, e.g., safety-critical
measures are aggregated over multiple time periods. Our approach, which uses
robust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into
deterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified
probability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. This
approach extends robust optimization methods from parametric uncertainty to
uncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity
conditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex
cases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially
relevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively
mitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example,
we develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions.

significantly reduce commuting and is not associated with deficits of working
from home (e.g. isolation, lack of focus). However, environmental burden might
increase through co-working due to the infrastructure required to set-up and
operate the co-working space and potential rebound effects. In this paper, we
(1) develop a framework of direct and indirect environmental effects of

requirements associated with operating the coworking space can counterbalance
commute-related energy savings. Thus, in order to realize energy savings
co-working should be accompanied with additional energy saving measures such as
a net reduction of (heated) floor space(at the co-working space, at the
employer's office and the co-workers home) and use of energy efficient
transport modes.

radiative zone which is initially made to rotate differentially in the presence
of a large-scale poloidal magnetic field threading the whole domain. We focus
both on the axisymmetric configurations produced by the initial winding-up of
the magnetic field lines and on the possible instabilities of those
configurations. We aim in particular at assessing the role of the
stratification at stabilising the system. We perform 2D and 3D global
Boussinesq numerical simulations started from an initial radial or cylindrical
differential rotation and a large-scale poloidal magnetic field. Under the
conditions of a large rotation frequency compared to the Alfv\'en frequency, a
magnetic configuration strongly dominated by its toroidal component is built.
The parameters of the simulations are chosen to respect the ordering of time
scales of a typical stellar radiative zone. In this framework, the axisymmetric
evolution is studied by varying the relative effects of the thermal diffusion,
the Br\""unt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency, the rotation and the initial poloidal
field strength. We find that the axisymmetric state only depends on
$t_{es}/t_{Ap}$, the ratio between the Eddington-Sweet circulation time scale
and the Alfv\'en time scale. A scale analysis of the Boussinesq equations
allows us to recover this result. In the cylindrical case, a magneto-rotational
instability develops when the thermal diffusivity is sufficiently high to
enable the favored wavenumbers to be insensitive to the effects of the stable
stratification. In the radial case, the magneto-rotational instability is
driven by the latitudinal shear created by the back-reaction of the Lorentz
force on the flow. Increasing the level of stratification then leaves the
growth rate of the instability mainly unaffected while its horizontal length
scale grows.

price-takers to active market participants. To manage those massive proactive
end-users efficiently, virtual power plant (VPP) as an innovative concept
emerges. It can provide some necessary information to help consumers improve
their profits and trade with the electricity market on behalf of them. One
important information that is desired by the consumers is the prediction of
renewable outputs inside this VPP. Presently, most VPPs run in a centralized
manner, which means the VPP predicts the outputs of all the renewable sources
it manages and provides the predictions to every consumer who buys this
information. We prove that by providing predictions, the social total surplus
can be improved. However, when more consumers and renewables participate in the
market, this centralized scheme needs extensive data communication and may
jeopardize the privacy of individual stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized prediction provision algorithm in which consumers from each
subregion only buy local predictions and exchange information with the VPP.
Convergence is proved under a mild condition, and the demand gap between
centralized and decentralized schemes is proved to have zero expectation and
bounded variance. Illustrative examples show that the variance of this gap
decreases with more consumers and higher uncertainty, and validate the proposed
algorithm numerically.

solar-like oscillators that have been discovered thus far are representative of
the large diversity of fundamental stellar properties and evolutionary stages
available. Because of the wide range of oscillation features that can be
recognized in such stars, it is particularly challenging to properly
characterize the oscillation modes in detail, especially in light of large
stellar samples. Overcoming this issue requires an automated approach, which
has to be fast, reliable, and flexible at the same time. In addition, this
approach should not only be capable of extracting the oscillation mode
properties of frequency, linewidth, and amplitude from stars in different
evolutionary stages, but also able to assign a correct mode identification for
each of the modes extracted. Here we present the new freely available pipeline
FAMED (Fast and AutoMated pEak bagging with DIAMONDS), which is capable of
performing an automated and detailed asteroseismic analysis in stars ranging
from the main sequence up to the core-Helium-burning phase of stellar
evolution. This, therefore, includes subgiant stars, stars evolving along the
red giant branch (RGB), and stars likely evolving toward the early asymptotic
giant branch. In this paper, we additionally show how FAMED can detect rotation
from dipolar oscillation modes in main sequence, subgiant, low-luminosity RGB,
and core-Helium-burning stars. FAMED can be downloaded from its public GitHub

example by taking the maximum, has the disadvantage that bad estimates of a
single heuristic can negatively affect the whole search. Since the performance
of a heuristic varies from instance to instance, approaches such as algorithm
selection can be successfully applied. In addition, alternating between
multiple heuristics during the search makes it possible to use all heuristics
equally and improve performance. However, all these approaches ignore the
internal search dynamics of a planning system, which can help to select the
most useful heuristics for the current expansion step. We show that dynamic
algorithm configuration can be used for dynamic heuristic selection which takes
into account the internal search dynamics of a planning system. Furthermore, we
prove that this approach generalizes over existing approaches and that it can
exponentially improve the performance of the heuristic search. To learn dynamic
heuristic selection, we propose an approach based on reinforcement learning and
show empirically that domain-wise learned policies, which take the internal
search dynamics of a planning system into account, can exceed existing
approaches.

critical attacks: one that defrauds the cardholder and a second that defrauds
the merchant. First, criminals can use a victim's Visa contactless card to make
payments for amounts that require cardholder verification, without knowledge of
the card's PIN. We built a proof-of-concept Android application and
successfully demonstrated this attack on real-world payment terminals. Second,
criminals can trick the terminal into accepting an unauthentic offline

has walked away with the goods. This attack is possible for implementations
following the standard, although we did not test it on actual terminals for
ethical reasons. Finally, we propose and verify improvements to the standard

analysis, these jets seem to be multi-thermal small-scale plasma ejections with
an estimated average electron density of $\sim$2.4 $\times$ 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$
and an approximate mean temperature of $\sim$2.6 $\times$ 10$^{5}$ K. Their
mean kinetic energy density, thermal energy density and dissipated magnetic

the host prominence suggest that the tornado mini-jets are probably created by
fine-scale external or internal magnetic reconnections (a) between the
prominence field and the enveloping or background field or (b) between twisted

into the geometry of such reconnection events in the corona and have
implications for the structure of the prominence magnetic field and the

123,000 deadly melanoma cases detected in a single year. This huge number is
proven to be a cause of a high amount of UV rays present in the sunlight due to
the degradation of the Ozone layer. If not detected at an early stage, skin
cancer can lead to the death of the patient. Unavailability of proper resources

consistent point of view. We take as starting point the assumption that a

by a Langevin equation that locally either conserves or not the field. Its
dynamic behavior may also depend on the action of external agents on the bulk
or/and at the system's boundaries. We derive the corresponding Fokker-Planck
equation and the probability of a path and we use them to study general
properties of the system's stationary state. In particular we focus on the
study of the quasi-potential that defines the stationary distribution at the
small noise limit. We argue that the system is at equilibrium when it is
macroscopic reversible, that is when the most probable path to create a
fluctuation from the stationary state is equal to the time reversed path that
relaxes it. When this doesn't occur the system is in a nonequilibrium
stationary state whose quasi-potential may present some lack of
differentiability and/or long range action. We also derive closed equations for
the two-body correlations at the stationary state and we apply them to some

neural circuit is to determine which, if any, of the neurons in the circuit are
vital for the biological behavior governed by the neural circuit. A similar
problem is to determine whether a given small set of neurons may be enough for
the behavior to be displayed, even if all other neurons in the circuit are
deactivated. Such a subset of neurons forms what is called a degenerate circuit
for the behavior being studied.
  Recent advances in experimental techniques have provided researchers with
tools to activate and deactivate subsets of neurons with a very high
resolution, even in living animals. The data collected from such experiments
may be of the following form: when a given subset of neurons is deactivated, is
the behavior under study observed? This setting leads to the algorithmic
question of determining the minimal vital or degenerate sets of neurons when
one is given as input a description of the neural circuit. The algorithmic
problem entails both figuring out which subsets of neurons should be perturbed
(activated/deactivated), and then using the data from those perturbations to
determine the minimal vital or degenerate sets. Given the large number of
possible perturbations, and the recurrent nature of neural circuits, the
possibility of a combinatorial explosion in such an approach has been
recognized in the biology and the neuroscience literature.
  In this paper, we prove that the problems of finding minimal or minimum-size
degenerate sets, and of finding the set of vital neurons, of a neural circuit
given as input, are in fact PSPACE-hard. More importantly, we prove our
hardness results by showing that a simpler problem, that of simulating such
neural circuits, is itself PSPACE-hard.

this paper we propose a model agnostic post-processing framework for balancing
them in the bipartite ranking scenario. Specifically, we maximize a weighted
sum of the utility and fairness by directly adjusting the relative ordering of
samples across groups. By formulating this problem as the identification of an
optimal warping path across different protected groups, we propose a
non-parametric method to search for such an optimal path through a dynamic

models and applicable to a variety of ranking fairness metrics. Comprehensive
experiments on a suite of benchmark data sets and two real-world patient

experimentally verify the robustness of our method when faced with the fewer

scheme cannot be third-order accurate for nonlinear conservation laws. We
provide a rigorous proof for third-order accuracy of the MUSCL scheme based on
a careful and detailed truncation error analysis. Throughout the analysis, the
distinction between the cell average and the point value will be strictly made
for the numerical solution as well as for the target operator. It is shown that
the average of the solutions reconstructed at a face by Van Leer's kappa-scheme
recovers a cubic solution exactly with kappa = 1/3, the same is true for the
average of the nonlinear fluxes evaluated by the reconstructed solutions, and a
dissipation term is already sufficiently small with a third-order truncation
error. Finally, noting that the target spatial operator is a cell-averaged flux
derivative, we prove that the leading truncation error of the MUSCL
finite-volume scheme is third-order with kappa = 1/3. The importance of the
diffusion scheme is also discussed: third-order accuracy will be lost when the
third-order MUSLC scheme is used with a wrong fourth-order diffusion scheme for
convection-diffusion problems. Third-order accuracy is verified by thorough
numerical experiments for both steady and unsteady problems. This paper is
intended to serve as a reference to clarify confusions about third-order
accuracy of the MUSCL scheme, as a guide to correctly analyze and verify the
MUSCL scheme for nonlinear equations, and eventually as the basis for
clarifying third-order unstructured-grid schemes in a subsequent paper.

w$\geq$ 2, is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to testing
equivalence of polynomials to Det_w, the determinant of the w $\times$ w matrix
of formal variables. (Here, d need not be a constant.)
  2. FMAI is randomized polynomial-time Turing reducible to equivalence testing
(in fact, to tensor isomorphism testing) for the family of matrix
multiplication tensors {Tr-IMM_{w,3}}.
  These in conjunction with the randomized poly-time reduction from determinant
equivalence testing to FMAI [Garg,Gupta,Kayal,Saha19], imply that FMAI,
equivalence testing for Tr-IMM and for Det, and the $3$-tensor isomorphism
problem for the family of matrix multiplication tensors are randomized
poly-time equivalent under Turing reductions.

approximate the mild solution of stochastic partial differential equations that
need not to fulfill a commutativity condition for the noise term and which can
flexibly be combined with some approximation method for the involved iterated

iterated stochastic integrals; these clear the way for the implementation of
the proposed higher order scheme. We prove the mean-square convergence of the
introduced derivative-free Milstein type scheme which attains the same order as
the original Milstein scheme. The original scheme, however, is definitely
outperformed when the computational cost is taken into account additionally,
that is, in terms of the effective order of convergence. We derive the
effective order of convergence for the derivative-free Milstein type scheme
analytically in the case that one of the recently proposed algorithms for the
approximation of the iterated stochastic integrals is applied. Compared to the
exponential Euler scheme and the original Milstein scheme, the proposed
derivative-free Milstein type scheme possesses at least the same and in most
cases even a higher effective order of convergence depending on the particular
SPDE under consideration. These analytical results are illustrated and
confirmed with numerical simulations.

X-ray properties and the possible favorable geometry needed to detect water
maser. We have searched for 22 GHz maser emission in a hard X-ray selected
sample of AGN, taken from the INTEGRAL/IBIS survey above 20 keV. Of the 380
sources in the sample, only half have water maser data. We have also considered
a sub-sample of 87 sources, volume limited, for which we obtained new Green
Bank Telescope and Effelsberg observations (for 35 sources), detecting one new
maser and increasing its radio coverage to 75%. The detection rate of water
maser emission in the total sample is 15+/-3%, this fraction raises up to
19+/-5% for the complete sub-sample, especially if considering type 2 and
Compton thick AGN. These results demonstrate that the hard X-ray selection may
significantly enhance the maser detection efficiency over comparably large
optical/infrared surveys. A possible decline of the detection fraction with
increasing luminosity might suggest that an extreme luminous nuclear
environment does not favour maser emission. The large fraction of CT AGN with
water maser emission could be explained in terms of geometrical effects, being
the maser medium the very edge-on portion of the obscuring medium.

After first reviewing the derivation in General Relativity as an
ultrarelativistic boost of a Schwarzschild solution, we provide an alternative
derivation by exploiting a novel relation between scattering amplitudes and
solutions to Einstein's field equations. We prove that gravitational shock
waves arise from the classical part of a three point function with two massless
scalars and a graviton. The region where radiation is localized has a
distributional profile and it is now recovered in a natural way, thus bypassing
the introduction of singular coordinate transformations as used in General
Relativity. The computation is easily generalized to arbitrary dimensions and
we show how the exactness of the classical solution follows from the absence of
classical contributions at higher loops. A classical double copy between
gravitational and electromagnetic shock waves is also provided and for a
spinning source, using the exponential form of three point amplitudes, we infer
a remarkable relation between gravitational shock waves and spinning ones, also
known as gyratons. Using this property, we infer a family of exact solutions
describing gravitational shock waves with spin. We then compute the phase shift
of a particle in a background of shock waves finding agreement with an earlier
computation by Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano for particles in the high energy
limit. Applied to a gyraton, it provides a result for the scattering angle to
all orders in spin.

sharply decreases to zero ductility at 770{\deg}C. At 100{\deg}C, a heavily
strained and twinned microstructure, primarily composed of {\alpha}+{\alpha}',
was observed and it was comparable to asbuilt microstructures obtained by
conventional LPBF methods. At higher temperatures, twins are no longer present
and instead nano-scale {\beta} precipitates are observed within {\alpha}' and
{\alpha}, as well as dislocation networks (570{\deg}C) and tangles
(770{\deg}C). Solute segregation at crystal defects was observed in all
pre-heating conditions. Al and V segregation at microtwins was observed in the
100{\deg}C sample, reporting for the first time `selective' and mutually
exclusive Al- and V-rich regions forming in adjacent twins. V segregation at
dislocations was observed in the 570{\deg}C and 770{\deg}C samples, consistent
with the higher preheating temperatures. High O contents were measured in all
samples but with apparent opposing effects. At 100{\deg}C and 570{\deg}C was
estimated to be below the critical threshold for O embrittlement and locally
aids in maintaining a strength high by solid solution strengthening, whereas at
770{\deg}C it was above the threshold, therefore failing in a brittle fashion.
Based on these observations, the initial increase in ductility from 100{\deg}C
to 570{\deg}C is attributed to a reduction in microtwins and the dislocation
networks acting as `soft barriers' for slip within a coarser microstructure.
The lack of ductility at 770{\deg}C was attributed to local solute
redistribution causing dislocation pinning and an increase of O content in this
sample.

the sustainability of humankind. For this aim the RPC community has exerted
considerable effort over the last decade to reduce the emission of greenhouse
gases from our detectors. These included searching for new eco-friendly gases,
implementing recovery and/or recirculation systems, improving gastightness and
using new materials and approaches in detector conception and operation for the
reduction of gas flow rates.
  Along this line of work, we present here an RPC architecture aimed at a
dramatic reduction of gas use in chambers meant for low-rate operation. Two
chambers were tested for more than six months with zero gas flow showing no
evidence of time-related effects, allowing to consider that permanently sealed
RPCs may be within reach, with obvious practical and environmental advantages.

extracting latent low-dimensional features becomes of the utmost importance for
efficient classification. Aiming at the problems of unclear margin
representation and difficulty in revealing the data manifold structure in most
of the existing linear discriminant methods, we propose a new discriminant
feature extraction framework, namely Robust Locality-Aware Regression (RLAR).
In our model, we introduce a retargeted regression to perform the marginal
representation learning adaptively instead of using the general average
inter-class margin. Besides, we formulate a new strategy for enhancing the
local intra-class compactness of the data manifold, which can achieve the joint
learning of locality-aware graph structure and desirable projection matrix. To
alleviate the disturbance of outliers and prevent overfitting, we measure the
regression term and locality-aware term together with the regularization term
by the L2,1 norm. Further, forcing the row sparsity on the projection matrix
through the L2,1 norm achieves the cooperation of feature selection and feature
extraction. Then, we derive an effective iterative algorithm for solving the
proposed model. The experimental results over a range of UCI data sets and
other benchmark databases demonstrate that the proposed RLAR outperforms some
state-of-the-art approaches.

wavefront sensor (PyWFS) over the more widely used Shack-Hartmann WaveFront
Sensor (SHWFS) to perform their Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) mode.
The PyWFS, a sensor based on Fourier filtering, has proven to be highly
successful in many astronomy applications. However, it exhibits non-linearity
behaviors that lead to a reduction of its sensitivity when working with
non-zero residual wavefronts. This so-called Optical Gains (OG) effect,
degrades the close loop performance of SCAO systems and prevents accurate
correction of Non-Common Path Aberrations (NCPA). In this paper, we aim at
computing the OG using a fast and agile strategy in order to control the PyWFS
measurements in adaptive optics closed loop systems. Using a novel theoretical
description of the PyFWS, which is based on a convolutional model, we are able
to analytically predict the behavior of the PyWFS in closed-loop operation.
This model enables us to explore the impact of residual wavefront error on
particular aspects such as sensitivity and associated OG. The proposed method
relies on the knowledge of the residual wavefront statistics and enables
automatic estimation of the current OG. End-to-End numerical simulations are
used to validate our predictions and test the relevance of our approach. We
demonstrate, using on non-invasive strategy, that our method provides an
accurate estimation of the OG. The model itself only requires AO telemetry data
to derive statistical information on atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, we
show that by only using an estimation of the current Fried parameter r_0 and
the basic system-level characteristics, OGs can be estimated with an accuracy
of less than 10%. Finally, we highlight the importance of OG estimation in the

specifies a latent momentum state responsible for generating the observed
securities' noisy returns. Existing momentum trading models suffer from
time-lagging caused by the delayed frequency response of digital filters.
Time-lagging results in a momentum signal of the wrong sign, when the market
changes trend direction. A key feature of this state space formulation, is no
such lagging occurs, allowing for accurate shifts in signal sign at market
change points. The number of latent states in the model is estimated using
three techniques, cross validation, penalized likelihood criteria and
simulation-based model selection for the marginal likelihood. All three
techniques suggest either 2 or 3 hidden states. Model parameters are then found
using Baum-Welch and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, whilst assuming a single
(discretized) univariate Gaussian distribution for the emission matrix. Often a
momentum trader will want to condition their trading signals on additional
information. To reflect this, learning is also carried out in the presence of
side information. Two sets of side information are considered, namely a ratio
of realized volatilities and intraday seasonality. It is shown that splines can
be used to capture statistically significant relationships from this
information, allowing returns to be predicted. An Input Output Hidden Markov
Model is used to incorporate these univariate predictive signals into the
transition matrix, presenting a possible solution for dealing with the signal
combination problem. Bayesian inference is then carried out to predict the
securities $t+1$ return using the forward algorithm. Simple modifications to
the current framework allow for a fully non-parametric model with asynchronous
prediction.

harmonic oscillator as the working fluid undergoing sudden expansion and
compression strokes during the adiabatic stages, coupled to a squeezed
reservoir. First, we show that the maximum efficiency that our engine can
achieve is 1/2 only, which is in contrast with the earlier studies claiming
unit efficiency under the effect of squeezed reservoir. Then, we obtain
analytic expressions for the upper bound on the efficiency as well as on the
coefficient of performance of the Otto cycle. The obtained bounds are
independent of the parameters of the system and depends on the reservoir
parameters only. Additionally, with hot squeezed thermal bath, we obtain
analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum work which satisfies the
derived upper bound. Further, in the presence of squeezing in the cold
reservoir, we specify an operational regime for the Otto refrigerator otherwise
forbidden in the standard case.

classifiers in a constrained event space is well known. However, real world
production systems often lack the ground truth these methods require. Privacy
concerns may also require that the ground truth needed to evaluate the
classifiers cannot be made available. In these autonomous settings,
non-parametric estimators of performance are an attractive solution. They do
not require theoretical models about how the classifiers made errors in any
given sample. They just estimate how many errors there are in a sample of an
industrial or robotic datastream. We construct one such non-parametric
estimator of the sample errors for an ensemble of weak binary classifiers. Our
approach uses algebraic geometry to reformulate the self-assessment problem for
ensembles of binary classifiers as an exact polynomial system. The polynomial
formulation can then be used to prove - as an algebraic geometry algorithm -
that no general solution to the self-assessment problem is possible. However,
specific solutions are possible in settings where the engineering context puts
the classifiers close to independent errors. The practical utility of the
method is illustrated on a real-world dataset from an online advertising
campaign and a sample of common classification benchmarks. The accuracy
estimators in the experiments where we have ground truth are better than one
part in a hundred. The online advertising campaign data, where we do not have
ground truth data, is verified by an internal consistency approach whose
validity we conjecture as an algebraic geometry theorem. We call this approach
- algebraic ground truth inference.

collections sourced from the web. However, recent studies have pointed out that
captioning datasets, such as COCO, contain gender bias found in web corpora. As
a result, learning models could heavily rely on the learned priors and image
context for gender identification, leading to incorrect or even offensive
errors. To encourage models to learn correct gender features, we reorganize the
COCO dataset and present two new splits COCO-GB V1 and V2 datasets where the
train and test sets have different gender-context joint distribution. Models
relying on contextual cues will suffer from huge gender prediction errors on
the anti-stereotypical test data. Benchmarking experiments reveal that most
captioning models learn gender bias, leading to high gender prediction errors,
especially for women. To alleviate the unwanted bias, we propose a new Guided
Attention Image Captioning model (GAIC) which provides self-guidance on visual
attention to encourage the model to capture correct gender visual evidence.
Experimental results validate that GAIC can significantly reduce gender

from other stars in X-ray binaries, or in merging double compact objects.
Improvements in astrometric and spectroscopic measurements have made it
possible to detect BHs also in non-interacting BH binaries (nBHB) through a
precise analysis of the companion's motion. In this study, using an updated
version of the Startrack binary-star population modelling code and a detailed
model of the Milky Way (MW) galaxy we calculate the expected number of
detections for Gaia and LAMOST surveys. We develop a formalism to convolve the
binary population synthesis output with a realistic stellar density
distribution, star-formation history (SFH), and chemical evolution for the MW,
which produces a probability distribution function of the predicted
compact-binary population over the MW. This avoids the additional statistical
uncertainty which is introduced by methods which Monte Carlo sample from binary
population synthesis output to produce one potential specific realisation of
the MW compact-binary distribution, and our method is also comparatively fast
to such Monte Carlo realisations. Specifically, we predict $\sim41$-$340$ nBHBs
to be observed by Gaia, although the numbers may drop to $\sim10$-$70$ if the
recent ($\lesssim100\;$ Myr) star formation is low ($\sim1\;M_\odot$/yr ). For
LAMOST we predict $\lesssim14$ detectable nBHBs, which is lower partially

other positive feedback circuit, a Schmitt-Trigger can become metastable
itself. Therefore, its own metastable behavior must be well understood; in

will build on existing results from Marino to show that (a) a monotonic input

  Applications",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In conventional machine learning applications, each data attribute is assumed
to be orthogonal to others. Namely, every pair of dimension is orthogonal to
each other and thus there is no distinction of in-between relations of
dimensions. However, this is certainly not the case in real world signals which
naturally originate from a spatio-temporal configuration. As a result, the
conventional vectorization process disrupts all of the spatio-temporal
information about the order/place of data whether it be $1$D, $2$D, $3$D, or
$4$D. In this paper, the problem of orthogonality is first investigated through
conventional $k$-means of images, where images are to be processed as vectors.
As a solution, shift-invariant $k$-means is proposed in a novel framework with
the help of sparse representations. A generalization of shift-invariant
$k$-means, convolutional dictionary learning, is then utilized as an
unsupervised feature extraction method for classification. Experiments suggest
that Gabor feature extraction as a simulation of shallow convolutional neural
networks provides a little better performance compared to convolutional
dictionary learning. Many alternatives of convolutional-logic are also
discussed for spatio-temporal information preservation, including a

at single-round level, the question of how to generate multi-round dialogue
about visual content has not yet been well explored.Existing visual dialogue
methods encode the image into a fixed feature vector directly, concatenated
with the question and history embeddings to predict the response.Some recent
methods tackle the co-reference resolution problem using co-attention mechanism
to cross-refer relevant elements from the image, history, and the target
question.However, it remains challenging to reason visual relationships, since
the fine-grained object-level information is omitted before co-attentive
reasoning. In this paper, we propose an object relationship discovery (ORD)
framework to preserve the object interactions for visual dialogue generation.
Specifically, a hierarchical graph convolutional network (HierGCN) is proposed
to retain the object nodes and neighbour relationships locally, and then
refines the object-object connections globally to obtain the final graph
embeddings. A graph attention is further incorporated to dynamically attend to
this graph-structured representation at the response reasoning stage. Extensive
experiments have proved that the proposed method can significantly improve the
quality of dialogue by utilising the contextual information of visual

dependence on fossil fuel power generation. Under this trend, more turbines
will be installed in wind farms. However, the inspection of the turbines in an
offshore wind farm is a challenging task because of the harsh environment
(e.g., rough sea, strong wind, and so on) that leads to high risk for workers
who need to work at considerable height. Also, inspecting increasing number of
turbines requires long man hours. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) can play an important role for automated inspection of the turbines for
the operator, thus reducing the inspection time, man hours, and correspondingly
the risk for the workers. In this case, the optimal number of UAVs enough to
inspect all turbines in the wind farm is a crucial parameter. In addition,
finding the optimal path for the UAVs' routes for inspection is also important
and is equally challenging. In this paper, we formulate a placement
optimization problem to minimize the number of UAVs in the wind farm and a
routing optimization problem to minimize the inspection time. Wind has an
impact on the flying range and the flying speed of UAVs, which is taken into
account for both problems. The formulated problems are NP-hard. We therefore
design heuristic algorithms to find solutions to both problems, and then
analyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. The data of the Walney wind
farm are then utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.
Simulation results clearly show that the proposed methods can obtain the
optimal routing path for UAVs during the inspection.

propose a bayesian multi-fidelity method for neural architecture search: MF-KD.
The method relies on a new approach to low-fidelity evaluations of neural
architectures by training for a few epochs using a knowledge distillation.
Knowledge distillation adds to a loss function a term forcing a network to
mimic some teacher network. We carry out experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet-16-120. We show that training for a few epochs with such a

training for a few epochs with a logistic loss. The proposed method outperforms

are considered as an important cryptographic property for Boolean functions
used in stream ciphers. Both attacks are very powerful analysis concepts and
can be applied to symmetric cryptographic algorithms used in stream ciphers.
The notion of algebraic immunity has received wide attention since it is a
powerful tool to measure the resistance of a Boolean function to standard
algebraic attacks. Nevertheless, an algebraic tool to handle the resistance to
fast algebraic attacks is not clearly identified in the literature. In the
current paper, we propose a new parameter to measure the resistance of a
Boolean function to fast algebraic attack. We also introduce the notion of fast
immunity profile and show that it informs both on the resistance to standard

secondary constructions of Boolean functions. Moreover, A coding-theory
approach to the characterization of perfect algebraic immune functions is
presented. Via this characterization, infinite families of binary linear
complementary dual codes (or LCD codes for short) are obtained from perfect
algebraic immune functions. The binary LCD codes presented in this paper have
applications in armoring implementations against so-called side-channel attacks

one-shot imitation learning. Therefore, we define the place reward as a
contrastive loss between real-world measurements and a task-specific noise

a range of emerging behaviors: The robot naturally learns to select the correct

highly-compressed H$_3$S, LaH$_1$$_0$ and YH$_6$ restores fundamental interest
to electron-phonon pairing mechanism in superconductors. One of prerequisites
of phonon-mediated NRT superconductivity in highly-compressed hydrides is
strong electron-phonon interaction, which can be quantified by dimensionless
ratios of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory vs
$k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\hslash}$${\omega}{_l}{_n}$), where Tc is the critical
temperature and ${\omega}{_l}{_n}$ is the logarithmic phonon frequency
(Mitrovic et al. 1984 Phys. Rev. B 29 184). However, all known strong-coupling
correction functions for BCS ratios are applicable for
$k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\hslash}$${\omega}{_l}{_n}$)<0.20, which is not high enough
$k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\hslash}$${\omega}{_l}{_n}$) range for NRT superconductors,
because the latter exhibit variable values of 0.13 <
$k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\hslash}$${\omega}{_l}{_n}$) < 0.32. In this paper, we
reanalyze full experimental dataset (including data for highly-compressed H3S)

gap-to-critical-temperature ratio and for the specific-heat-jump ratio are
double-valued nearly-linear functions of
$k{_B}T{_c}$/(${\hslash}$${\omega}{_l}{_n}$).

principles and constants of quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR)

standard-model photons, based on QM localization at a cosmological scale. Dark
energy is associated with de Sitter space and that has a fundamentally
invariant event horizon. I conceive of DE as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)
of cosmologically massive photons and I estimate fundamentally the binding
energy per particle originating from an effectively attractive QM potential in
that BEC. Since massive photons may stand at rest in a de Sitter universe with
flat spatial geometry, I solve the time-independent Schroedinger equation for a
non-relativistic attractive spherical-well potential self-confining at the de
Sitter horizon. The minimal critical potential depth that binds a particle
state at the top of that well, combined with the prototypical condition of dark
energy-pressure relation in the standard flat $\Lambda$-CDM model, provides an
estimate of the photon mass, $m_g$. That is supported by an independent
calculation of the vacuum energy of the BEC in a de Sitter static metric with
coordinate-time slicing. These estimates provide compatible accounts of dark
energy condensation, bridging a chasm between nuclear and cosmological scales.
Most notably, I consider a system of cosmological units, or `$g$-units,' that
complements the fundamental system of Planck units in various ways. The
geometric mean of Planck and $g$-mass turns out to be remarkably close to
current estimates of neutrino masses, suggesting that even masses of the
lightest known fermions may be deeply related to both GR and QM fundamental
constants $\Lambda$, $G$, $c$ and $h$. I finally relate the fine structure
constant to $m_g$ and a Coulomb potential confined within a corresponding
cosmological horizon.

suggesting that Hot DOGs do not have similar cold gas reserves compared with

novel nonparametric definitions of main effect estimands and effect

levels of deuteration, and all its D-containing variants, including ND$_3$,
have been detected in cold prestellar cores and around young protostars. The
observation of these deuterated isotopologues is very useful to elucidate the
chemical and physical processes taking place during the very early stages of
star formation, as the abundance of deuterated molecules is highly enhanced in
dense and cold gas. Nitrogen hydride radicals are key species lying at the very
beginning of the reaction pathway leading to the formation of NH$_3$ and
organic molecules of pre-biotic interest, but relatively little information is
known about their D-bearing isotopologues. To date, only ND has been detected
in the interstellar gas. To aid the identification of further deuterated
nitrogen radicals, we have thoroughly re-investigated the rotational spectrum
of NHD employing two different instruments: a frequency-modulation
submillimetre spectrometer operating in the THz region and a synchrotron-based
Fourier Transform infrared spectrometer operating in the 50-240 cm$^{-1}$
wavelength range. NHD was produced in a plasma of NH$_3$ and D$_2$. A wide
range of rotational energy levels has been probed thanks to the observation of
high $N$ (up to 15) and high $K_a$ (up to 9) transitions. A global analysis
including our new data and those already available in the literature has
provided a comprehensive set of very accurate spectroscopic parameters. A
highly reliable line catalogue has been generated to assist archival data
searches and future astronomical observations of NHD at submillimetre and THz

provides a theoretical foundation for networks that allow multiple
communication modes. The model follows the principles of synchronous message
passing, whereas nodes are allowed to use \textit{two} fundamentally different
communication modes. First, a local mode where nodes may exchange arbitrary
information per round over edges of a local communication graph $G$ (akin to
the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model). Second, a global mode where every node may
exchange $O(\log n)$ messages of size $O(\log n)$ bits per round with arbitrary
nodes in the network. The $\mathsf{HYBRID}$ model intends to reflect the
conditions of many real hybrid networks, where high-bandwidth but inherently
local communication is combined with highly flexible global communication with
restricted bandwidth.
  We continue to explore the power and limitations of the $\mathsf{HYBRID}$
model by investigating the complexity of computing shortest paths and diameter
of the local communication graph $G$. We improve on the known upper bound for
the exact all pairs shortest paths problem (APSP) from [Augustine et al., SODA

shortest paths problem ($k$-SSSP). We demonstrate that our results for APSP and
$k$-SSP are almost tight (up to poly-logarithmic factors). Furthermore, we give
an improved algorithm for the exact single source shortest paths problem for
graphs with large diameter. For the problem of approximating the diameter of
the local communication network we give the first non-trivial upper bound. This
upper bound is complemented by a lower bound for the exact diameter problem.

networks, allow for modeling only the first type of common sense. To model the
second type, it is vital to understand the motives and rules of human behavior.
This model is based on real-life heuristics, i.e., the rules of thumb,
developed through knowledge and experience of different generations. Such
knowledge base allows for development of an expert system with inference and
explanatory mechanisms (commonsense reasoning algorithms and personal models).

roughness. To do so, the Taylor-Couette geometry is used, allowing for both
accurate global drag and local flow measurements. The inner cylinder - coated
with a rough, hydrophobic material - is rotating, whereas the smooth outer
cylinder is kept stationary. The crucial control parameter is the air volume
fraction $\alpha$ present in the working fluid. For small volume fractions
($\alpha < {4}\,\%$), we observe that the surface roughness from the coating
increases the drag. For large volume fractions of air ($\alpha \geq 4\,\%$),
the drag decreases compared to the case with both the inner and outer cylinders
uncoated, i.e. smooth and hydrophilic, using the same volume fraction of air.
This suggests that two competing mechanisms are at place: on the one hand the
roughness invokes an extension of the log-layer - resulting in an increase in
drag - and on the other hand there is a drag-reducing mechanism of the
hydrophobic surface interacting with the bubbly liquid. The balance between
these two effects determines whether there is overall drag reduction or drag
enhancement. For further increased bubble concentration $\alpha = {6}\,\%$ we
find a saturation of the drag reduction effect. Our study gives guidelines for
industrial applications of bubbly drag reduction in hydrophobic wall-bounded

of flip-flop stages yields a dramatic improvement of their overall
metastability hardness, in this paper we elaborate on the question whether the
cascading of Schmitt-Trigger stages can obtain a similar gain. We perform a
theoretic analysis that is backed up by an existing metastability model for a

metastability is indeed reduced from the first stage to the second which
suggests an improvement. On the downside, however, it becomes clear that
metastability can still not be completely ruled out, and in some cases the

Emerging technologies such as renewable energy integration, distributed energy

different known voltage instability mechanisms, and then focuses on a class of
voltage instability which is induced by the singular surface of the algebraic
manifold. We argue and demonstrate that this class can include both dynamic and
static voltage instabilities. To determine the minimum distance to the point of

formulation is further converted into an optimal control framework for
identifying the path with minimum distance on the manifold. Comprehensive
numerical studies are conducted on some manifolds of different power system
test cases and demonstrate that the proposed method yields candidates for the
local shortest paths to the singular surface on the manifold for both the
dynamic model and the static model. Simulations show that the proposed method
can identify shorter paths on the manifold than the paths associated with the
minimum Euclidean distances. Furthermore, the proposed method always locates
the right path ending at the correct singular surface which is responsible for
the voltage instability; while the Euclidean distance formulation can
mistakenly find solutions on the wrong singular surface. A broad range of
potential applications using the proposed method are also discussed.

influenced by recommendations. In this setting, the user's overall experience
is a product of both the user's interest in a recommended content, i.e., the
recommendation quality (RQ), and the SQ of this content. However, network
decisions (like caching) that affect the SQ are usually made without
considering the recommender's actions. Likewise, recommendations are chosen
independently of the potential delivery quality. In this paper, we define a
metric of streaming experience (MoSE) that captures the fundamental tradeoff

in a generic network of caches, with the objective of maximizing this metric.
This is in line with the recent trend for content providers to simultaneously

applications of these methods to mirror levels in nucleon+${}^{12}{\rm C}$,
nucleon+${}^{16}{\rm O}$, and nucleon+${}^{26}{\rm Al}$ are presented. A new
approach to multi-level mirror symmetry is derived and applied to the first
three $2^+$ states of ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ and ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$.
  Conclusions: The relationship between the quantities of interest is clarified
and certain procedures are recommended. It is found that the asymptotic
normalization constant of the second $2^+$ state in ${}^{18}{\rm Ne}$ deduced
from the mirror state in ${}^{18}{\rm O}$ is significantly larger than found in
previous work. This finding has the effect of increasing the ${}^{17}{\rm
F}(p,\gamma){}^{18}{\rm Ne}$ reaction rate in novae.

  Constrained Minimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Descent directions such as movement towards Frank-Wolfe vertices, away steps,
in-face away steps and pairwise directions have been an important design
consideration in conditional gradient descent (CGD) variants. In this work, we
attempt to demystify the impact of movement in these directions towards
attaining constrained minimizers. The best local direction of descent is the
directional derivative of the projection of the gradient, which we refer to as
the $\textit{shadow}$ of the gradient. We show that the continuous-time
dynamics of moving in the shadow are equivalent to those of PGD however
non-trivial to discretize. By projecting gradients in PGD, one not only ensures
feasibility but is also able to ""wrap"" around the convex region. We show that
Frank-Wolfe (FW) vertices in fact recover the maximal wrap one can obtain by
projecting gradients, thus providing a new perspective on these steps. We also
claim that the shadow steps give the best direction of descent emanating from
the convex hull of all possible away-steps. Viewing PGD movements in terms of
shadow steps gives linear convergence, dependent on the number of faces. We
combine these insights into a novel $S\small{HADOW}$-$CG$ method that uses FW
steps (i.e., wrap around the polytope) and shadow steps (i.e., optimal local
descent direction), while enjoying linear convergence. Our analysis develops
properties of the curve formed by projecting a line on a polytope, which may be
of independent interest, while providing a unifying view of various descent
directions in the CGD literature.

combined with the differential rotation of the (proto-)star, is able to produce
an exponential growth of any initial magnetic seed field up to the values
required to explain the observations. By varying the dynamo coefficient we
obtain different growth rates. We find a quasi-linear dependence of the growth
rates on the intensity of the dynamo. Furthermore, the time interval in which
exponential growth occurs and the growth rates also seems to depend on the

captioning problems in remote sensing (RS). Existing DNN based approaches rely
on the availability of a training set made up of a high number of RS images
with their captions. However, captions of training images may contain redundant
information (they can be repetitive or semantically similar to each other),
resulting in information deficiency while learning a mapping from the image
domain to the language domain. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we
present a novel Summarization Driven Remote Sensing Image Captioning (SD-RSIC)
approach. The proposed approach consists of three main steps. The first step
obtains the standard image captions by jointly exploiting convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The second step,
unlike the existing RS image captioning methods, summarizes the ground-truth
captions of each training image into a single caption by exploiting sequence to
sequence neural networks and eliminates the redundancy present in the training
set. The third step automatically defines the adaptive weights associated to
each RS image to combine the standard captions with the summarized captions
based on the semantic content of the image. This is achieved by a novel
adaptive weighting strategy defined in the context of LSTM networks.
Experimental results obtained on the RSCID, UCM-Captions and Sydney-Captions

state-of-the-art RS image captioning approaches. The code of the proposed

the twin-beam intensity correlations, which is quantified by the noise
reduction factor. We derive an analytical model of twin-beam experiments,
incorporating experimental parameters such as the relative detection efficiency
of the beams, uncorrelated optical noise, and uncorrelated detector noise. We
show that for twin beams without excessive noise, measured correlations can be
improved by increasing the detection efficiency of each beam, notwithstanding
this may unbalance detection efficiency. However, for beams with excess
intensity or other experimental noise, one should balance detection efficiency,
even at the cost of reducing detection efficiency -- we specifically define
these noise conditions and verify our results with statistical simulation. This

W0=62636853.4 m2s-2. This value was first determined empirically to provide a
good approximation to the global mean sea level and then adopted as a reference
value by convention. I analyse the tidal aspects of the reference level based
on W0. The W0 is by definition independent of the tidal system adopted for the
equipotential surface, but for different tidal systems, different functions are
involved in the W of the equation W=W0. I find that the empirical determination
of the adopted estimate W0 is inconsistent from the viewpoint of tidal systems.
However, the adopted estimate and the consistent estimate from the same data
round off to the same value. I propose a simplified definition of IHRF
geopotential numbers that would make it possible to transform between IHRF and
zero-tide geopotential numbers using a simple datum-difference surface. IHRF
should adopt a conventional (best) estimate of the permanent tidal potential
such as is contained in the IERS Conventions and use it as a basis for other
conventional formulas. The tide-free coordinates of the ITRF, and tide-free
Global Geopotential Models are central in the modelling of geopotential for the
purposes of the IHRF. I present a set of correction formulas that can be used
to move to the zero-tide model before, in the middle, or after the processing,
and finally to the mean-tide IHRF. To reduce the confusion around the multitude
of tidal systems I propose that modelling should primarily done in the
zero-tide system, with the mean-tide potential as an add-on.

replication cycle. In this work, using a control theoretical approach,
validated mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 in humans are properly
characterized. A complete analysis of the main dynamic characteristic is
developed based on the reproduction number. The equilibrium regions of the
system are fully characterized, and the stability of such a regions, formally

computing the transmit beamformer that maximizes the weighted sum rate subject
to a power constraint is an NP-hard problem. As a result, iterative algorithms
that converge to a local optimum are used in practice. Among them, the weighted
minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm has gained popularity, but its
computational complexity and consequent latency has motivated the need for
lower-complexity approximations at the expense of performance. Motivated by the
recent success of deep unfolding in the trade-off between complexity and
performance, we propose the novel application of deep unfolding to the WMMSE
algorithm for a MISO downlink channel. The main idea consists of mapping a
fixed number of iterations of the WMMSE algorithm into trainable neural network
layers, whose architecture reflects the structure of the original algorithm.
With respect to traditional end-to-end learning, deep unfolding naturally
incorporates expert knowledge, with the benefits of immediate and well-grounded
architecture selection, fewer trainable parameters, and better explainability.
However, the formulation of the WMMSE algorithm, as described in Shi et al., is
not amenable to be unfolded due to a matrix inversion, an eigendecomposition,
and a bisection search performed at each iteration. Therefore, we present an
alternative formulation that circumvents these operations by resorting to
projected gradient descent. By means of simulations, we show that, in most of
the settings, the unfolded WMMSE outperforms or performs equally to the WMMSE
for a fixed number of iterations, with the advantage of a lower computational
load.

  Machine Learning algorithms",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The wiring of neurons in the brain is more flexible than the wiring of
connections in contemporary artificial neural networks. It is possible that
this extra flexibility is important for efficient problem solving and learning.
  This paper introduces the Interaction Network. Interaction Networks aim to
capture some of this extra flexibility.
  An Interaction Network consists of a collection of conventional neural
networks, a set of memory locations, and a DQN or other reinforcement learner.
The DQN decides when each of the neural networks is executed, and on what
memory locations. In this way, the individual neural networks can be trained on
different data, for different tasks. At the same time, the results of the
individual networks influence the decision process of the reinforcement
learner. This results in a feedback loop that allows the DQN to perform actions
that improve its own decision-making.
  Any existing type of neural network can be reproduced in an Interaction
Network in its entirety, with only a constant computational overhead.
  Interaction Networks can then introduce additional features to improve
performance further. These make the algorithm more flexible and general, but at
the expense of being harder to train.
  In this paper, thought experiments are used to explore how the additional
abilities of Interaction Networks could be used to improve various existing
types of neural networks.
  Several experiments have been run to prove that the concept is sound. These
show that the basic idea works, but they also reveal a number of challenges
that do not appear in conventional neural networks, which make Interaction
Networks very hard to train.
  Further research needs to be done to alleviate these issues. A number of
promising avenues of research to achieve this are outlined in this paper.

strings. The present work extends this by exploring the use of hyper-heuristics
in group-theoretic cryptology for the first time. Hyper-heuristics are a way to
generate new algorithms from existing algorithm components (in this case the
simple heuristics), with the EAs being one example of the type of algorithm
which can be generated by our hyper-heuristic framework. We take as a starting
point the above EA and allow hyper-heuristics to build on it by making small
tweaks to it. This adaptation is through a process of taking the EA and
injecting chains of heuristics built from the simple heuristics. We demonstrate
we can create novel heuristic chains, which when placed in the EA create
algorithms which out-perform the existing EA. The new algorithms solve a
markedly greater number of random AAG instances than the EA for harder
instances. This suggests the approach could be applied to many of the same
kinds of problems, providing a framework for the solution of cryptology
problems over groups. The contribution of this paper is thus a framework to
automatically build algorithms to attack cryptology problems.

theorem states that the classical local fractal dimensions of any locally
optimal outer measure coincide exactly with the algorithmic fractal dimensions.
Our proof uses an especially convenient locally optimal outer measure
$\boldsymbol{\kappa}$ defined in terms of Kolmogorov complexity. We discuss
implications for point-to-set principles.

described by the previously developed Mark-0 Agent-Based Model. We consider a
mixed supply and demand shock, and show that depending on the shock parameters
(amplitude and duration), our model economy can display V-shaped, U-shaped or
W-shaped recoveries, and even an L-shaped output curve with permanent output
loss. This is due to the economy getting trapped in a self-sustained ""bad""
state. We then discuss two policies that attempt to moderate the impact of the
shock: giving easy credit to firms, and the so-called helicopter money, i.e.
injecting new money into the households savings. We find that both policies are
effective if strong enough. We highlight the potential danger of terminating
these policies too early, although inflation is substantially increased by lax
access to credit. Finally, we consider the impact of a second lockdown. While
we only discuss a limited number of scenarios, our model is flexible and
versatile enough to accommodate a wide variety of situations, thus serving as a
useful exploratory tool for a qualitative, scenario-based understanding of
post-Covid recovery. The corresponding code is available on-line.

  methods","49 pages, 23 figures",,,,"physics.comp-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An original spectral study of the compressible hybrid lattice Boltzmann
method (HLBM) on standard lattice is proposed. In this framework, the mass and
momentum equations are addressed using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM),
while finite difference (FD) schemes solve an energy equation. Both systems are
coupled with each other thanks to an ideal gas equation of state. This work
aims at answering some questions regarding the numerical stability of such
models, which strongly depends on the choice of numerical parameters. To this
extent, several one- and two-dimensional HLBM classes based on different energy
variables, formulation (primitive or conservative), collision terms and
numerical schemes are scrutinized. Once appropriate corrective terms
introduced, it is shown that all continuous HLBM classes recover the
Navier-Stokes Fourier behavior in the linear approximation. However, striking
differences arise between HLBM classes when their discrete counterparts are
analysed. Multiple instability mechanisms arising at relatively high Mach
number are pointed out and two exhaustive stabilization strategies are
introduced: (1) decreasing the time step by changing the reference temperature
$T_{ref}$ and (2) introducing a controllable numerical dissipation $\sigma$ via
the collision operator. A complete parametric study reveals that only HLBM
classes based on the primitive and conservative entropy equations are found
usable for compressible applications. Finally, an innovative study of the
macroscopic modal composition of the entropy classes is conducted. Through this
study, two original phenomena, referred to as shear-to-entropy and
entropy-to-shear transfers, are highlighted and confirmed on standard
two-dimensional test cases.

The deduction camp concerns itself with questions about the expressiveness of

systems for reasoning from such knowledge bases. The learning camp attempts to
generalize from examples about partial descriptions about the world. In AI,
historically, these camps have loosely divided the development of the field,

neuro-symbolic systems, and high-level control have illustrated that the

between logic and learning. Our narrative is structured in terms of three
strands: logic versus learning, machine learning for logic, and logic for
machine learning, but naturally, there is considerable overlap. We place an
emphasis on the following ""sore"" point: there is a common misconception that
logic is for discrete properties, whereas probability theory and machine
learning, more generally, is for continuous properties. We report on results
that challenge this view on the limitations of logic, and expose the role that

covariates, but assume nothing about the conditional distribution of the
outcome given the covariates. Knockoffs is a popular methodology associated
with this framework, but it suffers from two main drawbacks: only one-bit
$p$-values are available for inference on each variable, and the method is
randomized with significant variability across runs in practice. The
conditional randomization test (CRT) is thought to be the ""right"" solution
under model-X, but usually viewed as computationally inefficient. This paper
proposes a computationally efficient leave-one-covariate-out (LOCO) CRT that
addresses both drawbacks of knockoffs. LOCO CRT produces valid $p$-values that
can be used to control the familywise error rate, and has nearly zero
algorithmic variability. For L1 regularized M-estimators, we develop an even
faster variant called L1ME CRT, which reuses computation by leveraging a novel
observation about the stability of the cross-validated lasso to removing
inactive variables. Last, for multivariate Gaussian covariates, we present a

reasonably accurately, any model with a deterministic delay function is
naturally limited in its modeling power. In this paper, we thus extend the
involution model, by adding non-deterministic delay variations (random or even
adversarial), and prove analytically that faithfulness is not impaired by this
generalization. Albeit the amount of non-determinism must be considerably
restricted to ensure this property, the result is surprising: the involution
model differs from non-faithful models mainly in handling fast glitch trains,
where small delay shifts have large effects. This originally suggested that
adding even small variations should break the faithfulness of the model, which
turned out not to be the case. Moreover, the results of our simulations also
confirm that this generalized involution model has larger modeling power and,

from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the

of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied sense, the LBD is
increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing.
Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort

increasingly interdisciplinary and involves methods from information science,
scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately, LBD is mainly limited to
the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep learning

applications with large working set size often exhibit streaming and/or
thrashing access patterns at LLC. As a result, a large fraction of the LLC
capacity is occupied by dead blocks that will not be referenced again, leading
to inefficient utilization of the LLC capacity. To improve cache efficiency,
the state-of-the-art cache management techniques employ prediction mechanisms
that learn from the past access patterns with an aim to accurately identify as
many dead blocks as possible. Once identified, dead blocks are evicted from LLC
to make space for potentially high reuse cache blocks.
  In this thesis, we identify variability in the reuse behavior of cache blocks
as the key limiting factor in maximizing cache efficiency for state-of-the-art
predictive techniques. Variability in reuse prediction is inevitable due to
numerous factors that are outside the control of LLC. The sources of
variability include control-flow variation, speculative execution and
contention from cores sharing the cache, among others. Variability in reuse
prediction challenges existing techniques in reliably identifying the end of a
block's useful lifetime, thus causing lower prediction accuracy, coverage, or
both. To address this challenge, this thesis aims to design robust cache
management mechanisms and policies for LLC in the face of variability in reuse
prediction to minimize cache misses, while keeping the cost and complexity of
the hardware implementation low. To that end, we propose two cache management
techniques, one domain-agnostic and one domain-specialized, to improve cache
efficiency by addressing variability in reuse prediction.

X-ray diffraction. Although all the Sr0.5RE0.5FBiS2 samples exhibited
superconductivity at transition temperatures (Tc) within the range of 2.1-2.7 K
under ambient pressure, the estimated superconducting volume fraction was
small. This indicated the non-bulk nature of superconductivity in these samples
under ambient pressure. A dramatic evolution of the bulk superconducting phases
was achieved on applying an external hydrostatic pressure. Near pressures below
1 GPa, bulk superconductivity was induced with a Tc of 2.5-2.8 K, which is
termed as the low-P phase. Moreover, the high-P phase (Tc = 10.0-10.8 K)
featuring bulk characteristics was observed at higher pressures. Pressure-Tc
phase diagrams indicated that the critical pressure for the emergence of the
high-P phase tends to increase with decreasing ionic radius of the doped RE
ions. According to the high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements of
Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2, a structural phase transition from tetragonal to monoclinic
also occurred at approximately 1.1 GPa. Thus, this phase transition indicates a

induced by the external hydrostatic pressure effect are expected to be useful
for evaluating the mechanisms of superconductivity in BiCh2-based

communications research. Before we build and operate real systems, we must
understand the science of radio propagation, and develop channel models that
both reflect the important propagation processes and allow a fair comparison of
different systems. In the past five decades, wireless systems have gone through
five generations, from supporting voice applications to enhanced mobile
broadband. To meet the ever increasing data rate demands of wireless systems,
frequency bands covering a wide range from 800 MHz to 100 GHz have been
allocated for use. The standardization of these systems started in the
early/mid 1980's in Europe by the European Telecommunications Standards
Institute with the advent of Global System for Mobile Communications. This
motivated the development of the first standardized propagation model by the
European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) 207 working group. These
standardization activities were continued and expanded for the third, fourth,
and fifth generations of COST, as well as by the Third Generation Partnership
Project, and the International Telecommunication Union. This paper presents a
historical overview of the standardized propagation models covering first to
fifth-generation systems. In particular, we discuss the evolution and
standardization of pathloss models, as well as large and small-scale fading
parameters for single antenna and multiple antenna systems. Furthermore, we
present insights into the progress of deterministic modelling across the five
generations of systems, as well as discuss more advanced modelling components
needed for the detailed simulations of millimeter-wave channels. A

present the radio properties of all clusters in our sample and show images of
newly detected diffuse sources. A radio halo is detected in 19 clusters, and
five clusters contain a relic source. Most of the brightest cluster galaxies
(BCG) in relaxed clusters show radio emission with powers typical of FRII radio
galaxies, and some are surrounded by a radio mini-halo. The high frequency of
radio emission from the BCG in relaxed clusters suggests that BCG feedback
mechanisms are in place already at z about 0.6. The properties of radio halos
and the small number of detected relics suggest redshift evolution in the
properties of diffuse sources. The radio power (and size) of radio halos could
be related to the number of past merger events in the history of the system. In
this scenario, the presence of a giant and high-power radio halo is indicative
of an evolved system with a large number of past major mergers.

consists of General Relativity coupled to a vector field of unit time type,
called the aether. In this effective theory, Lorentz invariance is violated,
but locality and covariance are preserved in the presence of the vector field.
For the mathematical formulation of the models, the 1 + 3 formalism is used
that allows writing field equations for spherically symmetric inhomogeneous
metrics as a system of partial differential equations in two variables. Using
the homothetic diagonal formulation, the Partial differential equations can be
written as ordinary differential equations plus algebraic constraints, using
the fact that the metric adapts to homothetic symmetry. The resulting equations
are very similar to those of the models with homogeneous hypersurfaces. This
allows the qualitative study of the solutions using techniques of local theory
of dynamic systems. Analytical results are verified numerically.

producing large amounts of animal manure, which, if not properly managed, can
contaminate nearby water bodies with nutrient excess. However, if animal manure
is exported to nearby crop fields, to be used as organic fertilizer, pollution
can be mitigated. It is a single-objective optimization problem, in regards to
finding the best solution for the logistics process of satisfying nutrient
needs of crops by means of livestock manure. This paper proposes three
different approaches to solve the problem: a centralized optimal algorithm
(COA), a decentralized nature-inspired cooperative technique, based on the
foraging behaviour of ants (AIA), as well as a naive neighbour-based method
(NBS), which constitutes the existing practice used today in an ad hoc,
uncoordinated manner in Catalonia. Results show that the COA approach is 8.5%
more efficient than the AIA. However, the AIA approach is fairer to the farmers
and more balanced in terms of average transportation distances that need to be
covered by each livestock farmer, while it is 1.07 times more eefficient than
the NBS. Our work constitutes the first application of a decentralized AIA to
this interesting real-world problem, in a domain where swarm intelligence

multi-agent quadratic programming framework in which each agent updates only a
small number of the total decision variables in a problem. Agents communicate
their updated values to each other, though we do not impose any restrictions on
the timing with which they do so, nor on the delays in these transmissions.
Furthermore, we allow weak parametric coupling among agents, in the sense that
they are free to independently choose their step sizes, subject to mild
restrictions. We further provide the means for agents to independently
regularize the problems they solve, thereby improving convergence properties
while preserving agents' independence in selecting parameters and ensuring a
global bound on regularization error is satisfied. Larger regularizations
accelerate convergence but increase error in the solution obtained, and we
quantify the trade off between convergence rates and quality of solutions.
Simulation results are presented to illustrate these developments.

points and, ignore the local non-linearities of the shape deformation, and
therefore, struggles to reliably model non-linear deformations. Furthermore,
available dense NRSfM algorithms are often hurdled by scalability,
computations, noisy measurements and, restricted to model just global
deformation. In this paper, we propose algorithms that can overcome these
limitations with the previous methods and, at the same time, can recover a
reliable dense 3D structure of a non-rigid object with higher accuracy.
Assuming that a deforming shape is composed of a union of local linear subspace
and, span a global low-rank space over multiple frames enables us to
efficiently model complex non-rigid deformations. To that end, each local
linear subspace is represented using Grassmannians and, the global 3D shape
across multiple frames is represented using a low-rank representation. We show
that our approach significantly improves accuracy, scalability, and robustness
against noise. Also, our representation naturally allows for simultaneous
reconstruction and clustering framework which in general is observed to be more
suitable for NRSfM problems. Our method currently achieves leading performance

similar non-local effects. Among other things, the outgoing member of the
Hawking pair very quickly becomes entangled with the black hole geometry (and
not its partner), which is in contrast with the usual assumption that the
Hawking pair is maximally entangled according to the local geometry near the
horizon. Also, an infalling wave affects the black hole geometry even before it
crosses the horizon. Finally, we find that a particle takes a finite amount of

the relativistic electrons is still debated. In this work we explore the
connection between thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM in a sample of
MH and we study its implications for hadronic models for the origin of the
relativistic electrons. We studied the thermal and non-thermal connection by
carrying out a point-to-point comparison of the radio and the X-ray surface
brightness. We extended the method generally applied to giant radio halos by
considering the effects of a grid randomly generated through a Monte Carlo
chain. Contrary to what is generally observed for giant radio halos, we find
that the mini-halos in our sample have super-linear scaling between radio and
X-rays, which suggests a peaked distribution of relativistic electrons and
magnetic field. We used the radio and X-ray correlation to constrain the
physical parameters of a hadronic model and we compared the model predictions
with current observations. Specifically, we focus on a model where cosmic rays
are injected by the central AGN and they generate secondaries in the ICM, and
we assume that the role of turbulent re-acceleration is negligible. This model
allows us to constrain the AGN cosmic ray luminosity in the range
$\sim10^{44-46}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and the central magnetic field in the range 10-40
$\mu$G. The resulting $\gamma$-ray fluxes calculated assuming these model

applications that are sensitive to household size, such as in travel demand and
housing demand modelling. Nonetheless, these demographic microsimulation models
with their associated shortcomings have been commonly used to assess various

contribute to the literature of population microsimulation by introducing a

science, mainly those where achieving good performance (e.g., scheduling in
cloud computing) or a predictable one (e.g., meeting deadlines in embedded
systems) is the objective. Despite being random variables, execution times are
most often treated as deterministic in the literature, with few works taking
advantage of their randomness; even in those, the underlying distributions are
assumed as being normal or uniform for no particular reason. In this work we
investigate these distributions in various machines and algorithms. A
mathematical problem arises when dealing with samples whose populational
minimum is unknown, so a significant portion of this monograph is dedicated to
such problem. We propose several different effective or computationally cheap
ways to overcome the problem, which also apply to execution times. These

research towards larger and more complex algorithms, edge devices demand
efficient inference and therefore reduction in model size, latency and energy
consumption. One technique to limit model size is quantization, which implies
using fewer bits to represent weights and biases. Such an approach usually
results in a decline in performance. Here, we introduce a method for designing
optimally heterogeneously quantized versions of deep neural network models for
minimum-energy, high-accuracy, nanosecond inference and fully automated
deployment on chip. With a per-layer, per-parameter type automatic quantization
procedure, sampling from a wide range of quantizers, model energy consumption
and size are minimized while high accuracy is maintained. This is crucial for
the event selection procedure in proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large
Hadron Collider, where resources are strictly limited and a latency of
${\mathcal O}(1)~\mu$s is required. Nanosecond inference and a resource
consumption reduced by a factor of 50 when implemented on field-programmable
gate array hardware are achieved.

  System","16 pages, 6 figures, accepted by ECML/PKDD 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding patients' journeys in healthcare system is a fundamental
prepositive task for a broad range of AI-based healthcare applications. This
task aims to learn an informative representation that can comprehensively
encode hidden dependencies among medical events and its inner entities, and
then the use of encoding outputs can greatly benefit the downstream
application-driven tasks. A patient journey is a sequence of electronic health
records (EHRs) over time that is organized at multiple levels: patient, visits
and medical codes. The key challenge of patient journey understanding is to
design an effective encoding mechanism which can properly tackle the
aforementioned multi-level structured patient journey data with temporal
sequential visits and a set of medical codes. This paper proposes a novel
self-attention mechanism that can simultaneously capture the contextual and
temporal relationships hidden in patient journeys. A multi-level self-attention
network (MusaNet) is specifically designed to learn the representations of
patient journeys that is used to be a long sequence of activities. The MusaNet
is trained in end-to-end manner using the training data derived from EHRs. We
evaluated the efficacy of our method on two medical application tasks with
real-world benchmark datasets. The results have demonstrated the proposed
MusaNet produces higher-quality representations than state-of-the-art baseline
methods. The source code is available in https://github.com/xueping/MusaNet.

is being increasingly adopted to predict stroke. Because of privacy concerns,
patient data are stored in distributed electronic health record (EHR)
databases, voluminous clinical datasets, which prevent patient data from being
aggregated and restrains AI technology to boost the accuracy of stroke
prediction with centralized training data. In this work, our scientists and
engineers propose a privacy-preserving scheme to predict the risk of stroke and
deploy our federated prediction model on cloud servers. Our system of federated
prediction model asynchronously supports any number of client connections and
arbitrary local gradient iterations in each communication round. It adopts
federated averaging during the model training process, without patient data
being taken out of the hospitals during the whole process of model training and
forecasting. With the privacy-preserving mechanism, our federated prediction
model trains over all the healthcare data from hospitals in a certain city
without actual data sharing among them. Therefore, it is not only secure but
also more accurate than any single prediction model that trains over the data
only from one single hospital. Especially for small hospitals with few
confirmed stroke cases, our federated model boosts model performance by 10%~20%
in several machine learning metrics. To help stroke experts comprehend the
advantage of our prediction system more intuitively, we developed a mobile app
that collects the key information of patients' statistics and demonstrates
performance comparisons between the federated prediction model and the single
prediction model during the federated training process.

attention, as they are simple to use, and require only a small unlabeled
calibration set. This small dataset cannot be used to fine-tune the model
without significant over-fitting. Instead, these methods only use the
calibration set to set the activations' dynamic ranges. However, such methods
always resulted in significant accuracy degradation, when used below 8-bits
(except on small datasets). Here we aim to break the 8-bit barrier. To this
end, we minimize the quantization errors of each layer separately by optimizing
its parameters over the calibration set. We empirically demonstrate that this
approach is: (1) much less susceptible to over-fitting than the standard
fine-tuning approaches, and can be used even on a very small calibration set;
and (2) more powerful than previous methods, which only set the activations'
dynamic ranges. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to optimally allocate the
bit-widths for each layer, while constraining accuracy degradation or model
compression by proposing a novel integer programming formulation. Finally, we
suggest model global statistics tuning, to correct biases introduced during
quantization. Together, these methods yield state-of-the-art results for both
vision and text models. For instance, on ResNet50, we obtain less than 1\%
accuracy degradation --- with 4-bit weights and activations in all layers, but
the smallest two. We open-sourced our code.

population growth. In spite of its apparent simplicity, as the population
growth-rate is increased the map exhibits a broad range of dynamics, which
include bifurcation cascades going from periodic to chaotic solutions. Studying
coupled maps allows to identify other qualitative changes in the collective
dynamics, such as pattern formations or hysteresis. Particularly, hysteresis is
the appearance of different attracting sets, a set when the control parameter
is increased and another set when it is decreased -- a multi-stable region. In
this work, we present an experimental study on the bifurcations and hysteresis
of nearly identical, coupled, logistic maps. Our logistic maps are an
electronic system that has a discrete-time evolution with a high
signal-to-noise ratio ($\sim10^6$), resulting in simple, precise, and reliable
experimental manipulations, which include the design of a modifiable diffusive
coupling configuration circuit. We find that the characterisations of the
isolated and coupled logistic-maps' dynamics agrees excellently with the
theoretical and numerical predictions (such as the critical bifurcation points
and Feigenbaum's bifurcation velocity). Here, we report multi-stable regions
appearing robustly across configurations, even though our configurations had
parameter mismatch (which we measure directly from the components of the
circuit and also infer from the resultant dynamics for each map) and were
unavoidably affected by electronic noise.

key advantage of the CIC model as compared to the standard

accounts for endogeneity in the choice of policy intervention. Our results
indicate that in contrast to Sweden, which did not impose a national lockdown,
Germany, and to some extent, the US were the two countries where nationwide
lockdown had a significant impact on the reduction in COVID-19 related total

significant impact on total and daily deaths per million people relative to
Sweden. Whereas in other countries; Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, and the UK,
the effect of the lockdown was in the opposite direction, that is, they
experienced significantly higher COVID-19 related total and daily deaths per

reservoir and is crucial for productivity optimization that needs fundamental
understanding. The present work focuses on the contributions from effective
stress build-up due to reservoir depletion and decreases in brine salinity from
low-salinity water injection. Particle detachment is studied analytically by
using the critical retention concentration function modified with stress and
salinity dependents. Increase in formation effective stress leads to
deformations within the reservoir configurations due to micro-cracks and
reduced pore dimensions. Decreased size of the travelling channels promotes
particle detachment, while the critical retention concentration decreases. A
sensitivity study reveals that, under influence of effective stress, particle
size and fluid velocity are dominant parameters controlling the fines migration
by influencing the particle detaching forces. With decreasing brine salinity
(e.g. via low-salinity water injection), clay particles that are attached on
the pore surface increasingly swell, leading to reduction in effective pore
space and flow channel. Decreased pore space directly obstructs travelling of
suspended particles and fluids which results in permeability decline. Initial
clay particle size is found to be a critical factor controlling particle
detachment behavior. Small initial particle sizes are not likely to detach from
the pore surface as a result of weak detaching forces, hence the analysis finds
the critical retention concentration unchanged resulting in negligible
permeability decline as a function of brine salinity. Considering both effects,
effective stress and brine salinity, stress-dependent effects dominate
salinity-dependent effects at low effective stress while the two contribute
equally at high effective stress.
