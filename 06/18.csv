realize exotic correlated states of matter. Here, we show that a twisted
dichalcogenide bilayer (WSe$_2$) encapsulated between a magnetic van der Waals
material (CrBr$_3$) features flat bands with tunable valley and spin flavors.
We demonstrate that, when electron-electron interactions are included,
spin-ferromagnetic and valley-ferromagnetic states emerge in the flat bands,
stemming from the interplay between correlations, intrinsic spin-orbit coupling
and exchange proximity effects. We show that the specific symmetry broken state
is controlled by the relative alignment of the magnetization of the
encapsulation, demonstrating the emergence of correlated states controlled by
exchange bias. Our results put forward a new van der Waals heterostructure
where symmetry broken states emerge from a genuine interplay between twist
engineering, spin-orbit coupling and exchange proximity, providing a powerful
starting point to explore exotic collective states of matter.

from the hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) of primary sewage sludge and microalga
Spirulina biomass was explored. A critical issue is the lack of thermal
stability of raw HTL biocrudes at the severe conditions (~400 {\deg}C) required
for hydrodenitrogenation. This fact suggests the need for a two-stage approach,
involving a first low-temperature stabilization stage followed by another one
operated at higher temperature. In this study, DSC was successfully used to
indicate the thermal stability of both biocrudes. During hydrotreating, it was
observed that complete deoxygenation was already achieved in the first stage at
350 {\deg}C, with limited coke formation. Moreover, after second stage up to
92% denitrogenation associated with the higher hydrogen consumption (39.9 g kg
-1 for Spirulina and 36.9 g kg -1 for sewage sludge) was obtained for both
biocrudes. Consequently, comparable oil yields but significantly less coke
yields were recorded during two stage upgrading (1.0% for Spirulina and 0.7%
for sewage sludge), compared to direct processing at 400 {\deg}C (9.1% for
Spirulina and 3.4% for sewage sludge). In addition, the properties of the
upgraded oils were enhanced by increasing the temperature in the first stage
(310 {\deg}C, 330 {\deg}C and 350 {\deg}C respectively). Finally, the results
indicated that remarkable drop in fuel properties were obtained, with respect
to heteroatom (O and N) removal, HHV, and H/C ratio during the two stage
hydrotreatment. Two-stage hydrotreating is therefore proposed as a successful
approach for the upgrading of HTL biocrudes with high nitrogen content.

recent efforts have also provided another lower bound associated with the
thermodynamic fluctuation of heat. The coexistence of the two conceptually
independent bounds has stimulated comparative studies of their close
relationship or tightness; however, these studies were concerned with finite
quantum systems that allowed the revival of erased information because of a
finite recurrence time. We broaden these comparative studies further to open
quantum systems with infinite recurrence times. By examining their dependence
on the initial state, we find the independence of the thermodynamic bound from
the initial coherence, whereas the entropic bound depends on both the initial
coherence and population. A crucial role is indicated by the purity of the
initial state: the entropic bound is tighter when the initial condition is
sufficiently mixed, whereas the thermodynamic bound is tighter when the initial
state is close to a pure state. These trends are consistent with previous
results obtained for finite systems.

many emerging industrial Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Quick
prototyping and evaluation of time-sensitive wireless technologies are
desirable for R&D efforts. Software-defined radio (SDR), by allowing wireless
signal processing on a personal computer (PC), has been widely used for such
quick prototyping efforts. Unfortunately, because of the \textit{uncontrollable
delay} between the PC and the radio board, SDR is generally deemed not suitable
for time-sensitive wireless applications that demand communication with low and
deterministic latency. For a rigorous evaluation of its suitability for
industrial IoT applications, this paper conducts a quantitative investigation
of the synchronization accuracy and end-to-end latency achievable by an SDR
wireless system. To this end, we designed and implemented a time-slotted
wireless system on the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) SDR platform.
We developed a time synchronization mechanism to maintain synchrony among nodes
in the system. To reduce the delays and delay jitters between the USRP board
and its PC, we devised a {\textit{Just-in-time}} algorithm to ensure that
packets sent by the PC to the USRP can reach the USRP just before the time
slots they are to be transmitted. Our experiments demonstrate that $90\%$
($100\%$) of the time slots of different nodes can be synchronized and aligned
to within $ \pm 0.5$ samples or $ \pm 0.05\mu s$ ($ \pm 1.5$ samples or $ \pm
0.15\mu s$), and that the end-to-end packet delivery latency can be down to
$3.75ms$. This means that SDR-based solutions can be applied in a range of IIoT
applications that require tight synchrony and moderately low latency, e.g.,
sensor data collection, automated guided vehicle (AGV) control, and
Human-Machine-Interaction (HMI).

estimation of displacement with Fock states always outperforms estimation using
Gaussian states with equivalent energy and optimal measurement. For estimation

detection, can be approached by modeling network data as a sequence of
relational events and then leveraging the resulting model for prediction.
Conditional logit models of discrete choice are a natural approach to modeling
relational events as ""choices"" in a framework that envelops and extends many
long-studied models of network formation. The conditional logit model is
simplistic, but it is particularly attractive because it allows for efficient
consistent likelihood maximization via negative sampling, something that isn't
true for mixed logit and many other richer models. The value of negative
sampling is particularly pronounced because choice sets in relational data are
often enormous.
  Given the importance of negative sampling, in this work we introduce a model
simplification technique for mixed logit models that we call ""de-mixing"",
whereby standard mixture models of network formation---particularly models that
mix local and global link formation---are reformulated to operate their modes
over disjoint choice sets. This reformulation reduces mixed logit models to
conditional logit models, opening the door to negative sampling while also
circumventing other standard challenges with maximizing mixture model
likelihoods. To further improve scalability, we also study importance sampling
for more efficiently selecting negative samples, finding that it can greatly
speed up inference in both standard and de-mixed models. Together, these steps
make it possible to much more realistically model network formation in very
large graphs. We illustrate the relative gains of our improvements on synthetic
datasets with known ground truth as well as a large-scale dataset of public

shape constraints. On top of (i) the vanilla, unstructured TBP, we consider the
case where (ii) the sequence of arm's means $(\mu_k)_k$ is monotonically
increasing MTBP, (iii) the case where $(\mu_k)_k$ is unimodal UTBP and (iv) the
case where $(\mu_k)_k$ is concave CTBP. In the TBP problem the aim is to
output, at the end of the sequential game, the set of arms whose means are
above a given threshold. The regret is the highest gap between a misclassified
arm and the threshold. In the fixed budget setting, we provide problem
independent minimax rates for the expected regret in all settings, as well as
associated algorithms. We prove that the minimax rates for the regret are (i)
$\sqrt{\log(K)K/T}$ for TBP, (ii) $\sqrt{\log(K)/T}$ for MTBP, (iii)
$\sqrt{K/T}$ for UTBP and (iv) $\sqrt{\log\log K/T}$ for CTBP, where $K$ is the
number of arms and $T$ is the budget. These rates demonstrate that the
dependence on $K$ of the minimax regret varies significantly depending on the
shape constraint. This highlights the fact that the shape constraints modify
fundamentally the nature of the TBP.

times dimmer than their host stars. Yet, the actual detection threshold depends
on the instrument's wavefront stability and varies by an order of magnitude
with the choice of observation strategy and post-processing method. In this
paper the authors consider the performance of the previously introduced
observation strategy (dark hole maintenance) and post-processing algorithm
(electric field order reduction) in the presence of various realistic effects.
In particular, it will be shown that under some common assumptions, the
telescope's averaged pointing jitter translates into an additional light source
incoherent with the residual light from the star (speckles), and that jitter
""modes"" can be identified in post-processing and distinguished from a planet
signal. We also show that the decrease in contrast due to drift of voltages in
deformable mirror actuators can be mitigated by recursive estimation of the
electric field in the high-contrast region of the image (dark hole) using
Electric Field Conjugation (EFC). Moreover, this can be done even when the
measured intensity is broadband, as long as it is well approximated by an
incoherent sum of monochromatic intensities. Finally, we assess the performance
of closed-loop vs. open-loop observation scenarios through a numerical
simulation of the Wide-Field Infra-Red Survey Telescope (WFIRST). In
particular, we compare the post-processing factors of Angular Differential

extended to account for possible telescope rolls and the presence of pointing
jitter. For all observation parameters considered in this paper, close-loop
dark hole maintenance resulted in significantly higher post-processing
accuracy.

distributions of travel times, AGV utilization, and AGV movement patterns in

collected at the XENON1T experiment. The excess may be explained by an
axion-like particle (ALP) with mass of a few keV and a coupling to electron of
$g_{ae} \sim 10^{-13}$, if the ALP constitutes all or some fraction of local
dark matter (DM). In order to satisfy the X-ray constraint, the ALP coupling to
photons must be significantly suppressed compared to that to electrons. This
strongly suggests that the ALP has no anomalous couplings to photons, i.e.,
there is no U(1)$_{\rm PQ}$-U(1)$_{\rm em}$-U(1)$_{\rm em}$ anomaly. We show
that such anomaly-free ALP DM predicts an X-ray line signal with a definite
strength through the operator arising from threshold corrections, and compare
it with the projected sensitivity of the ATHENA X-ray observatory. The
abundance of ALP DM can be explained by the misalignment mechanism, or by
thermal production if it constitutes a part of DM. In particular, we find that
the anomalous excess reported by the XENON1T experiment as well as the stellar
cooling anomalies from white dwarfs and red giants can be explained
simultaneously better when the ALP constitutes about 10\% of DM. As concrete

important attributes must be imputed to maximize the usefulness of the data.
This paper tends to study the capability of MDLD on estimating travel mode
share at aggregated levels. A data-driven framework is proposed to extract
travel behavior information from the MDLD. The proposed framework first
identifies trip ends with a modified Spatiotemporal Density-based Spatial
Clustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. Then three types
of features are extracted for each trip to impute travel modes using machine
learning models. A labeled MDLD dataset with ground truth information is used
to train the proposed models, resulting in 95% accuracy in identifying trip
ends and 93% accuracy in imputing five travel modes (drive, rail, bus, bike and
walk) with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed framework is then
applied to two large-scale MDLD datasets, covering the Baltimore-Washington
metropolitan area and the United States, respectively. The estimated trip
distance, trip time, trip rate distribution, and travel mode share are compared
against travel surveys at different geographies. The results suggest that the
proposed framework can be readily applied in different states and metropolitan
regions with low cost in order to study multimodal travel demand, understand
mobility trends, and support decision making.

the local Hilbert spaces, we analyze truncation effects which are present in
other approaches. The variational states are benchmarked against exact

function of several key galaxy properties (namely: stellar colour, specific
star formation rate, Sersic index, and effective radius) for a volume-limited
sample of GAMA galaxies in a narrow stellar mass range ($M_* \sim 2$--$5 \times
10^{10}$ Msol). This mass range is particularly interesting, inasmuch as it is
where bimodalities in galaxy properties are most pronounced, and near to the
break in both the galaxy stellar mass function and the stellar-to-halo mass
relation (SHMR). In this narrow mass range, we find that both size and Sersic
index are better predictors of halo mass than either colour or SSFR, with the
data showing a slight preference for Sersic index. In other words, we find that
mean halo mass is more tightly correlated with galaxy structure than either
past star formation history or current star formation rate. Our results lead to
an approximate lower bound on the dispersion in halo masses among $\log M_*
\approx {10.5}$ galaxies: we find that the dispersion is $\gtrsim 0.3$ dex.
This would imply either that offsets from the mean SHMR are closely coupled to
size/structure, or that the dispersion in the SHMR is larger than past results

computer vision. Previous methods are usually solely data-driven, which lead to
inaccurate 3D shape recovery and limited generalization capability. In this
work, we focus on object-level 3D reconstruction and present a geometry-based
end-to-end deep learning framework that first detects the mirror plane of
reflection symmetry that commonly exists in man-made objects and then predicts
depth maps by finding the intra-image pixel-wise correspondence of the
symmetry. Our method fully utilizes the geometric cues from symmetry during the
test time by building plane-sweep cost volumes, a powerful tool that has been
used in multi-view stereopsis. To our knowledge, this is the first work that
uses the concept of cost volumes in the setting of single-image 3D
reconstruction. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset and
find that our reconstruction method significantly outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art single-view 3D reconstruction networks in term of the accuracy
of camera poses and depth maps, without requiring objects being completely
symmetric. Code is available at https://github.com/zhou13/symmetrynet.

the canonical ensemble using York's formalism. Inside a cavity of fixed size
$r$ and fixed temperature $T$, there is a threshold at $\pi r T = 1$ above
which a black hole can be in thermal equilibrium. This thermal equilibrium can
be achieved for two specific black holes, a small black hole of horizon radius
$r_{+1}$, and a large black hole of radius $r_{+2}$. In five dimensions, the
radii $r_{+1}$ and $r_{+2}$ have an exact expression. Through the path integral
formalism and the partition function, one obtains the action and the free
energy. This leads to the thermal energy and entropy of the system, the latter
turning out to be given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law $S =
\frac{A_{+}}{4}$, where $A_+$ is the black hole's surface area. The heat
capacity is positive when the heat bath is placed at a radius $r$ that is equal
or less than the photonic orbit, implying thermodynamic stability. This means
that the small black hole is unstable and the large one is stable. A
generalized free energy is used to show that it is feasible that classical hot
flat space transits through $r_{+1}$ to settle at the stable $r_{+2}$.
Remarkably, the free energy of the larger $r_{+2}$ black hole is zero when the
cavity radius is equal to the Buchdahl radius. The relation to the
instabilities that arise due to perturbations in the path integral in the
instanton solution is mentioned. Quantum hot flat space has negative free
energy and we find the conditions for which the large black hole, quantum hot
flat space, or both are the ground state. The corresponding phase diagram is
displayed. Using the density of states $\nu$ at a given energy $E$ we also find

perturbation theory and validated by comparison to $N$-body simulations across
a variety of mark parameters. At moderate redshifts, including for massive

importance of non-linear gravitational effects on the large-scale spectra
complicates the modeling as there is no well-defined convergence radius of the

possible via a similar approach, and a simple model of the latter is shown to
yield promising results. The theory becomes non-perturbative at redshift zero

the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of massive galaxies, but instead pierce deep
into haloes from the cosmic web via filaments. To better resolve this process
numerically, we have developed a novel `shock refinement' scheme within the
moving mesh code AREPO that adaptively improves resolution around shocks
on-the-fly in galaxy formation simulations. We apply this to a massive
$\sim10^{12}$ M$_\odot$ halo at $z=6$ using the successful FABLE model,
increasing the mass resolution by a factor of 512. With better refinement there
are significantly more dense, metal-poor and fast-moving filaments and clumps
flowing into the halo, leading to a more multiphase CGM. We find a $\sim50$ per
cent boost in cool-dense gas mass and a 25 per cent increase in inflowing mass
flux. Better resolved accretion shocks cause turbulence to increase
dramatically, leading to a doubling in the halo's non-thermal pressure support.
Despite much higher thermalisation at shocks with higher resolution, increased
cooling rates suppress the thermal energy of the halo. In contrast, the faster
and denser filaments cause a significant jump in the bulk kinetic energy of
cool-dense gas, while in the hot phase turbulent energy increases by up to
$\sim150$ per cent. Moreover, HI covering fractions within the CGM increase by
up to 60 per cent. Consequently star formation is spread more widely and we
predict a population of metal-poor stars forming within primordial filaments

principle -- combinatorial gauge symmetry -- designed to emulate
topologically-ordered quantum liquids and serve as a foundation for the
construction of topological qubits. The proposed circuit exhibits rich
features: in the classical limit of large capacitances its ground state
consists of two superimposed loop structures; one is a crystal of small loops
containing disordered $U(1)$ degrees of freedom, and the other is a gas of
loops of all sizes associated to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. We show that
these classical results carry over to the quantum case, where phase
fluctuations arise from the presence of finite capacitances, yielding ${\mathbb
Z}_2$ quantum topological order. A key feature of the exact gauge symmetry is
that amplitudes connecting different ${\mathbb Z}_2$ loop states arise from
paths having zero classical energy cost. As a result, these amplitudes are
controlled by dimensional confinement rather than tunneling through energy
barriers. We argue that this effect may lead to larger energy gaps than
previous proposals which are limited by such barriers, potentially making it
more likely for a topological phase to be experimentally observable. Finally,
we discuss how our superconducting circuit realization of combinatorial gauge
symmetry can be implemented in practice.

time-dependent. This introduces a new class of time-dependent solutions with
the potential to address cosmological issues and provide alternatives to
conventional inflationary (or contracting) scenarios. We take a first step in
this paper toward such solutions. One important finding is that the resulting

involving only the induced metric on either one of the branes and the radion

system with k-body interactions fulfills Lieb-Robinson bounds in exponential
form if and only if the underlying interactions decay exponentially in space.
In particular, our result already follows from the behavior of two-point
correlation functions for single-site observables and generalizes to different
decay behaviours as well as fermionic lattice models. As a side-result, we thus
find that Lieb-Robinson bounds for single-site observables imply Lieb-Robinson
bounds for bounded observables with arbitrary support.

cosmic rays in the Universe. However, little is still known about their
efficiency in accelerating relativistic electrons and protons as a function of
their magnetization properties, i.e. of their magnetic field strength and
topology. In this work, we analyzed both uniform and adaptive mesh resolution
simulations of large-scale structures with the magnetohydrodynamical grid code
Enzo, studying the dependence of shock obliquity with different realistic
scenarios of cosmic magnetism. We found that shock obliquities are more often
perpendicular than what would be expected from a random three-dimensional
distribution of vectors, and that this effect is particularly prominent in the
proximity of filaments, due to the action of local shear motions. By coupling
these results to recent works from particle-in-cell simulations, we estimated
the flux of cosmic-ray protons in galaxy clusters, and showed that in principle
the riddle of the missed detection of hadronic gamma-ray emission by the
Fermi-LAT can be explained if only quasi-parallel shocks accelerate protons. On
the other hand, for most of the cosmic web the acceleration of cosmic-ray
electrons is still allowed, due to the abundance of quasi-perpendicular shocks.
We discuss quantitative differences between the analyzed models of
magnetization of cosmic structures, which become more significant at low cosmic
overdensities.

resolve the formation of proto-globular clusters (GCs) self-consistently, where

f_esc from cluster stars and non-cluster stars formed during a starburst over
~100 Myr in each galaxy. We find that the averaged f_esc over the lifetime of a
star particle follows a similar distribution for cluster stars and non-cluster
stars. Clusters tend to have low f_esc in the first few Myrs, presumably
because they form preferentially in more extreme environments with high optical
depths; the f_esc increases later as feedback starts to disrupt the natal
cloud. On the other hand, non-cluster stars formed between cluster complexes or
in the compressed shell at the front of a superbubble can also have high f_esc.
We find that cluster stars on average have comparable f_esc to non-cluster
stars. This result is robust across several star formation models in our
simulations. Our results suggest that the fraction of ionizing photons from
proto-GCs to cosmic reionization is comparable to the cluster formation
efficiency in high-redshift galaxies and hence proto-GCs likely contribute an
appreciable fraction of photons but are not the dominant sources for

works have adopted a simple ""sticky-sphere"" prescription, whose validity is
questionable. We apply both smoothed particle hydrodynamics and $N$-body
integrations to investigate the fluid effects in close encounters between gas
giants and the long-term evolution of closely-packed planetary systems.
Focusing on parabolic encounters between Jupiter-like planets with $M_J$ and
$2M_J$, we find that quick mergers occur when the impact parameter $r_p$ (the
pericenter separation between the planets) is less than $2R_J$, and the merger
conserved 97% of the initial mass. Strong tidal effects can affect the
""binary-planet"" orbit when $r_p$ is between $2R_J$ and $4R_J$. We quantify
these effects using a set of fitting formulae that can be implemented in
$N$-body codes. We run a suite of $N$-body simulations with and without the
formulae for systems of two giant planets initially in unstable, nearly
circular coplanar orbits. The fluid (tidal) effects significantly increase the
branching ratio of planetary mergers relative to ejections by doubling the
effective collision radius. While the fluid effects do not change the
distributions of semi-major axis and eccentricity of each type of remnant
planets (mergers vs surviving planets in ejections), the overall orbital
properties of planet scattering remnants are strongly affected due to the
change in the branching ratio. We also find that the merger products have broad
distributions of spin magnitudes and obliquities.

absorption requires very bright ($\gtrsim 10$-100 mJy) background sources at
high redshifts ($z\gtrsim 8$), which are evidently rare; very long times of
integration; or instruments of very high sensitivity. This motivates a
statistical one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum approach along narrow
sightlines but with fainter background objects ($\sim 1$-10 mJy), which are
likely to be more abundant and significant contributors at high redshifts. The
1D power spectrum reduces cosmic variance and improves sensitivity especially
on small spatial scales. Using standard radiative transfer and fiducial models
for the instrument, the background sources, and the evolution of IGM structures
during cosmic reionization, the potential of the 1D power spectrum along
selected narrow directions is investigated against uncertainties from thermal
noise and the chromatic synthesized point spread function (PSF) response.
Minimum requirements on the number of high-redshift background sources, the
telescope sensitivity, and the PSF quality are estimated for a range of
instrumental, background source, and reionization model parameters. The 1D
power spectrum is intrinsically stronger at higher redshifts. A $\sim 1000$ hr

explore the evolution of perturbation in such flows in the presence of an
additional force. Such a force, which is expected to be stochastic in nature

be), Brownian ratchet, grain-fluid interactions and feedback from outflows in

perturbation in the presence of Coriolis and external forces, which is modified
Landau equation. We show that even in the linear regime, under suitable forcing
and Reynolds number, the otherwise least stable perturbation evolves to a very
large saturated amplitude, leading to nonlinearity and plausible turbulence.
Hence, forcing essentially leads a linear stable mode to unstable. We further
show that nonlinear perturbation diverges at a shorter timescale in the
presence of force, leading to a fast transition to turbulence. Interestingly,
emergence of nonlinearity depends only on the force but not on the initial
amplitude of perturbation, unlike original Landau equation based solution.

aim to develop models that learn a proper mechanism of counting regardless of

based on pairs of training and testing sets that do not follow the same count
label distribution such as the odd-even sets. Intuitively, models that have
learned a proper mechanism of counting on odd numbers should perform well on
even numbers. Secondly, we introduce the Spatial Counting Network (SCN), which
is dedicated to visual analysis and counting based on natural language

and self-attention mechanisms, and provides a final counting score. We apply
our protocol on the recent dataset, TallyQA, and show superior performances

eventually change sign as density and pressure build up in the core of neutron

by a simultaneous condensation of the Ising electric and magnetic charges-- the
fractionalized excitations of the $Z_2$ quantum spin liquid. Both these

In this paper, we relax this assumption by proposing a flexible law of motion
for the TVPs in large-scale vector autoregressions (VARs). Instead of imposing
a restrictive random walk evolution of the latent states, we carefully design
hierarchical mixture priors on the coefficients in the state equation. These
priors effectively allow for discriminating between periods where coefficients
evolve according to a random walk and times where the TVPs are better
characterized by a stationary stochastic process. Moreover, this approach is
capable of introducing dynamic sparsity by pushing small parameter changes
towards zero if necessary. The merits of the model are illustrated by means of
two applications. Using synthetic data we show that our approach yields precise
parameter estimates. When applied to US data, the model reveals interesting
patterns of low-frequency dynamics in coefficients and forecasts well relative

entropy should arise near phase transitions of the associated Ryu-Takayanagi
(RT) surface. We study such corrections by decomposing the bulk state into
fixed-area states and conjecturing that a certain `diagonal approximation' will
hold. In terms of the bulk Newton constant $G$, this yields a correction of
order $O(G^{-1/2})$ near such transitions, which is in particular larger than
generic corrections from the entanglement of bulk quantum fields. However, the
correction becomes exponentially suppressed away from the transition. The net
effect is to make the entanglement a smooth function of all parameters, turning
the RT `phase transition' into a crossover already at this level of analysis.
  We illustrate this effect with explicit calculations (again assuming our
diagonal approximation) for boundary regions given by a pair of disconnected
intervals on the boundary of the AdS$_3$ vacuum and for a single interval on
the boundary of the BTZ black hole. In a natural large-volume limit where our
diagonal approximation clearly holds, this second example verifies that our
results agree with general predictions made by Murthy and Srednicki in the
context of chaotic many-body systems. As a further check on our conjectured
diagonal approximation, we show that it also reproduces the $O(G^{-1/2})$
correction found Penington et al for an analogous quantum RT transition. Our
explicit computations also illustrate the cutoff-dependence of fluctuations in
RT-areas.

simulations predict tight M_BH-M_star relations, and struggle to produce the
lowest (M_BH< 10^7.5 Msun) in galaxies of M_star~10^10.5-10^11.5 Msun. While
the time evolution of the mean M_BH-M_star relation is mild (<1 dex in BH mass
for 0<z<5) for all the simulations, its linearity (shape) and normalization
varies from simulation to simulation. The strength of SN feedback has a large
impact on the linearity and time evolution for M_star<10^10.5 Msun. We find
that the low-mass end is a good discriminant of the simulation models, and
highlights the need for new observational constraints. At the high-mass end,
strong AGN feedback can suppress the time evolution of the relation
normalization. Compared with the observations of the local universe, we find an
excess of BHs with M_BH>10^9 Msun in most of the simulations. The BH mass
function is dominated by efficiently accreting BHs (log10 f_Edd >-2$) at high

to be governed by inactive BHs. The transition time and the contribution of

Bi$_2$Se$_3$ is specially interesting because it displays pressure induced
re-entrant superconductivity where the high pressure phase shows almost two
times higher $T_c$ than the ambient superconducting phase ( $T_C\sim$ 2.9 K).
Interestingly, unlike the ambient phase, the pressure-induced superconducting
phase shows strong indication of unconventional superconductivity. However,
since the pressure-induced phase remains inaccessible to spectroscopic

we show that the high-pressure phase can be realized under a mesoscopic point

that known modalities of energy-lowering symmetry-broken spin and structural

breaking distortions and concomitant variations in spin order, are explored for
their ability to lower the total energy. The paper analyzes the contributions
of different symmetry-broken modalities to mass enhancement, finds common
effects in the range of d- as well as p-electron perovskites. Thus, symmetry
breaking in mean-field theory could describe effects that were previously
attributed exclusively to complex correlated treatments. Indeed, broken
symmetries are often experimentally observed, e.g., octahedral tilting,
Jahn-Teller distortions, or bond disproportionation, and often provide

judicious structuring of mappings between such characteristic latents and

efficiency of distributed training. However, little work has been done to
systematically understand whether the network is the bottleneck and to what
extent.
  In this paper, we take a first-principles approach to measure and analyze the
network performance of distributed training. As expected, our measurement
confirms that communication is the component that blocks distributed training
from linear scale-out. However, contrary to the common belief, we find that the
network is running at low utilization and that if the network can be fully
utilized, distributed training can achieve a scaling factor of close to one.
Moreover, while many recent proposals on gradient compression advocate over
100x compression ratio, we show that under full network utilization, there is
no need for gradient compression in 100 Gbps network. On the other hand, a
lower speed network like 10 Gbps requires only 2x--5x gradients compression
ratio to achieve almost linear scale-out. Compared to application-level
techniques like gradient compression, network-level optimizations do not
require changes to applications and do not hurt the performance of trained
models. As such, we advocate that the real challenge of distributed training is
for the network community to develop high-performance network transport to
fully utilize the network capacity and achieve linear scale-out.

kinematical components. On one hand, the velocity gradients detected on the
velocity field can be associated with a rotating disk -contrary to previous
results with less spectral resolution-. However, the velocity field, the
$\sigma$ and residual velocity field show significant deviations from circular
motions in the central part of the galaxy that matches a region with high
number of Wolf-Rayet and O stars, coincident with the blue luminous component
of the galaxy. We find narrow and broad velocity components for the ionized gas

outflow related with the on-going burst of stellar formation. The
morpho-kinematical analysis of the galaxy indicates we are only seeing the
brightest parts of the galaxy which correspond to the bulge, a central bar and
the beginning of the disk. We believe CIG 993 is a disk galaxy harboring
important star-forming processes most likely caused by a relatively recent

high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose

topic for many decades, while the partitioning pattern of nanoscale solutes in
the blood remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a multiscale
computational framework for direct numerical simulation of the nanoparticle
(NP) partitioning through physiologically-relevant vascular bifurcations in the
presence of red blood cells (RBCs). The computational framework is established
by embedding a newly-developed particulate suspension inflow/outflow boundary
condition into a multiscale blood flow solver. The computational framework is
verified by recovering a tubular blood flow without a bifurcation and validated
against the experimental measurement of an intravital bifurcation flow. The
classic Zweifach-Fung (ZF) effect is shown to be well captured by the method.
Moreover, we observe that NPs exhibit a ZF-like heterogeneous partition in
response to the heterogeneous partition of the RBC phase. The NP partitioning
prioritizes the high-flow-rate daughter branch except for extreme (large or
small) suspension flow partition ratios under which the complete phase
separation tends to occur. By analyzing the flow field and the particle
trajectories, we show that the ZF-like heterogeneity in NP partition can be
explained by the RBC-entrainment effect caused by the deviation of the flow
separatrix preceded by the tank-treading of RBCs near the bifurcation junction.
The recovery of homogeneity in the NP partition under extreme flow partition
ratios is due to the plasma skimming of NPs in the cell-free layer. These
findings, based on the multiscale computational framework, provide biophysical
insights to the heterogeneous distribution of NPs in microvascular beds that
are observed pathophysiologically.

is an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated
neuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized
modular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the
surrounding fluid with a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments.
This adaptive behavior emerges from the neural modules interacting through a
combination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback
mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait
adaptation are not understood. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical
modules that are coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range
proprioception, and gap-junctions. The model captures the experimentally
observed gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters, provided
that the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the
body response to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the
model allows the use of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to identify
the relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional coupling, and
proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows
that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of
these three coupling forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the
competition between gap-junctions and proprioception produces a long wavelength
undulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong
gap-junctional coupling.The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in
response to increasing fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the
relative strength of mechanical coupling, which promotes a short wavelength.

suffer from increased cost and sensitivity to the non-convexity of the loss
surface as compared to gradient-based approaches. We introduce a coordinate
descent method to train deep neural networks for classification tasks that
exploits global convexity of the cross-entropy loss in the weights of the
linear layer. Our hybrid Newton/Gradient Descent (NGD) method is consistent
with the interpretation of hidden layers as providing an adaptive basis and the
linear layer as providing an optimal fit of the basis to data. By alternating
between a second-order method to find globally optimal parameters for the
linear layer and gradient descent to train the hidden layers, we ensure an
optimal fit of the adaptive basis to data throughout training. The size of the
Hessian in the second-order step scales only with the number weights in the
linear layer and not the depth and width of the hidden layers; furthermore, the
approach is applicable to arbitrary hidden layer architecture. Previous work
applying this adaptive basis perspective to regression problems demonstrated
significant improvements in accuracy at reduced training cost, and this work
can be viewed as an extension of this approach to classification problems. We
first prove that the resulting Hessian matrix is symmetric semi-definite, and
that the Newton step realizes a global minimizer. By studying classification of
manufactured two-dimensional point cloud data, we demonstrate both an
improvement in validation error and a striking qualitative difference in the
basis functions encoded in the hidden layer when trained using NGD. Application
to image classification benchmarks for both dense and convolutional
architectures reveals improved training accuracy, suggesting possible gains of
second-order methods over gradient descent.

are carefully measured in a homogeneous manner using the galaxies' FUV, NUV and
3.6 $\micron$ magnitudes and their multi-component structural decompositions in
the literature. We find that more massive SMBHs are hosted by (early- and
late-type) galaxies with redder colors, but the $M_{\rm BH}- \mathcal{C_{\rm
UV,tot}}$ relations for the two morphological types have slopes that differ at
$\sim 2 \sigma$ level. Early-type galaxies define a red sequence in the $M_{\rm
BH}- \mathcal{C_{\rm UV,tot}}$ diagrams, while late-type galaxies trace a blue
sequence. Within the assumption that the specific star formation rate of a
galaxy (sSFR) is well traced by $L_{\rm UV}/L_{\rm 3.6}$, it follows that the
SMBH masses for late-type galaxies exhibit a steeper dependence on sSFR than
those for early-type galaxies. The $M_{\rm BH}- \mathcal{C_{\rm UV,tot}}$ and
$M_{\rm BH}-L_{\rm 3.6,tot}$ relations for the sample galaxies reveal a
comparable level of vertical scatter in the log $M_{\rm BH}$ direction, roughly
$5\%-27\%$ more than the vertical scatter of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation.
Our $M_{\rm BH}- \mathcal{C_{\rm UV,tot}}$ relations suggest different channels
of SMBH growth for early- and late-type galaxies, consistent with their
distinct formation and evolution scenarios.

precise rotation measures (RMs) because the effect of Faraday rotation is
proportional to the square of the observing wavelength. With these RMs, we
obtained polarized pulse profiles to see how polarization changes in the 25-88
MHz range. The RMs were also used to derive values for the electron density
weighted average Galactic magnetic field along the line of sight. We present
rotation measures and polarization profiles of 15 pulsars acquired using data

annotated data. This has led to the development of self-supervised learning
(SSL) that aims to alleviate this limitation by creating domain specific
pretext tasks on unlabeled data. Simultaneously, there are increasing interests
in generalizing deep learning to the graph domain in the form of graph neural
networks (GNNs). GNNs can naturally utilize unlabeled nodes through the simple
neighborhood aggregation that is unable to thoroughly make use of unlabeled
nodes. Thus, we seek to harness SSL for GNNs to fully exploit the unlabeled
data. Different from data instances in the image and text domains, nodes in
graphs present unique structure information and they are inherently linked
indicating not independent and identically distributed (or i.i.d.). Such
complexity is a double-edged sword for SSL on graphs. On the one hand, it
determines that it is challenging to adopt solutions from the image and text
domains to graphs and dedicated efforts are desired. On the other hand, it
provides rich information that enables us to build SSL from a variety of
perspectives. Thus, in this paper, we first deepen our understandings on when,
why, and which strategies of SSL work with GNNs by empirically studying
numerous basic SSL pretext tasks on graphs. Inspired by deep insights from the
empirical studies, we propose a new direction SelfTask to build advanced
pretext tasks that are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various
real-world datasets. The specific experimental settings to reproduce our
results can be found in \url{https://github.com/ChandlerBang/SelfTask-GNN}.

develop an efficient method for identifying the Majorana in-gap (edge) states

$\mu_{\star}$ at high redshifts, $z>0.33$. In a blinded analysis, we use $\sim
6,000$ clusters split into 12 subsets spanning the ranges $0.1 \leqslant
z<0.65$ and $\mu_{\star}$ up to $\sim 5.5 \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, and infer
the average masses of these subsets through modelling of their stacked weak
lensing signal. In our model we account for the following sources of systematic
uncertainty: shear measurement and photometric redshift errors, miscentring,
cluster-member contamination of the source sample, deviations from the NFW halo
profile, halo triaxiality and projection effects. We use the inferred masses to
estimate the joint mass--$\mu_{\star}$--$z$ scaling relation given by $\langle
M_{200c} | \mu_{\star},z \rangle = M_0 (\mu_{\star}/5.16\times 10^{12}
\mathrm{M_{\odot}})^{F_{\mu_{\star}}} ((1+z)/1.35)^{G_z}$. We find $M_0= (1.14
\pm 0.07) \times 10^{14} \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ with $F_{\mu_{\star}}= 0.76 \pm
0.06$ and $G_z= -1.14 \pm 0.37$. We discuss the use of $\mu_{\star}$ as a
complementary mass proxy to the well-studied richness $\lambda$ for: $i)$

$ii)$ testing systematics such as projection effects for applications in

activities in intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) experiments.
Differential brain activities to multisensory stimulus presentations are zero
in most regions and non-zero in some local regions, yielding locally sparse
functions. Such studies are essentially a function-on-scalar regression
problem, with interest being focused not only on estimating nonparametric
functions but also on recovering the function supports. We propose a weighted
group bridge approach for simultaneous function estimation and support recovery
in function-on-scalar mixed effect models, while accounting for heterogeneity
present in functional data. We use B-splines to transform sparsity of functions
to its sparse vector counterpart of increasing dimension, and propose a fast
non-convex optimization algorithm using nested alternative direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) for estimation. Large sample properties are established. In
particular, we show that the estimated coefficient functions are rate optimal
in the minimax sense under the $L_2$ norm and resemble a phase transition
phenomenon. For support estimation, we derive a convergence rate under the
$L_{\infty}$ norm that leads to a sparsistency property under
$\delta$-sparsity, and provide a simple sufficient regularity condition under
which a strict sparsistency property is established. An adjusted extended
Bayesian information criterion is proposed for parameter tuning. The developed
method is illustrated through simulation and an application to a novel iEEG
dataset to study multisensory integration. We integrate the proposed method
into RAVE, an R package that gains increasing popularity in the iEEG community.

semi-infinite slab and in the thin-film limit. We use Cd$_3$A$_2$ as a model
system, and include perturbations that break the $C_4$ symmetry and inversion
symmetry. The surface states are protected by the mirror symmetries present in
the bulk states and thus survive these perturbations. The Fermi arc states
persist down to very thin films, thinner than presently measured
experimentally, but are affected by breaking the symmetry of the Hamiltonian.
Our findings are compatible with experimental observations of transport in
Cd$_3$As$_2$, and also suggest that symmetry-breaking terms that preserve the
Fermi arc states nevertheless can have a profound effect in the thin film

propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tackles the challenging task of
representing the point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing
works directly deforming predefined primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square
patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a
proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with
each other iteratively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the
point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it
tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target
point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the
superiority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as
generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks.

effective ways to analyze data spread over multiple locations. In particular,
several areas of ""systems"" research - including databases, distributed systems,

that aims to inform generalization performance. Parameter count, while
successful in low-dimensional settings, is not well-justified for
overparameterized settings when the number of parameters is more than the
number of training samples. We revisit complexity measures based on Rissanen's
principle of minimum description length (MDL) and define a novel MDL-based
complexity (MDL-COMP) that remains valid for overparameterized models. MDL-COMP
is defined via an optimality criterion over the encodings induced by a good
Ridge estimator class. We provide an extensive theoretical characterization of
MDL-COMP for linear models and kernel methods and show that it is not just a
function of parameter count, but rather a function of the singular values of
the design or the kernel matrix and the signal-to-noise ratio.
  For a linear model with $n$ observations, $d$ parameters, and i.i.d. Gaussian
predictors, MDL-COMP scales linearly with $d$ when $d<n$, but the scaling is
exponentially smaller -- $\log d$ for $d>n$. For kernel methods, we show that
MDL-COMP informs minimax in-sample error, and can decrease as the
dimensionality of the input increases. We also prove that MDL-COMP upper bounds
the in-sample mean squared error (MSE). Via an array of simulations and
real-data experiments, we show that a data-driven Prac-MDL-COMP informs
hyper-parameter tuning for optimizing test MSE with ridge regression in limited
data settings, sometimes improving upon cross-validation and (always) saving
computational costs. Finally, our findings also suggest that the recently
observed double decent phenomenons in overparameterized models might be a
consequence of the choice of non-ideal estimators.

outgassing and sublimation. The loss from the atmosphere is the main mass
source for Jupiter's large magnetosphere. Previous studies attributed various
transient phenomena in Io's environment and Jupiter's magnetosphere to a sudden
change in the mass loss from the atmosphere supposedly triggered by a change in
volcanic activity. Since the gas in volcanic plumes does not escape directly,
such causal correlation would require a transient volcano-induced change in
atmospheric abundance, which has never been observed so far. Here we report
four observations of atmospheric SO2 and NaCl obtained with the IRAM NOEMA
interferometer. These observations are compared to measurements of volcanic hot
spots and Io's neutral and plasma environment. We find a stable NaCl column
density in Io's atmosphere. The SO2 column density derived for December 2016 is
about 30% lower compared to the period of March to April 2017. This increase in
SO2 from December 2016 to March 2017 might be related to increasing volcanic
activity observed at several sites in spring 2017, but the stability of the
volcanic trace gas NaCl and resulting decrease in NaCl/SO2 ratio do not support
this interpretation. Observed dimmings in both the sulfur ion torus and Na
neutral cloud suggest rather a decrease in mass loading in the period of
increasing SO2 abundance. The dimming Na brightness and stable atmospheric NaCl
furthermore dispute an earlier suggested positive correlation of the sodium
cloud and the hot spot activity at Loki Patara, which considerably increased in
this period. The environment of Io overall appears to be in a quiescent state,
preventing further conclusions. Only Jupiter's aurora morphology underwent
several short-term changes, which are apparently unrelated to Io's quiescent
environment or the relatively stable atmosphere.

galaxies formation to study the origin of the bimodality of $\alpha$-elements
in stellar populations. We explore how the bimodality is related to the
geometrically and kinematically defined stellar discs, gas accretion and radial
migration. We find that the two $\alpha$-sequences are formed in quite
different physical environments. The high-$\alpha$ sequence is formed early
from a burst of star formation (SF) in a turbulent, compact gaseous disc which
forms a thick disc. The low-$\alpha$ stellar populations is the result of
quiescent SF supported by the slow accretion of enriched gas onto a radially
extended thin disc. Stellar feedback-driven outflows during the formation of
the thick disc are responsible for the enrichment of the surrounding gaseous
halo, which subsequently feeds the disc on a longer time-scale. During the thin
disc phase, chemical evolution reaches an equilibrium metallicity and
abundance, where the stars pile-up. This equilibrium metallicity decreases
towards the outer disc, generating the ridgeline that forms the low-$\alpha$
sequence. We identify a second mechanism capable of creating a low-$\alpha$
sequence in one of our simulations. Rapid shutdown of the SF, provoked by the
feedback at the end of the thick disc phase, suppresses the chemical enrichment
of the halo gas, which, once accreted onto the star-forming disc, dilutes the
ISM at the beginning of the thin disc formation. Both mechanisms can operate in
a galaxy, but the former is expected to occur when SF efficiency ceases to be
dominated by the formation of the thick disc, while the latter can occur in the
inner regions. Being the result of the presence of low and high gas density
environments, the bimodality is independent of any particular merger history,
suggesting that it could be much more widespread than has been claimed.

challenging problem, partly owing to the large search space of possible graphs.
A recent line of work formulates the structure learning problem as a continuous
constrained optimization task using the least squares objective and an
algebraic characterization of DAGs. However, the formulation requires a hard
DAG constraint and may lead to optimization difficulties. In this paper, we
study the asymptotic role of the sparsity and DAG constraints for learning DAG
models in the linear Gaussian and non-Gaussian cases, and investigate their
usefulness in the finite sample regime. Based on the theoretical results, we
formulate a likelihood-based score function, and show that one only has to
apply soft sparsity and DAG constraints to learn a DAG equivalent to the ground
truth DAG. This leads to an unconstrained optimization problem that is much
easier to solve. Using gradient-based optimization and GPU acceleration, our
procedure can easily handle thousands of nodes while retaining a high accuracy.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method and
show that the DAG-penalized likelihood objective is indeed favorable over the
least squares one with the hard DAG constraint.

machine learning problem where the goal is to predict the ""correct"" value for
each attribute for each entity. Given a database, we use a combination of
attribute-level, recordlevel, and database-level signals to construct a feature
vector for each cell (or (row, col)) of that database. We use this feature
vector alongwith the ground-truth information to learn a classifier for each of
the attributes of the database.
  Our learning algorithm uses a novel stagewise additive model. At each stage,
we construct a new feature vector by combining a part of the original feature
vector with features computed by the predictions from the previous stage. We
then learn a softmax classifier over the new feature space. This greedy
stagewise approach can be viewed as a deep model where at each stage, we are
adding more complicated non-linear transformations of the original feature
vector. We show that our approach fuses records with an average precision of
~98% when source information of records is available, and ~94% without source
information across a diverse array of real-world datasets. We compare our
approach to a comprehensive collection of data fusion and entity consolidation

mode across the whole spectral range. Temperature evolution of this coherent
phonon mode in the low-excitation linear regime shows softening of the mode
down to the CDW transition temperature T$_{CDW}$ with subsequent hardening
below T$_{CDW}$. The global fit of the broadband probe data reveals four
different relaxation times associated with characteristic electron-electron,
electron-phonon and phonon-phonon relaxation processes. From first principle
calculations of electron-phonon coupling we associate the few picosecond
electron-phonon relaxation time $\tau_2$ with a specific group of phonons with
frequencies around 20 meV. On the other hand, the anomalously long relaxation
time of $\tau_3$~100 ps is associated with anharmonicity-driven phonon-phonon
scattering. All relaxation processes result from anomalies near the second
order CDW phase transition that are reflected in the temperature dependencies
of the characteristic relaxation times and amplitudes of optical densities. At
highest fluences we observe electronic melting of the CDW and disappearance of

called demixed shared component analysis (dSCA). dSCA decomposes population
activity into a few components, such that the shared components capture the
maximum amount of shared information across brain regions while also depending
on relevant task parameters. This yields interpretable components that express
which variables are shared between different brain regions and when this
information is shared across time. To illustrate our method, we reanalyze two

that dSCA provides new insights into the shared computation between different

labelled, re-train the learner to optimise the downstream task and the graph to
minimise its modified objective. We continue this process within a fixed
budget. We evaluate our method on 6 different benchmarks:4 real image
classification, 1 depth-based hand pose estimation and 1 synthetic RGB image

  Lengths","Submitted to NeurIPS2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Self-attention has emerged as a vital component of state-of-the-art
sequence-to-sequence models for natural language processing in recent years,
brought to the forefront by pre-trained bi-directional Transformer models. Its
effectiveness is partly due to its non-sequential architecture, which promotes
scalability and parallelism but limits the model to inputs of a bounded length.
In particular, such architectures perform poorly on algorithmic tasks, where
the model must learn a procedure which generalizes to input lengths unseen in
training, a capability we refer to as inductive generalization. Identifying the
computational limits of existing self-attention mechanisms, we propose I-BERT,
a bi-directional Transformer that replaces positional encodings with a
recurrent layer. The model inductively generalizes on a variety of algorithmic
tasks where state-of-the-art Transformer models fail to do so. We also test our
method on masked language modeling tasks where training and validation sets are
partitioned to verify inductive generalization. Out of three algorithmic and
two natural language inductive generalization tasks, I-BERT achieves
state-of-the-art results on four tasks.

widely studied. However, existing methods only use the information of limited
neighbors and do not deal with the inter-class connections in graphs. In this
paper, we propose Adaptive aggregation with Class-Attentive Diffusion (AdaCAD),
a new aggregation scheme that adaptively aggregates nodes probably of the same
class among K-hop neighbors. To this end, we first propose a novel stochastic
process, called Class-Attentive Diffusion (CAD), that strengthens attention to
intra-class nodes and attenuates attention to inter-class nodes. In contrast to
the existing diffusion methods with a transition matrix determined solely by
the graph structure, CAD considers both the node features and the graph
structure with the design of our class-attentive transition matrix that
utilizes a classifier. Then, we further propose an adaptive update scheme that
leverages different reflection ratios of the diffusion result for each node
depending on the local class-context. As the main advantage, AdaCAD alleviates
the problem of undesired mixing of inter-class features caused by discrepancies
between node labels and the graph topology. Built on AdaCAD, we construct a
simple model called Class-Attentive Diffusion Network (CAD-Net). Extensive
experiments on seven benchmark datasets consistently demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed method and our CAD-Net significantly outperforms the

forward through the mean-field perspective, but a key challenge is to bring

  Towards closing this gap, and focusing on shallow neural networks, in this
work we study the ability of different regularisation strategies to capture
solutions requiring only a finite amount of neurons, even on the infinitely

obtained by injecting noise into training targets [Blanc et al.~19], and (ii)
the variation-norm regularisation [Bach~17], compatible with the mean-field

having only a finite number of neurons, irrespective of the amount of
overparametrisation. We study the consequences of such property and describe
the settings where one form of regularisation is favorable over the other.

learning models, which require heavy use of compute and memory. One popular
technique for increasing resource efficiency is 8-bit integer quantization, in

integer numbers. Although deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, TFLite,
MXNet, and PyTorch enable developers to quantize models with only a small drop
in accuracy, they are not well suited to execute quantized models on a variety
of hardware platforms. For example, TFLite is optimized to run inference on ARM
CPU edge devices but it does not have efficient support for Intel CPUs and
Nvidia GPUs. In this paper, we address the challenges of executing quantized
deep learning models on diverse hardware platforms by proposing an augmented
compiler approach. A deep learning compiler such as Apache TVM can enable the
efficient execution of model from various frameworks on various targets. Many
deep learning compilers today, however, are designed primarily for fp32
computation and cannot optimize a pre-quantized INT8 model. To address this
issue, we created a new dialect called Quantized Neural Network (QNN) that
extends the compiler's internal representation with a quantization context.
With this quantization context, the compiler can generate efficient code for
pre-quantized models on various hardware platforms. As implemented in Apache
TVM, we observe that the QNN-augmented deep learning compiler achieves speedups
of 2.35x, 2.15x, 1.35x and 1.40x on Intel Xeon Cascade Lake CPUs, Nvidia Tesla

matter (DM) candidates. Under certain circumstances, large axion fluctuations
in the early universe can collapse to form dense configurations called axion
clumps. The densest axion clumps are metastable states known as oscillons. In
this paper we propose a new class of observables that exploit the axion's
coupling to photons. As a result of this coupling an axion clump acts like an
inhomogeneous refractive optical medium -- a lens -- that causes anomalous
dispersion of incident electromagnetic waves. The dispersion of electromagnetic
waves by axion clumps clearly distinguishes this lensing effect from
gravitational lensing. Axion clumps passing in front of background radio
sources act as lenses and lead to apparent positional shifts that can
potentially be discovered by high-precision radio astrometry missions with the
forthcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA). We discuss the sensitivity of SKA to
lensing effects in a variety of axion halo models. While gravitational
microlensing surveys have placed strong constraints on the amount of DM that
exists in the form of non-luminous astrophysical objects they have been unable
to do so for objects in the mass range $[10^{-14}, 10^{-11}] M_\odot$. We find
that, over a wide range of parameter space, SKA will be sensitive to optical
lensing by oscillons in the mass range that is currently unconstrained by

important problem in robotic learning in general and automated unsupervised
learning in particular. Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by
(multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised
learning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and
high-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust
representation learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to
develop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for
assessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method with respect to its
tuning parameters. Such metrics must account for the (geometric) constraints in
the physical world as well as the uncertainty associated with the learned
patterns. In this paper we introduce a model-free metric based on the
Procrustes distance for robust representation learning of interactions, and an
optimal transport based distance metric for comparing between distributions of
interaction primitives. These distance metrics can serve as an objective for
assessing the stability of an interaction learning algorithm. They are also
used for comparing the outcomes produced by different algorithms. Moreover,
they may also be adopted as an objective function to obtain clusters and
representative interaction primitives. These concepts and techniques will be
introduced, along with mathematical properties, while their usefulness will be
demonstrated in unsupervised learning of vehicle-to-vechicle interactions

parametric models whose likelihood function is intractable, however, the

to pay for this efficiency is a loss of parsimony and thereby a potential lack

is often critical in empirical applications, but can also deliver estimators
that are nearly as efficient as maximum likelihood. This new approach is based
on using a constrained approximation to the structural model, which ensures

super-resolution (HSR). HSR aims at fusing a pair of hyperspectral and
multispectral images to recover a super-resolution image (SRI). The vast
majority of the HSR approaches take a low-rank matrix recovery perspective. The
challenge is that theoretical guarantees for recovering the SRI using low-rank
matrix models are either elusive or derived under stringent conditions. A
couple of recent CTD-based methods ensure recoverability for the SRI under
relatively mild conditions, leveraging on algebraic properties of the canonical
polyadic decomposition (CPD) and the Tucker decomposition models, respectively.
However, the latent factors of both the CPD and Tucker models have no physical
interpretations in the context of spectral image analysis, which makes
incorporating prior information challenging---but using priors is often
essential for enhancing performance in noisy environments. This work employs an
idea that models spectral images as tensors following the block-term
decomposition model with multilinear rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (i.e., the LL1
model) and formulates the HSR problem as a coupled LL1 tensor decomposition
problem. Similar to the existing CTD approaches, recoverability of the SRI is
shown under mild conditions. More importantly, the latent factors of the LL1
model can be interpreted as the key constituents of spectral images, i.e., the
endmembers' spectral signatures and abundance maps. This connection allows us
to easily incorporate prior information for performance enhancement. A flexible
algorithmic framework that can work with a series of structural information is
proposed to take advantage of the model interpretability. The effectiveness is
showcased using simulated and real data.

spring at its boundary. The spring produces a fluctuating tensile force on the
filament, whose value depends on the filament's instantaneous end-to-end
length. The spring thereby introduces a nonlinearity, which mixes the
undulatory normal modes of the filament and changes their dynamics. We study
these dynamics using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de-Domincis formalism, and
compute the time-dependent correlation functions of transverse undulations and
of the filament's end-to-end distance. The relaxational dynamics of the modes
below a characteristic wavelength $\sqrt{\kappa/\tau_R}$, set by the filament's
bending modulus $\kappa$ and spring-renormalized tension $\tau_{R}$, are
changed by the boundary spring. This occurs near the cross-over frequency
between tension- and bending-dominated modes of the system. The boundary spring
can be used to represent the linear elastic compliance of the rest of the
filament network to which the filament is cross-linked. As a result, we predict
that this nonlinear effect will be observable in the dynamical correlations of
constituent filaments of networks and in the networks' collective shear
response. The system's dynamic shear modulus is predicted to exhibit the
well-known crossover with increasing frequency from $\omega^{1/2}$ to
$\omega^{3/4}$, but the inclusion of the the network's compliance in the
analysis of the individual filament dynamics shifts this transition to a higher
frequency.

on the well-known Apollonius circle and allows the pursuers to allocate their

theoretical motivations, where the stability of dark matter is usually achieved
by imposing a $Z_2$ parity. We promote the $Z_2$ parity into a global $U(1)$
symmetry and study its phenomenological implications. There are two
characteristic features of the model: both the CP-even and CP-odd neutral inert
scalars, $h_1$ and $h_2$, become DM candidates; the number of model parameters
is one less than that with $Z_2$ parity. We first analyze the constraints from
LEP experiments, electroweak precision tests, theoretical stability, Higgs
precision data, dark matter relic density, and direct detection experiments. It
is found that if the model is required to explain at least 10% of the observed
relic density, the theory is extremely limited such that the dark matter mass
is about $70\;{\rm GeV}$ and the charged Higgs boson is not very heavy.
Focusing on this narrow parameter space, we calculate the production cross
sections of almost all the possible mono-$X$ and mono-$XX'$ processes at the
LHC. The mono-$W\gamma$ process is shown to have high discovery potential with
the help of the decay of the intermediate-mass charged Higgs boson into $W^\pm
h_{1,2}$. A search strategy is designed to increase the potential discovery of
the model for the mono-$W\gamma$ signal at both the HL-LHC and the FCC-hh. The
optimal cut on $E_T^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{H_T}$ is suggested to maximize the signal
significance, being about $0.76$ at the HL-LHC and about $7.5$ at the FCC-hh.

regression function $f_0: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}$ based on observations from a
standard nonparametric regression model, using the convex least squares
estimator (LSE) $\widehat{f}_n$. For $x_0 \in (0,1)$, the local parameters
include the pointwise function value $f_0(x_0)$, the pointwise derivative
$f_0'(x_0)$, and the anti-mode (i.e., the smallest minimizer) of $f_0$. The
existing limiting distribution of the estimation error $(\widehat{f}_n(x_0) -
f_0(x_0), \widehat{f}_n'(x_0) - f_0'(x_0) )$ depends on the unknown second
derivative $f_0''(x_0)$, and is therefore not directly applicable for
inference. To circumvent this impasse, we show that the following locally
normalized errors (LNEs) enjoy pivotal limiting behavior: Let
$[\widehat{u}(x_0), \widehat{v}(x_0)]$ be the maximal interval containing $x_0$
where $\widehat{f}_n$ is linear. Then, under standard conditions, $$\binom{
\sqrt{n(\widehat{v}(x_0)-\widehat{u}(x_0))}(\widehat{f}_n(x_0)-f_0(x_0)) }{
\sqrt{n(\widehat{v}(x_0)-\widehat{u}(x_0))^3}(\widehat{f}_n'(x_0)-f_0'(x_0))}

where $n$ is the sample size, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the errors,
and $\mathbb{L}^{(0)}_2, \mathbb{L}^{(1)}_2$ are universal random variables.
This asymptotically pivotal LNE theory instantly yields a simple tuning-free
procedure for constructing CIs with asymptotically exact coverage and optimal
length for $f_0(x_0)$ and $f_0'(x_0)$. We also construct an asymptotically
pivotal LNE for the anti-mode of $f_0$, and its limiting distribution does not
even depend on $\sigma$. These asymptotically pivotal LNE theories are further
extended to other convexity/concavity constrained models (e.g., log-concave
density estimation) for which a limit distribution theory is available for
problem-specific estimators.

a customized V2V message set which features a velocity forecast, i.e. a
prediction on the future velocity trajectory, which enables platooning vehicles
to accurately maintain short following distances, thereby increasing
throughput. Furthermore, V2I communication allows platoons to react immediately
to changes in the state of nearby traffic lights, e.g. when the traffic phase
becomes green, enabling additional gains in traffic efficiency. We present our
design of the vehicle platooning system, and then evaluate performance by
estimating the potential gains in terms of throughput using our results from
simulation, as well as experiments conducted with real test vehicles on a

describes the collective behaviors in many-body systems. It was well known that
for usual spontaneous symmetry breaking in Hermitian systems, the
order-disorder phase transition with gap closing and spontaneous symmetry
breaking occur at the same critical point. In this paper, we generalized the
Landau's spontaneous symmetry breaking theory to the cases in non-Hermitian

certain universal features. We were surprised to find that the effect of the NH
terms splits the spontaneous biorthogonal Z2 symmetry breaking from a
(biorthogonal) order-disorder phase transition with gap closing. The sudden
change of similarity for two degenerate ground states indicates a new type of
quantum phase transition without gap closing accompanied by spontaneous
biorthogonal Z2 symmetry breaking. We will take the NH transverse Ising model

they can be sold on exchanges anonymously and most cryptocurrencies have their

clones in cryptocurrencies, which may amplify security threats. If a
vulnerability is found in one cryptocurrency, it might be propagated into other
cloned cryptocurrencies. In this work, we propose a systematic remedy to this
problem, and we propose CoinWatch (CW). Given a reported vulnerability at the
input, CW uses the code evolution analysis and a clone detection technique for
indication of cryptocurrencies that might be vulnerable. We applied CW on 1094

can attain an $O\big(\frac{1}{n}\big)$-accurate solution in $O(n\log\log n)$
number of stochastic gradient evaluations which improves the best-known result
$O(n\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of samples. Meanwhile, VRADA matches the
lower bound of the general convex setting up to a $\log\log n$ factor and
matches the lower bounds in both regimes $n\le \Theta(\kappa)$ and $n\gg
\kappa$ of the strongly convex setting, where $\kappa$ denotes the condition
number. Besides improving the best-known results and matching all the above
lower bounds simultaneously, VRADA has more unified and simplified algorithmic
implementation and convergence analysis for both the general convex and
strongly convex settings. The underlying novel approaches such as the novel
initialization strategy in VRADA may be of independent interest. Through
experiments on real datasets, we show the good performance of VRADA over
existing methods for large-scale machine learning problems.

the aid of machine learning algorithms is becoming a new promising field. Many
approaches are able to achieve better Reynolds stress prediction, with much
lower modeling error ($\epsilon_M$), than traditional RANS models but they
still suffer from numerical error and stability issues when the mean velocity
fields are estimated using RANS equations with the predicted Reynolds stresses,
illustrating that the error of solving the RANS equations ($\epsilon_P$) is
also very important. In the present work, the error $\epsilon_P$ is studied
separately by using the Reynolds stresses obtained from direct numerical
simulation and we derive the sources of $\epsilon_P$. For the implementations
with known Reynolds stresses solely, we suggest to run an adjoint RANS
simulation to make first guess on $\nu_t^*$ and $S_{ij}^0$. With around 10
iterations, the error could be reduced by about one-order of magnitude in flow
over periodic hills. The present work not only provides one robust approach to
minimize $\epsilon_P$, which may be very useful for the data-driven turbulence
models, but also shows the importance of the nonlinear part of the Reynolds
stresses in flow problems with flow separations.

devices with clean and stable interfaces by placing freshly exfoliated CrI3
flake atop pre-patterned thin Pt strip and encapsulating the Pt/CrI3
heterostructure with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in a protected environment.
In devices consisting of a wide range of CrI3 thicknesses (30 to 150 nm), we
observe that an abrupt upward jump in Pt MR emerge at a 2 T magnetic field
applied perpendicularly to the layers when the current density exceeds
2.5x10^10 A/m2, followed by a gradual decrease over a range of 5 T. These
distinct MR features suggest a spin-flop transition which reveals strong
antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in the surface layers of CrI3. We study
the current dependence by holding the Pt/CrI3 sample at approximately the same
temperature to exclude the joule heating effect, and find that the MR jump
increases with the current density, indicating a spin current origin. This spin
current effect provides a new route to control spin configurations in
insulating antiferromagnets, which is potentially useful for spintronic

we propose a solution to detect unintended deviations of a target user from his

90\% credible interval should contain the true outcome 90\% of the times.
However, typical definitions of calibration only require this to hold on
average, and offer no guarantees on predictions made on individual samples.
Thus, predictions can be systematically over or under confident on certain
subgroups, leading to issues of fairness and potential vulnerabilities. We show
that calibration for individual samples is possible in the regression setup if
the predictions are randomized, i.e. outputting randomized credible intervals.
Randomization removes systematic bias by trading off bias with variance. We
design a training objective to enforce individual calibration and use it to
train randomized regression functions. The resulting models are more calibrated
for arbitrarily chosen subgroups of the data, and can achieve higher utility in
decision making against adversaries that exploit miscalibrated predictions.

measure their actual resistance to linear cryptanalysis. The aforementioned
papers emphasize on the average nonlinearity of the S-box coordinates only,
ignoring the rest of the S-box components in the process. Thus, the majority of
those studies should be re-evaluated. Integrating such S-boxes in a given
cryptosystem should be done with a considerable caution. Furthermore, we show
that in the context of nonlinearity optimization problem the profit of using
chaos structures is negligible. By using two heuristic methods and starting
from pseudo-random S-boxes, we repeatedly reached S-boxes, which significantly
outperform all previously published CF-based S-boxes, in those cryptographic
terms, which the aforementioned papers utilize for comparison. Moreover, we
have linked the multi-armed bandit problem to the problem of maximizing an

near-optimal average coordinate nonlinearity values significantly greater than

there could be an important contribution from another process. In view of the
above, we derive the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) light curves from the

We show that this emission could explain the GeV flares exhibited in some LAT

cloud-free 1D models of KELT-1b's dayside emission are unable to fit the full

KELT-1b may have a significant dayside geometric albedo of
$\mathrm{A}_\mathrm{g}\sim0.5$ in the TESS bandpass, which would agree with the
tentative trend between equilibrium temperature and geometric albedo recently
suggested by Wong et al. 2020. We posit that if KELT-1b has a high dayside

(JCL) to find class-level discriminative features, which is essential for
minimizing the joint error. With a solid theoretical framework, JCL employs
contrastive loss to maximize the mutual information between a feature and its
label, which is equivalent to maximizing the Jensen-Shannon divergence between
conditional distributions. Experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate
that JCL outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Joachims, our algorithm has a running time which scales linearly in the number
of training examples $m$ (up to polylogarithmic factors) and applies to the
standard soft-margin $\ell_1$-SVM model. In contrast, while classical SVM-perf
has demonstrated impressive performance on both linear and nonlinear SVMs, its
efficiency is guaranteed only in certain cases: it achieves linear $m$ scaling
only for linear SVMs, where classification is performed in the original input
data space, or for the special cases of low-rank or shift-invariant kernels.
Similarly, previously proposed quantum algorithms either have super-linear
scaling in $m$, or else apply to different SVM models such as the hard-margin
or least squares $\ell_2$-SVM which lack certain desirable properties of the
soft-margin $\ell_1$-SVM model. We classically simulate our algorithm and give
evidence that it can perform well in practice, and not only for asymptotically
large data sets.

that merges a low resolution HSI (LR-HSI) and a high resolution multispectral
image (HR-MSI). The cross-modality distribution of the spatial and spectral
information makes the problem challenging. Inspired by the classic wavelet
decomposition-based image fusion, we propose a novel \textit{lightweight} deep
neural network-based framework, namely progressive zero-centric residual
network (PZRes-Net), to address this problem efficiently and effectively.
Specifically, PZRes-Net learns a high resolution and \textit{zero-centric}
residual image, which contains high-frequency spatial details of the scene
across all spectral bands, from both inputs in a progressive fashion along the
spectral dimension. And the resulting residual image is then superimposed onto
the up-sampled LR-HSI in a \textit{mean-value invariant} manner, leading to a
coarse HR-HSI, which is further refined by exploring the coherence across all
spectral bands simultaneously. To learn the residual image efficiently and
effectively, we employ spectral-spatial separable convolution with dense
connections. In addition, we propose zero-mean normalization implemented on the
feature maps of each layer to realize the zero-mean characteristic of the
residual image. Extensive experiments over both real and synthetic benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our PZRes-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods to
a \textit{significant} extent in terms of both 4 quantitative metrics and
visual quality, e.g., our PZRes-Net improves the PSNR more than 3dB, while
saving 2.3$\times$ parameters and consuming 15$\times$ less FLOPs. The code is

focus on the range of the mass squared $\mu^2$ of the scalar fields for which
the Robin boundary condition parametrised by $\zeta$ applies at the conformal
infinity. We find that if the black hole of radius $r_{+}$ and charge $Q$ is
much smaller than the AdS length $\ell$, the instability of the charged scalar
field can be understood in terms of superradiance in the reflective boundary
condition. Noting that the s-wave normal frequency in the AdS spacetime is a
decreasing function of $\zeta$, we find that if $|eQ|\ell/r_{+}$ is greater
than $(3+\sqrt{9+4\mu^2\ell^2})/2$, where $e$ is the charge of the scalar
field, the black hole is superradiantly unstable irrespectively of $\zeta$. On
the other hand, if $|eQ|\ell/r_{+}$ is equal to or smaller than this critical
value, the stability crucially depends on $\zeta$ and there appears a purely
oscillating mode at the onset of the instability. We argue that as a result of
the superradiant instability, the scalar field gains charge from the black hole
and energy from its ambient electric field, while the black hole gives charge
to the scalar field and gains energy from the scalar field but decreases its
asymptotic mass parameter.

shortest paths on a graph that simultaneously balance two cost functions. While
this problem has numerous applications, there is usually no path minimizing
both cost functions simultaneously. Thus, we typically consider the set of
paths where no path is strictly better then the others in both cost functions,
a set called the Pareto-optimal frontier. Unfortunately, the size of this set
may be exponential in the number of graph vertices and the general problem is
NP-hard. While existing schemes to approximate this set exist, they may be
slower than exact approaches when applied to relatively small instances and
running them on graphs with even a moderate number of nodes is often
impractical. The crux of the problem lies in how to efficiently approximate the
Pareto-optimal frontier. Our key insight is that the Pareto-optimal frontier
can be approximated using pairs of paths. This simple observation allows us to
run a best-first-search while efficiently and effectively pruning away
intermediate solutions in order to obtain an approximation of the Pareto
frontier for any given approximation factor. We compared our approach with an
adaptation of BOA*, the state-of-the-art algorithm for computing exact
solutions to the bi-criteria shortest-path problem. Our experiments show that
as the problem becomes harder, the speedup obtained becomes more pronounced.
Specifically, on large roadmaps, we obtain an average speedup of more than

  Plasmas","Accepted for publication in Physics of Plasmas",,,,"physics.space-ph astro-ph.SR physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerous prior studies have shown that as proton beta increases, a narrower
range of proton temperature anisotropy values is observed. This effect has
often been ascribed to the actions of kinetic microinstabilities because the
distribution of observational data aligns with contours of constant instability
growth rates in the beta-anisotropy plane. However, the linear Vlasov theory of
instabilities assumes a uniform background in which perturbations grow. The
established success of linear-microinstability theories suggests that the
conditions in regions of extreme temperature anisotropy may remain uniform for
a long enough time so that the instabilities have the chance to grow to
sufficient amplitude. Turbulence, on the other hand, is intrinsically
non-uniform and non-linear. Thin current sheets and other coherent structures
generated in a turbulent plasma, may destroy the uniformity fast enough. It is
therefore not a-priori obvious whether the presence of intermittency and
coherent structures favors or disfavors instabilities. To address this
question, we examined the statistical distribution of growth rates associated
with proton temperature-anisotropy driven microinstabilities and local
nonlinear time scales in turbulent plasmas. Linear growth rates are, on
average, substantially less than the local nonlinear rates. However, at the
regions of extreme values of temperature anisotropy, near the ""edges"" of the
populated part of the proton temperature anisotropy-parallel beta plane, the
instability growth rates are comparable or faster than the turbulence time
scales. These results provide a possible answer to the question as to why the
linear theory appears to work in limiting plasma excursions in anisotropy and
plasma beta.

safety critical. One direct threat to it is GPS spoofing, but fortunately, AV
systems today predominantly use Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) algorithms that are
generally believed to have the potential to practically defeat GPS spoofing.
However, no prior work has studied whether today's MSF algorithms are indeed
sufficiently secure under GPS spoofing, especially in AV settings. In this
work, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap. As the first study,
we focus on a production-grade MSF with both design and implementation level
representativeness, and identify two AV-specific attack goals, off-road and
wrong-way attacks.
  To systematically understand the security property, we first analyze the
upper-bound attack effectiveness, and discover a take-over effect that can
fundamentally defeat the MSF design principle. We perform a cause analysis and
find that such vulnerability only appears dynamically and
non-deterministically. Leveraging this insight, we design FusionRipper, a novel
and general attack that opportunistically captures and exploits take-over
vulnerabilities. We evaluate it on 6 real-world sensor traces, and find that
FusionRipper can achieve at least 97% and 91.3% success rates in all traces for
off-road and wrong-way attacks respectively. We also find that it is highly
robust to practical factors such as spoofing inaccuracies. To improve the
practicality, we further design an offline method that can effectively identify
attack parameters with over 80% average success rates for both attack goals,
with the cost of at most half a day. We also discuss promising defense
directions.

the decrease of the Tb-concentration, implying that a combination of the spin
Hall effect from both Co and Tb as well as an asymmetric spin current

may explain why FRB 180916 was the first detected periodically repeating FRB,

10-30 days; 3) the birth rate for NSC-FRB system is large enough to fulfill the

prosumers play a generalized Nash game. We prove main properties of the game:
an equilibrium exists and is partially unique; no prosumer is worse off by
energy sharing and the price-of-anarchy is 1-O(1/I) where I is the number of
prosumers. In particular, the PoA tends to 1 with a growing number of
prosumers, meaning that the resulting total cost under the proposed energy
sharing approaches social optimum. We prove that the corresponding prosumers'
strategies converge to the social optimal solution as well. Finally we propose
a bidding process and prove that it converges to the energy sharing equilibrium

  Discrimination","Accepted by IEEE TCSVT",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Visual tracking can be easily disturbed by similar surrounding objects. Such
objects as hard distractors, even though being the minority among negative
samples, increase the risk of target drift and model corruption, which deserve
additional attention in online tracking and model update. To enhance the
tracking robustness, in this paper, we propose a cascaded regression tracker
with two sequential stages. In the first stage, we filter out abundant
easily-identified negative candidates via an efficient convolutional
regression. In the second stage, a discrete sampling based ridge regression is
designed to double-check the remaining ambiguous hard samples, which serves as
an alternative of fully-connected layers and benefits from the closed-form
solver for efficient learning. Extensive experiments are conducted on 11
challenging tracking benchmarks including OTB-2013, OTB-2015, VOT2018, VOT2019,
UAV123, Temple-Color, NfS, TrackingNet, LaSOT, UAV20L, and OxUvA. The proposed

leading advertising system, serving millions of advertisers with fingertip
connection to hundreds of millions of customers. In our system, as well as most
e-commerce scenarios, ads are displayed with images.This makes visual-aware
Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction of crucial importance to both business
effectiveness and user experience. Existing algorithms usually extract visual
features using off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and late fuse
the visual and non-visual features for the finally predicted CTR. Despite being
extensively studied, this field still face two key challenges. First, although
encouraging progress has been made in offline studies, applying CNNs in real
systems remains non-trivial, due to the strict requirements for efficient
end-to-end training and low-latency online serving. Second, the off-the-shelf
CNNs and late fusion architectures are suboptimal. Specifically, off-the-shelf
CNNs were designed for classification thus never take categories as input
features. While in e-commerce, categories are precisely labeled and contain
abundant visual priors that will help the visual modeling. Unaware of the ad
category, these CNNs may extract some unnecessary category-unrelated features,
wasting CNN's limited expression ability. To overcome the two challenges, we
propose Category-specific CNN (CSCNN) specially for CTR prediction. CSCNN early
incorporates the category knowledge with a light-weighted attention-module on
each convolutional layer. This enables CSCNN to extract expressive
category-specific visual patterns that benefit the CTR prediction. Offline
experiments on benchmark and a 10 billion scale real production dataset from
JD, together with an Online A/B test show that CSCNN outperforms all compared
state-of-the-art algorithms.

diffusion of porous medium time. We consider the particularly delicate case
$p<m$ in problem (1.1), a case largely left open in [21] even when the initial
datum is smooth and compactly supported. We prove global existence for L$^m$
data, and a smoothing effect for the evolution, i.e. that solutions
corresponding to such data are bounded at all positive times with a
quantitative bound on their L$^\infty$ norm. As a consequence of this fact and
of a result of [21], it follows that on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds with
curvature pinched between two strictly negative constants, solutions
corresponding to sufficiently large L$^m$ data give rise to solutions that blow
up pointwise everywhere in infinite time, a fact that has no Euclidean
analogue. The methods of proof of the smoothing effect are functional analytic
in character, as they depend solely on the validity of the Sobolev inequality
and on the fact that the L$^2$ spectrum of $\Delta$ on $M$ is bounded away from
zero (namely on the validity of a Poincar\'{e} inequality on $M$). As such,
they are applicable to different situations, among which we single out the case
of (mass) weighted reaction-diffusion equation in the Euclidean setting. In
this latter setting, a modification of the methods of [37] allows to deal also,
with stronger results for large times, with the case of globally integrable

repetition effect includes a wear-in period, where the user's propensity to

the recommendation in the recent past. It also includes a counteracting
wear-out period, where the user's propensity to respond positively is dampened
if the recommendation was shown too many times recently. Priming effect can be
naturally modelled as a temporal constraint on the strategy space, since the
reward for the current action depends on historical actions taken by the
platform. We provide novel algorithms that achieves sublinear regret in time

human connectome can be crucial for the brain complex dynamics. In this
context, the best-connected brain areas, designated as hub nodes, play a
central role in supporting integrated brain function. Here, we study the
structure of simplicial complexes attached to eight global hubs in the female
and male connectomes and identify the core networks among the affected brain
regions. These eight hubs (Putamen, Caudate, Hippocampus and Thalamus-Proper in
the left and right cerebral hemisphere) are the highest-ranking according to
their topological dimension, defined as the number of simplexes of all orders
in which the node participates. Furthermore, we analyse the weight-dependent
heterogeneity of simplexes. We demonstrate changes in the structure of
identified core networks and topological entropy when the threshold weight is
gradually increased. These results highlight the role of higher-order
interactions in human brain networks and provide additional evidence for
(dis)similarity between the female and male connectomes.

based on optical satellite imagery of large areas. With such data sets, the
detection of cloud is often a necessary prerequisite step. Recently, deep
learning-based cloud detection methods have shown their potential for cloud
detection but they can only be applied locally, leading to inefficient data
downloading time and storage problems. This letter proposes a method to
directly perform cloud detection in Landsat-8 imagery in GEE based on deep
learning (DeepGEE-CD). A deep neural network (DNN) was first trained locally,
and then the trained DNN was deployed in the JavaScript client of GEE. An
experiment was undertaken to validate the proposed method with a set of
Landsat-8 images and the results show that DeepGEE-CD outperformed the widely
used function of mask (Fmask) algorithm. The proposed DeepGEE-CD approach can
accurately detect cloud in Landsat-8 imagery without downloading it, making it
a promising method for routine cloud detection of Landsat-8 imagery in GEE.

suppression formalism to explain all 3 dependencies of quarkonium suppression
obtained from heavy-ion collision experiments. We present here the improved
version of quarkonia suppression framework. It assumes bottomonia produced in
the early stage which dissociates due to color screening, gluonic dissociation,
and collisional damping in addition to the shadowing as an initial state
effect. The QGP medium formed in the collisions is assumed to evolve under
($3+1$)-dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics which is modeled using
ECHO-QGP. This replaces the Bjorken's hydrodynamics which we had used in our
earlier work where we determined the centrality and transverse momentum
dependent suppression. The correlated bottom quark and bottom anti-quark could
recombine in the plasma. A rate equation is employed, whose solution gives the
final number of bottomonium after dissociation and recombination under
$(3+1)$-dimensional expansion of the QGP medium. The Shadowing effect, which is
the dominant Cold Nuclear Matter effect at LHC energies, has now been modified
by employing the most recent parton distribution functions obtained from CT14
global analysis and shadowing factors from EPPS16. Using this improved
formalism we determine the centrality, transverse momentum, and rapidity,
dependencies of bottomonium suppression for $\Upsilon(1S)$, and $\Upsilon(2S)$
at the LHC's energies of $2.76$ TeV and $5.02$ TeV. We find a fairly good
agreement between theoretically calculated survival probability and the
measured nuclear modification factor($R_{AA}$) at the two energies.

operations in the theory of graph minors. Parameterized Complexity of editing
to a family of graphs by contracting $k$ edges has recently gained substantial
scientific attention, and several new results have been obtained. Some
important families of graphs, namely the subfamilies of chordal graphs, in the
context of edge contractions, have proven to be significantly difficult than
one might expect. In this paper, we study the \textsc{$\cal F$-Contraction}
problem, where $\cal F$ is a subfamily of chordal graphs, in the realm of
parameterized approximation. Formally, given a graph $G$ and an integer $k$,
\textsc{ $\cal F$-Contraction} asks whether there exists $X \subseteq E(G)$
such that $G/X \in \cal F$ and $|X| \leq k$. Here, $G/X$ is the graph obtained
from $G$ by contracting edges in $X$. We obtain the following results for the
\textsc{ $\cal F$-Contraction} problem. $(1)$ We show that \textsc{Clique
Contraction} admits a polynomial-size approximate kernelization scheme
(\textsf{PSAKS}). $(2)$ We give a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximate polynomial kernel
for \textsc{Split Contraction} (which also implies a factor
$(2+\epsilon)$-\FPT-approximation algorithm for \textsc{ Split Contraction}).

$\left(\frac{5}{4}-\delta \right)$-\FPT-approximation algorithm for
\textsc{Split Contraction}. Here, $\epsilon, \delta>0$ are fixed constants.
$(3)$ \textsc{Chordal Contraction} is known to be \WTH. We complement this
result by observing that the existing \textsf{W[2]-hardness} reduction can be
adapted to show that, assuming \FPT $\neq$ \textsf{W[1]}, there is no
$F(k)$-\FPT-approximation algorithm for \textsc{Chordal Contraction}. Here,
$F(k)$ is an arbitrary function depending on $k$ alone.

continuous rotation to realize tasks like fastening screws. The essential
structure of the tool comprises a Scissor-Like Element (SLE) mechanism and a
double-ratchet mechanism. They together convert repeated linear motion into
continuous rotating motion. At the joints of the SLE mechanism, elastic
elements are attached to provide resisting force for holding the tool as well
as for producing torque output when a gripper releases the tool. The tool is
entirely mechanical, allowing robots to use the tool without any peripherals
and power supply. The paper presents the details of the tool design, optimizes
its dimensions and effective stroke lengths, and studies the contacts and
forces to achieve stable grasping and screwing. Besides the design, the paper
develops manipulation policies for the tool. The policies include visual
recognition, picking-up and manipulation, and exchanging tooltips. The
developed tool produces clockwise rotation at the front end and
counter-clockwise rotation at the back end. Various tooltips can be installed
at both two ends. Robots may employ the developed manipulation policies to
exchange the tooltips and rotating directions following the needs of specific
fastening or loosening tasks. Robots can also reorient the tool using
pick-and-place or handover, and move the tool to work poses using the policies.
The designed tool, together with the developed manipulation policies, are
analyzed and verified in several real-world applications. The tool is small,
cordless, convenient, and has good robustness and adaptability.

have achieved impressive translation quality-speed tradeoffs compared to
autoregressive baselines. In this work, we reexamine this tradeoff and argue
that autoregressive baselines can be substantially sped up without loss in

decoders of varied depths. Our extensive experiments show that given a
sufficiently deep encoder, a single-layer autoregressive decoder can
substantially outperform strong non-autoregressive models with comparable

lack of knowledge distillation. Our results establish a new protocol for future

slits growing in the upper half complex plane. The problem is motivated by
Laplacian growth in which the slits represent thin fingers growing in a
diffusion field. A single finger follows a curved path determined by the
forcing function appearing in Loewner's equation. This function is found by
solving an ordinary differential equation whose terms depend on curvature
properties of the streamlines of the diffusive field in the conformally mapped
`mathematical' plane. The effect of boundary conditions specifying either
piecewise constant values of the field variable along the real axis, or a
dipole placed on the real axis, reveal a range of behaviours for the growing
slit. These include regions along the real axis from which no slit growth is
possible, regions where paths grow to infinity, or regions where paths curve
back toward the real axis terminating in finite time. Symmetric pairs of paths
subject to the piecewise constant boundary condition along the real axis are
also computed, demonstrating that paths which grow to infinity evolve
asymptotically toward an angle of bifurcation of $\pi/5$.

states, the concurrences of all pairs are equal to $N/2$, where N is the number

for these states, zz correlation between any pairs completely quenches. Our

$\Lambda$CDM initial conditions. Periodic boundary conditions cause an overall
negative and anisotropic bias in cosmological simulations of cosmic structure
formation. The lower amplitude of power spectra of small periodic simulations
are a consequence of the missing large scale modes and the equally important
smaller periodic forces. The effect is most significant when the largest mildly
non-linear scales are comparable to the linear size of the simulation box, as
often is the case for high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations. Spherical
collapse morphs into a shape similar to an octahedron. The anisotropic growth
distorts the large-scale $\Lambda$CDM dark matter structures. We introduce the
direction-dependent power spectrum invariant under the octahedral group of the

regularized least median estimator, and therefore not an ordinary regularized

orbital angular momentum but only few exist allowing to select a pure radial

occurred during solar cycles 23 and 24. We apply two methods: the Max spectrum
method can detect the predominant clusters and the de-clustering threshold time
method provides details on the typical clustering properties and time scales.
Our analysis shows that during the different phases of solar cycles 23 and 24,
CMEs with speed $\geq 1000\ km/s$ preferentially occur as isolated events and
in clusters with on average two members. However, clusters with more members
appear particularly during the maximum phases of the solar cycles. Over the
total period and in the maximum phases of solar cycles 23 and 24, about 50% are
isolated events, 18% (12%) occur in clusters with 2 (3) members, and another
20% in larger clusters $\geq 4$, whereas in solar minimum fast CMEs tend to
occur more frequently as isolated events (62%). During different solar cycle
phases, the typical de-clustering time scales of fast CMEs are $\tau_c=28-32\
hrs$, irrespective of the very different occurrence frequencies of CMEs during
solar minimum and maximum. These findings suggest that $\tau_c$ for extreme
events may reflect the characteristic energy build-up time for large flare and
CME-prolific active ARs. Associating statistically the clustering properties of
fast CMEs with the Disturbance storm index Dst at Earth suggests that fast CMEs
occuring in clusters tend to produce larger geomagnetic storms than isolated
fast CMEs. This may be related to CME-CME interaction producing a more complex
and stronger interaction with the Earth magnetosphere.

vesicles carrying biochemical reactants. Crossings between such filaments
constitute a key element, as they may serve to alter the destination of such
payload. Although motor proteins are known to display a rich behaviour at such
crossings, the latter have so far only been modelled as simple branching
points. Here we explore a model for a crossing between two microtubules which
retains the individual tracks consisting of protofilaments, and we construct a
schematic representation of the transport paths. We study collective transport
exemplified by the Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (TASEP), and
provide a full analysis of the transport features and the associated phase
diagram, by a generic mean-field approach which we confirm through
particle-based stochastic simulations. In particular we show that transport
through such a compound crossing cannot be approximated from a coarse-grained
structure with a simple branching point. Instead, it gives rise to entirely new
and counterintuitive features: the fundamental current-density relation for
traffic flow is no longer a single-valued function, and it furthermore differs
according to whether it is observed upstream or downstream from the crossing.
We argue that these novel features may be directly relevant for interpreting
experimental measurements.

the earthquake and its subsequent land change. However, in many cases, they
fail in their mission. In this paper, we address the well-established
earthquake prediction problem by a novel approach. We use a four-dimensional
location-time machine learning scheme to estimate the time of earthquake and
its land change. We present a study for the Ridgecrest, California 2019
earthquake prediction. We show the accuracy of our method is around 14
centimeters for the land change, and around 2 days for the time of the
earthquake, predicted from data more than 3 years before the earthquake.

flat, parallel fractures, and long wavelengths. However, we do not treat
fractures as weakness planes of displacement discontinuity. In contrast to the

background medium. In other words, we follow the Schoenberg-Douma matrix
formalism for Backus averaging, but we relax their assumptions of infinite
weakness and marginal thickness of a layer so that it does not correspond to
the linear-slip plane. To represent the properties of a fracture, we need a
fourth order elasticity tensor and a thickness parameter. The effective tensor
becomes more complicated, but it may describe a higher concentration of
parallel cracks more accurately. Apart from the derivations of the effective

  Forecasting",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Time series prediction has been a long-standing research topic and an
essential application in many domains. Modern time series collected from sensor
networks (e.g., energy consumption and traffic flow) are often large-scale and
incomplete with considerable corruption and missing values, making it difficult
to perform accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a low-rank
autoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework to model multivariate time
series data. The key of LATC is to transform the original multivariate time
series matrix (e.g., sensor$\times$time point) to a third-order tensor
structure (e.g., sensor$\times$time of day$\times$day) by introducing an
additional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms
and seasonality of time series as global patterns. With the tensor structure,
we can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation
problems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides
minimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the
original matrix representation into the objective function. The two components
serve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture
the global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e.,
similarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s.
the same time of historical days). The autoregressive norm can better model the
local temporal trends. Our numerical experiments on three real-world data sets
demonstrate the superiority of the integration of global and local trends in
LATC in both missing data imputation and rolling prediction tasks.

  Programming journal",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Shape analysis is of great importance for the verification of the correctness
and memory-safety of heap-manipulating programs, yet such analyses have been
shown to be highly difficult problems. The integration of separation logic into
shape analyses has improved the effectiveness of the techniques, but the most
significant advancement in this area is bi-abductive inference. Enabled by
separation logic, bi-abduction - a combination of abductive inference and frame
inference - is the key enabler for compositional reasoning, helping to scale up
verification significantly. Indeed, the success of bi-abduction has led to the
development of Infer, the tool used daily to verify Facebook's codebase of
millions of lines of code. However, this success currently stays largely within
the shape domain. To extend this impact towards the combination of shape and
arithmetic domains, in this work, we present a novel one-stage bi-abductive
procedure for a combination of data structures and ordering values. The
procedure is designed in the spirit of the Unfold-and-Match paradigm where the
inference is utilized to derive any mismatched portion. We have also
implemented a prototype solver, based on the Cyclist library, and demonstrate
its capabilities over a range of benchmarks from the SL-COMP competition. The
experimental results show that our proposal shows promise for the specification
inference in an automated verification of heap-manipulating programs.

based on the comprehensive and systematic studies, i.e., thickness range from
monolayer to bulk and various gate stack structures including 2D
heterostructure with h-BN as well as typical high-k top-gate structure. For
n-MoS2, Dit around the mid gap is drastically reduced to 5*10^11 cm-2eV-1 for
the heterostructure FET with h-BN from 5*10^12 cm-2eV-1 for the high-k top-gate
MoS2 FET. On the other hand, Dit remains high, ~10^13 cm-2eV-1, even for the
heterostructure FET for p-MoS2. The systematic study elucidates that the strain
induced externally through the substrate surface roughness and high-k
deposition process is the origin for the interface degradation on the
conduction band side, while sulfur-vacancy-induced defect-states dominate the
interface degradation on the valance band side. The present understanding on
the interface properties provides the key to further improving the performance

SnS has been commonly regarded to exhibit the odd-even effect, where the
centrosymmetry breaks only in the odd-number layers to exhibit
ferroelectricity. Remarkably, however, a robust RT ferroelectricity exists in
SnS below a critical thickness of 15 layers with both an odd and even number of

interaction with the mica substrate, suggesting the possibility of controlling
the stacking sequence of multilayer SnS, going beyond the limit of

optimising search strategies to maximise their efficiency of detecting these

with sparse data - PS15cey and PS17cke. Here we present more detailed analysis
and discussion of their nature. We observe that PS15cey was a luminous, fast
declining transient at 320 Mpc. Models of BH-NS mergers with a very stiff
equation of state could possibly reproduce the luminosity and decline but the
physical parameters are extreme. A more likely scenario is that this was a
SN2018kzr-like merger event. PS17cke was a faint and fast declining event at 15
Mpc. We explore several explosion scenarios of this transient including models
of it as a NS-NS and BH-NS merger, the outburst of a massive luminous star, and
compare it against other known fast fading transients. Although there is
uncertainty in the explosion scenario due to difficulty in measuring the
explosion epoch, we find PS17cke to be a plausible kilonova candidate from the

difference algorithms for multi-agent off-policy learning of linear
approximation of the value function in Markov decision processes with strict

neighborhoods. The algorithms are composed of: 1) local parameter updates based
on single-agent off-policy gradient temporal difference learning algorithms,
including eligibility traces with state dependent parameters, and 2) linear
stochastic time varying consensus schemes, represented by directed graphs. The
proposed algorithms differ by their form, definition of eligibility traces,
selection of time scales and the way of incorporating consensus iterations. The
main contribution of the paper is a convergence analysis based on the general
properties of the underlying Feller-Markov processes and the stochastic time
varying consensus model. We prove, under general assumptions, that the
parameter estimates generated by all the proposed algorithms weakly converge to
the corresponding ordinary differential equations (ODE) with precisely defined
invariant sets. It is demonstrated how the adopted methodology can be applied
to temporal-difference algorithms under weaker information structure
constraints. The variance reduction effect of the proposed algorithms is
demonstrated by formulating and analyzing an asymptotic stochastic differential
equation. Specific guidelines for communication network design are provided.
The algorithms' superior properties are illustrated by characteristic
simulation results.

excluding some fixed graph $H$ as an induced subgraph. We prove several
inapproximability results both for polynomial-time and parameterized
algorithms.
  Halld\'orsson [SODA 1995] showed that for every $\delta>0$ IS has a
polynomial-time $(\frac{d-1}{2}+\delta)$-approximation in $K_{1,d}$-free
graphs. We extend this result by showing that $K_{a,b}$-free graphs admit a
polynomial-time $O(\alpha(G)^{1-1/a})$-approximation, where $\alpha(G)$ is the
size of a maximum independent set in $G$. Furthermore, we complement the result
of Halld\'orsson by showing that for some $\gamma=\Theta(d/\log d),$ there is
no polynomial-time $\gamma$-approximation for these graphs, unless NP = ZPP.
  Bonnet et al. [IPEC 2018] showed that IS parameterized by the size $k$ of the
independent set is W[1]-hard on graphs which do not contain (1) a cycle of
constant length at least $4$, (2) the star $K_{1,4}$, and (3) any tree with two
vertices of degree at least $3$ at constant distance.
  We strengthen this result by proving three inapproximability results under
different complexity assumptions for almost the same class of graphs (we weaken
condition (2) that $G$ does not contain $K_{1,5}$). First, under the ETH, there
is no $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$ algorithm for any computable function $f$.
Then, under the deterministic Gap-ETH, there is a constant $\delta>0$ such that
no $\delta$-approximation can be computed in $f(k) \cdot n^{O(1)}$ time. Also,
under the stronger randomized Gap-ETH there is no such approximation algorithm
with runtime $f(k)\cdot n^{o(\sqrt{k})}$.
  Finally, we consider the parameterization by the excluded graph $H$, and show
that under the ETH, IS has no $n^{o(\alpha(H))}$ algorithm in $H$-free graphs
and under Gap-ETH there is no $d/k^{o(1)}$-approximation for $K_{1,d}$-free
graphs with runtime $f(d,k) n^{O(1)}$.

$E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ as a stabilizable set for the above equation, if there
is a linear bounded operator $K$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$ so that the semigroup
$\{e^{-t(H-\chi_EK)}\}_{t\geq 0}$ is exponentially stable. (Here, $\chi_E$
denotes the characteristic function of $E$, which is treated as a linear
operator on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$.)
  This paper presents different geometric characterizations of the stabilizable
sets for the above equation with different $H$. In particular, when $H$ is a
shifted fractional Laplacian, $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a stabilizable set if
and only if $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a thick set, while when $H$ is a shifted
Hermite operator, $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a stabilizable set for if and only
if $E\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a set of positive measure. Our results, together
with the results on the observable sets for the above equation obtained in
\cite{AB,Ko,Li,M09}, reveal such phenomena: for some $H$, the class of
stabilizable sets contains strictly the class of observable sets, while for
some other $H$, the classes of stabilizable sets and observable sets coincide.
Besides, this paper gives some sufficient conditions on the stabilizable sets
for the above equation where $H$ is the Schr\""{o}dinger operator with some

with the pulsar phase gives a direct measure of the source inclination and
magnetic obliquity. In the case of rapidly rotating millisecond pulsars, the
relativistic motion of the emission region causes additional rotation of the
polarisation plane. Here, we develop a relativistic rotating vector model,
where we derive analytical expression for the polarisation angle as a function
of the pulsar phase accounting for relativistic aberration and gravitational
light bending in the Schwarzschild metric. We show that in the case of fast
pulsars the rotation of the polarisation plane can reach tens of degrees,
strongly influencing the observed shape of the polarisation angle's phase
dependence. The rotation angle grows nearly linearly with the spin rate but it
is less sensitive to the neutron star radius. Overall, this angle is large even
for large spots. Our results have implications with regard to the modelling of
X-ray polarisation from accreting millisecond pulsars that are to be observed

states that in every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$,
sampling $O(\log{n})$ colors per each vertex independently from $\Delta+1$
colors almost certainly allows for proper coloring of $G$ from the sampled
colors. Besides being a combinatorial statement of its own independent
interest, this theorem was shown to have various applications to design of
algorithms for $(\Delta+1)$ coloring in different models of computation on
massive graphs such as streaming or sublinear-time algorithms.
  In this paper, we further study palette sparsification problems:
  * We prove that for $(1+\varepsilon) \Delta$ coloring, sampling only
$O_{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{\log{n}})$ colors per vertex is sufficient and necessary
to obtain a proper coloring from the sampled colors.
  * A natural family of graphs with chromatic number much smaller than
$(\Delta+1)$ are triangle-free graphs which are $O(\frac{\Delta}{\ln{\Delta}})$
colorable. We prove that sampling $O(\Delta^{\gamma} + \sqrt{\log{n}})$ colors
per vertex is sufficient and necessary to obtain a proper
$O_{\gamma}(\frac{\Delta}{\ln{\Delta}})$ coloring of triangle-free graphs.
  * We show that sampling $O_{\varepsilon}(\log{n})$ colors per vertex is
sufficient for proper coloring of any graph with high probability whenever each
vertex is sampling from a list of $(1+\varepsilon) \cdot deg(v)$ arbitrary
colors, or even only $deg(v)+1$ colors when the lists are the sets
$\{1,\ldots,deg(v)+1\}$.

to localize a temporal segment from an untrimmed video described by a natural

between vision and linguistic domains. Existing methods independently extract
the features of videos and sentences and purely utilize the sentence embedding
in the multi-modal fusion stage, which do not make full use of the potential of
language. In this paper, we present Language Guided Networks (LGN), a new
framework that leverages the sentence embedding to guide the whole process of
moment retrieval. In the first feature extraction stage, we propose to jointly
learn visual and language features to capture the powerful visual information
which can cover the complex semantics in the sentence query. Specifically, the
early modulation unit is designed to modulate the visual feature extractor's
feature maps by a linguistic embedding. Then we adopt a multi-modal fusion
module in the second fusion stage. Finally, to get a precise localizer, the
sentence information is utilized to guide the process of predicting temporal
positions. Specifically, the late guidance module is developed to linearly
transform the output of localization networks via the channel attention
mechanism. The experimental results on two popular datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our proposed method on moment retrieval (improving by

director, which triggers chaining parallel to the director and seemingly
contradicts the standard liquid crystal field theory result of a quadrupolar
attraction with a preferred ${45^{\circ}}$ angle. Our results can be explained
by a short-range density-dependent depletion interaction, which has been
neglected so far. Directionality and strength of the depletion interaction are
caused by the weak planar anchoring of hard rods. The depletion attraction
robustly dominates over the quadrupolar elastic attraction if disks come close.
Self-assembly of many disks proceeds via intermediate chaining, which
demonstrates that in lyotropic liquid crystal colloids depletion interactions
play an important role in structure formation processes.

In this study, we propose SXL, a method for embedding information on the

spatial autocorrelation, to ""nudge"" the model to learn the direction and
magnitude of local spatial effects, complementing the learning of the primary

constructed easily and as a multi-dimensional tensor offers seamless
integration into existing machine learning frameworks. Throughout a range of
experiments using real-world data, we highlight how our method consistently
improves the training of neural networks in unsupervised and supervised

such as disorder and pinning. While the effects of doping and disorder have
been well studied in B20 metallic materials such as Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and
Mn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si, the consequences of chemical substitution in the
magnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ have not been fully explored. In this
work, we utilize a combination of AC magnetometry and small angle neutron
scattering to investigate the magnetic phase transition dynamics in pristine
and Zn-substituted Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. The results demonstrate that the first order
helical-conical phase transition exhibits two thermally separated behavioural
regimes: at high temperatures, the helimagnetic domains transform by
large-scale, continuous rotations, while at low temperatures, the two phases
coexist. Remarkably, the effects of pinning in the substituted sample are less
prevalent at low temperatures, compared to high temperatures, despite the
reduction of available thermal activation energy. We attribute this behaviour
to the large, temperature-dependent, cubic anisotropy unique to Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$,
which becomes strong enough to overcome the pinning energy at low temperatures.
Consideration and further exploration of these effects will be crucial when
engineering skyrmion materials towards future applications.

the nebula. Non-LTE effects are clearly seen in complex species including
methanol absorption against the CMB. The temperatures are 17 K in the inner

relative abundance patterns in the remnant which currently are not understood.
Attempts to derive elemental abundances within the assumption of a chemical
equilibrium give only loose constraints on the CNO elements. That the formation
of many of the observed molecules requires a major involvement of circumstellar

information about the host superconductor. Here, we reveal that magnetic
impurities embedded below a superconducting La(0001) surface interact via

observed with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph (GRIS) at the 1.5-meter GREGOR
telescope on 2016 July 3. Three consecutive full-Stokes
slit-spectropolarimetric scans in the He I 10830 \r{A} spectral range were
acquired. The Stokes I profiles were classified using the machine learning
k-means algorithm and then inverted with different initial conditions using the
HAZEL code. The erupting-filament material presents the following physical
conditions: (1) ubiquitous upward motions with peak LOS velocities of ~73 km/s;
(2) predominant large horizontal components of the magnetic field, on average,
in the range of 173-254 G, whereas the vertical components of the fields are
much lower, on average between 39-58 G; (3) optical depths in the range of
0.7-1.1. The average azimuth orientation of the field lines between two
consecutive raster scans (<2.5 minutes) remained constant. The analyzed
filament eruption belonged to the fast rising phase, with total velocities of
about 124 km/s. The orientation of the magnetic field lines does not change
from one raster scan to the other, indicating that the untwisting phase has not
started yet. The untwisting seems to start about 15 min after the beginning of
the filament eruption.

misalignments, such as twisted bilayer graphene, feature interesting structural
moir\'e superlattices. Due to the quantum coupling between the twisted atomic
layers, light-matter interaction is inherently chiral; as such, they provide a
promising platform for chiral plasmons in the extreme nanoscale. However, while
the interlayer quantum coupling can be significant, its influence on chiral
plasmons still remains elusive. Here we present the general solutions from full
Maxwell equations of chiral plasmons in twisted atomic bilayers, with the
consideration of interlayer quantum coupling. We find twisted atomic bilayers
have a direct correspondence to the chiral metasurface, which simultaneously
possesses chiral and magnetic surface conductivities, besides the common
electric surface conductivity. In other words, the interlayer quantum coupling
in twisted van der Waals heterostructures may facilitate the construction of
various (e.g., bi-anisotropic) atomically-thin metasurfaces. Moreover, the
chiral surface conductivity, determined by the interlayer quantum coupling,
determines the existence of chiral plasmons and leads to a unique phase
relationship (i.e., +/-{\pi}/2 phase difference) between their TE and TM wave
components. Importantly, such a unique phase relationship for chiral plasmons
can be exploited to construct the missing longitudinal spin of plasmons,
besides the common transverse spin of plasmons.

the obstructed shadow of a measure in a peacock, a generalization of the
(obstructed) shadow introduced in \cite{BeJu16,NuStTa17}. As input data we take
an increasing family of measures $(\nu^\alpha)_{\alpha \in [0,1]}$ with
$\nu^\alpha(\mathbb{R})=\alpha$ that are submeasures of $\mu _0$, called a
parametrization of $\mu_0$. Then, for any $\alpha$ we define an evolution
$(\eta^\alpha_t)_{t\geq 0}$ of the measure $\nu^\alpha=\eta^\alpha_0$ across
our peacock by setting $\eta^\alpha_t$ equal to the obstructed shadow of
$\nu^\alpha$ in $(\mu _s)_{s \in [0,t]}$. We identify conditions on the
parametrization $(\nu^\alpha)_{\alpha\in [0,1]}$ such that this construction
leads to a unique martingale measure $\pi$, the shadow martingale, without any
assumptions on the peacock. In the case of the left-curtain parametrization
$(\nu_{\text{lc}}^\alpha)_{\alpha \in [0,1]}$ we identify the shadow martingale
as the unique solution to a continuous-time version of the martingale optimal
transport problem.
  Furthermore, our method enriches the knowledge on the Predictable

canonical Choquet representation in extremal Markov martingales.

systems. Various fairness notions have been proposed to measure the degree to
which an algorithm is unfair. In practice, there frequently exist a certain set
of variables we term as fair variables, which are pre-decision covariates such
as users' choices. The effects of fair variables are irrelevant in assessing
the fairness of the decision support algorithm. We thus define conditional
fairness as a more sound fairness metric by conditioning on the fairness
variables. Given different prior knowledge of fair variables, we demonstrate
that traditional fairness notations, such as demographic parity and equalized
odds, are special cases of our conditional fairness notations. Moreover, we
propose a Derivable Conditional Fairness Regularizer (DCFR), which can be
integrated into any decision-making model, to track the trade-off between
precision and fairness of algorithmic decision making. Specifically, an
adversarial representation based conditional independence loss is proposed in
our DCFR to measure the degree of unfairness. With extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets, we demonstrate the advantages of our conditional
fairness notation and DCFR.

applies distributed MCTS to a real-world and non-game problem. Existing work on

strategy to pre-train a neural network with unlabeled data, followed by
fine-tuning for a downstream task with limited annotations. Contrastive
learning, a particular variant of SSL, is a powerful technique for learning
image-level representations. In this work, we propose strategies for extending
the contrastive learning framework for segmentation of volumetric medical
images in the semi-supervised setting with limited annotations, by leveraging
domain-specific and problem-specific cues. Specifically, we propose (1) novel
contrasting strategies that leverage structural similarity across volumetric
medical images (domain-specific cue) and (2) a local version of the contrastive
loss to learn distinctive representations of local regions that are useful for
per-pixel segmentation (problem-specific cue). We carry out an extensive
evaluation on three Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets. In the limited
annotation setting, the proposed method yields substantial improvements
compared to other self-supervision and semi-supervised learning techniques.
When combined with a simple data augmentation technique, the proposed method
reaches within 8% of benchmark performance using only two labeled MRI volumes
for training, corresponding to only 4% (for ACDC) of the training data used to

for instance, accurate approximation of the behaviour of wide Bayesian NNs

further discuss the effects of positional encodings and layer normalisation,

these observations are made for the particle flux instead of the heat flux more
commonly studied in ion temperature gradient (ITG) driven turbulence in fluid

dynamics parallel to the magnetic field lines. To address questions regarding
the role of boundary conditions on the drift-wave zonal flow dynamics, we apply
our model to both a channel domain geometry and the more typical doubly
periodic geometry. We only observe strong soliton-like solutions in the
particle flux for the channel geometry, in the vicinity of the boundaries,
where strong velocity shear and density gradients are generated which are
absent in the doubly periodic simulations. Changing the aspect ratio of the

in the radial direction, more complex multiscale dynamics takes place, with
multiple zonal jets interacting with each other, and large scale avalanches.

interesting from a fundamental point of view, as the ponderomotive
approximation is no longer valid for such short pulses. Through
particle-in-cell simulations, we show how the plasma response becomes
asymmetric in the plane of laser polarization, and dependent on the
carrier-envelope phase (CEP) of the laser pulse. For the case of
self-injection, this in turn strongly affects the initial conditions of
injected electrons, causing collective betatron oscillations of the electron
beam. As a result, the electron beam pointing, electron energy spectrum and the
direction of emitted betatron radiation become CEP-dependent. For injection in
a density gradient the effect on beam pointing is reduced and the electron
energy spectrum is CEP-independent, as electron injection is mostly
longitudinal and mainly determined by the density gradient. Our results
highlight the importance of controlling the CEP in this regime for producing
stable and reproducible relativistic electron beams and identify how CEP
effects may be observed in experiments. In the future, CEP control may become
an additional tool to control the energy spectrum or pointing of the

offers control over image generation by providing direct handles controlling

unsupervised training that links generated coarse 3D models with unpaired real

redshift currently known in the literature. 4C 41.17 shows a narrow ridge of
dust continuum extending over 15 kpc near the radio jet axis. Line emission is
found within the galaxy in the region with signatures of positive feedback.
Using the [CI]1-0 line as a molecular gas tracer, and multifrequency
observations of the far-infrared dust heated by star formation, we find a total
gas mass of $7.6\times 10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$, which is somewhat greater than
that previously found from CO(4-3). The gas mass surface density of $10^3$
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ pc$^{-2}$ and the star formation rate surface density of
10 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$ were derived over the 12 kpc$\times$8 kpc

densities are comparable to those in other populations of massive, dusty
star-forming galaxies in this redshift range, suggesting that the jet does not
currently enhance the efficiency with which stars form from the gas. This is
consistent with expectations from simulations, whereby radio jets may
facilitate the onset of star formation in galaxies without boosting its
efficiency over longer timescales, in particular after the jet has broken out

from quality control to cutting edge biomedical research. One particular area
which has seen tremendous advances in the past decade is the development of
powerful handheld Raman spectrometers. They have been adopted widely by first
responders and law enforcement agencies for the field analysis of unknown
substances. Field detection and identification of unknown substances with Raman
spectroscopy rely heavily on the spectral matching capability of the devices on
hand. Conventional spectral matching algorithms (such as correlation, dot
product, etc.) have been used in identifying unknown Raman spectrum by
comparing the unknown to a large reference database. This is typically achieved
through brute-force summation of pixel-by-pixel differences between the
reference and the unknown spectrum. Conventional algorithms have noticeable
drawbacks. For example, they tend to work well with identifying pure compounds
but less so for mixture compounds. For instance, limited reference spectra
inaccessible databases with a large number of classes relative to the number of
samples have been a setback for the widespread usage of Raman spectroscopy for
field analysis applications. State-of-the-art deep learning methods
(specifically convolutional neural networks CNNs), as an alternative approach,
presents a number of advantages over conventional spectral comparison algorism.
With optimization, they are ideal to be deployed in handheld spectrometers for
field detection of unknown substances. In this study, we present a
comprehensive survey in the use of one-dimensional CNNs for Raman spectrum
identification. Specifically, we highlight the use of this powerful deep
learning technique for handheld Raman spectrometers taking into consideration
the potential limit in power consumption and computation ability of handheld

often enhance electronic interactions and, in turn, can result in dynamical
molecular stabilization at finite temperature. The underlying physical
mechanism promoted by NQE depends on the particular interaction under
consideration. First, the effective reduction of interatomic distances between
functional groups within a molecule can enhance the $n\to\pi^*$ interaction by
increasing the overlap between molecular orbitals or by strengthening
electrostatic interactions between neighboring charge densities. Second, NQE
can localize methyl rotors by temporarily changing molecular bond orders and
leading to the emergence of localized transient rotor states. Third, for

increase of the polarizability given the expanded average interatomic distances

that the action of dynamical decoupling cannot be understood as a simple

the design of distributed algorithms. One of the most important features of
random walks is that, under mild conditions, they converge to a stationary
distribution in time that is at most polynomial in the size of the graph. This
fundamental property, however, only holds if the graph does not change over
time, while on the other hand many distributed networks are inherently dynamic,
and their topology is subjected to potentially drastic changes.
  In this work we study the mixing (i.e., converging) properties of random
walks on graphs subjected to random changes over time. Specifically, we
consider the edge-Markovian random graph model: for each edge slot, there is a
two-state Markov chain with transition probabilities $p$ (add a non-existing
edge) and $q$ (remove an existing edge). We derive several positive and
negative results that depend on both the density of the graph and the speed by
which the graph changes. We show that if $p$ is very small (i.e., below the
connectivity threshold of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs), random walks do
not mix (fast). When $p$ is larger, instead, we observe the following behavior:
if the graph changes slowly over time (i.e., $q$ is small), random walks enjoy
strong mixing properties that are comparable to the ones possessed by random
walks on static graphs; however, if the graph changes too fast (i.e., $q$ is
large), only coarse mixing properties are preserved.

This assumption is, however, often violated in uncertain real-world
applications, which motivates the study of learning under covariate shift. In
this setting, the naive use of adaptive hyperparameter optimization methods
such as Bayesian optimization does not work as desired since it does not
address the distributional shift among different datasets. In this work, we
consider a novel hyperparameter optimization problem under the multi-source
covariate shift whose goal is to find the optimal hyperparameters for a target
task of interest using only unlabeled data in a target task and labeled data in
multiple source tasks. To conduct efficient hyperparameter optimization for the
target task, it is essential to estimate the target objective using only the
available information. To this end, we construct the variance reduced estimator
that unbiasedly approximates the target objective with a desirable variance
property. Building on the proposed estimator, we provide a general and
tractable hyperparameter optimization procedure, which works preferably in our
setting with a no-regret guarantee. The experiments demonstrate that the
proposed framework broadens the applications of automated hyperparameter

the electron donating and accepting (hole donating) properties of the spike

out the penetration potential of those particles under different electrostatic
fields. An intensive study have been carried out to find out the generation of
electrostatic charges due to the surface emission of electrons (SEE), when a
conducting material like silk, nylon or wool makes a friction with the Gr IV
elements like Germanium or Silicon, it creates an opposite layer of charges in
the outer conducting surface and the inner semiconducting surface separated by
a dielectric materials. This opposite charge barriers may be considered as
Inversion layers (IL). The electrostatic charges accumulated in the layers
between the Gr IV Ge is sufficient enough to either fuse or repel the charges

The syntax of a host-core language is split into two parts, representing

derived from Benton's Linear-Non-Linear formulation of Linear Logic, allows a
flexible management of data linearity, which is particularly useful in
non-classical computational paradigms. The host-core style can be viewed as a
simplified notion of multi-language programming, the process of software
development in a heterogeneous programming language. In this paper, we present
the typed calculus HC, a minimal and flexible host-core system that captures
and standardizes common properties of an ideal class of host-core languages. We
provide a denotational model in terms of enriched categories and we state a

several variants with DI1: DI5, DI1n, DI5n, and DEP. Since indicators should
measure what they propose to measure, we investigated the convergent validity

predictions based on the 'wrong' features. This effect which undermines the
generalization capability of an ML model and goes undetected by standard
validation techniques has been frequently observed for supervised learning
where the training algorithm leverages spurious correlations in the data. The
question whether Clever Hans also occurs in unsupervised learning, and in which
form, has received so far almost no attention. Therefore, this paper will
contribute an explainable AI (XAI) procedure that can highlight the relevant
features used by popular anomaly detection models of different type. Our
analysis reveals that the Clever Hans effect is widespread in anomaly detection
and occurs in many (unexpected) forms. Interestingly, the observed Clever Hans
effects are in this case not so much due to the data, but due to the anomaly
detection models themselves whose structure makes them unable to detect the
truly relevant features, even though vast amounts of data points are available.
Overall, our work contributes a warning against an unrestrained use of existing
anomaly detection models in practical applications, but it also points at a
possible way out of the Clever Hans dilemma, specifically, by allowing multiple
anomaly models to mutually cancel their individual structural weaknesses to
jointly produce a better and more trustworthy anomaly detector.

  variables","16 pages, 6 figures",,"10.3390/universe8060302",,"gr-qc","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We analyze the semiclassical and quantum polymer dynamics of the isotropic
Universe in terms of both the standard Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection and
its conjugate momentum and also of the new generalized coordinate conjugate to
the Universe volume. We study the properties of the resulting bouncing
cosmology that emerges in both the representations and we show that the Big
Bounce is an intrinsic cut-off on the cosmological dynamics only when the
volume variable is implemented, while in terms of the standard connection the
Universe Bounce energy density is fixed by the initial conditions on the
prepared wavepacket. As a phenomenological implication, we introduce particle
creation as a dissipative term and study the production of entropy in the two
formulations. Then, we compare the obtained dynamics with what emerges in Loop
Quantum Cosmology, where the same difference in the nature of the Big Bounce is
associated to fixing a minimum area eigenvalue in a comoving or in a physical
representation. We conclude that the privileged character of the
Ashtekar-Barbero-Immirzi connection suggests that the natural scenario in the
polymer framework is a Big Bounce that is not a Universal cut-off. However, by
a parallelism between the polymer and Loop Quantum Cosmology properties of the
basic operators, we also develop some considerations in favour of the viability
of the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme of Loop Quantum Cosmology on a semiclassical level.

searches for samples of interest across different dimensions. Automatically
extracting tags from AV labels is an efficient approach to categorize and index
massive amounts of samples. Recent tools like AVClass and Euphony have
demonstrated that, despite their noisy nature, it is possible to extract family
names from AV labels. However, beyond the family name, AV labels contain much
valuable information such as malware classes, file properties, and behaviors.
  This work presents AVClass2, an automatic malware tagging tool that given the
AV labels for a potentially massive number of samples, extracts clean tags that
categorize the samples. AVClass2 uses, and helps building, an open taxonomy
that organizes concepts in AV labels, but is not constrained to a predefined
set of tags. To keep itself updated as AV vendors introduce new tags, it
provides an update module that automatically identifies new taxonomy entries,
as well as tagging and expansion rules that capture relations between tags. We
have evaluated AVClass2 on 42M and showed how it enables advanced malware
searches and to maintain an updated knowledge base of malware concepts in AV
labels.

theorem by Kucerovsky provides sufficient conditions for an unbounded Kasparov
module to represent the (internal) Kasparov product of two other unbounded
Kasparov modules. In this article, we discuss several improved and generalised
variants of Kucerovsky's theorem. First, we provide a generalisation which
relaxes the positivity condition, by replacing the lower bound by a relative
lower bound. Second, we also discuss Kucerovsky's theorem in the context of
half-closed modules, which generalise unbounded Kasparov modules to symmetric
(rather than self-adjoint) operators. In order to deal with the positivity
condition for such non-self-adjoint operators, we introduce a fairly general
localisation procedure, which (using a suitable approximate unit) provides a
'localised representative' for the KK-class of a half-closed module. Using this
localisation procedure, we then prove several variants of Kucerovsky's theorem
for half-closed modules. A distinct advantage of the localised approach, also
in the special case of self-adjoint operators (i.e., for unbounded Kasparov
modules), is that the (global) positivity condition in Kucerovsky's original
theorem is replaced by a (less restrictive) 'local' positivity condition, which
is closer in spirit to the well-known Connes-Skandalis theorem in the bounded
picture of KK-theory.

retaining its benign accuracy to a high degree. Equally importantly, our

classification problem, and binary classifiers are trained and validated on
specialized anti-spoofing databases. One of the drawbacks of this approach is
that, due to the variability of face spoofing attacks, environmental factors,
and the typically small sample size, such classifiers do not generalize well to
previously unseen databases. Anomaly detection, which approaches face
anti-spoofing as a one-class classification problem, is emerging as an
increasingly popular alternative approach. Nevertheless, in all existing work
on anomaly detection for face anti-spoofing, the proposed training protocols
utilize images from specialized anti-spoofing databases only, even though only
common images of real faces are needed. Here, we explore the use of in-the-wild
images, and images from non-specialized face databases, to train one-class
classifiers for face anti-spoofing. Employing a well-established technique, we
train a convolutional autoencoder on real faces and compare the reconstruction
error of the input against a threshold to classify a face image accordingly as
either client or imposter.
  Our results show that the inclusion in the training set of in-the-wild images
increases the discriminating power of the classifier significantly on an unseen
database, as evidenced by a large increase in the value of the Area Under the
Curve. In a limitation of our approach, we note that the problem of finding a
suitable operating point on the unseen database remains a challenge, as
evidenced by the values of the Half Total Error Rate.

Quantum Interference Device (dc-SQUID). For a suppressed Josephson coupling,
the system generates a finite average thermoelectric signal, combined to an
oscillation due to the standard ac Josephson phenomenology. At large Josephson
couplings, the thermoelectricity induces an oscillatory behaviour with zero

associated to the Josephson coupling strength, and ultimately tuned by the
dc-SQUID magnetic flux. In conclusion, we demonstrate to be able to control the

atmospheric escape in close-in exoplanets. Given that stellar irradiation
depends on the stellar magnetism and that stars have magnetic cycles, we
investigate how cycles affect the evolution of exoplanetary atmospheric escape.
Firstly, we consider a hypothetical HD209458b-like planet orbiting the Sun. For
that, we implement the observed solar XUV radiation available over one and a
half solar cycles in a 1D hydrodynamic escape model of HD209458b. We find that
atmospheric escape rates show a cyclic variation (from 7.6 to 18.5 $\times$
10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$), almost proportional to the incident stellar radiation.
To compare this with observations, we compute spectroscopic transits in two
hydrogen lines. We find non-detectable cyclic variations in Ly$\alpha$
transits. Given the temperature sensitiveness of the H$\alpha$ line, its
equivalent width has an amplitude of 1.9 mA variation over the cycle, which
could be detectable in exoplanets such as HD209458b. We demonstrate that the
XUV flux is linearly proportional to the magnetic flux during the solar cycle.
Secondly, we apply this relation to derive the cyclic evolution of the XUV flux
of HD189733 using the available magnetic flux observations of the star from
Zeeman Doppler Imaging over nearly a decade. The XUV fluxes are then used to
model escape in HD189733b, which shows escape rate varying from 2.8 to 6.5
$\times$ 10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$. Like in the HD209458b case, this introduces
variations in Ly$\alpha$ and H$\alpha$ transits, with H$\alpha$ variations more

well-being. However, it is difficult to objectively detect when workers are
experiencing flow in their work. In this paper, we investigate how to predict a
worker's focus state based on physiological signals. We conducted a lab study
to collect physiological data from knowledge workers experienced different
levels of flow while performing work tasks. We used the nine characteristics of
flow to design tasks that would induce different focus states. A manipulation
check using the Flow Short Scale verified that participants experienced three
distinct flow states, one overly challenging non-flow state, and two types of
flow states, balanced flow, and automatic flow. We built machine learning
classifiers that can distinguish between non-flow and flow states with 0.889
average AUC and rest states from working states with 0.98 average AUC. The
results show that physiological sensing can detect focused flow states of
knowledge workers and can enable ways to for individuals and organizations to
improve both productivity and worker satisfaction.

time of day: `morning', `afternoon', `night' or `any time' when they would like
to undertake these outings as well as the desired place to visit. An artificial

requests and responds with specific time allocations for such visits that
minimize the overall risks of infection, hospitalization and death of people. A
number of alternatives for this computation are presented and results of
numerical experiments involving over 230 people of various ages and background
health levels in over 1700 visits that take place over three consecutive days.
A novel partial infection model is introduced to discuss these proof of concept

effective video forgery methods, used for generating so-called ""deepfakes"".
Mitigation research is mostly focused on post-factum deepfake detection and not
on prevention. We complement these efforts by introducing a novel class of
adversarial attacks---training-resistant attacks---which can disrupt
face-swapping autoencoders whether or not its adversarial images have been
included in the training set of said autoencoders. We propose the Oscillating
GAN (OGAN) attack, a novel attack optimized to be training-resistant, which
introduces spatial-temporal distortions to the output of face-swapping
autoencoders. To implement OGAN, we construct a bilevel optimization problem,
where we train a generator and a face-swapping model instance against each
other. Specifically, we pair each input image with a target distortion, and
feed them into a generator that produces an adversarial image. This image will
exhibit the distortion when a face-swapping autoencoder is applied to it. We
solve the optimization problem by training the generator and the face-swapping
model simultaneously using an iterative process of alternating optimization.
Next, we analyze the previously published Distorting Attack and show it is
training-resistant, though it is outperformed by our suggested OGAN. Finally,
we validate both attacks using a popular implementation of FaceSwap, and show
that they transfer across different target models and target faces, including
faces the adversarial attacks were not trained on. More broadly, these results
demonstrate the existence of training-resistant adversarial attacks,
potentially applicable to a wide range of domains.

major processes, namely preprocessing, feature extraction and classification
using multiple layers. Initially, the hyperspectral image is divided into
number of spectral bands. These bands are given as input in the input layer of
perceptron. Then the Frost filter is used in FFSIFT-MLPC technique for
preprocessing the input bands which helps to remove the noise from
hyper-spectral image at the first hidden layer. After preprocessing task,
texture, color and object features of hyper-spectral image are extracted at
second hidden layer using Gaussian distributive scale-invariant feature
transform. At the third hidden layer, Euclidean distance is measured between
the extracted features and testing features. Finally, feature matching is
carried out at the output layer for hyper-spectral image classification. The
classified outputs are resulted in terms of spectral bands (i.e., different
colors). Experimental analysis is performed with PSNR, classification accuracy,

infection, based on SEIR type models, based on additional information about the
number of detected cases, mortality, self-isolation coefficient and tests
performed for the Moscow city and the Novosibirsk Region from 03.23.2020.
Within the framework of the models used, the population is divided into seven
(SEIR-HCD) and five (SEIR-D) groups with similar characteristics with
transition probabilities between groups depending on a specific region.
Identifiability analysis of the SEIR-HCD mathematical model was carried out,
which revealed the least sensitive unknown parameters to additional
measurements. The tasks of refining the parameters are reduced to minimizing
the corresponding target functionals, which were solved using stochastic
methods (simulating annealing, differential evolution, genetic algorithm,
etc.). For a different amount of tested data, a prognostic scenario for the
development of the disease in the city of Moscow and the Novosibirsk region was
developed, the peak is predicted the development of the epidemic in Moscow with
an error of 2 days and 174 detected cases, and an analysis of the applicability
of the developed models was carried out.

that are ergodic and linear (i.e. where rewards and dynamics are linear in some
known features), we provide the first finite-sample OPE error bound, extending
existing results beyond the episodic and discounted cases. In a more general
setting, when the feature dynamics are approximately linear and for arbitrary
rewards, we propose a new approach for estimating stationary distributions with
function approximation. We formulate this problem as finding the
maximum-entropy distribution subject to matching feature expectations under
empirical dynamics. We show that this results in an exponential-family
distribution whose sufficient statistics are the features, paralleling
maximum-entropy approaches in supervised learning. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed OPE approaches in multiple environments.

  Transparency (FAccT) 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly used in real-world applications
(e.g. facial recognition). This has resulted in concerns about the fairness of
decisions made by these models. Various notions and measures of fairness have
been proposed to ensure that a decision-making system does not
disproportionately harm (or benefit) particular subgroups of the population. In
this paper, we argue that traditional notions of fairness that are only based
on models' outputs are not sufficient when the model is vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. We argue that in some cases, it may be easier for an
attacker to target a particular subgroup, resulting in a form of
\textit{robustness bias}. We show that measuring robustness bias is a
challenging task for DNNs and propose two methods to measure this form of bias.
We then conduct an empirical study on state-of-the-art neural networks on
commonly used real-world datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Adience, and
UTKFace and show that in almost all cases there are subgroups (in some cases
based on sensitive attributes like race, gender, etc) which are less robust and
are thus at a disadvantage. We argue that this kind of bias arises due to both
the data distribution and the highly complex nature of the learned decision
boundary in the case of DNNs, thus making mitigation of such biases a
non-trivial task. Our results show that robustness bias is an important
criterion to consider while auditing real-world systems that rely on DNNs for
decision making. Code to reproduce all our results can be found here:

underestimation bias. By unifying these two opposites, we propose a novel
Weighted Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm, which can reduce
the estimation error and further improve the performance by weighting a pair of

Currently, works on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning are still being

expected that they become far more important in the longer term. This article
presents a semi-supervised model, called Batch Semi-Supervised Self-Organizing

show that Batch SS-SOM is a good option for semi-supervised classification and

to a novel model we call the PECAIQR model. It adds several new variables and
parameters to the naive SIR model by taking into account the ramifications of
the partial quarantining implemented in the US. We fitted data to the model
parameters with numerical integration. Because of the fit degeneracy in
parameter space and non-constant nature of the parameters, we developed several
methods to optimize our fit, such as training on the data tail and training on
specific policy regimes. We use cross-validation to tune our hyper parameters
at the county level and generate a CDF for future daily deaths. For predictions

expressiveness, flexibility, and extensibility of Coq's languages and notations
means that Coq projects have a wide variety of recognizable coding styles,
sometimes explicitly documented as conventions on naming and formatting. In
particular, even inexperienced users can distinguish vernacular using the
standard library and plain Ltac from idiomatic vernacular using the
Mathematical Components (MathComp) library and SSReflect.
  While coding conventions are important for comprehension and maintenance,
they are costly to document and enforce. Rule-based formatters, such as Coq's
