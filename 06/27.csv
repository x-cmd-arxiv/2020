with a traveling spatial heterogeneity which destabilizes, or quenches, the
trivial ground state while progressing through the domain. We consider the
regime where the heterogeneity propagates with speed $c$ just below the linear
invasion speed of the pattern-forming front in the associated homogeneous
system. In this situation, the front locks to the interface of the
heterogeneity leaving a long intermediate state lying near the unstable ground
state, possibly allowing for growth of perturbations. This manifests itself in
the spectrum of the linearization about the front through the accumulation of
eigenvalues onto the absolute spectrum associated with the unstable ground
state. As the quench speed $c$ increases towards the linear invasion speed, the
absolute spectrum stabilizes with the same rate at which eigenvalues accumulate
onto it allowing us to rigorously establish spectrally stability of the front
in $L^2(\mathbb{R})$.
  The presence of unstable absolute spectrum poses a technical challenge as
spatial eigenvalues along the intermediate state no longer admit a hyperbolic
splitting and standard tools such as exponential dichotomies are unavailable.
Instead, we projectivize the linear flow, and use Riemann surface unfolding in
combination with a superposition principle to study the evolution of subspaces
as solutions to the associated matrix Riccati differential equation on the
Grassmannian manifold. Eigenvalues can then be identified as the roots of the
meromorphic Riccati-Evans function, and can be located using winding number and
parity arguments.

narrow-band measurements over ~1000 deg^2, with limiting magnitude r~22. The
analysis of high-z Lya-emitting sources over such a wide area is unprecedented,
and allows to select a total of ~14,500 hyper-bright (L_Lya>10^43.3 erg/s)
Lya-emitting candidates. We test our selection with two spectroscopic follow-up

sources, with ~64% being genuine z~2.2 QSOs. We extend the 2.2<z<3.3 Lya LF for
the first time above L_Lya~10^44 erg/s and down to densities of ~10^-8 Mpc^-3.
Our results unveil with high detail the Schechter exponential-decay of the
brightest-end of the Lya LF, complementing the power-law component of previous
LF determinations at 43.3<Log_10(L_Lya / [erg/s])<44. We measure
Phi^*=(3.33+-0.19)x10^-6, Log(L^*)=44.65+-0.65 and alpha=-1.35+-0.84 as an
average over the redshifts we probe. These values are significantly different
than the typical Schechter parameters measured for the Lya LF of high-z
star-forming LAEs. This suggests that z>2 AGN/QSOs (likely dominant in our
samples) are described by a structurally different LF than z>2 star-forming
LAEs, namely with L^*_QSOs ~ 100 L^*_LAEs and Phi^*_QSOs ~ 10^-3 Phi^*_LAEs.
Finally, our method identifies very efficiently as high-z line-emitters sources
without previous spectroscopic confirmation, currently classified as stars
(~2000 objects in each redshift bin, on average). Assuming a large predominance
of Lya-emitting AGN/QSOs in our samples, this supports the scenario by which

certain states enable an agent to do certain actions, in the context of

who learn and plan in Markov Decision Processes. Affordances play a dual role
in this case. On one hand, they allow faster planning, by reducing the number
of actions available in any given situation. On the other hand, they facilitate
more efficient and precise learning of transition models from data, especially
when such models require function approximation. We establish these properties
through theoretical results as well as illustrative examples. We also propose
an approach to learn affordances and use it to estimate transition models that
are simpler and generalize better.

terms of alcove walks. The formula immediately shows that the SSV polynomials
satisfy a triangularity property with respect to a version of the Bruhat order,
which in turn gives an independent proof that the SSV polynomials are a basis
for the space of Laurent polynomials. The result is also used to show that the
SSV polynomials have \emph{fewer} terms than the corresponding Macdonald

generalization of the permuted basement Macdonald polynomials. We then
construct a symmetrized variant of the SSV polynomials: these are symmetric
with respect to a conjugate of the Chinta-Gunnells Weyl group action and reduce
to symmetric Macdonald polynomials when $n=1$. We obtain an alcove walk formula
for the symmetrized polynomials as well. Finally, we calculate the
$q\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ limits of the SSV polynomials and
observe that our combinatorial formula can be written in terms of alcove walks
with only positive and negative folds respectively. In both of these $q$-limit

  learning",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning expressive probabilistic models correctly describing the data is a
ubiquitous problem in machine learning. A popular approach for solving it is
mapping the observations into a representation space with a simple joint
distribution, which can typically be written as a product of its marginals --
thus drawing a connection with the field of nonlinear independent component
analysis. Deep density models have been widely used for this task, but their
maximum likelihood based training requires estimating the log-determinant of
the Jacobian and is computationally expensive, thus imposing a trade-off
between computation and expressive power. In this work, we propose a new
approach for exact training of such neural networks. Based on relative
gradients, we exploit the matrix structure of neural network parameters to
compute updates efficiently even in high-dimensional spaces; the computational
cost of the training is quadratic in the input size, in contrast with the cubic
scaling of naive approaches. This allows fast training with objective functions
involving the log-determinant of the Jacobian, without imposing constraints on
its structure, in stark contrast to autoregressive normalizing flows.

Recently,
increasing attention has been paid on graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim
to model the local graph structures and capture the hierarchical patterns by
aggregating the information from neighbors with stackable network modules.
Motivated by the observation that different nodes often require different
iterations of aggregation to fully capture the structural information, in this
paper, we propose to explicitly sample diverse iterations of aggregation for
different nodes to boost the performance of GNNs. It is a challenging task to
develop an effective aggregation strategy for each node, given complex graphs
and sparse features. Moreover, it is not straightforward to derive an efficient
algorithm since we need to feed the sampled nodes into different number of
network layers. To address the above challenges, we propose Policy-GNN, a
meta-policy framework that models the sampling procedure and message passing of
GNNs into a combined learning process. Specifically, Policy-GNN uses a
meta-policy to adaptively determine the number of aggregations for each node.
The meta-policy is trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL) by exploiting
the feedback from the model. We further introduce parameter sharing and a
buffer mechanism to boost the training efficiency. Experimental results on
three real-world benchmark datasets suggest that Policy-GNN significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives, showing the promise in
aggregation optimization for GNNs.

efficiency. However, we show that making DNNs compact has indirect and subtle
implications which are not well-understood. Reducing the number of parameters

1.4 to 32.8. Further, the ""memory-footprint to model size ratio"" ranges between
15 to 443. This shows that a higher number of activations causes large memory
footprint which increases on-chip/off-chip data movements. Furthermore, these
parameter-reducing techniques reduce the arithmetic intensity which increases
on-chip/off-chip memory bandwidth requirement. Due to these factors, the energy
efficiency of compact DNNs may be significantly reduced which is against the

  We further connect congruences of modular forms in the Eisenstein subspace

representation that is independent of the specific choice of the one-hot
encoding permits inductive reasoning and leads to better generalization
properties. Experimentally, our model can predict various graph topological

heat intergalactic gas if HII regions within galaxies are recombination bound,
or cool the gas faster than by adiabatic expansion if reddened by winds
internal to the haloes. In some cases, differential 21-cm antenna temperatures
near $-500$ mK may be achieved at $15<z<25$, similar to the signature detected
by the EDGES 21-cm cosmic dawn experiment.

video sequence by analysing their style of walking or limb movement. However,
this identification is generally sensitive to appearance changes and
conventional feature descriptors such as Gait Energy Image (GEI) lose some of
the dynamic information in the gait sequence. Active Energy Image (AEI) focuses
more on dynamic motion changes than GEI and is more suited to deal with
appearance changes. We propose a new approach, which allows recognizing people
by analysing the dynamic motion variations and identifying people without using
a database of predicted changes. In the proposed method, the active energy
image is calculated by averaging the difference frames of the silhouette
sequence and divided into multiple segments. Affine moment invariants are
computed as gait features for each section. Next, matching weights are
calculated based on the similarity between extracted features and those in the
database. Finally, the subject is identified by the weighted combination of
similarities in all segments. The CASIA-B Gait Database is used as the
principal dataset for the experimental analysis.

autonomous driving to accomplish the task of driving between lane markings

unseen test roads in both simulation and on a real Jackal robot. The novel
predictive representation is learned by general value functions (GVFs) to
provide out-of-policy, or counter-factual, predictions of future lane

learning improve learning efficiency, smoothness of control and generalization
to roads that the agent was never shown during training, including damaged lane

of several predictions over different time scales, or discount factors,
improves the performance and smoothness of the control substantially. The
Jackal robot was trained in a two step process where the predictive
representation is learned first followed by a batch reinforcement learning

multiplexed gas-phase spectroscopy has remained inaccessible to such devices,
because of their large line spacing, their small number of usable comb lines,
the intensity variations between their comb lines, and their limited photonic

drawbacks that hinder or limit their potential. The most deleterious ones are
heavy weight, high bulk recombination, lack of photon confinement and an
increase of the heat absorption. The use of thinned Ge substrates is herein
proposed as a possible solution to the aforementioned challenges. The potential
of a thinned Ge subcell inside a standard GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple-junction
solar cell is assessed by simulations, pointing to an optimum thickness around
5-10 {\mu}m. This would reduce the weight by more than 90 %, whereas the
available current for the Ge subcell would decrease only by 5 %. In addition,
the heat absorption for wavelengths beyond 1600 nm would decrease by more than
85 %. The performance of such a device is highly influenced by the front and
back surface recombination of the p-n junction. Simulations remark that good
back surface passivation is mandatory to avoid losing power generation by
thinning the substrate. In contrast, it has been found that front surface
recombination lowers the power generation in a similar manner for thin and
thick solar cells. Therefore, the benefits of thinning the substrate are not
limited by the front surface recombination. Finally, Ge single-junction solar
cells thinned down to 85 {\mu}m by wet etching processes are demonstrated. The
feasibility of the thinning process is supported by the limited losses measured
in the current generation (less than 6 %) and generated voltage (4 %) for the
thinnest solar cell manufactured.

helium proceeding via two theoretically well understood processes, namely the
$pp$ chain and the CNO cycle. Neutrinos emitted along such fusion processes in
the solar core are the only direct probe of the deep interior of the star. A
complete spectroscopy of neutrinos from the {\it pp} chain, producing about
99\% of the solar energy, has already been performed \cite{bib:Nature-2018}.
Here, we report the direct observation, with a high statistical significance,
of neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle in the Sun. This is the first
experimental evidence of this process obtained with the unprecedentedly
radio-pure large-volume liquid-scintillator Borexino detector located at the
underground Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The main difficulty
of this experimental effort is to identify the excess of the few counts per day
per 100 tonnes of target due to CNO neutrino interactions above the
backgrounds. A novel method to constrain the rate of \bi contaminating the
scintillator relies on the thermal stabilisation of the detector achieved over
the past 5 years. In the CNO cycle, the hydrogen fusion is catalyzed by the
carbon (C) - nitrogen (N) - oxygen (O) and thus its rate, as well as the flux
of emitted CNO neutrinos, directly depends on the abundance of these elements
in solar core. Therefore, this result paves the way to a direct measurement of
the solar metallicity by CNO neutrinos. While this result quantifies the
relative contribution of the CNO fusion in the Sun to be of the order of 1\%,
this process is dominant in the energy production of massive stars. The
occurrence of the primary mechanism for the stellar conversion of hydrogen into
helium in the Universe has been proven.

stars. As a result, the best observable terrestrial exoplanets have vastly
different climates than Earth, with a large dayside-to-nightside irradiation
contrast and relatively slow rotation. Hurricanes may affect future
observations of terrestrial exoplanets because they enhance the vertical
transport of water vapor and could influence ocean heat transport. In this
work, we explore how the environment of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf
stars affects the favorability of hurricane genesis (formation). To do so, we
apply metrics developed to understand hurricane genesis on Earth to
three-dimensional climate models of ocean-covered exoplanets orbiting M dwarf
stars. We find that hurricane genesis is most favorable on
intermediate-rotating tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with rotation
periods of $\sim 8-10~\mathrm{days}$. As a result, hurricane genesis is most
favorable for terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones of late-type M
dwarf stars. The peak in the favorability of hurricane genesis at intermediate
rotation occurs because sufficient spin is required for hurricane genesis, but
the vertical wind shear on fast-rotating terrestrial exoplanets disrupts
hurricane genesis. We find that hurricane genesis is less favorable on slowly
rotating terrestrial exoplanets, which agrees with previous work. Future work
using simulations that resolve hurricane genesis and evolution can test our
expectations for how the environment affects the favorability of hurricane
genesis on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets.

timescales of a few hours. Other infrared data sets also show large-amplitude
variability from this source at earlier epochs but do not show significant
variability in recent data. We do not expect red supergiants to vary by
$\sim50\%$ in luminosity over these short timescales, indicating that the
variability should be powered by the compact object. However, the X-ray
luminosity of this system is typically $\sim1000\times$ less than the variable
luminosity in the infrared and falls below the Chandra detection limit. While
X-ray reprocessing can produce large-amplitude fast infrared variability, it
typically requires L$_{{\mathrm{X}}} >> $ L$_{\mathrm{IR,var}}$ to do so,
indicating that another process must be at work. We suggest that this system
may be a supergiant fast X-ray transient (SFXT), and that a large
($\sim10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$), fast ($10^{2-4}$ s) X-ray flare could explain
the rapid IR variability and lack of a long-lasting X-ray outburst detection.
SFXTs are normally associated with blue supergiant companions, so if confirmed,
XID 6592 would be the first red supergiant SFXT, as well as the second X-ray
red supergiant binary.

system size, we are able to determine the convergence point of the Lee-Yang
zeros in the thermodynamic limit and thereby predict the occurrence of a phase
transition. The cumulant method is attractive from an experimental point of
view since it uses fluctuations of measurable quantities, such as the
magnetization in a spin lattice, and it can be applied to a variety of
equilibrium and non-equilibrium problems. We show that the Lee-Yang zeros
encode important information about the rare fluctuations of the magnetization.
Specifically, by using a simple ansatz for the free energy, we express the
large-deviation function of the magnetization in terms of Lee-Yang zeros. This
result may hold for many systems that exhibit a first-order phase transition.

sub-word and word recognition neural networks with top-down cognitive word
context expectations. The utility of this context appropriate collaboration is
substantial savings in recognition time, accuracy and cortical neural
processing resources. Repetition priming, the simplest form of context
facilitation, has been studied extensively, but behavioral and cognitive
neuroscience research has failed to produce a common shared model. Facilitation
is attributed to temporary lowered word recognition thresholds. Recent fMRI
evidence identifies frontal, prefrontal, left temporal cortex interactions as
the source of this priming bias. Five experiments presented here clearly
demonstrate that word recognition facilitation is a bias effect. Context-Biased
Fast Accurate Recognition, a recurrent neural network model, shows how this
anticipatory bias is accomplished by interactions among top-down conceptual
cognitive networks and bottom-up lexical word recognition networks. Signal
detection theory says that this facilitation bias is offset by the cost of
miss-recognizing similar, but different words. However, the prime typically
creates a temporary time-space recognition window within which probability of
prime recurrence is substantially raised paradoxically transforming bias into
sensitivity.

one to study continuous and univalued interfaces, but which was up to now one
of the most successful tools to treat interfaces analytically. To establish the

an uplink cell-free network with centralized, semi-distributed, and fully
distributed processing, all based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). First,
we propose a fully centralized beamforming method that uses the deep
deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG) with continuous space. We then
enhance this method by enabling distributed experience at access points (AP).
Indeed, we develop a beamforming scheme that uses the distributed
distributional deterministic policy gradients algorithm (D4PG) with the APs
representing the distributed agents. Finally, to decrease the computational
complexity, we propose a fully distributed beamforming scheme that divides the
beamforming computations among APs. The results show that the D4PG scheme with
distributed experience achieves the best performance irrespective of the
network size. Furthermore, the proposed distributed beamforming technique
performs better than the DDPG algorithm with centralized learning only for
small-scale networks. The performance superiority of the DDPG model becomes
more evident as the number of APs and/or users increases. Moreover, during the
operation stage, all DRL models demonstrate a significantly shorter processing
time than that of the conventional gradient descent (GD) solution.

in an elastic way, much as a ball of tangled elastic strings responds
elastically to an impulse. Furthermore, a tangled field should support the
propagation of `magnetoelastic waves', the isotropic analogue of Alfv\'en waves
on a straight magnetic field. Here, we study magnetoelasticity in the idealised
context of an equilibrium tangled field configuration. In contrast to previous
treatments, we explicitly account for intermittency of the Maxwell stress, and
show that this intermittency necessarily decreases the frequency of
magnetoelastic waves in a stable field configuration. We develop a mean-field
formalism to describe magnetoelastic behaviour, retaining leading-order
corrections due to the coupling of large- and small-scale motions, and solve
the initial-value problem for viscous fluids subjected to a large-scale shear,
showing that the development of small-scale motions results in anomalous
viscous damping of large-scale waves. Finally, we test these analytic
predictions using numerical simulations of standing waves on tangled, linear

topics, the efficiency of the different processes driving the evolution of

distribution of the galaxies is fitted with the ""Code Investigating GALaxies

formation rate are estimated. For some of the dwarf galaxies, the metal and gas

We show that i) a top-heavy initial mass function that favours massive stars
and a dust condensation fraction for Type II Supernovae (SNe II) of 50% or more
help to reproduce the peak of sMdust observed after 100 Myrs since the
beginning of the cycle; ii) galactic outflows play a crucial role in
reproducing the decline in sMdust with age, and they are more efficient than
grain destruction from SNe II; iii) a star formation efficiency (mass of gas

addresses the challenging memory access patterns of traditional MCRT
algorithms, which hinder optimal performance of MCRT simulations on modern
hardware with a complex memory architecture. (Methods) We reformulate the MCRT
photon packet life cycle as a task-based algorithm, whereby the computation is
broken down into small tasks that are executed concurrently. Photon packets are
stored in intermediate buffers, and tasks propagate photon packets through
small parts of the computational domain, moving them from one buffer to another
in the process. (Results) Using the implementation of the new algorithm in the
photoionization MCRT code CMacIonize 2.0, we show that the decomposition of the
MCRT grid into small parts leads to a significant performance gain during the
photon packet propagation phase, which constitutes the bulk of an MCRT
algorithm, as a result of better usage of memory caches. Our new algorithm is a
factor 2 to 4 faster than an equivalent traditional algorithm and shows good
strong scaling up to 30 threads. We briefly discuss how our new algorithm could
be adjusted or extended to other astrophysical MCRT applications. (Conclusions)
We show that optimising the memory access patterns of a memory-bound algorithm
such as MCRT can yield significant performance gains.

potential impact on CMB observables. We show that an approximate ""isospin""

sufficiently the masses of the other states to suppress strongly their relic

remains efficient in setting the dark matter relic density, while CMB
constraints on unstable relics can be robustly avoided. We also consider the
phenomenological consequences of isospin breaking, including dark matter decay.
Cosmological, astrophysical, and terrestrial probes are combined into a global
picture of the parameter space. In addition, we outline an ultraviolet
completion in the context of neutral naturalness, where confinement at the GeV
scale is generic. We emphasize the general applicability of several novel
features of the SIMP mechanism that we discuss here.

this exponential ramp in terms of a high-dimensional manifold of saddle points

arises because the theory enjoys a large symmetry group. With finite

be probed directly using either ground- or space-based telescopes due to the
high cross-section for interaction of EUV photons with the interstellar medium.
This makes EUV spectra poorly constrained. The mm/submm recombination lines of
H and He, which can be observed from the ground, can serve as a reliable probe
of the EUV. Here we present a study based on ALMA observations of three
Galactic ultra-compact HII regions and the starburst region Sgr B2(M), in which
we reconstruct the key parameters of the EUV spectra using mm recombination
lines of HI, HeI and HeII. We find that in all cases the EUV spectra between
13.6 and 54.4 eV have similar frequency dependence: L_{\nu}~ \nu^{-4.5 +/-
0.4}. We compare the inferred values of the EUV spectral slopes with the values
expected for a purely single stellar evolution model (Starburst99) and the
Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code (BPASS). We find that the
observed spectral slope differs from the model predictions. This may imply that
the fraction of interacting binaries in HII regions is substantially lower than
assumed in BPASS. The technique demonstrated here allows one to deduce the EUV

subtle due to their large backreaction effects. In the context of 4d

We argue that, if interpreted from the EFT viewpoint, the 4d backreaction of
these objects translates into a classical RG flow of their couplings.
Constraints on the UV charges and tensions get then translated to constraints
on the axionic kinetic terms and scalar potential of the EFT. This uncovers new
relations among the Swampland Conjectures, which become interconnected by the
physical properties of low-codimension objects. In particular, using that

have radio luminosities $P_{\mathrm{1.4GHz}}$ > 1.6$\times$10$^{24}$ W
Hz$^{-1}$. The typical host galaxies are among the highest stellar mass
galaxies in the cluster. The exceptional radio activity among the massive
galaxy population appears to be linked to the dynamical state of the cluster.
The galaxy distribution suggests an ongoing merger, with a subgroup found to
the northwest of the main cluster. Further, two of the five sources are
classified as bent-tail sources with one being a potential wide-angle tail
(WAT)/hybrid morphology radio source (HyMoRS) indicating a dynamic environment.
The cluster also lies in a region of the mass-richness plane occupied by other
merging clusters in the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS).
The data suggest that during the merger phase radio activity can be
dramatically enhanced, which would contribute to the observed trend of
increased radio activity in clusters with increasing redshift.

paper, we use 3D dust radiative transfer to model the sub-mm emission from
galaxies in the SIMBA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, and compare
predictions to the latest single-dish observational constraints on the
abundance of 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$-selected sources. We find good agreement with
the shape of the integrated 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$ luminosity function, and the
normalisation is within 0.25 dex at $> 3 \; \mathrm{mJy}$, unprecedented for a
fully cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, along with good agreement in the
redshift distribution of bright SMGs. The agreement is driven primarily by
SIMBA's good match to infrared measures of the star formation rate (SFR)
function between $z = 2-4$ at high SFRs. Also important is the self-consistent
on-the-fly dust model in SIMBA, which predicts, on average, higher dust masses
(by up to a factor of 2.5) compared to using a fixed dust-to-metals ratio of
0.3. We construct a lightcone to investigate the effect of far-field blending,
and find that 52% of sources are blends of multiple components, which makes a
small contribution to the normalisation of the bright-end of the number counts.
We provide new fits to the 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$ luminosity as a function of SFR
and dust mass. Our results demonstrate that exotic solutions to the discrepancy
between sub-mm counts in simulations and observations, such as a top-heavy IMF,
are unnecessary, and that sub-millimetre-bright phases are a natural
consequence of massive galaxy evolution.

to relatively small production cross-sections a comparably light EW sector of

magnetic moment of the muon, $(g-2)_\mu$, and its Standard Model (SM)
prediction. Under the assumption that the $\tilde \chi_1^0$ provides the full
DM relic abundance we first analyze which mass ranges of neutralinos, charginos
and scalar leptons are in agreement with all experimental data, including
relevant LHC searches. We find an upper limit of $\sim 600$ GeV for the LSP and
NLSP masses. In a second step we assume that the new result of the Run 1 of the
``MUON G-2'' collaboration at Fermilab yields a precision comparable to the
existing experimental result with the same central value. We analyze the
potential impact of the combination of the Run 1 data with the existing
$(g-2)_\mu$ data on the allowed MSSM parameter space. We find that in this case
the upper limits on the LSP and NLSP masses are substantially reduced by
roughly $100$ GeV. This would yield improved upper limits on these masses of
$\sim 500$ GeV. In this way, a clear target could be set for future LHC EW

observations. Here we use the high-resolution ARTEMIS cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation suite of 42 Milky Way-mass halos to explore the
spatial and kinematical distributions of the DM in the solar neighbourhood, and
we examine how these quantities are influenced by substructures, baryons, the
presence of dark discs, as well as general halo-to-halo scatter (cosmic
variance). We also explore the accuracy of the standard Maxwellian approach for
modelling the velocity distribution function. We find significant halo-to-halo
scatter in the density and velocity functions which, if propagated through the
standard halo model for predicting the DM detection limits, implies a
significant scatter about the typically quoted limit. We also show that, in
general, the Maxwellian approximation works relatively well for simulations
that include the important gravitational effects of baryons, but is less
accurate for collisionless (DM-only) simulations. Given the significant
halo-to-halo scatter in quantities relevant for DM direct detection, we
advocate propagating this source of uncertainty through in order to derive

its rapid and simultaneous spread to the neighboring and distantly located
countries. To gain the systems level understanding of the role of global

the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2
termed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the travel history of country wise
index-cases using government press releases, their official social media
handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a
spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges
and follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a
novel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for
stochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A
peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a
fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the
average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF
realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found
that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of
countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no
spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the
superspreaders that have very quickly transported the virus, through multiple

are more luminous in more massive hosts with luminosity offsets ranging between
$-0.07 \pm0.03$ mag to $-0.15\pm0.04$ mag after light-curve standardization.
The slope of the SN~Ia Hubble residual-host mass relation is negative across
all $uBgVriYJH$ bands with values ranging between $-0.036\pm 0.025$ mag/dex to
$-0.097\pm 0.027$ mag/dex -- implying that SNe~Ia in more massive galaxies are
brighter than expected. The near-constant observed correlations across optical

the observed luminosity offset--host mass correlation. We measure projected
separations between SNe~Ia and their host centers, and find that SNe~Ia that
explode beyond a projected 10 kpc have a $\rm 30\% \ to \ 50\%$ reduction of
the dispersion in Hubble residuals across all bands -- making them a more
uniform subset of SNe~Ia. Dust in host galaxies, peculiar velocities of nearby
SN~Ia, or a combination of both may drive this result as the color excesses of
SNe~Ia beyond 10 kpc are found to be generally lower than those interior, but
there is also a diminishing trend of the dispersion as we exclude nearby
events. We do not find that SN~Ia average luminosity varies significantly when
they are grouped in various host morphological types. Host galaxy data from
this work will be useful, in conjunction with future high-redshift samples, in
constraining cosmological parameters.

probability kernel $G(\phi \mapsto \phi')$ as an involutive (i.e.,
self-inverting) deterministic function $f(\phi, \pi)$ on an enlarged state

volume preserving, and how to use deep volume-preserving involutive generative
models to make valid Metropolis-Hastings updates based on an auxiliary variable
scheme with an easy-to-calculate acceptance ratio. We prove that deep
involutive generative models and their volume-preserving special case are
universal approximators for probability kernels. This result implies that with
enough network capacity and training time, they can be used to learn
arbitrarily complex MCMC updates. We define a loss function and optimization
algorithm for training parameters given simulated data. We also provide initial
experiments showing that Involutive Neural MCMC can efficiently explore
multi-modal distributions that are intractable for Hybrid Monte Carlo, and can
converge faster than A-NICE-MC, a recently introduced neural MCMC technique.

This requires models that perform well and train quickly, without large amounts

from weak supervision (WS), wherein models can be trained with noisy sources of
signal instead of hand-labeled data. But WS relies on training downstream deep
networks to extrapolate to unseen data points, which can take hours or days.
Pre-trained embeddings can remove this requirement. We do not use the
embeddings as features as in transfer learning (TL), which requires fine-tuning
for high performance, but instead use them to define a distance function on the
data and extend WS source votes to nearby points. Theoretically, we provide a
series of results studying how performance scales with changes in source
coverage, source accuracy, and the Lipschitzness of label distributions in the
embedding space, and compare this rate to standard WS without extension and TL
without fine-tuning. On six benchmark NLP and video tasks, our method
outperforms WS without extension by 4.1 points, TL without fine-tuning by 12.8

because the asteroid belt has evolved since the time of asteroid formation
through mechanisms that include: (1) catastrophic collisions, (2) rotational
disruption, (3) chaotic orbital evolution and (4) orbital evolution driven by
Yarkovsky radiation forces. The timescales of these loss mechanisms are
uncertain and there is a need for more observational constraints. In the inner
main belt, the mean size of the non-family asteroids increases with increasing
inclination. Here, we use that observation to show that all inner main belt
asteroids originate from either the known families or from ghost families, that
is, old families with dispersed orbital elements. We estimate that the average
age of the asteroids in the ghost families is a factor of 1/3 less than the
Yarkovsky orbital evolution timescale. However, this orbital evolution
timescale is a long-term average that must allow for the collisional evolution
of the asteroids and for stochastic changes in their spin directions. By
applying these constraints on the orbital evolution timescales to the evolution
of the size-frequency distribution of the Vesta asteroid family, we estimate
that the age of this family is greater than 1.3 $Gyr$ and could be comparable
with the age of the solar system. By estimating the number of ghost families,
we calculate that the number of asteroids that are the root sources of the
meteorites and the near-Earth asteroids that originate from the inner main belt
is about 20.

various ways. Examples of such systems are networks of computing nodes, which
the nodes interact by exchanging workload, for instance, for load balancing
purposes. In this paper, we first study the Influence Model, a networked Markov
chain framework, for modeling network interactions and discuss two key
limitations of this model, which cause it to fall short in modeling
constraint-based and dynamic interactions in networks. Next, we propose the
Dynamic and Constraint-based Influence Model (DCIM) to alleviate the
limitations. The DCIM extends the application of the Influence Model to more
general network interaction scenarios. In this paper, the proposed DCIM is
successfully applied to stochastic modeling of load balancing in networks of
computing nodes allowing for prediction of the load distribution in the system,
which is a novel application for the Influence Model. The DCIM is further used
to identify the optimum workload distribution policy for load balancing in
networked computing systems.

using supervoxel-based masking instead of random masking, and also by focusing
on the area to be segmented in the primary task, which we term as the

learn semantics that are more attuned to the primary task, and test our

proposed for the numerical solution of the shallow water equations with

simulation of perturbation waves over the lake-at-rest steady state such as
waves on a lake or tsunami waves in the deep ocean. To ensure the well-balance
and positivity-preserving properties, strategies are discussed in the use of
slope limiting, positivity-preservation limiting, and data transferring between
meshes. Particularly, it is suggested that a DG-interpolation scheme be used
for the interpolation of both the flow variables and bottom topography from the
old mesh to the new one and after each application of the
positivity-preservation limiting on the water depth, a high-order correction be
made to the approximation of the bottom topography according to the
modifications in the water depth. Moreover, mesh adaptation based on the
equilibrium variable and water depth is shown to give more desirable results
than that based on the commonly used entropy function. Numerical examples in
one and two spatial dimensions are presented to demonstrate the well-balance

clinical outcomes faces a looming obstacle: model interpretation. Without
description of how outputs are generated, a collaborating physician can neither
resolve when the model's conclusions are in conflict with his or her own, nor
learn to anticipate model behavior. Current research aims to interpret networks
that diagnose ECG recordings, which has great potential impact as recordings
become more personalized and widely deployed. A generalizable impact beyond
ECGs lies in the ability to provide a rich test-bed for the development of
interpretive techniques in medicine. Interpretive techniques for Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs), however, tend to be heuristic and observational in nature,
lacking the mathematical rigor one might expect in the analysis of math
equations. The motivation of this paper is to offer a third option, a
scientific approach. We treat the model output itself as a phenomenon to be
explained through component parts and equations governing their behavior. We
argue that these component parts should also be ""black boxes"" --additional
targets to interpret heuristically with clear functional connection to the
original. We show how to rigorously factor a DNN into a hierarchical equation
consisting of black box variables. This is not a subdivision into physical
parts, like an organism into its cells; it is but one choice of an equation
into a collection of abstract functions. Yet, for DNNs trained to identify
normal ECG waveforms on PhysioNet 2017 Challenge data, we demonstrate this
choice yields interpretable component models identified with visual composite
sketches of ECG samples in corresponding input regions. Moreover, the recursion
distills this interpretation: additional factorization of component black boxes
corresponds to ECG partitions that are more morphologically pure.

Well, almost",,"Journal of Machine Learning Research, 22 79 (2021), 1-64",,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Overparameterised deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly expressive and so
can, in principle, generate almost any function that fits a training dataset
with zero error. The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on
unseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This
success suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards
functions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this
inductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the
probability $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a
function $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes
to estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\mid S)$ that the DNN
expresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$.
  Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with
$P_B(f\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and
low complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the
parameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\mid S)$), rather than a special
property of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in
the overparameterised regime.
  While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\mid S)$ is the
first order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$, there remain second order
differences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability
picture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\mid S)$ and/or $P_B(f\mid S)$, can shed new light
on the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as
batch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.

concerning the lack of curvature of the universe, and the homogeneity problem,
questioning why the universe is almost isotropic despite having regions that
are causally disconnected. These problems served as motivation for the theory
of inflation, which suggests a period of exponential expansion in the early
universe, and the inflationary origin of the universe can be traced by B-mode
polarization. In an effort to better understand the potential foreground
systematics, especially the levels of polarized dust emission, we queried the
Heiles catalog to produce a list of starlight polarization data in the
so-called ""Southern Hole"", which is an approximately $20\times20$ degree region
centered at RA: $00^h12^m00^s$ and DEC: $-59{\deg}18'00''$ that is being
examined by multiple CMB polarization experiments. Because magnetic field tends
to dictate the orientation of dust grains, which in turn determines how
starlight is polarized, starlight polarization can be used to trace magnetic
fields. Therefore, to improve our understanding of the properties of this
region, we used this catalog, along with Gaia data as tracers of the
three-dimensional distribution of dust, as a potential indicator of magnetic
field orientation throughout the galaxy in the Southern Hole region. We then
analyzed these data with the hope that magnetic field data can be used to
create a template to aid in subtracting away the contamination of CMB B-mode

models (GMMs) with equal covariance matrices in the low signal-to-noise regime.
The expansion reveals an intimate connection between two types of algorithms
for parameter estimation: the method of moments and likelihood optimizing
algorithms such as Expectation-Maximization (EM). We show that likelihood
optimization in the low SNR regime reduces to a sequence of least squares
optimization problems that match the moments of the estimate to the ground
truth moments one by one. This connection is a stepping stone toward the
analysis of EM and maximum likelihood estimation in a wide range of models. A
motivating application for the study of low SNR mixture models is cryo-electron

imposed on the mixture centers. We discuss the application of our expansion to
algebraically constrained GMMs, among other example models of interest.

the magnetic field in the dusty Galactic disk using near-infrared stellar
polarimetry. All GPIPS observations were completed using the 1.83 m Perkins
telescope and Mimir instrument. GPIPS observations surveyed 76 sq-deg of the
northern Galactic plane, from Galactic longitudes 18 to 56 deg and latitudes -1
to +1 deg, in the H-band (1.6 um). Surveyed stars span 7th to 16th mag,
resulting in nearly 10 million stars with measured linear polarizations. Of
these stars, ones with m_H < 12.5 mag and polarization percentage uncertainties
under 2% were judged to be high quality and number over one million. GPIPS data
reveal plane-of-sky magnetic field orientations for numerous interstellar
clouds for AV values to ~30 mag. The average sky separation of stars with m_H <
12.5 mag is about 30arcsec, or about 60 per Planck polarization resolution
element. Matching to Gaia DR2 showed the brightest GPIPS stars are red giants
with distances in the 0.6-7.5 kpc range. Polarization orientations are mostly
parallel to the Galactic disk, with some zones showing significant orientation
departures. Changes in orientations are stronger as a function of Galactic
longitude than of latitude. Considered at 10 arcmin angular scales, directions
that show the greatest polarization fractions and narrowest polarization
position angle distributions are confined to about ten large, coherent
structures that are not correlated with star forming clouds. The GPIPS
polarimetric and photometric data products (Data Release 4 catalogs and images)
are publicly available for over 13million stars.

inference, MILP solvers are purely CPU-based. This severely limits its
application as many practitioners may not have access to high-end GPUs. In this
work, we ask two key questions. First, in a more realistic setting where only a
CPU is available, is the GNN model still competitive? Second, can we devise an
alternate computationally inexpensive model that retains the predictive power
of the GNN architecture? We answer the first question in the negative, and
address the second question by proposing a new hybrid architecture for
efficient branching on CPU machines. The proposed architecture combines the
expressive power of GNNs with computationally inexpensive multi-layer
perceptrons (MLP) for branching. We evaluate our methods on four classes of
MILP problems, and show that they lead to up to 26% reduction in solver running
time compared to state-of-the-art methods without a GPU, while extrapolating to
harder problems than it was trained on. The code for this project is publicly

probability measures over a semi-discrete space $\mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathcal{G}$ where $\mathcal{G}$ is a finite weighted graph. With such
Riemmanian structure in hand, we derive formal expressions for the gradient
flow of a relative entropy functional, as well as second order dynamics for the
optimization of said energy. Then, with the aim of providing a rigorous
motivation for the gradient flow equations derived formally, we also consider
an iterative procedure known as minimizing movement scheme (i.e., Implicit
Euler scheme, or JKO scheme) and apply it to the relative entropy with respect
to a suitable cost function. For some specific choices of metric and cost, we
rigorously show that the minimizing movement scheme of the relative entropy
functional converges to the gradient flow process provided by the formal
Riemannian structure. This flow coincides with a system of reaction-diffusion
equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$.

We show that attention: (1) captures the folding structure of proteins,
connecting amino acids that are far apart in the underlying sequence, but
spatially close in the three-dimensional structure, (2) targets binding sites,
a key functional component of proteins, and (3) focuses on progressively more
complex biophysical properties with increasing layer depth. We find this

medical data. To circumvent this, one may build rule-based or other
expert-knowledge driven labelers to ingest data and yield silver labels absent
any ground-truth training data. One popular such labeler is CheXpert, a labeler
that produces diagnostic labels for chest X-ray radiology reports. CheXpert is
very useful, but is relatively computationally slow, especially when integrated
with end-to-end neural pipelines, is non-differentiable so can't be used in any
applications that require gradients to flow through the labeler, and does not
yield probabilistic outputs, which limits our ability to improve the quality of
the silver labeler through techniques such as active learning.
  In this work, we solve all three of these problems with
$\texttt{CheXpert++}$, a BERT-based, high-fidelity approximation to CheXpert.
$\texttt{CheXpert++}$ achieves 99.81\% parity with CheXpert, which means it can
be reliably used as a drop-in replacement for CheXpert, all while being
significantly faster, fully differentiable, and probabilistic in output. Error
analysis of $\texttt{CheXpert++}$ also demonstrates that $\texttt{CheXpert++}$
has a tendency to actually correct errors in the CheXpert labels, with
$\texttt{CheXpert++}$ labels being more often preferred by a clinician over
CheXpert labels (when they disagree) on all but one disease task. To further
demonstrate the utility of these advantages in this model, we conduct a
proof-of-concept active learning study, demonstrating we can improve accuracy
on an expert labeled random subset of report sentences by approximately 8\%
over raw, unaltered CheXpert by using one-iteration of active-learning inspired
re-training. These findings suggest that simple techniques in co-learning and
active learning can yield high-quality labelers under minimal, and controllable

single-parameter density profiles (such as the NFW profile) there exists a
one-to-one mapping between the energy of the halo and the scale radius of its
density profile. The energy therefore uniquely determines the concentration
parameter of such halos. We exploit this fact to predict the concentrations of
dark matter halos via a random walk in halo energy space. Given a full merger
tree for a halo, the total internal energy of each halo in that tree is
determined by summing the internal and orbital energies of progenitor halos. We
show that, when calibrated, this model can accurately reproduce the mean of the
concentration--mass relation measured in N-body simulations, and reproduces
more of the scatter in that relation than previous models. We further test this
model by examining both the autocorrelation of scale radii across time, and the
correlations between halo concentration and spin, and comparing to results
measured from cosmological N-body simulations. In both cases we find that our
model closely matches the N-body results. Our model is implemented within the

unequal intra-component coupling strengths or asymmetric trap frequencies, the
turbulent condensates undergo a dramatic decay dynamics to an interlaced array
of vortex-antidark structures, a quasi-equilibrium state, of like-signed
vortices with an extended size of the vortex core. The time of formation of
this state is shortened when the parameter asymmetry of the intra-component

the incompressible kinetic energy exhibits two noteworthy features: (i) a
$k^{-3}$ power-law around the range of the wave number determined by the spin

transitions from excited states to ground states, is well studied, but their
influence on hyperfine quenching in a reactant molecule is not known. Here, we
report on ultracold collision dynamics of the hydroxyl free-radical OH with Sr
atoms leading to quenching of OH hyperfine states. Our quantum-mechanical
calculations of this process reveal that quenching is efficient due to
anomalous molecular dynamics in the vicinity of the conical intersection at
collinear geometry. We observe wide scattering resonance features in both
elastic and inelastic rate coefficients at collision energies below k x 10 mK.
They are identified as either p- or d-wave shape resonances. We also describe
the electronic potentials relevant for these non-reactive collisions, their
diabatization procedure, as well as the non-adiabatic coupling between the
diabatic potentials near the CIs.

novel set of mean field master equations to describe the model for $F=2$ and
$F=3$ in complete graphs where all indirect interactions are explicitly

driven by initial conditions (set by parameter $Q$) and the size of the system

mechanisms: coherent curvature emission (CCE), beam-driven relativistic plasma
emission (RPE) and anomalous Doppler emission (ADE). We assume that the pulsar
plasma is one dimensional (1D), streaming outward with a bulk Lorentz factor
$\gamma_{\rm s} \gg \langle \gamma\rangle -1 \gtrsim 1$, where $\langle \gamma
\rangle $ is the intrinsic spread in the rest frame of the plasma. We argue
that the formation of beams in a multi-cloud model is ineffective in the
intrinsically relativistic case for plausible parameters, because the
overtaking takes too long. We argue that the default choice for the particle
distribution in the rest frame is a J{\""u}ttner distribution and that
relativistic streaming should be included by applying a Lorentz transformation
to the rest-frame distribution, rather than the widely assumed relativistically
streaming Gaussian distribution. We find that beam-driven wave growth is
severely restricted by (a) the wave properties in pulsar plasma, (b) a
separation condition between beam and background, and (c) the inhomogeneity of
the plasma in the pulsar frame. The growth rate for the kinetic instability is
much smaller and the bandwidth of the growing waves is much larger for a
J{\""u}ttner distribution than for a relativistically streaming Gaussian
distribution. No reactive instability occurs at all for a J{\""u}ttner
distribution. We conclude that none of CCE, RPE and ADE in tenable as the
generic pulsar radio emission mechanism for ``plausible'' assumptions about the
pulsar plasma.

the effective throughput result, numerical results demonstrate that the

a detailed understanding of the relationship between TMN NP properties and

localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) frequency, bandwidth, and extinction
of titanium nitride (TiN), zirconium nitride (ZrN), and hafnium nitride (HfN)
NPs were examined as a function of the particle size, surface oxidation, and
refractive index of the surrounding medium using finite element method (FEM). A
linear redshift in the LSPR frequency and a linear increase in the associated
full-width at half maximum (FWHM) was observed with increasing the particle
size, oxidation layer thickness, and medium refractive index. We show that the
effect of surface oxidation on plasmonic properties of TMN NPs is strongly

broadening in small NPs compared to larger NPs. Furthermore, the performance

lattice deviates from the perfect crystal structure. The presence of
dislocations transcends condensed matter research and gives rise to a diverse
range of emergent phenomena [1-6], ranging from geological effects [7] to light
emission from diodes [8]. Despite their ubiquity, to date, the controlled
formation of dislocations is usually achieved via strain fields, applied either
during growth [9,10] or retrospectively via deformation, e.g., (nano
[11-14])-indentation [15]. Here we show how partial dislocations can be induced
using local electric fields, altering the structure and electronic response of
the material where the field is applied. By combining high-resolution imaging
techniques and density functional theory calculations, we directly image these
dislocations in the ferroelectric hexagonal manganite Er(Ti,Mn)O3 and study
their impact on the local electric transport behaviour. The use of an electric
field to induce partial dislocations is a conceptually new approach to the
burgeoning field of emergent defect-driven phenomena and enables local property
control without the need of external macroscopic strain fields. This control is
an important step towards integrating and functionalising dislocations in
practical devices for future oxide electronics.

a segmented time frame as one data sample to model training. However, the sound
durations of sound events vary greatly depending on the sound event class,
e.g., the sound event ``fan'' has a long time duration, while the sound event
``mouse clicking'' is instantaneous. The difference in the time duration
between sound event classes thus causes a serious data imbalance problem in
SED. In this paper, we propose a method for SED using a duration robust loss
function, which can focus model training on sound events of short duration. In
the proposed method, we focus on a relationship between the duration of the
sound event and the ease/difficulty of model training. In particular, many
sound events of long duration (e.g., sound event ``fan'') are stationary
sounds, which have less variation in their acoustic features and their model
training is easy. Meanwhile, some sound events of short duration (e.g., sound
event ``object impact'') have more than one audio pattern, such as attack,
decay, and release parts. We thus apply a class-wise reweighting to the
binary-cross entropy loss function depending on the ease/difficulty of model
training. Evaluation experiments conducted using TUT Sound Events 2016/2017 and
TUT Acoustic Scenes 2016 datasets show that the proposed method respectively
improves the detection performance of sound events by 3.15 and 4.37 percentage

construction of disease signatures of diagnostic/prognostic value. However,
less attention has been given to understanding disease heterogeneity.
Semi-supervised clustering methods can address this problem by estimating
multiple transformations from a (e.g. healthy) control (CN) group to a patient
(PT) group, seeking to capture the heterogeneity of underlying pathlogic
processes. Herein, we propose a novel method, Smile-GANs (SeMi-supervIsed
cLustEring via GANs), for semi-supervised clustering, and apply it to brain MRI
scans. Smile-GANs first learns multiple distinct mappings by generating PT from
CN, with each mapping characterizing one relatively distinct pathological
pattern. Moreover, a clustering model is trained interactively with mapping
functions to assign PT into corresponding subtype memberships. Using relaxed
assumptions on PT/CN data distribution and imposing mapping non-linearity,
Smile-GANs captures heterogeneous differences in distribution between the CN
and PT domains. We first validate Smile-GANs using simulated data, subsequently
on real data, by demonstrating its potential in characterizing heterogeneity in
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal phases. The model was first trained
using baseline MRIs from the ADNI2 database and then applied to longitudinal
data from ADNI1 and BLSA. Four robust subtypes with distinct neuroanatomical
patterns were discovered: 1) normal brain, 2) diffuse atrophy atypical of AD,
3) focal medial temporal lobe atrophy, 4) typical-AD. Further longitudinal
analyses discover two distinct progressive pathways from prodromal to full AD:
i) subtypes 1 - 2 - 4, and ii) subtypes 1 - 3 - 4. Although demonstrated on an
important biomedical problem, Smile-GANs is general and can find application in

often do not satisfy the braiding relation known from 2D physics. We accomplish
a full description of relations between the generators for star graphs where we
derive certain quasi-braiding relations. We also describe how graph braid
groups depend on the (graph-theoretic) connectivity of the graph. This is done
in terms of quotients of graph braid groups where one-particle moves are put to
identity. In particular, we show that for $3$-connected planar graphs such a
quotient reconstructs the well-known planar braid group. For $2$-connected

formation in the post-reionization epoch ($z\lesssim 6$) by combining
cosmological simulation data with semi-analytical models. We find that due to
radiative feedback (i.e. Lyman-Werner and ionizing radiation) massive haloes
($M_{\rm halo}\gtrsim 10^{9}\ \rm M_{\odot}$) are the major ($\gtrsim 90$%)
hosts for potential Pop III star formation at $z\lesssim 6$, where dense
pockets of metal-poor gas may survive to form Pop III stars, under inefficient
mixing of metals released by supernovae. Metal mixing is the key process that
determines not only when Pop III star formation ends, but also the total mass,
$M_{\rm PopIII}$, of \textit{active} Pop III stars per host halo, which is a
crucial parameter for direct detection and identification of Pop III hosts.
Both aspects are still uncertain due to our limited knowledge of metal mixing
during structure formation. Current predictions range from early termination at
the end of reionization ($z\sim 5$) to continuous Pop III star formation
extended to $z=0$ at a non-negligible rate $\sim 10^{-7}\ \rm M_{\odot}\
yr^{-1}\ Mpc^{-3}$, with $M_{\rm PopIII}\sim 10^{3}-10^{6}\ \rm M_{\odot}$.
This leads to a broad range of redshift limits for direct detection of Pop III
hosts, $z_{\rm PopIII}\sim 0.5-12.5$, with detection rates $\lesssim 0.1-20\
\rm arcmin^{-2}$, for current and future space telescopes (e.g. HST, WFIRST and
JWST). Our model also predicts that the majority ($\gtrsim 90$%) of the cosmic
volume is occupied by metal-free gas. Measuring the volume filling fractions of
this metal-free phase can constrain metal mixing parameters and Pop III star
formation.

of the massive star-forming region W4 in the Cassiopeia OB6 association using
the Gaia Data Release 2 and high-resolution optical spectra. This star-forming
region is composed of a core cluster (IC 1805) and a stellar population
distributed over 20 pc, which is a typical structural feature found in many OB
associations. According to a classical model, this structural feature can be
understood in the context of the dynamical evolution of a star cluster. The
core-extended structure exhibits internally different kinematic properties.
Stars in the core have an almost isotropic motion, and they appear to reach
virial equilibrium given their velocity dispersion (0.9 +/- 0.3 km/s)
comparable to that in a virial state (~0.8 km/s). On the other hand, the
distributed population shows a clear pattern of radial expansion. From the
N-body simulation for the dynamical evolution of a model cluster in subvirial
state, we reproduce the observed structure and kinematics of stars. This model
cluster experiences collapse for the first 2 Myr. Some members begin to
radially escape from the cluster after the initial collapse, eventually forming
a distributed population. The internal structure and kinematics of the model
cluster appear similar to those of W4. Our results support the idea that the
stellar population distributed over 20 pc in W4 originate from the dynamical
evolution of IC 1805.

of our time. The absence of mass testing and the relevant presence of
asymptomatic individuals causes the available data of the COVID-19 pandemic in
Brazil to be largely under-reported regarding the number of infected
individuals and deaths. We propose an adapted Susceptible-Infected-Recovered
(SIR) model which explicitly incorporates the under-reporting and the response
of the population to public policies (such as confinement measures, widespread
use of masks, etc) to cast short-term and long-term predictions. Large amounts
of uncertainty could provide misleading models and predictions. In this paper,
we discuss the role of uncertainty in these prediction, which is illustrated
regarding three key aspects. First, assuming that the number of infected
individuals is under-reported, we demonstrate an anticipation regarding the
peak of infection. Furthermore, while a model with a single class of infected
individuals yields forecasts with increased peaks, a model that considers both
symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals suggests a decrease of the
peak of symptomatic. Second, considering that the actual amount of deaths is
larger than what is being register, then demonstrate the increase of the
mortality rates. Third, when consider generally under-reported data, we
demonstrate how the transmission and recovery rate model parameters change
qualitatively and quantitatively. We also investigate the effect of the
""COVID-19 under-reporting tripod"", i.e. the under-reporting in terms of
infected individuals, of deaths and the true mortality rate. If two of these
factors are known, the remainder can be inferred, as long as proportions are
kept constant. The proposed approach allows one to determine the margins of
uncertainty by assessments on the observed and true mortality rates.

properties. The key challenge is the lack of an inherent ordering or distance

latent-variable Gaussian process (LVGP) models to create multi-response LVGP

qualitative microstructure concepts and quantitative microstructure design
variables as mixed-variable inputs. The MR-LVGP model embeds the mixed

the responses, providing substantial insights into the interplay between
different geometrical classes and material parameters of microstructures. With
this model, we can easily obtain a continuous and differentiable transition
between different microstructure concepts that can render gradient information

multiscale topology optimization with aperiodic microstructures. Design
examples reveal that considering multiclass microstructures can lead to
improved performance due to the consistent load-transfer paths for micro- and

we propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep
generative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for
property prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database
to map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and
organized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE
provides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation
between microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in
geometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven
methods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and
multiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical
properties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by
simple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further
extended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of
mechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale
metamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly
generated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then
assembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure
compatibility between adjacent microstructures. We demonstrate our framework by
designing both functionally graded and heterogeneous metamaterial systems that
achieve desired distortion behaviors.

simulation as a function of stellar mass and environment at the present day.
The distribution with stellar mass is bimodal, separating star-forming and
quenched galaxies. The metallicity of gas and stars is self-consistently
calculated using a chemical evolution model that includes supernovae type II
and Ia, hypernovae, and asymptotic giant branch stars. The mass of oxygen lost
from each galaxy is calculated by comparing the existing oxygen in gas and
stars in the galaxy to the oxygen that should have been produced by the
present-day population of stars. More massive galaxies are able to retain a
greater fraction of their metals ($\sim 100$ per cent) than low-mass galaxies
($\sim 40 - 70$ per cent). As in the star formation main sequence, star-forming
galaxies follow a tight relationship also in terms of oxygen mass lost -- a
metal flow main sequence, ZFMS -- whereas massive quenched galaxies tend to
have lost a greater fraction of oxygen (up to 20 per cent), due to AGN-driven
winds. The amount of oxygen lost by satellite galaxies depends on the details
of their interaction history, and those in richer groups tend to have lost a
greater fraction of their oxygen. Observational estimates of metal retention in
galaxies will provide a strong constraint on models of galaxy evolution.

Although, researchers have addressed various aspects of the DNS in the

comprehensively understand the root causes of the vulnerabilities of DNS, it is
mandatory to review the various activities in the research community on DNS

which are published in both top conferences and journals in the last ten years,
and summarizes vulnerabilities in DNS and corresponding countermeasures. This
paper not only focuses on the DNS threat landscape and existing challenges, but
also discusses the utilized data analysis methods, which are frequently used to
address DNS threat vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we looked into the DNSthreat

variability of air quality changes in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic. We
focus on two federally regulated pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine
particulate matter (PM2.5). Observed concentrations at all available ground
monitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared
between April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the
baseline. Large statistically significant decreases in NO2 concentrations were
found at more than 65% of the monitoring sites, with an average drop of 2 ppb
when compared to the mean of the previous five years. The same patterns are
confirmed by satellite-derived NO2 column totals from NASA OMI. PM2.5
concentrations from the ground monitoring sites, however, were more likely to
be higher. The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses
of the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward
is that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most
dramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial
vehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged,
thus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a
correlation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people
were sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made
public by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at
the county level to capture changes in human movement over time. We found a
strong correlation between the observed decreases in NO2 concentrations and
decreases in human mobility. By contrast, no discernible pattern was detected
between mobility and PM2.5 concentrations changes, suggesting that decreases in
personal-vehicle traffic alone may not be effective at reducing PM2.5
pollution.

research including medical research. Effect of covariates (and their
interactions) on survival distribution can be studied through existing methods
which requires to pre-specify the functional form of the covariates including
their interactions. Survival trees offer relatively flexible approach when the
form of covariates' effects is unknown. Most of the currently available
survival tree construction techniques are not based on a formal test of
significance; however, recently proposed ctree algorithm (Hothorn et al., 2006)
uses permutation test for splitting decision that may be conservative at times.
We consider parameter instability test of statistical significance of
heterogeneity to guard against spurious findings of variation in covariates'
effect without being overly conservative. We have proposed SurvCART algorithm
to construct survival tree under conditional inference framework (Hothorn et
al., 2006) that selects splitting variable via parameter instability test and
subsequently finds the optimal split based on some maximally chosen statistic.
Notably, unlike the existing algorithms which focuses only on heterogeneity in
event time distribution, the proposed SurvCART algorithm can take splitting
decision based in censoring distribution as well along with heterogeneity in
event time distribution. The operating characteristics of parameter instability
test and comparative assessment of SurvCART algorithm were carried out via
simulation. Finally, SurvCART algorithm was applied to a real data setting. The
proposed method is fully implemented in R package LongCART available on CRAN.

long-standing controversial issue. We show simulation results of real stable
first-order phase transitions between high and low density liquid (HDL and
LDL)-like structures in confined supercooled water in both positive and
negative pressures. These topological phase transitions originate from H-bond
network ordering in molecular rotational mode after molecular exchanges are
frozen. It is explained by the order parameter-dependent free energy change
upon mixing liquid-like and ice-like moieties of H-bond orientations which is
governed by their two- to many-body interactions. This unexplored purely H-bond
orientation-driven topological phase gives mid-density and stable intermediate
mixed-phase with high and low density structures. The phase diagram of

machine learning approaches. We introduce a deep-learning model based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) that can predict the temperatures of a future
period directly where a particular room is unoccupied and by using these

particularly suitable for this learning task as they enable us to learn across
many relatively short series, which is necessary to focus on particular
operation modes of the air conditioning (AC) system. We evaluate the prediction
accuracy of our RNN model against a set of state-of-the-art models and are able
to outperform those by a large margin. We furthermore analyse the usage of our
RNN model in optimising the energy consumption of an AC system in a real-world

$T_eT_i/n_e$, respectively. Based on the typical parameters in DIII-D pedestal

negligible turbulent source driven current, the residual turbulent flux driven
local intrinsic current density by EM DW turbulence can reach about 66% of the
bootstrap current density for ITER pedestal parameters due to much lower

social network or a product purchase network) is an important task because the
way a network functions is often determined by its communities. Traditional
approaches to community detection involve modularity-based algorithms, which
generally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics that seek to
maximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those between them. On
the other hand, node embedding approaches represent each node in a graph as a
real-valued vector and is thereby able to transform the problem of community
detection in a graph to that of clustering a set of vectors. Existing node
embedding approaches are primarily based on, first, initiating random walks
from each node to construct a context of a node, and then make the vector
representation of a node close to its context. However, standard node embedding
approaches do not directly take into account the community structure of a
network while constructing the context around each node. To alleviate this, we
explore two different threads of work. First, we investigate the use of maximum
entropy-based random walks to obtain more centrality preserving embedding of
nodes, which may lead to more effective clusters in the embedded space. Second,
we propose a community structure-aware node embedding approach, where we
incorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics into the objective
function of node embedding. We demonstrate that our proposed combination of the
combinatorial and the embedding approaches for community detection outperforms
a number of modularity-based baselines and K-means clustering on a standard
node-embedded (node2vec) vector space on a wide range of real-life and
synthetic networks of different sizes and densities.

algorithm based on continuous-time observations and controls, and establish a
logarithmic regret bound of order $O((\ln M)(\ln\ln M))$, with $M$ being the
number of learning episodes. The analysis consists of two parts: perturbation
analysis, which exploits the regularity and robustness of the associated
Riccati differential equation; and parameter estimation error, which relies on
sub-exponential properties of continuous-time least-squares estimators. We
further propose a practically implementable least-squares algorithm based on
discrete-time observations and piecewise constant controls, which achieves
similar logarithmic regret with an additional term depending explicitly on the
time stepsizes used in the algorithm.

spectral diversities in the high-energy bands. In our model, the jitter
radiative spectral index is determined by the spectral index of the turbulence.
We classify GRBs into three classes depending on the shape of the GRB
high-energy spectrum when we compare the GBM and LAT detections: the GRB
spectrum is concave (GRBs turn out to be softer and are labeled as S-GRBs), the
GRB spectrum is convex (GRBs turn out to be harder and are labeled as H-GRBs),
and the GRBs have no strong spectral changes (labeled as N-GRBs). A universal
Kolmogorov index 7/3 in the turbulent cascade is consistent with the photon
index of the N-GRBs. The S-GRB spectra can be explained by the turbulent
cascade due to the kinetic magnetic reconnection with the spectral index range
of the turbulence from 8/3 to 3.0. The H-GRB spectra originate from the inverse
turbulent cascade with the spectral index range of the turbulence from 2.0 to
3.5 that occurred during the large lengthscale magnetic reconnection. Thus, the
GRB radiative spectra are diversified because the turbulent cascade modifies
the turbulent energy spectrum. More observational samples are expected in the
future to further identify our suggestions.

condensation. It has been suggested to tune the condensate phase of bilayer
excitons by applying interlayer tunneling current. A poorly-understood
phenomenon observed by Huang {\it et al} [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\bf 109$, 156802
(2012)] demonstrates that the critical values of the interlayer tunneling
current at either edge can be controlled by passing a second interlayer
tunneling current at the other edge. We successfully attribute this novel
coupling to excitonic Josephson effect induced by tunneling-current generated
relative phases and indicate that Huang's experiment is very robust evidence
for exciton condensation. We furthermore make a new proposal: there exists a
critical Josephson current beyond which Josephson coupling collapses and
external currents prefer to convert into edge-state currents to meet Huang's
observation at the second tunneling current above $\pm$16nA -- a sudden
decoupling of two edges accompanied by a large interedge voltage. Also, we make
a feasible suggestion to detect Josephson current by measuring induced magnetic
field of a ring-shaped excitonic Josephson junction. This work not only solves

classification due to the low computational cost. However, amongst online
practical scenarios where the features are evolving (e.g., some features are
vanished and some new features are augmented), most metric learning models
cannot be successfully applied to these scenarios, although they can tackle the
evolving instances efficiently. To address the challenge, we develop a new
online Evolving Metric Learning (EML) model for incremental and decremental
features, which can handle the instance and feature evolutions simultaneously
by incorporating with a smoothed Wasserstein metric distance. Specifically, our
model contains two essential stages: a Transforming stage (T-stage) and a
Inheriting stage (I-stage). For the T-stage, we propose to extract important
information from vanished features while neglecting non-informative knowledge,
and forward it into survived features by transforming them into a low-rank
discriminative metric space. It further explores the intrinsic low-rank
structure of heterogeneous samples to reduce the computation and memory burden
especially for highly-dimensional large-scale data. For the I-stage, we inherit
the metric performance of survived features from the T-stage and then expand to
include the new augmented features. Moreover, a smoothed Wasserstein distance
is utilized to characterize the similarity relationships among the
heterogeneous and complex samples, since the evolving features are not strictly
aligned in the different stages. In addition to tackling the challenges in
one-shot case, we also extend our model into multishot scenario. After deriving
an efficient optimization strategy for both T-stage and I-stage, extensive

Nucleosynthesis (BBN) data on primordial abundance of ${}^4He$. Starting from
these indications, we perform our analysis considering both background and
linear perturbations evolution and constrain, beyond the standard six
cosmological parameters, the free parameters of $f(T)$ models in both cases
whether the BBN consistency relation is considered or not. We use a combination
of Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation, Supernovae Ia and
galaxy clustering measurements, and find that very narrow constraints on the
free parameters of specific $f(T)$ cosmology can be obtained, beyond any
previous precision. While no degeneration is found between the helium fraction,
$Y_P$, and the free parameter of $f(T)$, we note that these models constrain
the current Hubble parameter, $H_0$, {higher extent than the standard model}
one, fully compatible with the Riess et al. measurement in the case of power
law $f(T)$ model. Moreover, the free parameters are constrained at non-zero
values in more than 3-$\sigma$, showing a preference of the observations for
extended gravity models.

observations in the field of the SPT2349-56 proto-cluster at $z=4.3$. We detect
optical/IR counterparts for only nine of the 14 submillimetre galaxies (SMGs)
previously identified by ALMA in the core of SPT2349-56. In addition, we detect
four $z\sim4$ Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) in the 30 arcsec diameter region
surrounding this proto-cluster core. Three of the four LBGs are new systems,
while one appears to be a counterpart of one of the nine observed SMGs. We
identify a candidate brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) with a stellar mass of
$(3.2^{+2.5}_{-1.4})\times10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$. The stellar masses of the
eight other SMGs place them on, above, and below the main sequence of star
formation at $z\approx4.5$. The cumulative stellar mass for the SPT2349-56 core
is at least $(11.5\pm2.9)\times10^{11}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, a sizeable fraction
of the stellar mass in local BCGs, and close to the universal baryon fraction
(0.16) relative to the virial mass of the core ($10^{13}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$). As
all 14 of these SMGs are destined to quickly merge, we conclude that the
proto-cluster core has already developed a significant stellar mass at this
early stage, comparable to $z=1$ BCGs. Importantly, we also find that the
SPT2349-56 core structure would be difficult to uncover in optical surveys,
with none of the ALMA sources being easily identifiable or constrained through
$g,r,$ and $i$ colour-selection in deep optical surveys and only a modest
overdensity of LBGs over the extended core structure. SPT2349-56 therefore
represents a truly dust-obscured phase of a massive cluster core under
formation.

item, which is a challenging task due to the inherent uncertainty in user
behaviors and anonymous implicit feedback information. A powerful session-based
recommender can typically explore the users' evolving interests (i.e., a
combination of his/her long-term and short-term interests). Recent advances in
attention mechanisms have led to state-of-the-art methods for solving this
task. However, there are two main drawbacks. First, most of the attention-based
methods only simply utilize the last clicked item to represent the user's
short-term interest ignoring the temporal information and behavior context,
which may fail to capture the recent preference of users comprehensively.
Second, current studies typically think long-term and short-term interests as
equally important, but the importance of them should be user-specific.
Therefore, we propose a novel Parallel Attention Network model (PAN) for
Session-based Recommendation. Specifically, we propose a novel time-aware
attention mechanism to learn user's short-term interest by taking into account
the contextual information and temporal signals simultaneously. Besides, we
introduce a gated fusion method that adaptively integrates the user's long-term

improvements than the state-of-the-art methods.

approach to monocular depth estimation. As obtaining labeled data is costly,
there is a recent trend to move from supervised learning to unsupervised
learning to obtain monocular depth. However, most unsupervised learning methods
capable of achieving high depth prediction accuracy will require a deep network
architecture which will be too heavy and complex to run on embedded devices
with limited storage and memory spaces. To address this issue, we propose a new
powerful network with a recurrent module to achieve the capability of a deep
network while at the same time maintaining an extremely lightweight size for
real-time high performance unsupervised monocular depth prediction from video
sequences. Besides, a novel efficient upsample block is proposed to fuse the
features from the associated encoder layer and recover the spatial size of
features with the small number of model parameters. We validate the
effectiveness of our approach via extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset.
Our new model can run at a speed of about 110 frames per second (fps) on a
single GPU, 37 fps on a single CPU, and 2 fps on a Raspberry Pi 3. Moreover, it
achieves higher depth accuracy with nearly 33 times fewer model parameters than

requirement of CNNs for abundant labeled samples versus the insufficient human

learning paradigm may lead to the overfitting of training data, and the lack of
supervision information of PolSAR images undoubtedly aggravates this problem,
which greatly affects the generalization performance of CNN-based classifiers
in large-scale applications. To handle this problem, in this paper, learning
transferrable representations from unlabeled PolSAR data through convolutional
architectures is explored for the first time. Specifically, a PolSAR-tailored
contrastive learning network (PCLNet) is proposed for unsupervised deep PolSAR
representation learning and few-shot classification. Different from the
utilization of optical processing methods, a diversity stimulation mechanism is
constructed to narrow the application gap between optics and PolSAR. Beyond the
conventional supervised methods, PCLNet develops an unsupervised pre-training
phase based on the proxy objective of instance discrimination to learn useful
representations from unlabeled PolSAR data. The acquired representations are
transferred to the downstream task, i.e., few-shot PolSAR classification.
Experiments on two widely-used PolSAR benchmark datasets confirm the validity
of PCLNet. Besides, this work may enlighten how to efficiently utilize the

generation of training examples for such biological-physiological systems is
not straightforward, due to their dynamic nature in which the various parts of
the system interact in complex ways. However, an understanding of these
dynamics has been developed for years in the form of mathematical process
simulators. We study how to incorporate this knowledge into the generative
process by leveraging a biological simulator for the task of ECG
classification. Specifically, we use a system of ordinary differential
equations representing heart dynamics, and incorporate this ODE system into the
optimization process of a generative adversarial network to create biologically
plausible ECG training examples. We perform empirical evaluation and show that
heart simulation knowledge during the generation process improves ECG
classification.

In this study, we proposed a deep learning framework guided by the visual

specific, we first extracted the ERP sequences from multiple EEG channels to
response image stimuli-related information. Then, we trained an LSTM network to
learn the feature representation space of visual objects for classification. In
the experiment, 10 subjects were recorded by over 50,000 EEG trials from an

showed that our proposed ERP-LSTM framework could achieve classification
accuracies of cross-subject of 66.81% and 27.08% for categories (6 classes) and

develop sustainable carbon-free energy sources induced a keen interest in the
production of hydrogen fuel. This can be achieved via the water-splitting
process exploiting solar energy but requiring the use of adequate
photocatalysts. Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) are target
photocatalysts for water-splitting. Both electronic and structural
characteristics of CTFs, optical bandgaps and porosity, are directly relevant
for water-splitting. These can be engineered through chemical design. Porosity
can be beneficial to water-splitting by providing larger surface area for the
catalytic reactions. However, porosity can also affect both charge transport
within the photocatalyst and mass transfer of both reactants and products, thus
impacting the overall kinetics of the reaction. We focus on the link between
chemical design and water (reactants) mass transfer, playing a key role in the
water uptake process and the subsequent hydrogen generation. We use neutron
spectroscopy to study water mass transfer in two porous CTFs, CTF-CN and CTF-2,
that differ in the polarity of their struts. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering
(QENS) is used to quantify the amount of bound water and the translational
diffusion of water. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements complement QENS
and provides insights into the softness of the CTF structures and the changes
in librational degrees of freedom of water in CTFs. We show that CTF-CN
exhibits smaller surface area and water uptake due to a softer structure than
CTF-2. The current study leads to new insights into the
structure-dynamics-property relationship of CTF photo-catalysts that pave the
road for a better understanding of the guest-host interaction at the basis of
water splitting applications.

crucial. To this end, several loss functions have been proposed to encourage
large intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. In this paper, we
propose to enhance the discriminative power of features from a new perspective
by introducing a novel neural network termed Relation-and-Margin learning
Network (ReMarNet). Our method assembles two networks of different backbones so
as to learn the features that can perform excellently in both of the
aforementioned two classification mechanisms. Specifically, a relation network
is used to learn the features that can support classification based on the
similarity between a sample and a class prototype; at the meantime, a fully
connected network with the cross entropy loss is used for classification via
the decision boundary. Experiments on four image datasets demonstrate that our
approach is effective in learning discriminative features from a small set of
labeled samples and achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art

$\frac{2e}{e-1}\approx 3.16$ to $\frac{2e^2}{e^2-1}\approx 2.31$. Finally, we
study $\alpha$-bounded graphs, a class of undirected graphs in which the sum of
node degrees higher than two is at most $\alpha$, and show that the adaptivity
gap is upper-bounded by $\sqrt{\alpha}+O(1)$. Moreover, we show that in
0-bounded graphs, i.e. undirected graphs in which each connected component is a
path or a cycle, the adaptivity gap is at most $\frac{3e^3}{e^3-1}\approx
3.16$. To prove our bounds, we introduce new techniques to relate adaptive
policies with non-adaptive ones that might be of their own interest.

electric or magnetic dipole moving with constant velocity in vacuum, and in a
medium, is considered. Of course, in vacuum there is no net force on such a
particle. Rather, because of loss of mass by the particle due to radiation, the
self-force precisely cancels this inertial effect, and thus the spectral
distribution of the energy radiated by dipole radiation is deduced without any
consideration of radiation fields or of radiation reaction, in both the
nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes. If the particle is moving in a
homogeneous medium faster than the speed of light in the medium,
Vavilov-\v{C}erenkov radiation results. This is derived for the different
polarization states, in agreement with the earlier results of Frank. The
friction experienced by a point (time-independent) dipole moving parallel to an
imperfectly conducting surface is examined. Finally, the quantum/thermal
Einstein-Hopf effect is rederived. We obtain a closed form for the spectral
distribution of the force, and demonstrate that, even if the atom and the
blackbody background have independent temperatures, the force is indeed a drag
in the case that the imaginary part of the polarizability is proportional to a
power of the frequency.

function of the elapsed time since infection, those function being i.i.d. for
the various individuals in the population. This approach models infection-age
dependent infectivity, and extends the classical SIR and SEIR models. We focus
on the infectivity process (total force of infection at each time), and prove a
functional law of large number (FLLN). In the deterministic limit of this LLN,
the infectivity process and the susceptible process are determined by a
two-dimensional deterministic integral equation. From its solutions, we then
derive the exposed, infectious and recovered processes, again using integral
equations. For the early phase, we study the stochastic model directly by using
an approximate (non--Markovian) branching process, and show that the epidemic
grows at an exponential rate on the event of non-extinction, which matches the
rate of growth derived from the deterministic linearized equations. We also use
these equations to derive the basic reproduction number $R_0$ during the early

sector inducing SSB was distinct from the Higgs field interactions induced
through its gauge and Yukawa couplings. We have adopted a similar perspective
but, following most recent lattice simulations, described SSB in
$\lambda\Phi^4$ theory as a weak first-order phase transition. In this case,
the resulting effective potential has two mass scales: i) a lower mass $m_h$,
defined by its quadratic shape at the minima, ~and~ ii) a larger mass $M_h$,
defined by the zero-point energy. These refer to different momentum scales in
the propagator and are related by $M^2_h\sim m^2_h \ln (\Lambda_s/M_h)$, where
$\Lambda_s$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the scalar sector. We have checked
this two-scale structure with lattice simulations of the propagator and of the
susceptibility in the 4D Ising limit of the theory. These indicate that, in a
cutoff theory where both $m_h$ and $M_h$ are finite, by increasing the energy,
there could be a transition from a relatively low value, e.g. $m_h$=125 GeV, to
a much larger $M_h$. The same lattice data give a final estimate $M_h= 720 \pm
30 $ GeV which induces to re-consider the experimental situation at LHC. In
particular an independent analysis of the ATLAS + CMS data indicating an excess
in the 4-lepton channel as if there were a new scalar resonance around 700 GeV.
Finally, the presence of two vastly different mass scales, requiring an
interpolating form for the Higgs field propagator also in loop corrections,
could reduce the discrepancy with those precise measurements which still favor
large values of the Higgs particle mass.

both effects can be offset if papers draw upon more distant fields (disparity).
These associations are consistent across different citation-window lengths. We

(TASEP) coupled to a reservoir of unlimited capacity. We elucidate how the
steady states are controlled by the interplay between the reservoir population
that dynamically controls both the entry and exit rates of the TASEP, and the
total particle number in the system. The TASEP can be in the low density, high
density, maximal current and shock phases. We show that such a TASEP is
different from an open TASEP for all values of available resources: here, the
TASEP can support only localised domain walls for any (finite) amount of
resources as opposed to delocalised domain walls in open TASEPs. Furthermore,
in the limit of infinite resources, the TASEP can be found in its high density
phase only for any finite values of the control parameters, in contrast to an
open TASEP.

(GR) with action $S = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \int [ R- 2\Lambda + (R-4\Lambda) \,
\mathcal{F}(\Box) \, (R-4\Lambda) ] \, \sqrt{-g}\; d^4x ,$ where $\mathcal{F}
(\Box) = \sum_{n=1}^{+\infty} f_n \Box^n$ is an analytic function of the
d'Alembertian $\Box$. We found a few exact cosmological solutions of the
corresponding equations of motion. There are two solutions which are valid only
if $\Lambda \neq 0, \, k = 0,$ and they have not analogs in Einsten's gravity
with cosmological constant $\Lambda$. One of these two solutions is $ a (t) = A
\, \sqrt{t} \, e^{\frac{\Lambda}{4} t^2} ,$ that mimics properties similar to
an interference between the radiation and the dark energy. Another solution is
a nonsingular bounce one -- $ a (t) = A \, e^{\Lambda t^2}$. For these two
solutions, some cosmological aspects are discussed. We also found explicit form
of the nonlocal operator $\mathcal{F}(\Box)$, which satisfies obtained
necessary conditions.

will resolve the neutrino mass ordering to a precision of 5$\sigma$, for all

charge-parity violation in the neutrino sector to a precision of 3$\sigma$

syndrome coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2). The virus transmits rapidly; it has
a basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health
Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently
affecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing
strategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for
testing surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to
screen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only
seconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a
dataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution
neural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet,
InceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models,
we then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen
COVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A
feature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are
important for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of

theoretical understanding of consciousness. In this study, we propose a simple
numerical model comprising a set of coupled double quantum dots, where the
disconnection of the elements is represented by the removal of Coulomb
interaction between the quantum dots, for the quantitative investigation of
integrated information. As a measure of integrated information, we calculate
the mutual information in the model system, as the Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the connected and disconnected status, through the probability
distribution of the electronic states from the master transition-rate
equations. We reasonably demonstrate that the increase in the strength of
interaction between the quantum dots leads to higher mutual information, owing
to the larger divergence in the probability distributions of the electronic
states. Our model setup could be a useful basic tool for numerical analyses in
the field of integrated information theory.

preconditioned Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method. The approach allows time
steps larger than those restricted by the traditional explicit CFL limit and is
algorithmically scalable as well as efficient due to an effective
preconditioning strategy based on algebraic multigrid and block factorization.
We implement this approach in the open-source Tusas framework, which is a
general, flexible tool developed in C++ for solving coupled systems of
nonlinear partial differential equations. The performance of our approach is
analyzed in terms of algorithmic scalability and efficiency, while the
computational performance of Tusas is presented in terms of parallel

In this work, we present a novel federated learning paradigm, named Federated
Mutual Leaning (FML), dealing with the three heterogeneities. FML allows
clients training a generalized model collaboratively and a personalized model
independently, and designing their private customized models. Thus, the
Non-IIDness of data is no longer a bug but a feature that clients can be

the glucose metabolism of the human body, which decreases the quantity of life

likely to suffer bone fragility fracture as diabetes affects bone mineral

algorithm, Prior-Knowledge-driven local Causal structure Learning (PKCL), to
discover the underlying causal mechanism between BMD and its factors from the

medicine, PKCL adequately utilize the prior knowledge to mine the local causal
structure for the target relationship. Combining the medical prior knowledge
with the discovered causal relationships, PKCL can achieve more reliable
results without long-standing medical statistical experiments. Extensive
experiments are conducted on a newly provided clinical data set. The
experimental study of PKCL on the data is proved to highly corresponding with
existing medical knowledge, which demonstrates the superiority and
effectiveness of PKCL. To illustrate the importance of prior knowledge, the
result of the algorithm without prior knowledge is also investigated.

platform extended from the TensorFlow ecosystem and, to our knowledge, the
first framework to leverage AutoML for model search and hyperparameter tuning
in deep recommendation models. AutoRec also supports a highly flexible pipeline
that accommodates both sparse and dense inputs, rating prediction and
click-through rate (CTR) prediction tasks, and an array of recommendation
models. Lastly, AutoRec provides a simple, user-friendly API. Experiments
conducted on the benchmark datasets reveal AutoRec is reliable and can identify
models which resemble the best model without prior knowledge.

  with application to COVID-19 detection",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Due to the high availability of large-scale annotated image datasets,
knowledge transfer from pre-trained models showed outstanding performance in
medical image classification. However, building a robust image classification
model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very
challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we
propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised
Super Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT
encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image
recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a
generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is
a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample
decomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the
robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with
a class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT
can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its
class boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used
50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer
learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has
achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.44%, 99.98%) in the detection of
COVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97.54% (95%$ CI: 96.22%,
98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small
dataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the
highest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.

  Encoding","Submitted to IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and
  bioinformatics",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding E3 ligase and target substrate interactions are important for
cell biology and therapeutic development. However, experimental identification
of E3 target relationships is not an easy task due to the labor-intensive
nature of the experiments. In this article, a sequence-based E3-target
prediction model is proposed for the first time. The proposed framework
utilizes composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) to learn the
relationship between E3 ligases and their target protein. A class separable
latent space encoding scheme is also devised that provides a compressed
representation of feature space. A thorough ablation study is performed to
identify an optimal gap size for CKSAAP and the number of latent variables that
can represent the E3-target relationship successfully. The proposed scheme is
evaluated on an independent dataset for a variety of standard quantitative
measures. In particular, it achieves an average accuracy of $70.63\%$ on an
independent dataset. The source code and datasets used in the study are
available at the author's GitHub page
(https://github.com/psychemistz/E3targetPred).
