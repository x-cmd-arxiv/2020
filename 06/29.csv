it is a second-order scheme or a third-order scheme. The QUICK scheme, as
proposed in the original reference [B. P. Leonard, Comput. Methods. Appl. Mech.
Eng., 19, (1979), 59-98], is a third-order (not second-order) finite-volume
scheme for the integral form of a general nonlinear conservation law with
point-valued solutions stored at cell centers as numerical solutions.
Third-order accuracy is proved by a careful and detailed truncation error
analysis and demonstrated by a series of thorough numerical tests. The QUICK
scheme requires a careful spatial discretization of a time derivative to
preserve third-order accuracy for unsteady problems. Two techniques are
discussed, including the QUICKEST scheme of Leonard. Discussions are given on
how the QUICK scheme is mistakenly found to be second-order accurate. This
paper is intended to serve as a reference to clarify any confusion about
third-order accuracy of the QUICK scheme and also as the basis for clarifying
third-order unstructured-grid schemes as we will discuss in a subsequent paper.

dependent frequency analysis. The system under test consists of an electrically
conducting fluid, confined between two differentially rotating spheres. The
spherical setup is exposed to an axial magnetic field. The classical Fourier
Transform method provides a first estimation of the time dependence of the
frequencies associated to the flow, as well as its volume-averaged properties.
It is however unable to detect strange attractors close to regular solutions in
the Feigenbaum as well as Newhouse-Ruelle-Takens bifurcation scenarios. It is
shown that Laskar's frequency algorithm is sufficiently accurate to identify
these strange attractors and thus is an efficient tool for classification of
chaotic flows in high dimensional dynamical systems. Our analysis of several
chaotic solutions, obtained at different magnetic field strengths, reveals a
strong robustness of the main frequency of the flow. This frequency is
associated to an azimuthal drift and it is very close to the frequency of the
underlying unstable rotating wave. In contrast, the main frequency of
volume-averaged properties can vary almost one order of magnitude as the
magnetic forcing is decreased. We conclude that, at the moderate differential
rotation considered, unstable rotating waves provide a good description of the
variation of the main time scale of any flow with respective variations in the
magnetic field.

train GCNs with insufficient supervision. When labeled data are limited, the
performance of GCNs becomes unsatisfying for low-degree nodes. While some prior
work analyze successes and failures of GCNs on the entire model level,
profiling GCNs on individual node level is still underexplored.
  In this paper, we analyze GCNs in regard to the node degree distribution.
From empirical observation to theoretical proof, we confirm that GCNs are
biased towards nodes with larger degrees with higher accuracy on them, even if
high-degree nodes are underrepresented in most graphs. We further develop a
novel Self-Supervised-Learning Degree-Specific GCN (SL-DSGC) that mitigate the
degree-related biases of GCNs from model and data aspects. Firstly, we propose
a degree-specific GCN layer that captures both discrepancies and similarities
of nodes with different degrees, which reduces the inner model-aspect biases of
GCNs caused by sharing the same parameters with all nodes. Secondly, we design
a self-supervised-learning algorithm that creates pseudo labels with
uncertainty scores on unlabeled nodes with a Bayesian neural network. Pseudo
labels increase the chance of connecting to labeled neighbors for low-degree
nodes, thus reducing the biases of GCNs from the data perspective. Uncertainty
scores are further exploited to weight pseudo labels dynamically in the
stochastic gradient descent for SL-DSGC. Experiments on three benchmark
datasets show SL-DSGC not only outperforms state-of-the-art
self-training/self-supervised-learning GCN methods, but also improves GCN

optimizing for a material surface characteristic, surface roughness, and
explore the strategies used by the agents as compared with a traditional
actor-critic (A2C) baseline. Further, we find that SVPG stabilizes the training

done using a microphone-array, bringing the speaker or set of speakers at the
viewing angle is not a trivial task. First of all, the robot should react only
to a human voice, but not to the random noises. Secondly, if there are multiple
speakers, to whom the robot should face or should it rotate continuously with
every new speaker? Lastly, most robotic platforms are resource-constrained and
to achieve a real-time response, i.e., avoiding network delay, all the
algorithms should be implemented within the robot itself. This article presents
a study and implementation of an attention shifting scheme in a telepresence

the size of Earth and Neptune into two populations. The location and depth of
this feature is an important signature of the physical processes that form and
sculpt planets. In particular, planets residing in the radius gap are valuable
probes of these processes as they may be undergoing the final stages of
envelope loss. Here, we discuss two views of the radius gap by Fulton &
Petigura (2018; F18) and Van Eylen et al. (2018; V18). In V18, the gap is wider
and more devoid of planets. This is due, in part, to V18's more precise
measurements of planet radius $R_p$. Thanks to Gaia, uncertainties in stellar
radii Rstar are no longer the limiting uncertainties in determining $R_p$ for
the majority of Kepler planets; instead, errors in $R_p/R_\star$ dominate.
V18's analysis incorporated short-cadence photometry along with constraints on
mean stelar density that enabled more accurate determinations of $R_p/R_\star$.
In the F18 analysis, less accurate $R_p/R_\star$ blurs the boundary the radius
gap. The differences in $R_p/R_\star$ are largest at high impact parameter ($b
\gtrsim 0.8$) and often exceed 10%. This motivates excluding high-$b$ planets
from demographic studies, but identifying such planets from long-cadence
photometry alone is challenging. We show that transit duration can serve as an
effective proxy, and we leverage this information to enhance the contrast

hydrodynamic equations beyond the 13-moments approximation, and include the

found in contrast with the fact that hydrodynamic equations for the higher rank
tensors do not contain interaction in the classic plasmas studied in the
selfconsistent (meanfield) approximation. Therefore, we present the quantum
hydrodynamic model, where the quantum effects are studied beyond the quantum
Bohm potential. Developed model is considered in two regimes: all electrons in
plasmas are considered as the single fluid, and the separate spin evolution
regime, where electrons with different spin projections are considered as two
different fluids. To illustrate the fundamental meaning of found quantum
effects we demonstrate their contribution in the spectrum of the Langmuir waves
and the spin-electron-acoustic waves. It is worth to mention that the
application of the pressure evolution equation ensures that the contribution of
pressure in the Langmuir wave spectrum is proportional to $(3/5)v_{Fe}^{2}$,
unlike $(1/3)v_{Fe}^{2}$ appearing from hydrodynamics based on the continuity

corresponds on other plasmas phenomena like the speed of sound for
spin-electron-acoustic waves. Moreover, it is found that novel quantum effects

difficult problems from both a theoretical and numerical perspective: the
combinatorial nature of the vanishing constraints often prevents standard
constraint qualifications and optimality conditions from being attained;
moreover, the feasible set is inherently nonconvex, and often has no interior
around points of interest. In this paper, we therefore study and compare four
regularization methods for the numerical solution of MPVCS. Each method depends
on a single regularization parameter, which is used to embed the original MPVC
into a sequence of standard nonlinear programs. Convergence results for these
methods based on both exact and approximate stationary of the subproblems are
established under weak assumptions. The improved regularity of the subproblems
is studied by providing sufficient conditions for the existence of KKT
multipliers. Numerical experiments, based on applications in truss topology
design and an optimal control problem from aerothermodynamics, complement the
theoretical analysis and comparison of the regularization methods. The
computational results highlight the benefit of using regularization over
applying a standard solver directly, and they allow us to identify two

releasing aggregate socio-economic data about a large population without

their salary brackets. Recent events have identified some of the privacy
challenges faced by these organizations. To address them, this paper presents a
novel differential-privacy mechanism for releasing hierarchical counts of
individuals. The counts are reported at multiple granularities (e.g., the
national, state, and county levels) and must be consistent across all levels.
The core of the mechanism is an optimization model that redistributes the noise
introduced to achieve differential privacy in order to meet the consistency
constraints between the hierarchical levels. The key technical contribution of
the paper shows that this optimization problem can be solved in polynomial time
by exploiting the structure of its cost functions. Experimental results on very
large, real datasets show that the proposed mechanism provides improvements of
up to two orders of magnitude in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy
with respect to other state-of-the-art techniques.

occurring in ultrafast photoelectron spectroscopy from the gas phase is
presented. The target sample CF$_3$I is excited by ultrashort (100 fs)
far-ultraviolet radiation pulses produced by a free-electron laser. The
modification of the energy distribution of the photoelectrons, i.e. the shift
and broadening of the spectral structures, is monitored as a function of the
pulse intensity. The experimental results are compared with computational
simulations which employ a Barnes-Hut algorithm to calculate the effect of
individual Coulomb forces acting among the particles. In the presented model, a
survey spectrum acquired at low radiation fluence is used to determine the
initial energy distribution of the electrons after the photoemission event. The
spectrum modified by the space-charge effects is then reproduced by $N$-body
calculations that simulate the dynamics of the photoelectrons subject to the
individual mutual Coulomb repulsion and to the attractive force of the positive
ions. The employed numerical method accounts for the space-charge effects on
the energy distribution and allows to reproduce the complete photoelectron
spectrum and not just a specific photoemission structure. The simulations also
provide information on the time evolution of the space-charge effects on the
picosecond scale. Differences with the case of photoemission from solid samples
are highlighted and discussed. The presented simulation procedure, although it
omits the analysis of angular distribution, constitutes an effective simplified
model that allows to predict and account for space-charge effects on the
photoelectron energy spectrum in time-resolved photoemission experiments with
high-intensity pulsed sources.

machine learning generalization as a function of a variety of data set

the relevance of using the concept of the convex hull of the training data in
assessing machine learning generalization, by emphasizing the difference
between interpolated and extrapolated predictions. Besides several predictable
correlations, we observe unexpectedly weak associations between the
generalization ability of machine learning models and all metrics related to
dimensionality, thus challenging the common assumption that the \textit{curse
of dimensionality} might impair generalization in machine learning.

only defined conditional on a post-treatment event status. For example, in a
study of the effect of different cancer treatments on quality of life at end of
follow-up, the quality of life of individuals who die during the study is
undefined. In these settings, a naive contrast of outcomes conditional on the
post-treatment variable is not an average causal effect, even in a randomized
experiment. Therefore the effect in the principal stratum of those who would
have the same value of the post-treatment variable regardless of treatment,
such as the always survivors in a truncation by death setting, is often
advocated for causal inference. While this principal stratum effect is a well
defined causal contrast, it is often hard to justify that it is relevant to
scientists, patients or policy makers, and it cannot be identified without
relying on unfalsifiable assumptions. Here we formulate alternative estimands,
the conditional separable effects, that have a natural causal interpretation
under assumptions that can be falsified in a randomized experiment. We provide
identification results and introduce different estimators, including a doubly
robust estimator derived from the nonparametric influence function. As an
illustration, we estimate a conditional separable effect of chemotherapies on
quality of life in patients with prostate cancer, using data from a randomized

analysed carefully. Moreover, the possibility of hovering at large attitude
maneuvers of this novel vehicle requires singularity-free attitude control.
Hence, quaternion state feedback is utilized to compute the control commands
for the UAV motors while avoiding the gimbal lock condition experienced by
Euler angle based controllers. The quaternion implementation also reduces the
overall complexity of state estimation due to absence of trigonometric
parameters. The quadcopter dynamic model and state space is utilized to design
the attitude controller and control allocation for the UAV. The control
allocation, in particular, is derived by linearizing the system about hover
condition. This mathematical method renders the control allocation more
accurate than existing approaches. Lyapunov stability analysis of the attitude
controller is shown to prove global stability. The quaternion feedback attitude
controller is commanded by an outer position controller loop which generates
rotor-tilt and desired quaternions commands for the system. The performance of
the UAV is evaluated by numerical simulations for tracking attitude step
commands and for following a way-point navigation mission.

asymptotic stability of (topological) solitons. Our approach is based on the
use of the distorted Fourier transform at the nonlinear level; it does not rely
on Strichartz or virial estimates and is therefore able to treat low power
nonlinearities (hence also non-localized solitons) and capture the global (in
space and time) behavior of solutions. More specifically, we consider quadratic
nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations with a potential in one space dimension. The
potential is assumed to be regular, decaying, and either generic or exceptional
(with some additional parity assumptions). Assuming that the associated
Schr\""odinger operator has no negative eigenvalues, we obtain global-in-time
bounds, including sharp pointwise decay and modified asymptotics, for small
solutions. These results have implications for the asymptotic stability of
solitons, or topological solitons, for a variety of problems. For instance, we
obtain full asymptotic stability of kinks with respect to odd perturbations for
the double Sine-Gordon problem (in an appropriate range of the deformation
parameter). For the $\phi^4$ problem, we obtain asymptotic stability of the
kink (with respect to odd perturbations) when the coupling to the internal mode
appearing in the linearization around it is neglected. Our results also go
beyond these examples since our approach allows for the presence of a fully
coherent phenomenon at the level of quadratic interactions, which creates a
degeneracy in distorted Fourier space. We devise a suitable framework that
incorporates this, and use multilinear harmonic analysis in the distorted
setting to control all nonlinear interactions.

curate another 1001 patients. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our new
data curation strategy, combined with the SaDT deep dynamic texture analysis,
can effectively improve the mean F1 scores by >8.6% compared with baselines, in
differentiating four major liver lesion types. Our F1 score of (hepatocellular

human observer performance using dynamic CT and comparable to an advanced
magnetic resonance imagery protocol. Apart from demonstrating the benefits of
our data curation approach and physician-inspired workflow, these results also
indicate that analyzing texture features, instead of standard object-based
analysis, is a promising strategy for lesion differentiation.

description details for an atomic nucleus will be possible than is the case
with the conventional description. The YY model is compatible with the standard
model. However, it allows for very delicate considerations when modelling the
distribution of protons and neutrons within or around an atomic nucleus.
Furthermore, it can explain many subatomic processes in an elegant way. The YY

Our approach also includes a native common root for the description of
macrophysics (space, dark matter and cosmology).
  Following a model-driven approach - a methodology widely used in computer

dispense with mathematical formulations. In addition, energy balances in the
transformations are left out. Many different aspects that can be derived from
this new mechanism can then be verified. We hope to gain the confidence of many
other physicists in the YY model. They could make detailed theoretical and
experimental verifications by adding additional descriptive elements and
linking the YY model to the known quantum field theories and the widely
accepted big bang theories for space and cosmology, especially for research on

well-known St\""ackel transform, which in turn originates from the classical
Maupertuis-Jacobi principle. We extend our recently developed algebraic
geometric approach for the classification of second order superintegrable
systems in arbitrarily high dimension to conformally superintegrable systems,
which are presented via conformal scale choices of second order superintegrable
systems defined within a conformal geometry.
  For superintegrable systems on constant curvature spaces, we find that the
conformal scales of St\""ackel equivalent systems arise from eigenfunctions of
the Laplacian and that their equivalence is characterised by a conformal
density of weight two.
  Our approach yields an algebraic equation that governs the classification
under conformal equivalence for a prolific class of second order conformally
superintegrable systems. This class contains all non-degenerate examples known
to date, and is given by a simple algebraic constraint of degree two on a
general harmonic cubic form. In this way the yet unsolved classification
problem is put into the reach of algebraic geometry and geometric invariant
theory. In particular, no obstruction exists in dimension three, and thus the
known classification of conformally superintegrable systems is reobtained in
the guise of an unrestricted univariate sextic. In higher dimensions, the
obstruction is new and has never been revealed by traditional approaches.

robots, it holds great potential to design visual-inertial navigation systems
(VINS) for efficient versatile 3D motion tracking which utilize any (multiple)
available cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) and are resilient to
sensor failures or measurement depletion. To this end, rather than the standard
VINS paradigm using a minimal sensing suite of a single camera and IMU, in this
paper we design a real-time consistent multi-IMU multi-camera (MIMC)-VINS
estimator that is able to seamlessly fuse multi-modal information from an
arbitrary number of uncalibrated cameras and IMUs. Within an efficient
multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework, the proposed MIMC-VINS
algorithm optimally fuses asynchronous measurements from all sensors, while
providing smooth, uninterrupted, and accurate 3D motion tracking even if some
sensors fail. The key idea of the proposed MIMC-VINS is to perform high-order
on-manifold state interpolation to efficiently process all available visual
measurements without increasing the computational burden due to estimating
additional sensors' poses at asynchronous imaging times. In order to fuse the
information from multiple IMUs, we propagate a joint system consisting of all
IMU states while enforcing rigid-body constraints between the IMUs during the
filter update stage. Lastly, we estimate online both spatiotemporal extrinsic
and visual intrinsic parameters to make our system robust to errors in prior
sensor calibration. The proposed system is extensively validated in both
Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments.

genus-$g$ maps that are essentially $2b$-irreducible for $b\geq 0$, which
loosely speaking means that they are not allowed to possess contractible cycles
of length less than $2b$ and each such cycle of length $2b$ is required to
bound a face of degree $2b$. The enumeration of such maps is shown to be again

the face degrees with a polynomial dependence on $b$. These polynomials satisfy

distributed training thanks to its straightforward principle and broad
applicability. In general, the technique of distributed data parallelism
replicates the model on every computational resource to generate gradients
independently and then communicates those gradients at each iteration to keep
model replicas consistent. Despite the conceptual simplicity of the technique,
the subtle dependencies between computation and communication make it
non-trivial to optimize the distributed training efficiency. As of v1.5,
PyTorch natively provides several techniques to accelerate distributed data

modeling method that has been popular for data mining applications. MARS has
also been employed to approxmiate unknown relationships in optimzation for
complex systems, including surrogate optimization, dynamic programming, and
two-stage stochastic programming. Given the increasing desire to optimize real
world systems, this paper presents an approach to globally optimize a MARS
model that allows up to two-way interaction terms that are products of
truncated linear univariate functions (TITL-MARS). Specifally, such a MARS
model consists of linear and quadratic structure. This structure is exploited
to formulate a mixed integer quadratic programming problem (TITL-MARS-OPT). To
appreciate the contribution of TITL-MARS-OPT, one must recognize that popular
heurstic optimization approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, do not
guarantee global optimality and can be computationally slow. The use of MARS
maintains the flexibility of modeling within TITL-MARS-OPT while also taking
advantage of the linear modeling structure of MARS to enable global optimality.
Computational results compare TITL-MARS-OPT with a genetic algorithm for two
types of cases. First, a wind farm power distribution case study is described
and then other TITL-MARS forms are tested. The results show the superiority of
TITL-MARS-OPT over the genetic algorithm in both accuracy and computational

have a geometrical nature, basing on the idea that the intrinsic angular
momentum, the spin, modifies the geometry of the space, which becomes a
manifold, that is represented as a vector bundle with a base formed by the
translational coordinates and time, and the fiber of the bundle, specified at
each point by the field of an tetrad $e^a_{\mu}$, forms from the bilinear
combinations of spinor wave function. It was shown, that the spin vector
rotates following the geodesic of the space with torsion and the particle moves
according to the geometrized guidance equation. This fact explains the
self-action of the spinning particle. We show that the curvature and torsion of
the spin vector line is determined by the space torsion of the absolute
parallelism geometry.

extracted from week 1 CBCTs using power law adaptive histogram equalization

CBCT reconstruction parameters. Moreover, we leverage physics-based artifact
induced pCTs to drive the esophagus segmentation in real weekly CBCTs.
Segmentations were evaluated using geometric Dice and Hausdorff distance as
well as dosimetrically using mean esophagus dose and D5cc. Due to the
physics-based data augmentation, our model trained just on the synthetic CBCTs
was robust and generalizable enough to also produce state-of-the-art results on

human-level performances in various tasks, it still has several fundamental
challenges. First, most RL methods require intensive data from the exploration

in a way that humans can understand. To address these two challenges, we
propose a framework that enables an RL agent to reason over its exploration

explorations. Specifically, we propose a novel RL algorithm that learns
high-level knowledge in the form of a finite reward automaton by using the L*
learning algorithm. We prove that in episodic RL, a finite reward automaton can
express any non-Markovian bounded reward functions with finitely many reward
values and approximate any non-Markovian bounded reward function (with
infinitely many reward values) with arbitrary precision. We also provide a
lower bound for the episode length such that the proposed RL approach almost
surely converges to an optimal policy in the limit. We test this approach on
two RL environments with non-Markovian reward functions, choosing a variety of
tasks with increasing complexity for each environment. We compare our algorithm
with the state-of-the-art RL algorithms for non-Markovian reward functions,

confirmatory trial. A sample size is typically derived based on constraints on
the maximal acceptable type I error rate and a minimal desired power. Here,
power depends on the unknown true effect size. In practice, power is typically
calculated either for the smallest relevant effect size or a likely point
alternative. The former might be problematic if the minimal relevant effect is
close to the null, thus requiring an excessively large sample size. The latter
is dubious since it does not account for the a priori uncertainty about the
likely alternative effect size. A Bayesian perspective on the sample size
derivation for a frequentist trial naturally emerges as a way of reconciling
arguments about the relative a priori plausibility of alternative effect sizes
with ideas based on the relevance of effect sizes. Many suggestions as to how
such `hybrid' approaches could be implemented in practice have been put forward
in the literature. However, key quantities such as assurance, probability of
success, or expected power are often defined in subtly different ways in the
literature. Starting from the traditional and entirely frequentist approach to
sample size derivation, we derive consistent definitions for the most commonly
used `hybrid' quantities and highlight connections, before discussing and
demonstrating their use in the context of sample size derivation for clinical

correcting these commands. Collision avoidance is incorporated into the design
using potential fields. A term in the cost function facilitates natural

these alternative catalogs on occurrence rates. We find that if there is no
correction for reliability, different catalogs give statistically inconsistent
occurrence rates, while if we correct for both completeness and reliability, we
get statistically consistent occurrence rates. This is a strong indication that
correction for completeness and reliability is critical for the accurate
computation of occurrence rates. Additionally, we find that this result is the
same whether using Bayesian Poisson likelihood MCMC or Approximate Bayesian
Computation methods. We also examine the use of a Robovetter disposition score
cut as an alternative to reliability correction, and find that while a score
cut does increase the reliability of the catalog, it is not as accurate as
performing a full reliability correction. We get the same result when
performing a reliability correction with and without a score cut. Therefore
removing low-score planets removes data without providing any advantage, and
should be avoided when possible. We make our alternative catalogs publicly

and the self-coupling within the framework of Polyakov loop enhanced
Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model at finite temperature and quark chemical
potential. PNJL model, where quarks couple simultaneously to the chiral
condensate and to a background temporal quantum chromodynamics (QCD) gauge
field, includes two important features of QCD phase transition, i.e.
deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration. The Polyakov loop in PNJL model
plays an important role near the critical temperature. We have shown
significant difference in the axion properties calculated in PNJL model
compared to the same obtained using Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. We find
that both the mass of the axion and its self-coupling are correlated with the
chiral transition as well as the confinement-deconfinement transition. We have
also estimated the axion properties at finite chemical potential. Across the
QCD transition temperature and/or quark chemical potential axion mass and its
self-coupling also changes significantly. Since the PNJL model includes both
the fermionic sector and the gauge fields, it can give reliable estimates of
the axion properties, i.e. it's mass and the self-coupling in a hot and dense
QCD medium. We also compare our results with the lattice QCD results whenever

bridged the gap to fully-supervised performance. We first propose to adapt two
top performing objectives in this class - instance recognition and local
aggregation, to the video domain. In particular, the latter approach iterates
between clustering the videos in the feature space of a network and updating it
to respect the cluster with a non-parametric classification loss. We observe
promising performance, but qualitative analysis shows that the learned
representations fail to capture motion patterns, grouping the videos based on
appearance. To mitigate this issue, we turn to the heuristic-based IDT
descriptors, that were manually designed to encode motion patterns in videos.
We form the clusters in the IDT space, using these descriptors as a an
unsupervised prior in the iterative local aggregation algorithm. Our
experiments demonstrates that this approach outperform prior work on UCF101 and

apply the use of churn prediction to not only predict whether a customer will
unsubscribe from the service but explore the user's playing behavior to obtain
more insight into user playing patterns. The churn problem is somewhat complex

is used in two aspects of this paper: Survival Analysis and Binary
Classification. Firstly, we explore the dataset using the Kaplan Meier
estimator to predict the duration until a customer churns, and lastly predict
whether a person will churn in six months using traditional machine learning
algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier,
and Random Forests. From the survival analysis results, WoW customers have a
relatively long duration until churn, which solidifies the addictiveness of the
game. Lastly, the binary classification performed in the best performing

alignment reduces the entanglement density and thus should accelerate welding
by diffusion. Here, coarse-grained molecular simulations are used to test the
effect of molecular alignment on diffusion and weld strength. While standard
measures show a decrease of the entanglement density with alignment, there is
no change in the rate of diffusion normal to the interface or the rate of
formation of entanglements across the interface. The time for chain
reorientation also remains equal to the equilibrium disentanglement time
$\tau_d$. Despite this, simulations of mechanical tests show that welds formed
from aligned states are weaker until several $\tau_d$. This is not because the
weld itself is weaker, but because aligned material near the weld is weaker

  through interface strain and disorder","32 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Artificially engineered superlattices were designed and fabricated to induce
different growth mechanisms and structural characteristics. DC sputtering was
used to grow ferromagnetic (La$_{0.8}$Ba$_{0.2}$MnO$_3$) / ferroelectric
(Ba$_{0.25}$Sr$_{0.75}$TiO$_3$ or BaTiO$_3$) superlattices. We systematically
modified the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer to analyze dimensional and
structural effects on the superlattices with different structural
characteristics. The crystalline structure was characterized by X-Ray
diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The magnetic and electronic
properties were investigated by SQUID magnetometry and resistance measurements.
The results show that both strain and structural disorder can significantly
affect the physical properties of the systems. Compressive strain tends to
increase the competition between the magnetic interactions decreasing the
ferromagnetism of the samples and the localization of the charge carrier
through the electron-phonon interaction. Tensile strain reduces the charge
carrier localization, increasing the ferromagnetic transition temperature.
Structural defects have a stronger influence on the magnetic properties than on
the transport properties, reducing the ferromagnetic transition temperature
while increasing the magnetic hardness of the superlattices. These results help
to further understand the role of strain and interface effects in the magnetic
and transport properties of manganite based multiferroic systems.

$1/r^2$ at temperature $T=0$. The associated logarithmic singularity leads to
loss of order for any $x>0$. Order for small $x>0$ and $T>0$ is induced by weak

freshness, captured by the {\it age-of-information} (AoI) metric. When
strategic data sources have private market information, a fundamental economic
challenge is how to incentivize them to acquire fresh data and optimize the
age-related performance. In this work, we consider an information update system
in which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from multiple
sources. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general
increasing function of the AoI. Each source is strategic and incurs a sampling
cost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to
the destination. The destination decides on the price of updates, when to get
them, and who should generate them, based on the sources' reported sampling
costs. We show that a benchmark that naively trusts the sources' reports can
lead to an arbitrarily bad outcome compared to the case where sources
truthfully report. To tackle this issue, we design an optimal (economic)
mechanism for timely information acquisition following Myerson's seminal work.
To this end, our proposed optimal mechanism minimizes the sum of the
destination's age-related cost and its payment to the sources, while ensuring
that the sources truthfully report their private information and will
voluntarily participate in the mechanism. However, finding the optimal
mechanisms may suffer from \textit{prohibitively expensive computational
overheads} as it involves solving a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization
problem. We further propose a quantized version of the optimal mechanism that
achieves asymptotic optimality, maintains the other economic properties, and
enables one to tradeoff between optimality and computational overheads.

value. By explicitly storing and evolving confidence values using the CRM
filter, CRM extends traditional grid mapping in three ways: first, it partially
maintains the probabilistic dependence among voxels. Second, it relaxes the
need for hand-engineering an inverse sensor model and proposes the concept of

sensor model. Third, and most importantly, it provides consistent confidence
values over the occupancy estimation that can be reliably used in collision
risk evaluation and motion planning. CRM runs online and enables mapping
environments where voxels might be partially occupied. We demonstrate the
performance of the method on various datasets and environments in simulation

achieving maps that are more accurate than traditional methods, the proposed

schemes with and without preemption in service, the closed-form expressions of
the average age of information (AoI) and the average peak AoI of each device is
characterized. It is shown that the scheme with preemption in service always
leads to a smaller average AoI and a smaller average peak AoI, compared to the
scheme without preemption in service. Then, a distributed noncooperative medium
access control game is formulated in which each device optimizes its waiting
rate so as to minimize its average AoI or average peak AoI under an average

the challenges of solving this game for an ultra-dense IoT, a mean-field game

The micro-scale experiments reveal that, due to Ostwald ripening, longer
injection intervals allow smaller crystals to dissolve and reprecipitate into
larger crystals regardless of the concentration of cementation solution. By
applying this finding in the macro-scale experiments, a treatment duration of 6
days, where injection intervals were 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h for cementation

enough to precipitate crystals large enough for effective strength enhancement.
This was indicated by the fact that significantly higher soil strength and

develop new techniques for PolSAR image classification under the condition of
very few training samples. In this letter, we take the advantage of active

classification. We first show that only 35\% of the predicted labels of a deep

disagreement between snapshots is non-negligible. From the perspective of
multiview learning, the snapshots together serve as a good committee to
evaluate the importance of unlabeled instances. Using the snapshots committee

better performance on two real PolSAR images compared with standard active

Conner-Kobayashi reductions M to N, where N is the fixed point set of the

positive curvature manifolds each with even co-dimension. By Berger, N is not
empty. By Lefschetz, M and N have the same Euler characteristic. By Frankel,
the sum of dimension of any two components in N is smaller than the dimension

dimension 6 to 24, only four exceptional manifolds have appeared so far, some
of them being flag manifolds and related to the special unitary group in three

with the existence of of two linearly independent harmonic k-forms on the

OGLE-2018-BLG-1269, with planet-host mass ratio $q \sim 6\times10^{-4}$, i.e.,
$0.6$ times smaller than the Jupiter/Sun mass ratio. Combined with the $Gaia$
parallax and proper motion, a strong one-dimensional constraint on the
microlens parallax vector allows us to significantly reduce the uncertainties
of lens physical parameters. A Bayesian analysis that ignores any information
about light from the host yields that the planet is a cold giant $(M_{2} =
0.69_{-0.22}^{+0.44}\,M_{\rm J})$ orbiting a Sun-like star $(M_{1} =
1.13_{-0.35}^{+0.72}\,M_{\odot})$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L} =
2.56_{-0.62}^{+0.92}\,{\rm kpc}$. The projected planet-host separation is
$a_{\perp} = 4.61_{-1.17}^{+1.70}\,{\rm au}$. Using {\it Gaia} astrometry, we
show that the blended light lies $\lesssim 12\,$mas from the host and therefore
must be either the host star or a stellar companion to the host. An isochrone
analysis favors the former possibility at $>99.6\%$. The host is therefore a
subgiant. For host metallicities in the range of $0.0 \leq {\rm [Fe/H]} \leq
+0.3$, the host and planet masses are then in the range of $1.16 \leq
M_{1}/M_{\odot} \leq 1.38$ and $0.74 \leq M_{2}/M_{\rm J} \leq 0.89$,
respectively. Low host metallicities are excluded. The brightness and proximity
of the lens make the event a strong candidate for spectroscopic followup both
to test the microlensing solution and to further characterize the system.

existence of hidden antiunitary symmetry, which we call the effective
time-reversal symmetry (eTRS), the Fermi surfaces of ordinary antiferromagnetic
metals are generally spin-degenerate, and spin-singlet pairing is favored.
However, by introducing a local inversion symmetry breaking perturbation that
also breaks the eTRS, we can lift the degeneracy to obtain spin-polarized Fermi
surfaces. In the weak-coupling limit, the spin-polarized Fermi surfaces
constrain the electrons to form spin-triplet Cooper pairs with odd-parity.
Interestingly, all the odd-parity superconducting ground states we obtained
host nontrivial band topologies manifested as chiral topological
superconductors, second-order topological superconductors, and nodal
superconductors. We propose that layered double-perovskites with collinear
antiferromagnetism, sandwiched by conventional superconductors, are promising
candidate systems where our theoretical ideas can be applied to.

with an efficient method for implementing multi-step Gaussian process

show that optimization of a combination of energy and variance may be more
efficient to find low-energy excited states than those of minimizing energy or

address modern settings where datasets from $N$ related distributions $\{P_t\}$
are to be combined towards improving performance on any single such
distribution ${\cal D}$. A perplexing fact remains in the evolving theory on
the subject: while we would hope for performance bounds that account for the
contribution from multiple tasks, the vast majority of analyses result in
bounds that improve at best in the number $n$ of samples per task, but most
often do not improve in $N$. As such, it might seem at first that the
distributional settings or aggregation procedures considered in such analyses
might be somehow unfavorable; however, as we show, the picture happens to be
more nuanced, with interestingly hard regimes that might appear otherwise
favorable.
  In particular, we consider a seemingly favorable classification scenario
where all tasks $P_t$ share a common optimal classifier $h^*,$ and which can be
shown to admit a broad range of regimes with improved oracle rates in terms of
$N$ and $n$. Some of our main results are as follows:
  $\bullet$ We show that, even though such regimes admit minimax rates
accounting for both $n$ and $N$, no adaptive algorithm exists; that is, without
access to distributional information, no algorithm can guarantee rates that
improve with large $N$ for $n$ fixed.
  $\bullet$ With a bit of additional information, namely, a ranking of tasks
$\{P_t\}$ according to their distance to a target ${\cal D}$, a simple
rank-based procedure can achieve near optimal aggregations of tasks' datasets,
despite a search space exponential in $N$. Interestingly, the optimal

is somewhat limited in complex and big data situations due to the computational
cost associated with full posterior evaluations. Variational Bayes (VB)
provides a useful alternative to circumvent the computational cost and time
complexity associated with the generation of samples from the true posterior
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. The efficacy of the VB
methods is well established in machine learning literature. However, its
potential broader impact is hindered due to a lack of theoretical validity from
a statistical perspective. However there are few results which revolve around
the theoretical properties of VB, especially in non-parametric problems. In
this paper, we establish the fundamental result of posterior consistency for
the mean-field variational posterior (VP) for a feed-forward artificial neural
network model. The paper underlines the conditions needed to guarantee that the
VP concentrates around Hellinger neighborhoods of the true density function.
Additionally, the role of the scale parameter and its influence on the
convergence rates has also been discussed. The paper mainly relies on two
results (1) the rate at which the true posterior grows (2) the rate at which
the KL-distance between the posterior and variational posterior grows. The
theory provides a guideline of building prior distributions for Bayesian NN
models along with an assessment of accuracy of the corresponding VB
implementation.

some experimentally accessible condensed matter systems can host these exotic
excitations as bound states on the boundaries of 1D chains, and that their
topological and non-abelian nature holds promise for quantum computation.
Unambiguously detecting the experimental signatures of Majorana bound states
has turned out to be challenging, as many other phenomena lead to similar
experimental behaviour. Here, we computationally study a ring comprised of two
Kitaev model chains with tunnel coupling between them, where an applied
magnetic field allows for Aharonov-Bohm interference in transport through the
resulting ring structure. We use a non-equilibrium Green's function technique
to analyse the transport properties of the ring in both the presence and
absence of Majorana zero modes. Further, we show that these results are robust
against weak disorder in the presence of an applied magnetic field. This
computational model suggests another signature for the presence of these
topologically protected bound states can be found in the magnetic field
dependence of devices with loop geometries.

these viscous ECS are not suitable candidates for quasi-coherent structures

viscous ECS cannot account for the singular nature of the inertial domain,
where the flow self-organizes into uniform momentum zones (UMZs) separated by
internal shear layers and the instantaneous streamwise velocity develops a
staircase-like profile. In this investigation, a large-Re asymptotic analysis

sustain a spatially-distributed array of much larger-scale, effectively
inviscid streamwise roll motions. In contrast to other self-sustaining process
theories, the rolls are sufficiently strong to differentially homogenize the

perturbation parameter. Numerical results are presented to verify the
theoretical findings.
  The new method uses piecewise quadratic polynomials, and is of the lowest
degree possible. Optimal order approximation property of the finite element
space is proved by means of a locally-averaged interpolation operator newly
constructed. This interpolator, however, is not a projection. Indeed, we
establish a general theory and show that no locally defined interpolation
associated with the locally supported basis functions can be projective for the
finite element space in use. Particularly, the general theory gives an answer

means of suitable coordinate transformations. The droplet surface temperature
and mass fraction of fuel vapor are determined by the matching conditions at

the unsteadiness factor and droplet vaporization lifetime. The theoretical
model successfully reveals the conventional recognition of droplet vaporization
characteristics, and its predicted droplet size history agrees well with

Momentum, would be the most popular stochastic optimizer for accelerating the
training of deep neural networks. However, it is empirically known that Adam
often generalizes worse than Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The purpose of
this paper is to unveil the mystery of this behavior in the diffusion
theoretical framework. Specifically, we disentangle the effects of Adaptive
Learning Rate and Momentum of the Adam dynamics on saddle-point escaping and
flat minima selection. We prove that Adaptive Learning Rate can escape saddle
points efficiently, but cannot select flat minima as SGD does. In contrast,
Momentum provides a drift effect to help the training process pass through
saddle points, and almost does not affect flat minima selection. This partly
explains why SGD (with Momentum) generalizes better, while Adam generalizes
worse but converges faster. Furthermore, motivated by the analysis, we design a
novel adaptive optimization framework named Adaptive Inertia, which uses
parameter-wise adaptive inertia to accelerate the training and provably favors
flat minima as well as SGD. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed adaptive inertia method can generalize significantly better than SGD
and conventional adaptive gradient methods.

$\sim 1$ keV cm$^{-3}$ over the range from sub-Milky Way dwarfs to bright

Way-like systems, CR pressure is typically comparable to turbulent gas and
magnetic pressure at the galactic midplane, but the ratio of CR pressure to gas
pressure drops to $\sim 10^{-3}$ in dense starbursts. Galaxies also become
increasingly CR calorimetric and gamma-ray bright in this limit. The degree of
calorimetry at fixed galaxy properties is sensitive to the assumed model for CR
transport, and in particular to the time CRs spend interacting with neutral

these winds might play in regulating galaxies' star formation rates. Using a
detailed treatment of the transport and losses of hadronic CRs developed in the
previous paper in this series, here we develop a semi-analytic model that
allows us to assess the viability of using CRs to launch cool winds from
galactic discs. In particular, we determine the critical CR fluxes -- and
corresponding star formation rate surface densities -- above which hydrostatic
equilibrium within a given galaxy is precluded because CRs drive the gas off in
a wind or otherwise render it unstable. We show that, for star-forming galaxies
with lower gas surface densities typical of the Galaxy and local dwarfs, the
locus of this CR stability curve patrols the high side of the observed
distribution of galaxies in the Kennicutt-Schmidt parameter space of star
formation rate versus gas surface density. However, hadronic losses render CRs
unable to drive winds in galaxies with higher surface densities. Our results
show that quiescent, low surface density galaxies like the Milky Way are poised
on the cusp of instability, such that small changes to ISM parameters can lead
to the launching of CR-driven outflows, and we suggest that, as a result, CR
feedback sets an ultimate limit to the star formation efficiency of most modern

and subsequent decay of a dark gauge boson $V_\mu$ may be responsible for the
excess. The relevant semi-annihilation process is $X+X\rightarrow
\overline{X}+V_\mu (\rightarrow \psi + \overline{\psi})$, in which the final
$\psi$ has a box-shape energy spectrum. The fast-moving $\psi$ can scatter with
electron through an additional gauge boson that mixes with photon kinetically.
The shape of the signals in this model can be consistent with the observed
excess. The additional interaction with proton makes this model testable in
future searches for nucleus recoil as well. Because of the lightness of
invisible particle introduced, this scenario requires non-standard cosmology to
accommodate the additional radiation component.

discrete grids for approximating solutions to stochastic differential equations
in d-dimensions. Product Markovian quantization (PMQ) reduces this problem to d
one-dimensional quantization problems by recursively constructing product
quantizers, as opposed to a truly optimal quantizer. However, the standard
Newton-Raphson method used in the PMQ algorithm suffers from numerical
instabilities, inhibiting widespread adoption, especially for use in
calibration. By directly specifying the random variable to be quantized at each
time step, we show that PMQ, and RMQ in one dimension, can be expressed as
standard vector quantization. This reformulation allows the application of the
accelerated Lloyd's algorithm in an adaptive and robust procedure. Furthermore,
in the case of stochastic volatility models, we extend the PMQ algorithm by
using higher-order updates for the volatility or variance process. We
illustrate the technique for European options, using the Heston model, and more
exotic products, using the SABR model.

exposure stack from a given single exposure utilizes a deep learning framework

often fail to fuse the multi-exposure stack into a perceptually pleasant HDR
image as the inversion artifacts occur. We tackle the problem in stack
reconstruction-based methods by proposing a novel framework with a fully

the loss, which compares the network's output with the ground truth HDR image,
our framework enables a neural network that generates the multiple exposure
stack for HDRI to train stably. In other words, our differentiable HDR
synthesis layer helps the deep neural network to train to create multi-exposure
stacks while reflecting the precise correlations between multi-exposure images
in the HDRI process. In addition, our network uses the image decomposition and
the recursive process to facilitate the exposure transfer task and to
adaptively respond to recursion frequency. The experimental results show that
the proposed network outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitative and
qualitative results in terms of both the exposure transfer tasks and the whole

to the disk because of the strong light bending in the vicinity of the compact

spectrum of the source, it is often neglected in theoretical models. In the
present paper, we study the impact of the returning radiation on relativistic
reflection spectra. Assuming neutral material in the disk, we estimate the
systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the properties of the system
when we fit the data with a theoretical model that neglects the returning
radiation. Our NICER simulations show that the inclination angle of the disk
and the black hole spin parameter tend to be overestimated for low viewing
angles, while no clear bias is observed for high viewing angles. The iron
abundance of the disk is never overestimated. In the most extreme cases (in
particular, for maximally rotating black holes) the returning radiation
flattens the radial emissivity beyond a few gravitational radii. In such cases,
it also produces residuals that cannot be compensated by adjusting the
parameters of models neglecting the returning radiation. This may be an
important issue for interpretation of data from future X-ray missions (e.g.
Athena). When we simulate some observations with NuSTAR and we fit data above

block models (SBMs) has received much attention lately. In this paper, we focus
on the binary symmetric SBM -- in which a graph of $n$ vertices is randomly
generated by first partitioning the vertices into two equal-sized communities
and then connecting each pair of vertices with probability that depends on
their community memberships -- and study the associated exact community
recovery problem. Although the maximum-likelihood formulation of the problem is
non-convex and discrete, we propose to tackle it using a popular iterative
method called projected power iterations. To ensure fast convergence of the
method, we initialize it using a point that is generated by another iterative
method called orthogonal iterations, which is a classic method for computing
invariant subspaces of a symmetric matrix. We show that in the logarithmic
sparsity regime of the problem, with high probability the proposed two-stage
method can exactly recover the two communities down to the
information-theoretic limit in $\mathcal{O}(n\log^2n/\log\log n)$ time, which
is competitive with a host of existing state-of-the-art methods that have the
same recovery performance. We also conduct numerical experiments on both
synthetic and real data sets to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method

methodology for quantum chemistry based on near-term quantum devices. However,
many problems are yet to be investigated for this methodology, such as the
influences of optimization algorithm and basis size on the accuracy and
efficiency for quantum computing. To address these issues, five molecules (H2,
LiH, HF, N2 and F2) are studied in this work based on the VQE method using
unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz. The performance of the gradient
optimization L-BFGS-B is compared with that of the direct search method COBYLA.
The former converges more quickly, but the accuracy of energy surface is a
little lower. The basis set shows a vital influence on the accuracy and
efficiency. A large basis set generally provides an accurate energy surface,
but induces a significant increase in computing time. The 631g basis is
generally required from the energy surface of the simplest H2 molecule. For
practical applications of VQE, complete active space (CAS) is suggested based
on limited quantum resources. With the same number of qubits, more occupied
orbitals included in CAS gives a better accuracy for the energy surface and a
smaller evaluation number in the VQE optimization. Additionally, the electronic
structure, such as filling fraction of orbitals, the bond strength of a
molecule and the maximum nuclear charge also influences the performance of
optimization, where half occupation of orbitals generally requires a large
computation cost.

toward the IRS2 massive young stellar object in the Monoceros R2 star-forming
cluster. The H21alpha line shows maser amplification, which allows us to study
the kinematics and physical structure of the ionised gas around the massive
protostar down to spatial scales of ~1-2 au. Our ALMA images and 3D radiative
transfer modelling reveal that the ionized gas around IRS2 is distributed in a
Keplerian circumstellar disk and an expanding wind. The H21alpha emission
centroids at velocities between -10 and 20 km s-1 deviate from the disk plane,
suggesting a warping for the disk. This could be explained by the presence of a
secondary object (a stellar companion or a massive planet) within the system.
The ionized wind seems to be launched from the disk surface at distances ~11 au
from the central star, consistent with magnetically-regulated disk wind models.
This suggests a similar wind launching mechanism to that recently found for
evolved massive stars such as MWC349A and MWC922.

is constructed from an event tree through a sequence of transformations

in the pion production path, while the $\pi^{-}/\pi^{+}$ ratio in reactions at
near threshold energies remains its sensitivity to the symmetry energy. By
comparing the calculations to the FOPI data, we obtain a model dependent
conclusion on the symmetry energy and the symmetry energy at two times normal
density is $S(2\rho_0)$=38-73 MeV within $1\sigma$ uncertainties. Under the
constraints of tidal deformability and maximum mass of neutron star, the
symmetry energy at two times normal density is reduced to $48-58$ MeV and slope
of symmetry energy $L=54-81$ MeV, and it is consistent with the constraints
from ASY-EOS flow data.

several learned video compression methods are superior to DVC, but currently
none of them provides open source codes. We hope that our OpenDVC codes are
able to provide a useful model for further development, and facilitate future
researches on learned video compression. Different from the original DVC, which
is only optimized for PSNR, we release not only the PSNR-optimized
re-implementation, denoted by OpenDVC (PSNR), but also the MS-SSIM-optimized

  Trajectory and Scheduling Design in UAV-assisted Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless network is
considered in which a battery-constrained UAV is assumed to move towards
energy-constrained ground nodes to receive status updates about their observed
processes. The UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling of status updates are
jointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum
of Age of Information (NWAoI) values for different physical processes at the
UAV. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer program. Then, for a
given scheduling policy, a convex optimization-based solution is proposed to
derive the UAV's optimal flight trajectory and time instants on updates.
However, finding the optimal scheduling policy is challenging due to the
combinatorial nature of the formulated problem. Therefore, to complement the
proposed convex optimization-based solution, a finite-horizon Markov decision
process (MDP) is used to find the optimal scheduling policy. Since the state
space of the MDP is extremely large, a novel neural combinatorial-based deep
reinforcement learning (NCRL) algorithm using deep Q-network (DQN) is proposed
to obtain the optimal policy. However, for large-scale scenarios with numerous
nodes, the DQN architecture cannot efficiently learn the optimal scheduling
policy anymore. Motivated by this, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based
autoencoder is proposed to map the state space to a fixed-size vector
representation in such large-scale scenarios. A lower bound on the minimum
NWAoI is analytically derived which provides system design guidelines on the
appropriate choice of importance weights for different nodes. The numerical
results also demonstrate that the proposed NCRL approach can significantly
improve the achievable NWAoI per process compared to the baseline policies,
such as weight-based and discretized state DQN policies.

correlation between features and ignoring those unexpected correlations will
hurt the performance of clustering algorithms. Therefore, how to remove those

largely unexplored for clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel
Decorrelation regularized K-Means algorithm (DCKM) for clustering with data
selection bias. Specifically, the decorrelation regularizer aims to learn the
global sample weights which are capable of balancing the sample distribution,
so as to remove unexpected correlations among features. Meanwhile, the learned
weights are combined with k-means, which makes the reweighted k-means cluster
on the inherent data distribution without unexpected correlation influence.
Moreover, we derive the updating rules to effectively infer the parameters in
DCKM. Extensive experiments results on real world datasets well demonstrate
that our DCKM algorithm achieves significant performance gains, indicating the
necessity of removing unexpected feature correlations induced by selection bias

only one of these performance metrics. However, these metrics may be mutually
competitive, as they share the same communication and computing resource in a
road segment. From the perspective of joint optimizing driving safety, vehicle

limited communication bandwidth and on-board processing capacity incur the

whose data is part of the training set. Several recent attacks have been able
to infer sensitive information from trained models, including model inversion

certain sensitive features of individuals who participated in training the
model. It has also been shown that several factors can contribute to an
increased risk of model inversion, including feature influence. We observe that
not all features necessarily share the same level of privacy or sensitivity. In
many cases, certain features used to train a model are considered especially
sensitive and therefore propitious candidates for inversion. We present a
solution for countering model inversion attacks in tree-based models, by
reducing the influence of sensitive features in these models. This is an avenue
that has not yet been thoroughly investigated, with only very nascent previous
attempts at using this as a countermeasure against attribute inference. Our
work shows that, in many cases, it is possible to train a model in different
ways, resulting in different influence levels of the various features, without
necessarily harming the model's accuracy. We are able to utilize this fact to
train models in a manner that reduces the model's reliance on the most
sensitive features, while increasing the importance of less sensitive features.
Our evaluation confirms that training models in this manner reduces the risk of
inference for those features, as demonstrated through several black-box and
white-box attacks.

susceptibility is observed. Upon increasing $x$, despite the absence of
magnetic order, the $B_{2g}$ nematic susceptibility increases and becomes
dominant, closely following the strength of the $(\pi, \pi)$ spin fluctuations.
Over a wide range of compositions ($0.17 \leq x \leq 0.53$), while the $B_{2g}$
nematic susceptibility follows a Curie temperature dependence (with zero Weiss
temperature) at low temperatures, it shows deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior
for temperatures higher than $50K$. This is the opposite of what is observed in
typical iron pnictides, where Curie-Weiss deviations are seen at low
temperatures. We attribute this unusual temperature dependence to a loss of
coherence of the $d_{xy}$ orbital, which is supported by our theoretical
calculations. Our results highlight the importance of orbital differentiation

variable is sufficient to explain most of the covariance among a set of

assumption that it is the underlying latent, rather than the indicators, that
is causally efficacious. The assumption that the indicators do not have effects

imposing a structural interpretation on the latent factor model. In this paper,
we show that this structural assumption has empirically testable implications,

investigates the variability of photospheric emission in a variable jet. By
setting a constant $\eta$ (dimensionless entropy of the jet), we find that the
light curve of the photospheric emission shows a ``tracking'' pattern on the
time profile of jet power. However, the relative variability is significantly
low in the photospheric emission compared with that in the jet power. If the
$\eta$ is genetic variable, the variability of the photospheric emission is not
only limited by the jet power but also affected by $\eta$ strongly. It becomes
complex and is generally different from that of the jet power. Moreover, the
opposite phase may stand in the variabilities of the photospheric emission at
different photon energies. We also find that the relative variability does not
remain constant over the photon energies with an obvious reduction at a certain
energy. This is consistent with the analysis of GRB 090902B in which an
appreciable thermal component has been detected in a wide energy range. For
several other GRBs coupling with the thermal component, we conservatively
evaluate the variability of the thermal and non-thermal emission, respectively.

likely comparable to that of the non-thermal emission for these bursts. In

are necessary, and how to compute their exact outcomes. In general, we show
that such questions are more tractable to compute for LIKE than for BALANCED
LIKE. As LIKE is strategy-proof but BALANCED LIKE is not, we also consider the
computational problem of how, with BALANCED LIKE, an agent can compute a
strategic bid to improve their outcome. We prove that this problem is

nonlinear nonlocal elliptic equations with kernels that satisfy a mild
continuity assumption. An interesting feature of our main result is that the
obtained regularity is better than one might expect when considering
corresponding results for local elliptic equations in divergence form with
continuous coefficients. Therefore, in some sense our result can be considered
to be of purely nonlocal type, following the trend of various such purely
nonlocal phenomena observed in recent years. Our approach can be summarized as
follows. First, we use certain test functions that involve discrete fractional
derivatives in order to obtain higher H\""older regularity for homogeneous
equations driven by a locally translation invariant kernel, while the global
behaviour of the kernel is allowed to be more general. This enables us to
deduce the desired regularity in the general case by an approximation argument.

Balanced Like and Maximum Like allocation mechanisms firstly introduced for
online fair division problems. Our first contribution is that we perform a
competitive analysis of these mechanisms with respect to the expected size of
the matching, the utilitarian welfare, and the egalitarian welfare. We also
suppose that an oracle can give a number of advice bits to the mechanisms. Our

provide a good example of a quantum fluid naturally suited to studies of
acoustic Hawking radiation. Due to rapid longitudinal expansion, presence of a
sonic horizon is also naturally guaranteed here, though, in general, this
horizon is not static. Using Ultra relativistic quantum molecular dynamics
(UrQMD) simulations, we show that, under certain conditions, the longitudinal

a short span during the evolution of the system. During this period, we can
have a conformally static acoustic metric with a (conformal) Killing horizon
coinciding with the apparent horizon. An asymptotic observer will then see a
thermal flux of phonons, constituting the Hawking radiation, coming from the
horizon. For the relatively low energy collision considered here, where the
resulting QCD system is governed by non-relativistic hydrodynamics, we estimate
the Hawking temperature to be about 4-5 MeV (with the temperature of the QCD
fluid being about 135 MeV). We discuss the experimental signatures of this
Hawking radiation in terms of a thermal component in the rapidity dependence of
the transverse momentum distribution of detected particles. We also discuss
extension to ultra-relativistic case which should lead to a higher Hawking

general relativity by introducing a non-minimal coupling between the scalar
field and gravity. The Solar System tests put tight constraints on the theory.
In order to evade these constraints, various screening mechanisms have been
proposed. These screening mechanisms allow the scalar field to couple to matter
as strongly as gravity in low density environments while suppressing it in the
Solar System. The Vainshtein mechanism, which is found in various modified
gravity models such as massive gravity, braneworld models and scalar tensor
theories, suppresses the scalar field efficiently in the vicinity of a massive
object. This makes it difficult to test these theories from gravitational wave
observations. We point out that the recently found scalar gravitational wave
memory effect, which is caused by a permanent change in spacetime geometry due
to the collapse of a star to a back hole can be significantly enhanced in the
Brans-Dicke theory of gravity with the Vainshtein mechanism. This provides a

better the quality and generic-nature of the features produced by the network,
the better is the performance of the network on few-shot learning. Our approach
aims to train networks to produce such features by using a self-supervised

rotation at two levels, i.e., rotation of patches inside the image (inner
rotation) and rotation of the whole image (outer rotation) and assigns one out
of 16 rotation classes to the modified image. We then simultaneously train for
the composite rotation prediction task along with the original classification
task, which forces the network to learn high-quality generic features that help
improve the few-shot classification performance. We experimentally show that
our approach performs better than existing few-shot learning methods on

artificial intelligence (AI) applications recently due to its capability of
learning high-level features from big data. However, the current demand of DNNs
for computational resources especially the storage consumption is growing due
to that the increasing sizes of models are being required for more and more
complicated applications. To address this problem, several tensor decomposition
methods including tensor-train (TT) and tensor-ring (TR) have been applied to
compress DNNs and shown considerable compression effectiveness. In this work,
we introduce the hierarchical Tucker (HT), a classical but rarely-used tensor
decomposition method, to investigate its capability in neural network
compression. We convert the weight matrices and convolutional kernels to both
HT and TT formats for comparative study, since the latter is the most widely
used decomposition method and the variant of HT. We further theoretically and
experimentally discover that the HT format has better performance on
compressing weight matrices, while the TT format is more suited for compressing
convolutional kernels. Based on this phenomenon we propose a strategy of hybrid
tensor decomposition by combining TT and HT together to compress convolutional
and fully connected parts separately and attain better accuracy than only using
the TT or HT format on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our work
illuminates the prospects of hybrid tensor decomposition for neural network
compression.

despite promising results for some specific tasks. This is partly due to data
being in insufficient quantities hurting the training of the models. To address
this issue, data from multiple health actors or patients could be combined by
capitalizing on their heterogeneity through the use of transfer learning.
  To improve the quality of the transfer between multiple sources of data, we
propose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning framework that enables the
learning of a feature representation that is similar across the sources, and
thus more general and more easily transferable. We apply this idea to glucose
forecasting for diabetic people using a fully convolutional neural network. The
evaluation is done by exploring various transfer scenarios with three datasets
characterized by their high inter and intra variability.
  While transferring knowledge is beneficial in general, we show that the
statistical and clinical accuracies can be further improved by using of the
adversarial training methodology, surpassing the current state-of-the-art
results. In particular, it shines when using data from different datasets, or
when there is too little data in an intra-dataset situation. To understand the
behavior of the models, we analyze the learnt feature representations and
propose a new metric in this regard. Contrary to a standard transfer, the
adversarial transfer does not discriminate the patients and datasets, helping
the learning of a more general feature representation.
  The adversarial training framework improves the learning of a general feature
representation in a multi-source environment, enhancing the knowledge transfer
to an unseen target.
  The proposed method can help improve the efficiency of data shared by
different health actors in the training of deep models.

type-1 diabetic patients coming from the OhioT1DM dataset. The predictive
models are personalized to the patient and evaluated on 3 different prediction
horizons (30, 60, and 120 minutes) with metrics assessing their accuracy and
clinical acceptability.
  The results of nine different models coming from the glucose-prediction
literature are presented. First, they show that standard autoregressive linear
models are outclassed by kernel-based non-linear ones and neural networks. In
particular, the support vector regression model stands out, being at the same

relative performances of the models are the same for both datasets. This shows
that, even though data simulated by T1DMS are not fully representative of
real-world data, they can be used to assess the forecasting ability of the
glucose-predictive models.
  Those results serve as a basis of comparison for future studies. In a field

transition amplitudes is extended to the treatment of the self-energies of a
fermion and an (IR-regulated) vector boson, in order to pave the way for
constructing a comprehensive application of the technique to both gap- and
Bethe-Salpeter equations, in Minkowski space. The achieved result, namely a
6-channel coupled system of integral equations, eventually allows one to
determine the three K\""all\'en-Lehman weights for fully dressing the
propagators of fermion and photon. A first consistency check is also provided.
The presented formal elaboration points to embed the characteristics of the
non-perturbative regime at a more fundamental level. It yields a viable tool in
Minkowski space for the phenomenological investigation of strongly interacting
theories, within a QFT framework where the dynamical ingredients are made
transparent and under control.

argue this sort of low level cognitive interaction, where control is shared in
dyadic encounters, is susceptible of study with neural robots. Hence, in this
work we pursue three main objectives. Firstly, from the concept of active

experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition,
and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction.
Secondly, we propose an open-source methodology named \textit{neural robotics

program for interacting in real-time with a virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot).
Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot (hybrid)

system with a single heat source at constant temperature can convert heat into
mechanical work in a recurrent manner. First we note that this is equivalent to
cyclo-passivity at the mechanical port of the thermodynamic system, while the
temperature at the thermal port of the system is kept constant. This leads to
the general system-theoretic question which systems with two power ports have
similar behavior: when is a system cyclo-passive at one of its ports, while the
output variable at the other port (such as the temperature in the thermodynamic
case) is kept constant? This property is called `one-port cyclo-passivity', and
entails, whenever it holds, a fundamental limitation to energy transfer from
one port (where the output is kept constant) to the other port. Sufficient
conditions for one-port cyclo-passivity are derived for systems formulated in
general port-Hamiltonian form. This is illustrated by a variety of examples
from different {(multi-)}physical domains; from coupled inductors and capacitor
microphones to synchronous machines.

via either capturing the companion's wind or Roche lobe overflow (RLO). As
shown in our previous work that focusing on the formation and evolution of
detached BH binaries, our assumed models relevant to BH's progenitors predicted
significantly different binary properties \citep{sl19}. In this paper, we
further follow the evolutionary paths of the BH systems that appearing as XRBs.
By use of both binary population synthesis and detailed binary evolution
calculations, we can obtain the potential population of BH XRBs. Distributions
at the current epoch of various binary parameters have been computed. The
observed sample of wind-fed XRBs can be well reproduced under assumption of all
our models. The wind-fed XRBs are expected to be so rare ($ \lesssim 100 $)
that only a couple of such systems have been detected. Comparison of known RLO
XRBs with the calculated distributions of various binary parameters indicates
that only the models assuming relatively small masses for BH progenitors can
roughly match the observations. Accordingly we estimate that there are hundreds
of RLO XRBs in the Milky Way, of which the majority are low-mass XRBs. The RLO
systems may become ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) if the BH accretes at a
very high rate, we expect that about a dozen ULXs with a BH accretor may exist

underlying security analysis. In particular, the security analyses determines
the key-rate, i.e., the amount of cryptographic key material that can be
distributed per time unit. Nowadays, the security analyses of various QKD
protocols are well understood. It is known that optimal protocol parameters,
such as the number of decoy states and their intensities, can be found by
solving a nonlinear optimization problem. The complexity of this optimization
problem is typically handled by making an number of heuristic assumptions. For
instance, the number of decoy states is restricted to only one or two, with one
of the decoy intensities set to a fixed value, and vacuum states are ignored as
they are assumed to contribute only marginally to the secure key-rate. These
assumptions simplify the optimization problem and reduce the size of search
space significantly. However, they also cause the security analysis to be
non-tight, and thereby result in sub-optimal performance.
  In this work, we follow a more rigorous approach using both linear and
non-linear programs describing the optimization problem. Our approach, focusing
on the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, allows heuristic assumptions to be omitted,
and therefore results in a tighter security analysis with better protocol
parameters. We show an improved performance for the Decoy-State BB84 QKD
protocol, demonstrating that the heuristic assumptions typically made are too
restrictive. Moreover, our improved optimization frameworks shows that the
complexity of the performance optimization problem can also be handled without
making heuristic assumptions, even with limited computational resources
available.

trions. The analogy is valid to the extent that the Chevy Ansatz provides a
good description of dynamical screening of excitons and provided the Fermi

closed symmetric linear relation $T$ in a Krein space $\mathfrak{H}$. Let

with two main topics. First, since $M_\Gamma$ need not be (generalized)
Nevanlinna, the characterization of the closure and the adjoint of a linear
relation $M_\Gamma(z)$, for some $z\in\mathbb{C}\smallsetminus\mathbb{R}$,
becomes a nontrivial task. Regarding $M_\Gamma(z)$ as the (Shmul'yan) transform
of $zI$ induced by $\Gamma$, we give conditions for the equality in
$\overline{M_\Gamma(z)}\subseteq\overline{M_{\overline{\Gamma}}(z)}$ to hold
and we compute the adjoint $M_{\overline{\Gamma}}(z)^*$. As an application we
ask when the resolvent set of the main transform associated with a unitary
boundary pair for $T^+$ is nonempty. Based on the criterion for the closeness
of $M_\Gamma(z)$ we give a sufficient condition for the answer. It follows, for
example, that, if $T$ is a standard linear relation in a Pontryagin space then
the Weyl family $M_\Gamma$ corresponding to a boundary relation $\Gamma$ for
$T^+$ is a generalized Nevanlinna family. In the second topic we characterize
the transformed boundary pair $(\mathfrak{L}^\prime,\Gamma^\prime)$ with its
Weyl family $M_{\Gamma^\prime}$. The transformation scheme is either
$\Gamma^\prime=\Gamma V^{-1}$ or $\Gamma^\prime=V\Gamma$ with suitable linear
relations $V$. Results in this direction include but are not limited to: a 1-1

variation in synthetic speech.Despite successes in this effort, the
state-of-the-art systems fall short of faithfully reproducing local prosodic
events that give rise to, e.g., word-level emphasis and phrasal structure. This
type of prosodic variation often reflects long-distance semantic relationships
that are not accessible for end-to-end systems with a single sentence as their
synthesis domain. One of the possible solutions might be conditioning the
synthesized speech by explicit prosodic labels, potentially generated using
longer portions of text. In this work we evaluate whether augmenting the
textual input with such prosodic labels capturing word-level prominence and
phrasal boundary strength can result in more accurate realization of sentence
prosody. We use an automatic wavelet-based technique to extract such labels
from speech material, and use them as an input to a tacotron-like synthesis
system alongside textual information. The results of objective evaluation of
synthesized speech show that using the prosodic labels significantly improves
the output in terms of faithfulness of f0 and energy contours, in comparison
with state-of-the-art implementations.

runs and squares, naturally extend to two-dimensional strings. We consider two
types of repetitions in 2D-strings: 2D-runs and quartics (quartics are a
2D-version of squares in standard strings). Amir et al. introduced 2D-runs,
showed that there are $O(n^3)$ of them in an $n \times n$ 2D-string and
presented a simple construction giving a lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ for their
number (TCS 2020). We make a significant step towards closing the gap between
these bounds by showing that the number of 2D-runs in an $n \times n$ 2D-string
is $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$. In particular, our bound implies that the $O(n^2\log n +
\textsf{output})$ run-time of the algorithm of Amir et al. for computing
2D-runs is also $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$. We expect this result to allow for
exploiting 2D-runs algorithmically in the area of 2D pattern matching.
  A quartic is a 2D-string composed of $2 \times 2$ identical blocks
(2D-strings) that was introduced by Apostolico and Brimkov (TCS 2000), where by
quartics they meant only primitively rooted quartics, i.e. built of a primitive
block. Here our notion of quartics is more general and analogous to that of
squares in 1D-strings. Apostolico and Brimkov showed that there are $O(n^2
\log^2 n)$ occurrences of primitively rooted quartics in an $n \times n$
2D-string and that this bound is attainable. Consequently the number of
distinct primitively rooted quartics is $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$. Here, we prove that
the number of distinct general quartics is also $O(n^2 \log^2 n)$. This extends
the rich combinatorial study of the number of distinct squares in a 1D-string,
that was initiated by Fraenkel and Simpson (J. Comb. Theory A 1998), to two
dimensions.
  Finally, we show some algorithmic applications of 2D-runs. (Abstract

discretisations that track the moving phase boundary. However standard
phase-field models are only first-order accurate. They often incur an error
proportional to the thickness of the diffuse interface. We eliminate this
dominant error by developing a general framework for asymptotic analysis of
diffuse-interface methods in arbitrary geometries. With this framework we can
consistently unify previous second-order phase-field models of melting and

finally validate second-order convergence of our model in two comprehensive

exploitation of excitons in advanced technological applications is a detailed
understanding of their dynamical nature. However, the ultrafast processes
unfolding on few-femtosecond and attosecond time scales, of primary relevance
in view of the desired extension of electronic devices towards the petahertz

reflection spectroscopy in a sequential two-foci geometry and observe
sub-femtosecond dynamics of a core-level exciton in bulk MgF$_2$ single

the latter dominates the attosecond excitonic response and originates by the

aligned 3D models is very difficult. The main contribution of this work is to
lift this restriction by training a neural rendering algorithm from unpaired
data. More specifically, we propose an autoencoder for joint generation of
realistic images from synthetic 3D models while simultaneously decomposing real
images into their intrinsic shape and appearance properties. In contrast to a
traditional graphics pipeline, our approach does not require to specify all
scene properties, such as material parameters and lighting by hand. Instead, we
learn photo-realistic deferred rendering from a small set of 3D models and a
larger set of unaligned real images, both of which are easy to acquire in
practice. Simultaneously, we obtain accurate intrinsic decompositions of real

reconstruction of single-photon absorption and two-photon absorption
coefficients in photoacoustic tomography (PAT). This framework comprises of
minimizing an objective functional involving a least squares fit of the
interior pressure field data corresponding to two boundary source functions,
where the absorption coefficients and the photon density are related through a
semi-linear elliptic partial differential equation (PDE) arising in PAT.
Further, the objective functional consists of an $L^1$ regularization term that
promotes sparsity patterns in absorption coefficients. The motivation for this
framework primarily comes from some recent works related to solving inverse
problems in acousto-electric tomography and current density impedance
tomography. We provide a new proof of existence and uniqueness of a solution to
the semi-linear PDE. Further, a proximal method, involving a Picard solver for
the semi-linear PDE and its adjoint, is used to solve the optimization problem.
Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework.

generic inversion framework. The core of this framework is nonconvex sparse
recovery, for which we develop two algorithms: one extends the conventional
nonlinear least squares (NLS) to the single-look multi-master data model, and
the other is based on bi-convex relaxation and alternating minimization
(BiCRAM). We provide two theorems for the objective function of the NLS
subproblem, which lead to its analytic solution up to a constant phase angle in
the one-dimensional case. We also report our findings from the experiments on
different acceleration techniques for BiCRAM. The proposed algorithms are
applied to a real TerraSAR-X data set, and validated with height ground truth
made available via a SAR imaging geodesy and simulation framework. This shows
empirically that the \emph{single-master} approach, if applied to a single-look
\emph{multi-master} stack, can be insufficient for layover separation, and the
\emph{multi-master} approach can indeed perform slightly better (despite being
computationally more expensive) even in the case of single scatterers. Besides,
this paper also sheds light on the special case of single-look bistatic SAR
tomography, which is relevant for current and future SAR missions such as
TanDEM-X and Tandem-L.

equation's separability into decoupled radial and angular differential
equations is a crucial step in analytical and numerical computations of
quantities like eigenvalues, quasinormal modes and bound states. However, this
separation has been performed in co-ordinate systems that are not well-behaved
in either limiting regions of $r \rightarrow r_{horizon}$, $r \rightarrow
r_\infty$ or both. In particular, the extensively used Boyer-Lindquist
co-ordinates contains unphysical features of spacetime geometry for both
$r_{horizon}$ and $r_\infty$. Therefore, motivated by the recently developed
compact hyperboloidal co-ordinate system for Kerr Black Holes that is well
behaved in these limiting regions, we attempt the separation of the Dirac
equation. We first construct a null tetrad suitable for the separability
analysis under the Newman-Penrose formalism. Then, an unexpected result is
shown that by using the standard separability procedure based on the mode
ansatz under this tetrad, the Dirac equation does not decouple into radial and
angular equationsPossible reasons for this behaviour as well as importance of
proving separability for various computations are discussed.

latter are large-N systems with long relaxation timescales and can be simulated
disregarding two-body interactions, while either computationally expensive
direct N-body simulations or approximate schemes are required to properly model
the former. Large globular clusters and nuclear star clusters, with relaxation
timescales of the order of a Hubble time, are small enough to display some
collisional behaviour and big enough to be impossible to simulate with direct
$N$-body codes and current hardware. We introduce a new method to simulate
collisional stellar systems, and validate it by comparison with direct $N$-body
codes on small-$N$ simulations. The Multi-Particle collision for Dense stellar
systems Code (MPCDSS) is a new code for evolving stellar systems with the
Multi-Particle Collision method. Such method amounts to a stochastic collision
rule that allows to conserve exactly the energy and momentum over a cluster of
particles experiencing the collision. The code complexity scales with $N \log
N$ in the number of particles. Unlike Monte-Carlo codes, MPCDSS can easily
model asymmetric, non-homogeneous, unrelaxed and rotating systems, while
allowing us to follow the orbits of individual stars. We evolve small ($N = 3.2
\times 10^4$) star clusters with MPCDSS and with the direct-summation code
NBODY6, finding a similar evolution of key indicators. We then simulate
different initial conditions in the $10^4 - 10^6$ star range. MPCDSS bridges
the gap between small, collisional systems that can be simulated with direct
$N$-body codes and large noncollisional systems. MPCDSS in principle allows us
to simulate globular clusters such as Omega Cen and M54 and even the nuclear
star cluster, beyond the limits of current direct N-body codes in terms of the

charm distributions and unintegrated (transverse momentum dependent) gluon
distributions. For the collinear-factorization approach we use matrix elements
for both massless and massive charm quarks/antiquarks. The distributions in
rapidity and transverse momentum of charm quark/antiquark are shown for a few
different models of IC. Forward charm production is dominated by $gc$-fusion
processes. The IC contribution dominates over the standard pQCD (extrinsic)
$gg$-fusion mechanism of $c\bar c$-pair production at large rapidities or
Feynman-$x_F$. We perform similar calculations within leading-order and

approach leads to much larger cross sections than the LO collinear approach. At
high energies and large rapidities of $c$-quark or $\bar c$-antiquark one tests
gluon distributions at extremely small $x$. The IC contribution has important
consequences for high-energy neutrino production in the Ice-Cube experiment and

and failures than bottom-fixed counterparts due to the severe wind and wave
loads typical of deep water sites. In particular, mooring line faults may lead
to unacceptably high operation and maintenance costs due to the limited
accessibility of FOWTs. Detecting the mooring line faults is therefore
critical, but the application of Fault Detection (FD) techniques has not been
investigated yet. In this paper, an FD scheme based on a wave-excited linear
model is developed to detect in a reliable way critical mooring line faults
occurring at the fairlead and anchor ends. To reach the goal, a linear model of
the FOWT is obtained by approximating the wave radiation and incident wave
forces. Based on this model, an observer is built to predict the rigid rotor
and platform dynamics. The FD scheme is thus implemented by comparing the
Mahalanobis Distance of the observer prediction error against a probabilistic
detection threshold. Numerical simulations in some selected fault scenarios
show that the wave-excited linear model can predict the FOWT dynamics with good
accuracy. Based on this, the FD scheme capabilities are demonstrated, showing
that it is able to effectively detect two critical mooring line faults.

ram-pressure stripping (RPS) spanning a wide range in galaxy mass and host
cluster mass. We use this rich sample to study how the star formation rate
(SFR) in the tails of stripped gas depends on the properties of the galaxy and
its host cluster. We show that the interplay between all the parameters
involved is complex and that there is not a single, dominant one in shaping the
observed amount of SFR. Hence, we develop a simple analytical approach to
describe the mass fraction of stripped gas and the SFR in the tail, as a
function of the cluster velocity dispersion, galaxy stellar mass,
clustercentric distance and speed in the intracluster medium. Our model
provides a good description of the observed gas truncation radius and of the
fraction of star-formation rate (SFR) observed in the stripped tails, once we
take into account the fact that the star formation efficiency in the tails is a
factor $\sim 5$ lower than in the galaxy disc, in agreement with GASP ongoing
HI and CO observations. We finally estimate the contribution of RPS to the
intracluster light (ICL) and find that the average SFR in the tails of
ram-pressure stripped gas is $\sim 0.22 M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1} $ per
cluster. By extrapolating this result to evaluate the contribution to the ICL
at different epochs, we compute an integrated average value per cluster of
$\sim 4 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ of stars formed in the tails of RPS galaxies since

of engineering problems. Impulsive interventions are often employed to control
stochastic systems; however, the modeling and analysis subject to execution
delay have been less explored. In addition, continuously receiving information
of the dynamics is not always possible. In this paper, with an application to
an environmental restoration problem, a continuous-time stochastic impulse
control problem subject to execution delay under discrete and random
observations is newly formulated and analyzed. The dynamics have a non-smooth
coefficient modulated by a Markov chain, and eventually attain an undesirable
state like a depletion due to the non-smoothness. The goal of the control
problem is to find the most cost-efficient policy that can prevent the dynamics
from attaining the undesirable state. We demonstrate that finding the optimal
policy reduces to solving a non-standard system of degenerate elliptic
equations, the optimality equation, which is rigorously and analytically
verified in a simplified case. The associated Fokker-Planck equation for the
controlled dynamics is derived and solved explicitly as well. The model is
finally applied to numerical computation of a recent river environmental
restoration problem. The optimality and Fokker-Planck equations are
successfully computed, and the optimal policy and the probability density
functions are numerically obtained. The impacts of execution delay are
discussed to deeper analyze the model.

where the cosmological constant is dynamical, it is possible for the latter to
remain quantum even in contexts where everything else is deemed classical.

incorporate them into a resource allocation problem. Since flexible loads are
often consumers, for concerns of privacy it is desirable for this problem to
have a distributed implementation. Technically, this distributed implementation
manifests itself as a time varying convex optimization problem constrained by
the QoS of each load. In the literature, a time invariant form of this problem
without all of the necessary QoS metrics for the flexible loads is often

challenges, due to the problems' time-varying nature. In this work, we develop

magnetism-induced topological transition from a topological nodal-line
semimetal in the paramagnetic or the spin-polarized state to a topological

topological surface states on the (010) surface. Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH)
oscillations in the AFM state identify nonzero Berry phase and a negative
longitudinal magnetoresistance ($n$-LMR) induced by the chiral anomaly,
confirming the topological nature predicted by band calculations. When magnetic
moments are fully polarized by an external magnetic field, an unsaturated and
extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) of $\sim$ 2$\times10^5$ % at 1.8 K and
28.3 T is observed, likely arising from topological protection. Consistent with
band calculations for the spin-polarized state, four new bands in quantum
oscillations different from those in the AFM state are discerned, of which two
are topologically protected. Nodal-line structures at the $Y$ point in the
Brillouin zone (BZ) are proposed in both the spin-polarized and paramagnetic
states, and the latter is proven by ARPES. Moreover, a temperature-induced
Lifshitz transition accompanied by the emergence of a new band below 3 K is

attractive problem in applied statistics. In view of the complex interplay

seldom reflect the true underlying raters' responses. Rather, they are
imprecisely observed in the sense that they are subject to a non-random

article is to illustrate a statistical approach to analyse ratings data which
integrates both random and non-random components of the rating process. In

uncertainty and a variable dispersion beta linear model is instead adopted to
model the random counterpart of rating responses. The main idea is to quantify
characteristics of latent and non-fuzzy rating responses by means of random

Expectation-Maximization algorithm is adopted to both estimate model's

the proposed fuzzy beta model are investigated by means of a simulation study

this kinetic duality principle produces regularity results where one can trade
a loss of regularity or integrability somewhere in the kinetic transport

(DERs) in Distribution Networks (DNs) opens up new opportunities for the
provision of ancillary services to the Transmission Network (TN) level. As the
penetration of smart meter devices and communication infrastructure in DNs
increases, they become more observable and controllable with centralized
optimization-based control schemes becoming efficient and practical. In this
paper, we propose a centralized tractable Optimal Power Flow (OPF)-based
control scheme that optimizes the real-time operation of active DNs, while also
considering the provision of voltage support as an ancillary service to the TN.
We embed in the form of various constraints the current voltage support
requirements of Switzerland and investigate the potential benefit of ancillary
services provision assuming different operational modes of the DER inverters.
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme using a combined HV-MV-LV
test system.

received significant attention in recent years. This paper studies the impact
of Side Information (SI) on the performance of distortion-based real-time
privacy-preserving algorithms for SMs. In particular, we consider a deep
adversarial learning framework, in which the desired releaser (a recurrent
neural network) is trained by fighting against an adversary network until
convergence. To define the loss functions, two different approaches are
considered: the Causal Adversarial Learning (CAL) and the Directed Information
(DI)-based learning. The main difference between these approaches is in how the
privacy term is measured during the training process. On the one hand, the
releaser in the CAL method, by getting supervision from the actual values of
the private variables and feedback from the adversary performance, tries to
minimize the adversary log-likelihood. On the other hand, the releaser in the
DI approach completely relies on the feedback received from the adversary and
is optimized to maximize its uncertainty. The performance of these two
algorithms is evaluated empirically using real-world SMs data, considering an
attacker with access to SI (e.g., the day of the week) that tries to infer the
occupancy status from the released SMs data. The results show that, although
they perform similarly when the attacker does not exploit the SI, in general,
the CAL method is less sensitive to the inclusion of SI. However, in both
cases, privacy levels are significantly affected, particularly when multiple
sources of SI are included.

system designed for highly automated radiation mapping and source localization.
Our approach includes a three-phase procedure comprising sequential deployment
of two diverse platforms, namely, an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) and an
unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), to perform aerial photogrammetry, aerial
radiation mapping, and terrestrial radiation mapping. The central idea is to
produce a sparse dose rate map of the entire study site via the UAS and,
subsequently, to perform detailed UGV-based mapping in limited
radiation-contaminated regions. To accomplish these tasks, we designed numerous
methods and data processing algorithms to facilitate, for example, digital
elevation model (DEM)-based terrain following for the UAS, automatic selection
of the regions of interest, obstacle map-based UGV trajectory planning, and
source localization. The overall usability of the multi-robotic system was
demonstrated by means of a one-day, authentic experiment, namely, a fictitious

the system to localize radiation hotspots and individual sources has been
verified.

important role in many different astrophysical processes and phenomena.
Traditionally, dust grains are known to be destroyed by thermal sublimation,
Coulomb explosions, sputtering, and shattering. The first two mechanisms arise
from the interaction of dust with intense radiation fields and high-energy
photons (extreme UV), which work in a limited astrophysical environment. The
present review is focused on a new destruction mechanism present in the {\it
dust-radiation interaction} that is effective in a wide range of radiation
fields and has ubiquitous applications in astrophysics. We first describe this
new mechanism of grain destruction, namely rotational disruption induced by
Radiative Torques (RATs) or RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We then discuss
rotational disruption of nanoparticles by mechanical torques due to supersonic
motion of grains relative to the ambient gas, which is termed MEchanical Torque
Disruption (METD). These two new mechanisms modify properties of dust and ice
(e.g., size distribution and mass), which affects observational properties,
including dust extinction, thermal and nonthermal emission, and polarization.
We present various applications of the RATD and METD mechanisms for different
environments, including the ISM, star-forming regions, astrophysical
transients, and surface astrochemistry.

dynamics undergoes a regime shift. These can often occur with little change in
the mean amplitude of system response prior to the actual time of transition.
The recent dimming and brightening event in Betelgeuse occured as a sudden
shift in the brightness and has been the subject of much debate. Internal
changes or an external dust cloud have been suggested as reasons for this
change in variability. We examine whether the dimming and brightening event of
2019-20 could be due to a critical transition in the pulsation dynamics of
Betelgeuse, by studying the characteristics of the light curve prior to
transition. We calculate the quantifiers hypothesised to rise prior to a
critical transition for the light curve of Betelgeuse upto the dimming event of
2019-20. These include the autocorrelation at lag-1, variance and the spectral
coefficient calculated from detrended fluctation analysis (DFA), apart from two
measures that quantify the recurrence properties of the light curve.
Significant rises are confirmed using the Mann-Kendall trend test. We see a
significant increase in all quantifiers (p < 0.05) prior to the dimming event
of 2019-20. This suggests that the event was a critical transition related to
the underlying nonlinear dynamics of the star. Together with results that
suggests minimal change in $T_{eff}$ and infra-red flux, a critical transition
in the pulsation dynamics could be a possible reason for the unprecedented
dimming of Betelgeuse. The rise in the studied quantifiers prior to the dimming
event, supports this possibility.

Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) with different speed of sound and interaction
parameter. The quench dynamics is induced by switching off the tunnelling and
letting the two systems evolve independently. We fully diagonalize the problem
within a quadratic approximation for the initial tunnelling. Both the case of
zero and finite temperature in the initial state are considered. We focus on
correlation functions associated with the antisymmetric and symmetric
combinations of the two TLLs (relevant for interference measurements), which
turn out to be coupled due to the asymmetry in the two systems' Hamiltonians.
The presence of different speeds of sound leads to multiple lightcones
separating different decaying regimes. In particular, in the large time limit,
we are able to identify a prethermal regime where the two-point correlation
functions of vertex operators of symmetric and antisymmetric sector can be
characterized by two emerging effective temperatures, eventually drifting
towards a final stationary regime that we dubbed $quasi-thermal$, well
approximated at large scale by a thermal-like state, where these correlators
become time independent and are characterized by a unique correlation length.
If the initial state is at equilibrium at non-zero temperature $T_0$, all the
effective temperatures acquire a linear correction in $T_0$, leading to faster
decay of the correlation functions. Such effects can play a crucial role for
the correct description of currently running cold atoms experiments.

critical issue for the electric mobility (E-Mobility) in the transportation

introduce a stochastic game to study the complex interactions between the power
grid and charging stations. In this context, existing studies have not taken
into account the dynamics of customers' preference on charging parameters. In
reality, however, the choice of the charging parameters may vary over time, as
the customers may change their charging preferences. We model this behavior of
customers with another stochastic game. Moreover, we define a quality of
service (QoS) index to reflect how the charging process influences customers'
choices on charging parameters. We also develop an online algorithm to reach
the Nash equilibria for both stochastic games. Then, we utilize real data from
the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) to evaluate the performance
of our proposed algorithm. The results reveal that the electricity cost with
the proposed method can result in a saving of about 20% compared to the
benchmark method, while also yielding a higher QoS in terms of charging and
waiting time. Our results can be employed as guidelines for charging service
providers to make efficient decisions under uncertainty relative to power
generation of renewable energy.

in-depth understanding of the photo-activation mechanisms. A first step is
usually to rationalize their UV-vis spectra for which time-dependent density
functional theory (TD-DFT) is an indispensable tool. We carried out TD-DFT
calculations with a systematic series of non-relativistic(NR),
scalar-relativistic (SR), and four-component (4c) Hamiltonians. Large
differences are found between spectra calculated within 4c and NR frameworks,
while the most intense features (found at higher energies below 300 nm) can be
reasonably well reproduced within a SR framework. Yet the underlying
transitions can be strongly influenced by spin-orbit coupling introduced in the
4c framework: while this can affect both intense and less intense transitions
in the spectra, the effect is most pronounced for weaker transitions at lower
energies, above 300 nm. Since the investigated complexes are activated with
light of wavelengths above 300 nm, employing a method with explicit inclusion

years. To cope with this growth, intelligent management of the consumption
profile of the households is necessary, such that the households can save the
electricity bills, and the stress to the power grid during peak hours can be
reduced. However, implementing such a method is challenging due to the
existence of randomness in the electricity price and the consumption of the
appliances. To address this challenge, we employ a model-free method for the
households which works with limited information about the uncertain factors.
More specifically, the interactions between households and the power grid can
be modeled as a non-cooperative stochastic game, where the electricity price is
viewed as a stochastic variable. To search for the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the
game, we adopt a method based on distributed deep reinforcement learning. Also,
the proposed method can preserve the privacy of the households. We then utilize
real-world data from Pecan Street Inc., which contains the power consumption
profile of more than 1; 000 households, to evaluate the performance of the
proposed method. In average, the results reveal that we can achieve around 12%
reduction on peak-to-average ratio (PAR) and 11% reduction on load variance.
With this approach, the operation cost of the power grid and the electricity

review of the main properties of the classes of complete, quadratic, and

of odd degrees are reduced to a form adapted to curves in the form of
Weierstrass. To do this, use the modified law of addition of curve points in
the generalized Edwards form, which preserves the horizontal symmetry of the
curve return points. Examples of the calculation of 3- and 5-isogenies of
complete Edwards supersingular curves over small simple fields are given, and
the properties of the isogeny composition for their calculation with
large-order kernels are discussed. Equations are obtained for upper complexity
estimates for computing isogeny of odd degrees 3 and 5 in the classes of
complete and quadratic Edwards curves in projective coordinates; algorithms are
constructed for calculating 3- and 5-isogenies of Edwards curves with

virtual origins for all three velocities using Robin, slip-like boundary
conditions to study the effect of displacing the origins perceived by different
flow components, a mechanism common to small-textured surfaces. We also explore
this effect using opposition control. For riblets, Luchini et al. (1991)
proposed that their effect could be reduced to the offset between the
streamwise- and spanwise-velocity origins, the latter being the origin
perceived by turbulence. Later results on superhydrophobic surfaces suggest
that the apparent wall-normal-velocity origin could also play a role. Our
results support that the relevant parameter is the offset between the origins
perceived by the mean flow and by turbulence. The former is determined by the
streamwise slip length, but the latter depends on both the wall-normal and
spanwise slip lengths. The slip on the streamwise velocity fluctuations, in
turn, has a negligible effect on the virtual origin for turbulence, at least in
the drag-reduction regime. This suggests that the origin perceived by the
quasi-streamwise vortices, which induce the cross velocities at the surface, is
key in determining the virtual origin for turbulence, while that perceived by
the near-wall streaks, which are associated with the streamwise velocity
fluctuations, plays a secondary role. In this framework, the changes in
turbulent quantities typically reported in the flow-control literature are
shown to be only a result of the choice of origin and are absent when
referenced to the origin experienced by turbulence. Other than this shift in
origin, we show that turbulence remains essentially smooth-wall-like, and a
simple expression can predict the virtual origin for turbulence. The effect on
drag can be reproduced a priori by introducing the virtual origins into a
smooth-wall eddy-viscosity framework.

the learning of a target robot, there are usually no guarantees that experience
transfer improves the performance of the target robot. In practice, the
efficacy of transferring experience is often not known until it is tested on
physical robots. This trial-and-error approach can be extremely unsafe and
inefficient. Building on our previous work, in this paper we consider an
inverse module transfer learning framework, where the inverse module of a
source robot system is transferred to a target robot system to improve its
tracking performance on arbitrary trajectories. We derive a theoretical bound
on the tracking error when a source inverse module is transferred to the target
robot and propose a Bayesian-optimization-based algorithm to estimate this
bound from data. We further highlight the asymmetric nature of cross-robot
experience transfer that has often been neglected in the literature. We
demonstrate our approach in quadrotor experiments and show that we can

route to fill the terahertz gap in optical technologies, but can also connect
local quantum bits to scale up solid-state quantum-computing devices. However,
taking into account both the interactions among electrons/holes, and the host
band structures, is challenging. Here we combine first-principles
band-structure calculations with quantum-chemistry methodology to evaluate the
ground and excited states of a pair of phosphorous donors in silicon within s
single framework. We use a broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach, followed by a
time-dependent Hartree-Fock method to compute the excited states. Our
Hamiltonian for each valley includes an anisotropic kinetic energy term, which
splits the 2p_0 and 2p_+- transitions of isolated donors by ~4 meV, in good
agreement with experiments. Our single-valley calculations show the optical
response is a strong function of the optical polarisation, and suggest the use
of valley polarisation to control optics and reduce oscillations in exchange
interactions. When taking into account all valleys, including valley-orbital
interactions, we find a gap opens between the 1s to 2p transition and
low-energy charge-transfer states within 1s manifolds (which become optically
allowed because of inter-donor interactions). In contrast to the single-valley
case, we find charge-transfer excited states also in the triplet sector, thanks
to the valley degrees of freedom. These states have a qualitatively correct
energy as compared with the previous experiments; additionally, we predict new
excitations below 20 meV that have not been analysed previously. A statistical
average of nearest-neighbour pairs at different separations suggests that THz
radiation could be used to excite pairs spin-selectively. Our approach can
readily be extended to other donors and to other semiconducting hosts.

integer base case. The present paper is devoted to the continuity properties of
these maps with respect to the Hausdorff metric.

the observations (Mask-and-Interpolate, RDI-NMF, RDI-KLIP, and ADI-KLIP) to
measure the geometric parameters and the scattering phase function for the
disk. To understand the systematic errors associated with PSF subtraction, we
also forward-modeled the observations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
framework and a simple model for the disk. We found that measurements of the
disk geometric parameters were robust, with all of our analyses yielding
consistent results; however, measurements of the scattering phase function were
challenging to reconstruct from PSF-subtracted images, despite extensive
testing. As a result, we estimated the scattering phase function using disk
modeling. We searched for a dependence of the scattering phase function with
respect to the GPI filters but found none. We compared the H-band scattering
phase function with that measured by Hubble Space Telescope STIS at visual
wavelengths and discovered a blue color at small scattering angles and a red
color at large scattering angles, consistent with predictions and laboratory
measurements of large grains. Finally, we successfully modeled the SPHERE H2 HR

interactions among persons and or objects. In particular, human actions involve
certain spatial and temporal relationships, are the components of more
complicated activity, and evolve dynamically over time. Therefore, the
description of a single human action and the modeling of the evolution of
successive human actions are two major issues in human activity recognition. In
this paper, we develop a method for human activity recognition that tackles
these two issues. In the proposed method, an activity is divided into several
successive actions represented by spatio temporal patterns, and the evolution
of these actions are captured by a sequential model. A refined comprehensive
spatio temporal graph is utilized to represent a single action, which is a
qualitative representation of a human action incorporating both the spatial and
temporal relations of the participant objects. Next, a discrete hidden Markov
model is applied to model the evolution of action sequences. Moreover, a fully
automatic partition method is proposed to divide a long-term human activity
video into several human actions based on variational objects and qualitative
spatial relations. Finally, a hierarchical decomposition of the human body is
introduced to obtain a discriminative representation for a single action.
Experimental results on the Cornell Activity Dataset demonstrate the efficiency
and effectiveness of the proposed approach, which will enable long videos of
human activity to be better recognized.

explore the effect of the coupling between the normal and tangential

to quantify the contribution this can have on energy losses. We found that, due
to normal-tangential coupling, asymmetric contacts and consequently additional
friction are observed even for purely elastic layers, indeed associated with
zero bulk energy dissipation. Furthermore, enhanced viscoelastic friction is
reported in the case of viscoelastic coatings due to coupling, this time also
entailing larger bulk energy dissipation. Geometric coupling also introduces
additional interactions involving the larger scales normal displacements, which
leads to a significant increase of the contact area, under given normal load,

solving PMDM allows for providing data utility guarantees as opposed to
existing approaches.
  We first show, through a reduction from the well-known $k$-Clique problem,
that a decision version of the PMDM problem is NP-complete, even for strings
over a binary alphabet. We present a data structure for PMDM that answers
queries over $\mathcal{D}$ in time
$\mathcal{O}(2^{\ell/2}(2^{\ell/2}+\tau)\ell)$ and requires space
$\mathcal{O}(2^{\ell}d^2/\tau^2+2^{\ell/2}d)$, for any parameter

We show an $\mathcal{O}((d\ell)^{k/3}+d\ell)$-time and
$\mathcal{O}(d\ell)$-space algorithm for PMDM if $k=|K|=\mathcal{O}(1)$. We
generalize our exact algorithm to mask multiple query strings simultaneously.
We complement our results by showing a two-way polynomial-time reduction

user requests, and pays for, fresh data updates from a source provider, and
data freshness is captured by the {\it age of information} (AoI) metric.
Keeping data fresh relies on frequent data updates by the source, which
motivates the source to {\it price fresh data}. In this work, the destination
incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general increasing function of the
AoI. The source designs a pricing mechanism to maximize its profit; the
destination chooses a data update schedule to trade off its payments to the
source and its age-related cost. Depending on different real-time applications
and scenarios, we study both a predictable-deadline and an
unpredictable-deadline models. The key challenge of designing the optimal
pricing scheme lies in the destination's time-interdependent valuations, due to
the nature of AoI and the infinite-dimensional and dynamic optimization. To
this end, we consider three pricing schemes that exploit and understand the
profitability of three different dimensions in designing pricing: a {\it
time-dependent} pricing scheme, in which the price for each update depends on
when it is requested; a {\it quantity-based} pricing scheme, in which the price
of each update depends on how many updates have been previously requested; a
{\it subscription-based} pricing scheme, in which the price for each update is
flat-rate but the source charges an additional subscription fee. Our analysis
reveals that the optimal subscription-based pricing maximizes the source's
profit among all possible pricing schemes under both predictable deadline and
unpredictable deadline models; the optimal quantity-based pricing scheme is
only optimal with a predictable deadline; the time-dependent pricing scheme,
under the unpredictable deadline, is asymptotically optimal under significant

learning-based approaches usually require large amounts of well-annotated data,
which can be extremely expensive in the field of medical image analysis.
Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much easier to acquire. Semi-supervised
learning and unsupervised domain adaptation both take the advantage of
unlabeled data, and they are closely related to each other. In this paper, we
propose uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), a unified framework
that addresses these two tasks for volumetric medical image segmentation. Our
framework is capable of efficiently utilizing unlabeled data for better
performance. We firstly rotate and permute the 3D volumes into multiple views
and train a 3D deep network on each view. We then apply co-training by
enforcing multi-view consistency on unlabeled data, where an uncertainty
estimation of each view is utilized to achieve accurate labeling. Experiments
on the NIH pancreas segmentation dataset and a multi-organ segmentation dataset
show state-of-the-art performance of the proposed framework on semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, we
validate the effectiveness of this work by adapting our multi-organ
segmentation model to two pathological organs from the Medical Segmentation
Decathlon Datasets. Additionally, we show that our UMCT-DA model can even
effectively handle the challenging situation where labeled source data is
inaccessible, demonstrating strong potentials for real-world applications.

points bifurcate \emph{independently}, with $k$ up to the dimension of the

construct, in these families, subfamilies of codimension 1 where the

unaligned image pairs) sampled from a natural image collection, so that they
can be different in both appearances and poses. To this end, we propose a
cross-image cycle consistency framework ($C^3$) which applies the
swapping-reconstruction strategy twice to obtain the final supervision.
Moreover, a cross-image flow module is further introduced to impose the
equivariance between estimated landmarks across images. Through comprehensive
experiments, our proposed framework is shown to outperform strong baselines by
a large margin. Besides quantitative results, we also provide visualization and
interpretation on our learned models, which not only verifies the effectiveness
of the learned landmarks, but also leads to important insights that are
beneficial for future research.

the vectors are orthogonal due to the independence of endmember spectrums.
Based on it, the global low rank tensor structure can be well exposited for HSI

spectral piecewise smoothness of HSI. Meanwhile, the sparse noise including
impulse noise, deadlines and stripes, is detected by the l1 norm

as the distance to contact center increases. With the lateral force increasing,
the slip zone expands inwards from the contact edge. At the same time, the

bacterial density in the range between 0.6e8 and 5.2e8 cells/ml. Bacterial
density also affects both the size and number of CaCO3 crystals. A low
bacterial density of 0.6e8 cells/ml produced 1.1e6 crystals/ml with an average
crystal volume of 8,000 um3, whereas a high bacterial density of 5.2e8 cells/ml
resulted in more crystals (2.0e7 crystals/ml) but with a smaller average
crystal volume of 450 um3. The produced CaCO3 crystals were stable when the
bacterial density was 0.6e8 cells/ml. When the bacterial density was 4-10 times
higher, the crystals were first unstable and then transformed into more stable
CaCO3 crystals. This suggests that bacterial density should be an important
consideration in the design of MICP protocols.
