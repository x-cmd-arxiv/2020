circular restricted three-body problem, and relate its dynamical properties to
the underlying structure associated with specific invariant manifolds. We
consider a range of Jacobi constant values for which the neck around the
Lagrangian point $L_1$ is always open but the orbits are bounded due to Hill
stability. First, we show that the system displays three different dynamical
scenarios in the neighborhood of the Moon: two mixed ones, with regular and
chaotic orbits, and an almost entirely chaotic one in between. We then analyze
the transitions between these scenarios using the Monodromy matrix theory and
determine that they are given by two specific types of bifurcations. After
that, we illustrate how the phase space configurations, particularly the shapes
of stability regions and stickiness, are intrinsically related to the
hyperbolic invariant manifolds of the Lyapunov orbits around $L_1$ and also to
the ones of some particular unstable periodic orbits. Lastly, we define transit
time in a manner that is useful to depict dynamical trapping and show that the
traced geometrical structures are also connected to the transport properties of
the system.

found to be sensitive to the parameterization of the fragments' binding

properties of these correlations have been examined in the framework of the
Statistical Multifragmentation Model as a function of the breakup temperature.
The model calculations suggest that the maxima of these correlation functions
occur at well separated temperatures as the breakup volumes used in the model
vary from 3 to 6 times that at normal density. These volumes are within the
range assumed in most statistical calculations and supported by experiments.
Besides their position, the height and width of the maxima are also found to be
sensitive to the parameterization of the fragments' binding energy. The
magnitude of all these effects also depends on the isobars considered in the
correlations. We found that, due to an interplay between the symmetry energy
and the volume dependent terms of the Helmholtz free energy, in the case of
nearly symmetric sources, correlations involving light mirror nuclei seem to
enhance these effects. We suggest that the proposed correlation functions could
be used to extract information on the fragments' energies and on the breakup
volume of nuclear sources.

performance by moving the search space to load shed buses. Research from the
past shows that changing transmission system topology changes the power flows
and removes post contingency violations. Hence, TS can reduce the amount of
load shed after an N-1 contingency. One of the major challenges is to find the
best TS candidate in a suitable time. In this letter, the best TS candidate is
determined by using a novel heuristic bi-level method based on linear
sensitivity. The proposed bi-level method is easy to implement in the real
world, guarantees removal of post contingency violations, and ranks the best TS
candidates based on minimum load shedding possible. Moreover, the proposed
method is computationally efficient since it does not involve mixed integer
programming. The bi-level method is implemented by modifying the topology of
transmission system after the N-1 contingency in the IEEE 39-bus test system
and results show that TS with generation re-dispatch is the best solution for
load shed recovery to prevent cascading failures. Moreover, the bi-level method
performs even for the case when the existing methods in literature fail to
completely remove post contingency violations.

key issue concerned here is about the superconducting gap function. Here we
report the first set data of single particle tunneling measurements on the

tunneling spectra, one shows a V-shape feature which can be fitted very well by
a d-wave gap function with gap maximum of about 3.9 meV, another one exhibits a
full gap of about 2.35 meV. Some spectra demonstrate mixed contributions of
these two components. Our results suggest that the newly found Ni-based

the coding efficiency over its ancestor standard High Efficiency Video Coding
(HEVC), but at the expense of sharply increased complexity. In VVC, the
quad-tree plus multi-type tree (QTMT) structure of coding unit (CU) partition
accounts for over 97% of the encoding time, due to the brute-force search for
recursive rate-distortion (RD) optimization. Instead of the brute-force QTMT
search, this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the QTMT-based
CU partition, for drastically accelerating the encoding process of intra-mode
VVC. First, we establish a large-scale database containing sufficient CU
partition patterns with diverse video content, which can facilitate the
data-driven VVC complexity reduction. Next, we propose a multi-stage exit CNN
(MSE-CNN) model with an early-exit mechanism to determine the CU partition, in
accord with the flexible QTMT structure at multiple stages. Then, we design an
adaptive loss function for training the MSE-CNN model, synthesizing both the
uncertain number of split modes and the target on minimized RD cost. Finally, a
multi-threshold decision scheme is developed, achieving desirable trade-off
between complexity and RD performance. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach can reduce the encoding time of VVC by 44.65%-66.88% with the
negligible Bj{\o}ntegaard delta bit-rate (BD-BR) of 1.322%-3.188%, which
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

solution based on cross-sectional data over stores and SKUs, observing that
detecting inventory inaccuracies can be viewed as a problem of identifying
anomalies in a (low-rank) Poisson matrix. State-of-the-art approaches to
anomaly detection in low-rank matrices apparently fall short. Specifically,
from a theoretical perspective, recovery guarantees for these approaches
require that non-anomalous entries be observed with vanishingly small noise
(which is not the case in our problem, and indeed in many applications).
  So motivated, we propose a conceptually simple entry-wise approach to anomaly
detection in low-rank Poisson matrices. Our approach accommodates a general
class of probabilistic anomaly models. We show that the cost incurred by our
algorithm approaches that of an optimal algorithm at a min-max optimal rate.
Using synthetic data and real data from a consumer goods retailer, we show that
our approach provides up to a 10x cost reduction over incumbent approaches to
anomaly detection. Along the way, we build on recent work that seeks entry-wise
error guarantees for matrix completion, establishing such guarantees for
sub-exponential matrices, a result of independent interest.

spintronics owing to their fast dynamics and high robustness against parasitic
magnetic fields. However, nanoscale imaging of the magnetic order in such
materials with zero net magnetization remains a major experimental challenge.
Here we show that non-collinear antiferromagnetic spin textures can be imaged
by probing the magnetic noise they locally produce via thermal populations of
magnons. To this end, we perform nanoscale, all-optical relaxometry with a
scanning quantum sensor based on a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect in
diamond. Magnetic noise is detected through an increase of the spin relaxation
rate of the NV defect, which results in an overall reduction of its
photoluminescence signal under continuous laser illumination. As a
proof-of-concept, the efficiency of the method is demonstrated by imaging
various spin textures in synthetic antiferromagnets, including domain walls,
spin spirals and antiferromagnetic skyrmions. This imaging procedure could be
extended to a large class of intrinsic antiferromagnets and opens up new
opportunities for studying the physics of localized spin wave modes for
magnonics.

location(s) in the human organism, is the ultimate cause of death for the
majority of cancer patients. That is why, it is crucial to understand
metastases evolution in order to successfully combat the disease. We consider a
metastasized cancer cell population after medical treatment (e.g.
chemotherapy). Arriving in a different environment the cancer cells may change
their lifespan and reproduction, thus they may proliferate into different
types. If the treatment is effective, in the context of branching processes it
means, the reproduction of cancer cells is such that the mean offspring of each
cell is less than one. However, it is possible mutations to occur during cell
division cycle. These mutations can produce a new cancer cell type, which is
resistant to the treatment. Cancer cells from this new type may lead to the
rise of a non-extinction branching process. The above scenario leads us to the
choice of a reducible multi-type age-dependent branching process as a relevant
framework for studying the asymptotic behavior of such complex structures. Our
previous theoretical results are related to the asymptotic behavior of the
waiting time until the first occurrence of a mutant starting a non-extinction
process and the modified hazard function as a measure of immediate recurrence
of cancer disease. In the present paper these asymptotic results are used for
developing numerical schemes and algorithms implemented in Python via the NumPy
package for approximate calculation of the corresponding quantities. In
conclusion, our conjecture is that this methodology can be advantageous in
revealing the role of the lifespan distribution of the cancer cells in the
context of cancer disease evolution and other complex cell population systems,
in general.

change made to an input to change a prediction made by a fixed model (hereafter
called sparse methods). Recent work, however, has revitalized an old insight:
there often does not exist one superior solution to a prediction problem with
respect to commonly used measures of interest (e.g. error rate). In fact, often
multiple different classifiers give almost equal solutions. This phenomenon is
known as predictive multiplicity (Breiman, 2001; Marx et al., 2019). In this
work, we derive a general upper bound for the costs of counterfactual
explanations under predictive multiplicity. Most notably, it depends on a
discrepancy notion between two classifiers, which describes how differently
they treat negatively predicted individuals. We then compare sparse and data
support approaches empirically on real-world data. The results show that data
support methods are more robust to multiplicity of different models. At the
same time, we show that those methods have provably higher cost of generating
counterfactual explanations under one fixed model. In summary, our theoretical

effective-sphere analysis is rapid and numerically robust and so is useful for
practical implementations of label-free immunoassays. Here, we assess how

we neither know all potential confounders nor do we have data on them. To
alleviate this requirement, we leverage the dependencies among multiple causes

our theoretical analysis, we prove that using the substitute confounder enables
identifiability of the causal effect of neuroanatomy on cognition. We
quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on semi-synthetic

large-scale molecular dynamics simulations with a deep potential to elucidate
the dynamic compression processes of gold from an atomic level. The potential
is constructed by accurately reproducing the free energy surfaces of
density-functional-theory calculations for gold, from ambient conditions to 15
500 K and 500 GPa. Within this framework, we extend the simulations up to 200
000 atoms size, and found a much lower pressure threshold for phase
transitioning from face-centered cubic (FCC) to body-centered (BCC), as
compared to previous calculations. Furthermore, the transition pressure is
strongly dependent on the shock direction, namely 159 GPa for (100) orientation
and 219 GPa for (110) orientation, respectively. Most importantly, the accurate
atomistic perspective presents that the shocked BCC structure contains unique
features of medium-range and short-range orders, which is named disorders here.
We propose a model and demonstrate that the existence of disorders
significantly reduces the Gibbs free energies of shocked structures, therefore
leading to the lowering of the phase transition pressure. The present study

cannot be computed analytically. In this paper, we study a tractable subclass
of CTNSs, the Gaussian CTNSs (GCTNSs), and benchmark them on simple quadratic
and quartic bosonic QFT Hamiltonians. We show that GCTNSs provide arbitrarily
accurate approximations to the ground states of quadratic Hamiltonians, and
decent estimates for quartic ones at weak coupling. Since they capture the
short distance behavior of the theories we consider exactly, GCTNSs even allow
to renormalize away simple divergences variationally. In the end, our study
makes it plausible that CTNSs are indeed a good manifold to approximate the low

plausible interpretation, thus allowing for multiple valid labels. To capture
such ambiguities, recent work has explored the use of probabilistic networks
that can learn a distribution over predictions. However, these do not
necessarily represent the empirical distribution accurately. In this work, we
present a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over
semantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects
its ground truth correctness likelihood. To this end, we propose a novel
two-stage, cascaded approach for calibrated adversarial refinement: (i) a
standard segmentation network is trained with categorical cross entropy to
predict a pixelwise probability distribution over semantic classes and (ii) an
adversarially trained stochastic network is used to model the inter-pixel
correlations to refine the output of the first network into coherent samples.
Importantly, to calibrate the refinement network and prevent mode collapse, the
expectation of the samples in the second stage is matched to the probabilities
predicted in the first. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the
approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on the multigrader LIDC dataset
and on a modified Cityscapes dataset with injected ambiguities. In addition, we
show that the core design can be adapted to other tasks requiring learning a

crucial for planning and policy development. While several efforts have been
made to produce fine-scale gridded population estimates, socioeconomic features
are typically not available at scales finer than Census units, which may hide
local heterogeneity and disparity. In this paper we present a new statistical
downscaling approach to derive fine-scale estimates of key socioeconomic
attributes. The method leverages demographic and geographical extensive
covariates available at multiple scales and additional Census covariates only
available at coarse resolution, which are included in the model hierarchically
within a ""forward learning"" approach. For each selected socioeconomic variable,
a Random Forest model is trained on the source Census units and then used to
generate fine-scale gridded predictions, which are then adjusted to ensure the
best possible consistency with the coarser Census data. As a case study, we
apply this method to Census data in the United States, downscaling the selected
socioeconomic variables available at the block group level, to a grid of ~300
spatial resolution. The accuracy of the method is assessed at both spatial
scales, first computing a pseudo cross-validation coefficient of determination
for the predictions at the block group level and then, for extensive variables
only, also for the (unadjusted) predicted counts summed by block group. Based
on these scores and on the inspection of the downscaled maps, we conclude that
our method is able to provide accurate, smoother, and more detailed
socioeconomic estimates than the available Census data.

and torque in any direction, which is important for applications such as
contact-based industrial inspection. This comes at the price of an increase in
model complexity. These vehicles usually have non-negligible, repetitive
dynamics that are hard to model, such as the aerodynamic interference between
the propellers. This makes it difficult for high-performance trajectory
tracking using a model-based controller. This paper presents an approach that
combines a data-driven and a first-principle model for the system actuation and
uses it to improve the controller. In a first step, the first-principle model
errors are learned offline using a Gaussian Process (GP) regressor. At runtime,
the first-principle model and the GP regressor are used jointly to obtain
control commands. This is formulated as an optimization problem, which avoids
ambiguous solutions present in a standard inverse model in overactuated
systems, by only using forward models. The approach is validated using a
tilt-arm overactuated omnidirectional flying vehicle performing attitude
trajectory tracking. The results show that with our proposed method, the
attitude trajectory error is reduced by 32% on average as compared to a nominal
PID controller.

Granger causality (GC) with perturbations, and our proposed perturbation

abundances which resemble those typical of gas processed by proton-capture

Lithium is destroyed in the 2G stars, but instead it is generally observed, at

discussing the models for the formation of multiple populations, I examine the

introduces a view on how such dynamics is described by the laws for the entropy
of neural activity, a paradigm that we call thermodynamics of the Bayesian
brain. The Bayesian brain hypothesis sees the stimulus-evoked activity of
neurons as an act of constructing the Bayesian posterior distribution based on
the generative model of the external world that an organism possesses. A closer
look at the stimulus-evoked activity at early sensory cortices reveals that
feedforward connections initially mediate the stimulus-response, which is later
modulated by input from recurrent connections. Importantly, not the initial
response, but the delayed modulation expresses animals' cognitive states such
as awareness and attention regarding the stimulus. Using a simple generative
model made of a spiking neural population, we reproduce the stimulus-evoked
dynamics with the delayed feedback modulation as the process of the Bayesian
inference that integrates the stimulus evidence and a prior knowledge with
time-delay. We then introduce a thermodynamic view on this process based on the
laws for the entropy of neural activity. This view elucidates that the process
of the Bayesian inference works as the recently-proposed information-theoretic
engine (neural engine, an analogue of a heat engine in thermodynamics), which
allows us to quantify the perceptual capacity expressed in the delayed
modulation in terms of entropy.

to effectively learn a (near-)optimal policy in environments with large state
spaces having sparse and noisy feedback signals. In real-world applications, an
expert with additional domain knowledge can help in speeding up the learning
process via \emph{shaping the environment}, i.e., making the environment more
learner-friendly. A popular paradigm in literature is \emph{potential-based
reward shaping}, where the environment's reward function is augmented with
additional local rewards using a potential function. However, the applicability
of potential-based reward shaping is limited in settings where (i) the state
space is very large, and it is challenging to compute an appropriate potential
function, (ii) the feedback signals are noisy, and even with shaped rewards the
agent could be trapped in local optima, and (iii) changing the rewards alone is
not sufficient, and effective shaping requires changing the dynamics. We
address these limitations of potential-based shaping methods and propose a
novel framework of \emph{environment shaping using state abstraction}. Our key
idea is to compress the environment's large state space with noisy signals to
an abstracted space, and to use this abstraction in creating smoother and more
effective feedback signals for the agent. We study the theoretical
underpinnings of our abstraction-based environment shaping, and show that the
agent's policy learnt in the shaped environment preserves near-optimal behavior

moving dark matter (DM), with velocity $v\sim0.05-0.20$ and mass between 1 MeV
and 10 GeV, scattering off an electron. Assuming the fast moving DM-electron
interaction is mediated by a vector particle, we derive collider constraints on
the said DM-electron interaction. The bounds on DM-electron coupling is then
used to constrain possible production mechanisms of the fast moving DM. We find
that the preferred mass of the vector mediator is relatively light ($\lesssim$
1 GeV) and the coupling of the vector to the electron is much smaller than the
coupling to the fast moving DM.

reconstructing spatial maps from satellite imagery is not a trivial vision task
as it requires reconstructing a scene or object with high-level representation

detection and representation using visual data has been achieved, but the
primitive-based object representation still remains as a challenging vision
task. Thus, a high-quality spatial map is mainly produced through complex
labour-intensive processes. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural

building boundary shapes from a single satellite imagery. The proposed deep
learning method consists of a two-stage object detection network to produce
region of interest (RoI) features and a building boundary extraction network
using graph models to learn geometric information of the polygon shapes.
Extensive experiments show that our model can accomplish multi-tasks of object

simultaneously. In terms of building extraction accuracy, computation
efficiency and boundary regularization performance, our model outperforms the

observe black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). Analyzing the 11 detections
from LIGO/Virgo's first gravitational-wave catalog, GWTC-1, we investigate
whether the power-law fit to the BH mass spectrum can also accommodate the
binary neutron star (BNS) event GW170817, or whether we require an additional
feature, such as a mass gap, in between the NS and BH populations. We find that
with respect to the power-law fit to binary black hole (BBH) masses, GW170817
is an outlier at the 0.13\% level, suggesting a distinction between NS and BH
masses. A single power-law fit across the entire mass range is in mild tension
with: (a) the detection of one source in the BNS mass range ($\sim 1$--$2.5
\,M_\odot$), (b) the absence of detections in the ""mass-gap"" range ($\sim
2.5$--$5 \,M_\odot$), and (c) the detection of 10 sources in the BBH mass range
($\gtrsim 5 \,M_\odot$). Instead, the data favor models with a feature between
NS and BH masses, including a mass gap (Bayes factor of 4.6) and a break in the
power law, with a steeper slope at NS masses compared to BH masses (91\%
credibility). We estimate the merger rates of compact binaries based on our fit
to the global mass distribution, finding $\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{BNS} =
871^{+3015}_{-805} \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ and
$\mathcal{R}_\mathrm{BBH} = 47.5^{+57.9}_{-28.8} \ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3} \

of the difference between NSs and BHs, the gravitational-wave data alone
already suggest two distinct populations of compact objects.

studied is identical to those in the MAJORANA DEMONSTRATOR experiment, a search
for neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) in $^{76}$Ge. $\alpha$
decays on most of the passivated surface exhibit significant energy loss due to
charge trapping, with waveforms exhibiting a delayed charge recovery (DCR)
signature caused by the slow collection of a fraction of the trapped charge.
The DCR is found to be complementary to existing methods of $\alpha$
identification, reliably identifying $\alpha$ background events on the
passivated surface of the detector. We demonstrate effective rejection of all
surface $\alpha$ events (to within statistical uncertainty) with a loss of only
0.2% of bulk events by combining the DCR discriminator with previously-used
methods. The DCR discriminator has been used to reduce the background rate in

dependent perturbation theory is presented. The derivation is based on
adiabatic turning on of the perturbation as used, for instance, in some formal
developments of scattering theory. Energy conservation is expressed in terms of
an intuitively and physically appealing Lorentzian line shape rather than the
artificial, oscillatory sin(x)=x type line shape that appears in conventional
derivations. The conditions for the derivation's validity are compactly and
conveniently expressed in the frequency/energy domain rather than in the usual
time domain. The derivation also highlights how, along with energy
conservation, the transition rate faithfully and instantaneously follows the
variations in the square of the perturbing potential as one may expect in the
adiabatic limit. In the first instance, the adiabatic turning on is achieved,
as usual, by a single exponential time variation. But we demonstrate that the
instantaneous following of the square of the perturbing potential by the
transition rate is more general and that one can derive the Golden Rule for a
general slowly varying time dependent perturbation. This allows one to derive
generalisations of the simple decay law, originally derived in the classic
paper by Weisskopf and Wigner; a tutorial exposition of the essence of this
classic work is provided. The Oppenheimer method for applying the Golden rule
to problems, such as the electric field ionisation of atoms, in which the
perturbing potential can also create the final states, is reviewed. No use of
an energy gap condition is needed to derive our results on adiabatic behaviour
in contrast to the origianl derivations of the adiabatic theorem in quantum
mechanics.

We show that the excitation of band edge dipolar modes of a linear nanopillar
array results in strong reshaping of the photoluminescence spectra. Among other
collective modes, the magnetic dipolar mode with the polarization along the
array axis contributes the most to the emission spectrum exhibiting an
experimentally measured Q-factor of around 500 for an array of 11 pillars. The
results belong to the first experimental evidence of light emission enhancement
of quantum emitters applying collective Mie resonances and therefore represent
an important contribution to the new field of active all-dielectric
meta-optics.

field in neutron star cores through ambipolar diffusion, taking the neutrons as
a motionless uniform background. However, in real neutron stars, neutrons are
free to move, and a strong composition gradient leads to stable stratification
(stability against convective motions) both of which might impact on the
time-scales of evolution. Here we address these issues by providing the first
long-term two-fluid simulations of the evolution of an axially symmetric
magnetic field in a neutron star core composed of neutrons, protons, and
electrons with density and composition gradients. Again, we find that the
magnetic field evolves towards barotropic ""Grad-Shafranov equilibria"", in which
the magnetic force is balanced by the degeneracy pressure gradient and
gravitational force of the charged particles. However, the evolution is found
to be faster than in the case of motionless neutrons, as the movement of
charged particles (which are coupled to the magnetic field, but are also
limited by the collisional drag forces exerted by neutrons) is less
constrained, since neutrons are now allowed to move. The possible impact of
non-axisymmetric instabilities on these equilibria, as well as beta decays,
proton superconductivity, and neutron superfluidity, are left for future work.

environment by decoding the mental intention of individuals. BCIs can therefore
be used to address basic neuroscience questions but also to unlock a variety of
applications from exoskeleton control to neurofeedback (NFB) rehabilitation. In
general, BCI usability critically depends on the ability to comprehensively
characterize brain functioning and correctly identify the user s mental state.
To this end, much of the efforts have focused on improving the classification
algorithms taking into account localized brain activities as input features.
Despite considerable improvement BCI performance is still unstable and, as a
matter of fact, current features represent oversimplified descriptors of brain
functioning. In the last decade, growing evidence has shown that the brain
works as a networked system composed of multiple specialized and spatially
distributed areas that dynamically integrate information. While more complex,
looking at how remote brain regions functionally interact represents a grounded
alternative to better describe brain functioning. Thanks to recent advances in
network science, i.e. a modern field that draws on graph theory, statistical
mechanics, data mining and inferential modelling, scientists have now powerful
means to characterize complex brain networks derived from neuroimaging data.
Notably, summary features can be extracted from these networks to
quantitatively measure specific organizational properties across a variety of
topological scales. In this topical review, we aim to provide the
state-of-the-art supporting the development of a network theoretic approach as
a promising tool for understanding BCIs and improve usability.

overcome these issues, we propose an Expert-Supervised RL (ESRL) framework

finally, 3) we propose a way to interpret ESRL's policy at every state through
posterior distributions, and use this framework to compute off-policy value

we investigate generalization error for kernel regression, which, besides being
a popular machine learning method, also includes infinitely overparameterized
neural networks trained with gradient descent. We use techniques from
statistical mechanics to derive an analytical expression for generalization
error applicable to any kernel or data distribution. We present applications of
our theory to real and synthetic datasets, and for many kernels including those
that arise from training deep neural networks in the infinite-width limit. We
elucidate an inductive bias of kernel regression to explain data with ""simple

the data distribution. This notion of simplicity allows us to characterize
whether a kernel is compatible with a learning task, facilitating good
generalization performance from a small number of training examples. We show
that more data may impair generalization when noisy or not expressible by the
kernel, leading to non-monotonic learning curves with possibly many peaks. To
further understand these phenomena, we turn to the broad class of rotation
invariant kernels, which is relevant to training deep neural networks in the

all quantum corrections to the Killing vectors vanish in the asymptotic limit,
in addition to the result that the star product trivializes to pointwise

predictions (1) without considering goal information, and (2) at the finest
temporal resolution, one step at a time. In this work we propose a framework
for visual prediction and planning that is able to overcome both of these
limitations. First, we formulate the problem of predicting towards a goal and
propose the corresponding class of latent space goal-conditioned predictors
(GCPs). GCPs significantly improve planning efficiency by constraining the
search space to only those trajectories that reach the goal. Further, we show
how GCPs can be naturally formulated as hierarchical models that, given two
observations, predict an observation between them, and by recursively
subdividing each part of the trajectory generate complete sequences. This
divide-and-conquer strategy is effective at long-term prediction, and enables
us to design an effective hierarchical planning algorithm that optimizes
trajectories in a coarse-to-fine manner. We show that by using both
goal-conditioning and hierarchical prediction, GCPs enable us to solve visual
planning tasks with much longer horizon than previously possible.

classical periodic orbits and the so-called quasimodes, i.e., the non-ergodic

Recently, interest in quantum scars has been revived in a many-body setting of
Rydberg atom chains. While previous theoretical works have identified periodic
orbits for such systems using time-dependent variational principle (TDVP), the
link between periodic orbits and quasimodes has been missing. Here we provide a
conceptually simple analytic construction of quasimodes for the non-integrable

our method decreases sample complexity and improves generalization of the

fluid phase. The first method mirrors the usual derivation of the hydrodynamic
equations of motion by relating conserved---or to account for chemical
reactions, non-conserved---currents to local-equilibrium parameters. The second
method involves a higher-brow approach in which we attack the same problem from
the perspective of non-equilibrium effective field theory (EFT).
Non-equilibrium effective actions are defined using the in-in formalism on the
Schwinger-Keldysh contour and are therefore capable of describing thermal
fluctuations and dissipation as well as quantum effects. The non-equilibrium
EFT approach is especially powerful as all terms in the action are fully
specified by the symmetries of the system; in particular the second law of
thermodynamics does not need to be included by hand, but is instead derived
from the action itself. We find that the equations of motion generated by both
methods agree, but the EFT approach yields certain advantages. To demonstrate
some of these advantages we construct a quadratic action that is valid to very
small distance scales---much smaller than the scales at which ordinary
hydrodynamic theories break down. Such an action captures the full
thermodynamic and quantum behavior of reactions and diffusion at quadratic
order. Finally, taking the low-frequency and low-wavenumber limit, we reproduce
the linearized version of the well-known reaction-diffusion equations as a
final coherence check.

genetic modification technique to create a pair of complementary assembly
histories: one in which the halo assembles later than in the unmodified case,
and one in which it assembles earlier. Delayed assembly leads to the galaxy
exhibiting a greater present-day star formation rate than its unmodified
counterpart, whilst in the accelerated case the galaxy quenches at $z\simeq 1$,
and becomes spheroidal. We simulate each assembly history nine times, adopting
different seeds for the random number generator used by EAGLE's stochastic
subgrid implementations of star formation and feedback. The systematic changes
driven by differences in assembly history are significantly stronger than the
random scatter induced by this stochasticity. The sensitivity of $\sim L^\star$
galaxy evolution to dark matter halo assembly follows from the close coupling
of the growth histories of the central black hole (BH) and the halo, such that
earlier assembly fosters the formation of a more massive BH, and more efficient
expulsion of circumgalactic gas. In response to this expulsion, the
circumgalactic medium reconfigures at a lower density, extending its cooling
time and thus inhibiting the replenishment of the interstellar medium. Our
results indicate that halo assembly history significantly influences the
evolution of $\sim L^\star$ central galaxies, and that the expulsion of
circumgalactic gas is a crucial step in quenching them.

strongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear.
It may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the
binary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular
momentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then
evolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which may later
be disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the
formation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with
main sequence (MS) companions. Through an extensive, star-by-star review of the
literature of a magnitude-limited sample of Galactic early-type Be stars, we
investigate whether Be binaries with MS companions are known to exist. Our
sample is constructed from the BeSS database and cross-matched with all
available literature on the individual stars. Out of an initial list of 505 Be
stars, we compile a final sample of 287 Galactic Be stars earlier than B1.5
with V<=12 mag. Out of those, 13 objects were reported as Be binaries with
known post-MS companions and 11 as binaries with unknown, uncertain or debated
companions. We find no confirmed reports of Be binaries with MS companions. For
the remaining 263 targets, no significant reports of multiplicity exist in the
literature, implying that they are either Be binaries with faint companions, or
truly single. The clear lack of reported MS companions to Be stars, which
stands in contrast to the high number of detected B+B MS binaries, strongly
supports the hypothesis that early-type Be stars are binary interaction
products that spun up after mass and angular momentum transfer from a companion

When measuring multiple phases embedded in interferometric networks,
specially-tailored input quantum states achieve enhanced sensitivities compared
with both single-parameter and classical estimation schemes. Significant
attention has been devoted to defining the optimal strategies for the scenario
in which all of the phases are evaluated with respect to a common reference
mode, in terms of optimal probe states and optimal measurement operators. As
well, the strategies assume unlimited external resources, which is
experimentally unrealistic. Here, we optimize a generalized scenario that
treats all of the phases on an equal footing and takes into account the
resources provided by external references. We show that the absence of an
external reference mode reduces the number of simultaneously estimatable
parameters, owing to the immeasurability of global phases, and that the
symmetries of the parameters being estimated dictate the symmetries of the
optimal probe states. Finally, we provide insight for constructing optimal
measurements in this generalized scenario. The experimental viability of this
work underlies its immediate practical importance beyond fundamental physics.

only in a few objects. In this paper, we analyse MUSE/VLT data of 26 local

objects from the literature to obtain a total sample of 31 galaxies with
spatially resolved multi-phase outflow information. We find that the ionized
phase of the outflows has on average an electron density three times higher
than the disc ($n_{\rm e, disc}$ $\sim$ 145 cm$^{-3}$ vs $n_{\rm e, outflow}$
$\sim$ 500 cm$^{-3}$), suggesting that cloud compression in the outflow is more
important that cloud dissipation. We find that the difference in extinction
between outflow and disc correlates with the outflow gas mass. Together with
the analysis of the outflow velocities, this suggests that at least some of the
outflows are associated with the ejection of dusty clouds from the disc. This
may support models where radiation pressure on dust contributes to driving
galactic outflows. The presence of dust in outflows is relevant for potential
formation of molecules inside them. We combine our data with millimetre data to
investigate the molecular phase. We find that the molecular phase accounts for
more than 60 $\%$ of the total mass outflow rate in most objects and this
fraction is higher in AGN-dominated systems. The neutral atomic phase
contributes of the order of 10 $\%$, while the ionized phase is negligible. The
ionized-to-molecular mass outflow rate declines slightly with AGN luminosity,

the thermal to gravitational energy ($\alpha_0$). We study $16$ models in total

In these models, a large-sized rotationally-supported disk forms and a weak
outflow appears, in contrast to a smaller disk and strong outflow in the

indicate that relics are more common in denser environments, where merging
events predominate. To verify this scenario, we compared the number counts of a
sample of ultracompact massive galaxies (UCMGs) selected within the third data

mildly on the global environment, with denser environments penalizing the

line-of-sight velocity. We provide information on the line-of-sight kinematics

with cosmological zoom-in simulation, finding qualitative agreement between
them. A simple two-component (accretion, outflow) analytical model generally
reproduces the observed line-of-sight kinematics and projected spatial
distribution of H I. The best-fitting model suggests that galaxy-scale outflows
with initial velocity $v_{out}$ ~ 600 km/s dominate the kinematics of
circumgalactic H I out to $D_{tran}$ ~ 50 kpc, while H I at $D_{tran}$ > 100
kpc is dominated by infall with characteristic $v_{in}$ < $v_c$, where $v_c$ is
the circular velocity of the host halo ($M_h$ ~ $10^{12} M_\odot$). Over the
impact parameter range 80 < $D_{tran}$/pkpc < 200, the H I line-of-sight
velocity range reaches a minimum, with a corresponding flattening in the
rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width. These observations can be naturally
explained as the transition between outflow-dominated and accretion-dominated
flows. Beyond $D_{tran}$ ~ 300 kpc, the line of sight kinematics are dominated
by Hubble expansion.

spectroscopy. We apply MCSED to a sample of $\sim2000$ $1.90<z<2.35$ galaxies
in the five CANDELS fields, which were selected via their strong [O III]
$\lambda5007$ emission, and explore the systematic behavior of their SEDs. We
find the galaxies become redder with stellar mass, due to both increasing
internal attenuation and a greater population of older stars. The slope of the
UV extinction curve also changes with stellar mass, and at least some galaxies
exhibit an extinction excess at 2175 Angstroms. Finally, we demonstrate that
below $M\lesssim10^9\,M_{\odot}$), the shape of the star-forming galaxy main
sequence is highly dependent on the galaxies' assumed SFR history, as
calculations which assume a constant SFR produce stellar masses that are
$\sim1$ dex smaller than those found using more realistic SFR histories.

holographic bulk from the structure of entanglement in a quantum state. We
start with a generic system in complete isolation, assuming it has a classical
limit involving coherent states. Then we entangle it with another system of
that kind, and subject the pair to a decohering process. We make a number of
broadly applicable and physically reasonable assumptions about this setup.
First, we assume that the states selected by the decoherence (called pointer
states) have the same local symmetries as the isolated systems, in a sense
which is made precise. We also assume that the modular Hamiltonians of pointer
states scale inversely with Planck's constant, so that the pointer states are
highly entangled in the classical limit. Finally, we require the timescale of
decoherence to scale in a certain way with Planck's constant, so that
decoherence happens very frequently in the classical limit, but not too
frequently. Given these assumptions, we demonstrate that the semiclassical
evolution of the system is dominated by a certain dynamical generalisation of
Uhlmann holonomy. We construct a coherent state path integral for this
evolution, showing that the semiclassical fields evolve in a spacetime with one
more dimension than the isolated case. The additional dimension is generated by
modular flow.

robots in human-centric environments. Previous work has primarily focused on
commands specifying the desired object's type such as ""scissors"" and/or visual
attributes such as ""red,"" thus limiting the robot to only known object classes.
We develop a model to retrieve objects based on descriptions of their usage.
The model takes in a language command containing a verb, for example ""Hand me
something to cut,"" and RGB images of candidate objects and selects the object
that best satisfies the task specified by the verb. Our model directly predicts
an object's appearance from the object's use specified by a verb phrase. We do
not need to explicitly specify an object's class label. Our approach allows us
to predict high level concepts like an object's utility based on the language
query. Based on contextual information present in the language commands, our
model can generalize to unseen object classes and unknown nouns in the
commands. Our model correctly selects objects out of sets of five candidates to
fulfill natural language commands, and achieves an average accuracy of 62.3% on
a held-out test set of unseen ImageNet object classes and 53.0% on unseen
object classes and unknown nouns. Our model also achieves an average accuracy
of 54.7% on unseen YCB object classes, which have a different image
distribution from ImageNet objects. We demonstrate our model on a KUKA LBR iiwa

metal column densities of the cool outflowing clouds entrained in the Fermi
Bubbles. We find that the number of UV absorption components per sightline
decreases as a function of increasing latitude, suggesting that the outflowing
clouds become less common with increasing latitude. The Fermi Bubble HI clouds
are accelerated up to b~7 degree, whereas when we model the UV Fermi Bubbles
clouds deprojected flow velocities, we find that they are flat or even
accelerating with distance from the Galactic center. This trend, which holds in
both the northern and southern hemispheres, indicates that the nuclear outflow
accelerates clouds throughout the Fermi Bubbles or has an acceleration phase
followed by a coasting phase. Finally, we note the existence of several
blueshifted high-velocity clouds at latitudes exceeding ~30 degree, whose
velocities cannot be explained by gas clouds confined to the inside of the
gamma-ray defined Fermi Bubbles. These anomalous velocity clouds are likely in
front of the Fermi Bubbles and could be remnants from past nuclear outflows.
Overall, these observations form a valuable set of empirical data on the

simulating a cosmological phase transition that leads to the formation of these

explore the kink solution interacting with a thermal bath and extract the
amplitude of the localized excitation as a function of temperature. We note
that this amplitude increases with temperature but again the extra energy in

provides a large-scale and open-access learning opportunity for students to
grasp the knowledge. To attract students' interest, the recommendation system
is applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a
course usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering
some specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook
students'interest to some specific knowledge concepts. To fill this gap, in
this paper, we study the problem of knowledge concept recommendation. We
propose an end-to-end graph neural network-based approach
calledAttentionalHeterogeneous Graph Convolutional Deep Knowledge
Recommender(ACKRec) for knowledge concept recommendation in MOOCs. Like other
recommendation problems, it suffers from sparsity issues. To address this
issue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn
the representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to
students and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g.,
courses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network to
capture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types
of entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process.
Specifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students'
preferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference
distribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured.
Furthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context
information from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different
interests of different students. The promising experiment results show that the
proposedACKRecis able to effectively recommend knowledge concepts to students
pursuing online learning in MOOCs.

This alternated optimization is known to be delicate in practice since it
compounds unstable adversarial training with brittle and sample-inefficient
reinforcement learning. We propose to remove the burden of the policy
optimization steps by leveraging a novel discriminator formulation.
Specifically, our discriminator is explicitly conditioned on two policies: the
one from the previous generator's iteration and a learnable policy. When
optimized, this discriminator directly learns the optimal generator's policy.
Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization
problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require
an additional optimization loop. This formulation effectively cuts by half the
implementation and computational burden of Adversarial Imitation Learning
algorithms by removing the Reinforcement Learning phase altogether. We show on
a variety of tasks that our simpler approach is competitive to prevalent

(the water bolus) to avoid overheating of the skin. In patient-specific
treatment planning, antenna feedings are optimized to maximize the specific
absorption rate (SAR) inside the tumor, or to directly maximize the temperature
there, involving a higher numerical cost. We present here a method to effect a
low-complexity temperature-based planning. It arises from recognizing that SAR
and temperature have shifted peaks due to thermal boundary conditions at the
water bolus and for physiological effects like air flow in respiratory ducts.
In our method, temperature focusing on the tumor is achieved via a SAR-based
optimization of the antenna excitations, but optimizing its target to account
for the cooling effects. The temperature optimization process is turned into
finding a SAR peak position that maximizes the chosen temperature objective
function. Application of this method to the 3D head and neck region provides a
temperature coverage that is consistently better than that obtained with
SAR-optimization alone, also considering uncertainties in thermal parameters.
This improvement is obtained by solving the bioheat equation a reduced number
of times, avoiding its inclusion in a global optimization process.

research papers applying deep learning based image processing to chest
radiographs for detection of the disease. To test the performance of the two
top models for CXR COVID-19 diagnosis on external datasets to assess model
generalizability. Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the
efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19
diagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet
evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional
dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing
patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large
false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR
(23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54
F1-score and 0.49 precision value. The FPR of the CoroNet model is
significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net -
EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%).
Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal
datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance
dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes
including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and
ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR,
which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa.
Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have
better performance and generalization.

frequently represents a large portion of the cost of the rendering pipeline
both in terms of time and space complexity, especially when rendering is done
for inspection purposes only. This problem has been addressed in the past by
incremental construction approaches, but these either result in low quality
hierarchies or in longer construction times. In this work we present OMiCroN --
Oblique Multipass Hierarchy Creation while Navigating -- which is the first
algorithm capable of immediately displaying partial renders of the geometry,
provided the cloud is made available sorted in Morton order. OMiCroN is fast,
being capable of building the entire data structure in memory spending an
amount of time that is comparable to that of just reading the cloud from disk.
Thus, there is no need for storing an expensive hierarchy, nor for delaying the
rendering until the whole hierarchy is read from disk. In fact, a pipeline
coupling OMiCroN with an incremental sorting algorithm running in parallel can
start rendering as soon as the first sorted prefix is produced, making this
setup very convenient for streamed viewing.

on the distribution assumption of data. However, for complex data that are
increasingly available in many scientific fields, the specification of their
underlying distribution turns out to be challenging, and the existing criteria
may be limited and are not general enough to handle a variety of model
selection problems. Here, we propose a robust and consistent model selection
criterion based upon the empirical likelihood function which is data-driven. In
particular, this framework adopts plug-in estimators that can be achieved by
solving external estimating equations, not limited to the empirical likelihood,
which avoids potential computational convergence issues and allows versatile
applications, such as generalized linear models, generalized estimating
equations, penalized regressions and so on. The formulation of our proposed
criterion is initially derived from the asymptotic expansion of the marginal
likelihood under variable selection framework, but more importantly, the
consistent model selection property is established under a general context.
Extensive simulation studies confirm the out-performance of the proposal
compared to traditional model selection criteria. Finally, an application to
the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study illustrates the practical value
of this proposed framework.

following a quench into the ordered phase. We explore the crossover between
dissipative and conservative evolution by performing numerical simulations
within the classical field methodology. Regardless of the dissipation strength,
we find clear evidence for universal scaling, with dynamical critical exponent
$z$ characterising the growth of the correlation length. In the dissipative
limit we find growth consistent with the logarithmically corrected law
$[t/\log(t/t_0)]^{1/z}$, and exponent $z=2$, in agreement with previous
studies. Decreasing the dissipation towards the conservative limit, we find
strong numerical evidence for the expected growth law $t^{1/z}$. However, we
observe a smooth crossover in $z$ that converges to an anomalous value
distinctly lower than $2$ at a small finite dissipation strength. We show that
this lower exponent may be attributable to a power-law vortex mobility arising
from vortex--sound interactions.

its potential in im-provement of the switching speed and thus total energy

hybrid SRAM array of 64 KB show a factor of 7 and 34 reduction in read delay

NOMA networks are investigated by invoking stochastic geometry techniques. We
propose a novel \textit{dynamic protocol} to interpret which part of the GF

is observed that dynamic protocol provides more accurate channel quality

rehabilitation of infants with moderate-to-severe perinatal brain damage (PBD).
Methods: Thirty-two participants were recruited (7-to-16 years) and divided
into 3 groups: one Healthy group (n = 11), one group with PBD treated with
Katona methodology from 2 months of corrected age, and with long-term follow-up
(n = 12), and one group with PBD but without treatment in the first year of
life due to late diagnosis of PBD (n = 9). Neuropediatric evaluations, motor
evoked potentials (MEPs) and magnetic resonance images (MRI) were made. The PBD
groups were matched by severity and topography of lesion. Results: The patients
treated with Katona had better motor performance when compared to patients
without early treatment (Gross Motor Function Classification System levels; 75%
of Katona group were classified in levels I and II and 78% of patients without
early treatment were classified in levels III and IV). Furthermore, independent
k-means cluster analyses of MRI, MEPs, and neuropediatric evaluations data were
performed. Katona and non-treated early groups were classified in the same MRI
cluster which is the expected for patient's population with PBD. However, in
MEPs and neuropediatric evaluations clustering, the 67% of Katona group were
assigning into Healthy group showing the impact of Katona therapy over the
patients treated with it. These results highlight the Katona therapy benefits
in early rehabilitation of infants with moderate-to-severe PBD. Conclusions:
Katona therapy and early rehabilitation have an important therapeutic effect in
infants with moderate-to-severe PBD by decreasing the severity of motor
disability in later stages of life.

takes to multiply a $d \times N$ matrix by its transpose, and $\kappa$ is the

polynomial dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ in the runtime is prohibitively large.

$\Sigma$ is reasonably conditioned, our runtime matches that of the fastest
algorithm for covariance estimation without outliers, up to poly-logarithmic
factors, showing that we can get robustness essentially ""for free.""

undergo avoided crossings, which produce a characteristic ""mode bumping"" of the

between modes in the p- and g-mode cavities that are near resonance with each

rely on the JWKB approach, which is strictly speaking inapplicable for the
low-order g-modes observed in subgiants, or the low-order p-modes seen in very
evolved red giants. We present both a nonasymptotic prescription for isolating
the two mode cavities, as well as a perturbative (and also nonasymptotic)

low-order g- and p-modes in these physical situations. Finally, we discuss how
these results may be applied to modelling subgiant stars and determining their
global properties from oscillation frequencies. We also make our code for all

machine learning. While NAS offers great promise, the prohibitive computational
demand of most of the existing NAS methods makes it difficult to directly
search the architectures on large-scale tasks. The typical way of conducting
large scale NAS is to search for an architectural building block on a small
dataset (either using a proxy set from the large dataset or a completely
different small scale dataset) and then transfer the block to a larger dataset.
Despite a number of recent results that show the promise of transfer from proxy
datasets, a comprehensive evaluation of different NAS methods studying the
impact of different source datasets has not yet been addressed. In this work,
we propose to analyze the architecture transferability of different NAS methods
by performing a series of experiments on large scale benchmarks such as
ImageNet1K and ImageNet22K. We find that: (i) The size and domain of the proxy
set does not seem to influence architecture performance on the target dataset.
On average, transfer performance of architectures searched using completely
different small datasets (e.g., CIFAR10) perform similarly to the architectures
searched directly on proxy target datasets. However, design of proxy sets has
considerable impact on rankings of different NAS methods. (ii) While different
NAS methods show similar performance on a source dataset (e.g., CIFAR10), they
significantly differ on the transfer performance to a large dataset (e.g.,
ImageNet1K). (iii) Even on large datasets, random sampling baseline is very
competitive, but the choice of the appropriate combination of proxy set and
search strategy can provide significant improvement over it. We believe that
our extensive empirical analysis will prove useful for future design of NAS
algorithms.

conjecture a general form for the endpoint contribution that applies to any

title are of high importance in the evaluation of individuals' research
performance not only when a researcher applies for obtaining a DSc title, but
also during promotions and appointments at universities, and in the case of the
evaluation of applications for scientific titles and degrees, and the
assessment of applications for funding. In the Section of Earth Sciences
encompassing nine related disciplines, rather than carrying out a
straightforward bibliometric analysis, the performance indicators were designed
as a result of a consensual agreement between leading academicians, each of
whom represented a particular discipline. Therefore, the minimum values of the
indicators, required to be fulfilled if one is applying for a DSc title, do not
adequately reflect the actual discipline-specific performance of researchers.
This problem may generate tension between researchers during the evaluation
process. The main goal of this paper is to recalibrate the minimum values of
four major performance indicators by taking the actual discipline-specific
distance ratios into account. In addition, each minimum value will be defined
by employing integer and fractional counting methods as well. The research
outcome of this study can provide impetus for the Section of Earth Sciences to
optimize the minimum values of the DSc title performance indicators by taking
the specifics of each discipline into account. Because academic performance
indicators are also employed in other Eastern European countries in the

Therefore, the parameter space should be explored in a conservative way to
ensure that none of the constraints are violated during the optimization
process once we start from a safe initialization point. To this end, we develop
an algorithm called Reliable Frank-Wolfe (Reliable-FW). Given a general
non-convex function and an unknown polytope constraint, Reliable-FW
simultaneously learns the landscape of the objective function and the boundary
of the safety polytope. More precisely, by assuming that Reliable-FW has access
to a (stochastic) gradient oracle of the objective function and a noisy
feasibility oracle of the safety polytope, it finds an $\epsilon$-approximate
first-order stationary point with the optimal ${\mathcal{O}}({1}/{\epsilon^2})$
gradient oracle complexity (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({1}/{\epsilon^3})$ (also
optimal) in the stochastic gradient setting), while ensuring the safety of all
the iterates. Rather surprisingly, Reliable-FW only makes
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(({d^2}/{\epsilon^2})\log 1/\delta)$ queries to the noisy
feasibility oracle (resp. $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(({d^2}/{\epsilon^4})\log

$\delta$ is the reliability parameter, tightening the existing bounds even for
safe minimization of convex functions. We further specialize our results to the

sequences consisting of the concatenation of re-usable ""motifs"". In the context
of neuroscience or robotics, these motifs would be the motor primitives from
which complex behavior is generated. Given a known set of motifs, can a new
motif be learned without affecting the performance of the known set and then
used in new sequences without first explicitly learning every possible
transition? Two requirements enable this: (i) parameter updates while learning
a new motif do not interfere with the parameters used for the previously
acquired ones; and (ii) a new motif can be robustly generated when starting
from the network state reached at the end of any of the other motifs, even if
that state was not present during training. We meet the first requirement by
investigating artificial neural networks (ANNs) with specific architectures,
and attempt to meet the second by training them to generate motifs from random
initial states. We find that learning of single motifs succeeds but that
sequence generation is not robust: transition failures are observed. We then
compare these results with a model whose architecture and
analytically-tractable dynamics are inspired by the motor thalamocortical
circuit, and that includes a specific module used to implement motif
transitions. The synaptic weights of this model can be adjusted without
requiring stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the simulated network outputs,
and we have asymptotic guarantees that transitions will not fail. Indeed, in
simulations, we achieve single-motif accuracy on par with the previously
studied ANNs and have improved sequencing robustness with no transition
failures. Finally, we show that insights obtained by studying the transition
subnetwork of this model can also improve the robustness of transitioning in
the traditional ANNs previously studied.

solve problems in computer vision. On the other hand, Lie algebraic
representations of the transformations therein were introduced to overcome the
difficulties behind group structure by mapping the transformation groups to
linear spaces. In this paper we focus on application of Lie groups and Lie
algebras to find the rigid transformation that best register two surfaces
represented by point clouds. The so called pairwise rigid registration can be
formulated by comparing intrinsic second-order orientation tensors that encode
local geometry. These tensors can be (locally) represented by symmetric
non-negative definite matrices. In this paper we interpret the obtained tensor
field as a multivariate normal model. So, we start with the fact that the space
of Gaussians can be equipped with a Lie group structure, that is isomorphic to
a subgroup of the upper triangular matrices. Consequently, the associated Lie
algebra structure enables us to handle Gaussians, and consequently, to compare
orientation tensors, with Euclidean operations. We apply this methodology to
variants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP), a known technique for pairwise
registration. We compare the obtained results with the original implementations
that apply the comparative tensor shape factor (CTSF), which is a similarity
notion based on the eigenvalues of the orientation tensors. We notice that the
similarity measure in tensor spaces directly derived from Lie's approach is not
invariant under rotations, which is a problem in terms of rigid registration.
Despite of this, the performed computational experiments show promising results
when embedding orientation tensor fields in Lie algebras.

states by simultaneously measuring at least two mechanical parameters of the

converging shocks where a single experiment probes a range of pressures as the
converging shock strengthens. However, at sufficiently high pressures, the
shocked material becomes hot enough that the x-ray opacity falls significantly.
If the system includes a Lagrangian marker, such that the mass within the
marker is known, this additional information can be used to constrain the
opacity as well as the Hugoniot state. In the limit that the opacity changes
only on shock heating, and not significantly on subsequent isentropic
compression, the opacity of shocked material can be determined uniquely. More
generally, it is necessary to assume the form of the variation of opacity with
isentropic compression, or to introduce multiple marker layers. Alternatively,
assuming either the equation of state or the opacity, the presence of a marker
layer in such experiments enables the non-assumed property to be deduced more
accurately than from the radiographic density reconstruction alone. An example
analysis is shown for measurements of a converging shock wave in polystyrene,
at the National Ignition Facility.

Unable to prevent the buffers from leaking, Intel issued countermeasures via
microcode updates that overwrite the buffers when the CPU changes security

  In this work we present CacheOut, a new microarchitectural attack that is
capable of bypassing Intel's buffer overwrite countermeasures. We observe that
as data is being evicted from the CPU's L1 cache, it is often transferred back
to the leaky CPU buffers where it can be recovered by the attacker. CacheOut
improves over previous MDS attacks by allowing the attacker to choose which
data to leak from the CPU's L1 cache, as well as which part of a cache line to
leak. We demonstrate that CacheOut can leak information across multiple

tracing the spread of certain diseases. Governments and regulators are turning
to use these features to trace the people thought to have symptoms of certain
diseases or virus e.g. COVID-19. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, has
seen a surge of the mobile applications for tracing, tracking and isolating the
persons showing COVID-19 symptoms to limit the spread of disease to the larger
community. The use of embedded sensors could disclose private information of
the users thus potentially bring threat to the privacy and security of users.
In this paper, we analyzed a large set of smartphone applications that have
been designed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus and bring the people
back to normal life. Specifically, we have analyzed what type of permission
these smartphone apps require, whether these permissions are necessary for the
track and trace, how data from the user devices is transported to the analytic
center, and analyzing the security measures these apps have deployed to ensure
the privacy and security of users.

computations are in good agreement with the experimental observations and the
weakly nonlinear analysis. Nonlinear simulations reveal that due to the
existence of a second interface, the classical highly branched morphologies are
replaced by less unstable structures in which finger tip-splitting and finger
competition phenomena are evidently restrained as the initial annulus'
thickness is reduced. In addition, these novels patterns develop fingers with a
series of low-amplitude bumps at their tips, associated with the enhanced
growth of high-frequency modes promoted by the increasing coupling strength of

constructed surface water impoundments is an important tool to characterize the
function and health of these systems, but is generally carried out manually.
This is costly and can be hazardous and difficult for humans due to
inaccessibility, contamination, or availability of required equipment. Robotic
sampling systems can ease these burdens, but little work has examined the
efficiency of such sampling means and no prior work has investigated the
quality of the resulting samples. This paper presents an experimental study
that evaluates and optimizes sediment sampling patterns applied to a robot
sediment sampling system that allows collection of minimally-disturbed sediment
cores from natural and man-made water bodies for various sediment types. To
meet this need, we developed and tested a robotic sampling platform in the
laboratory to test functionality under a range of sediment types and operating
conditions. Specifically, we focused on three patterns by which a cylindrical
coring device was driven into the sediment (linear, helical, and zig-zag) for
three sediment types (coarse sand, medium sand, and silt). The results show
that the optimal sampling pattern varies depending on the type of sediment and
can be optimized based on the sampling objective. We examined two sampling
objectives: maximizing the mass of minimally disturbed sediment and minimizing
the power per mass of sample. This study provides valuable data to aid in the
selection of optimal sediment coring methods for various applications and
builds a solid foundation for future field testing under a range of
environmental conditions.

an infected person, which causes widespread community transmission and mass
infection. To address this problem, we develop an e-government Privacy
Preserving Mobile and Fog computing framework entitled PPMF that can trace
infected and suspected cases nationwide. We use personal mobile devices with
contact tracing app and two types of stationary fog nodes, named Automatic Risk
Checkers (ARC) and Suspected User Data Uploader Node (SUDUN), to trace
community transmission alongside maintaining user data privacy. Each user's
mobile device receives a Unique Encrypted Reference Code (UERC) when
registering on the central application. The mobile device and the central
application both generate Rotational Unique Encrypted Reference Code (RUERC),
which broadcasted using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology. The ARCs are
placed at the entry points of buildings, which can immediately detect if there
are positive or suspected cases nearby. If any confirmed case is found, the
ARCs broadcast pre-cautionary messages to nearby people without revealing the
identity of the infected person. The SUDUNs are placed at the health centers
that report test results to the central cloud application. The reported data is
later used to map between infected and suspected cases. Therefore, using our
proposed PPMF framework, governments can let organizations continue their
economic activities without complete lockdown.

pandemic by recalibrating the population agendas to include work-from-home and
re-estimating the mode choice model for MATSim-NYC to fit observed traffic and
transit ridership data. Assuming the change in behavior exhibits inertia during
reopening, we analyze the increase in car traffic due to the phased reopen plan
guided by the state government of New York. Four reopening phases and two
reopening scenarios (with and without transit capacity restrictions) are
analyzed. A Phase 4 reopening with 100% transit capacity may only see as much
as 73% of pre-COVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as
much as 142% of pre-pandemic levels. Limiting transit capacity to 50% would
decrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64% while increasing car trips
to as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears small,
the impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already
increased traffic congestion. Many of the trips also get shifted to other modes
like micromobility. The findings imply that a transit capacity restriction
policy during reopening needs to be accompanied by (1) support for
micromobility modes, particularly in non-Manhattan boroughs, and (2) congestion
alleviation policies that focus on reducing traffic in Manhattan, such as
cordon-based pricing.

then assessed by evaluating the difference from its projection onto the
good-quality manifold. In particular, the projection is refined through
iterative search in the latent space. The proposed method achieves high
prediction accuracy on two publicly available cardiac MRI datasets. Moreover,
it shows better generalisation ability than traditional regression-based
methods. Our approach provides a real-time and model-agnostic quality control

consists of a change of variables combined with a discretization on a staggered

singularities of the Navier-Stokes equations at the sphere centre and along the
polar axis. This new method alleviates also the time step restrictions
introduced by the discretization around the polar axis while the sphere centre
still yields strong limitations, although only in very unfavourable flow
configurations.
  The scheme is second-order accurate in space and is verified and validated by
computing numerical examples that are compared with similar results produced by
other codes or available from the literature.
  The method can cope with flows evolving in the whole sphere, in a spherical
shell and in a sector without any change and, thanks to the flexibility of
finite-differences, it can employ generic mesh stretching (in two of the three
directions) and complex boundary conditions.

first effective learning rate expression of Adam is derived. Then the
demonstration that, in the presence of NLs, performing Stochastic Gradient

geometry of their stress-free state. Elastic deformations separate into
in-plane stretching and lower energy out-of-plane bending deformations. For
elastic structures with a curved stress-free state, these two elastic modes are
coupled within linear elasticity. We investigate the effect of that
curvature-induced coupling on wave propagation in lower dimensional elastic
structures, focusing on the simplest example -- a curved elastic rod. We find
that the dispersion relation of the waves becomes gapped in the presence of
finite curvature; bending modes are absent below a frequency proportional to
the curvature of the rod. By studying the scattering of undulatory waves off
regions of uniform curvature, we find that undulatory waves with frequencies in
the gap associated with the curved region tunnel through that curved region via
conversion into compression waves. These results should be directly applicable
to the spectrum and spatial distribution of phonon modes in a number of curved
rod-like elastic solids, including carbon nanotubes and biopolymer filaments.

scales. The size of the discretized problems forces the utilization of
iterative linear solvers with solution time dependant on the quality of the
preconditioner. The lack of clear separation between the scales, as well as the
high-contrast, imposes severe challenges on the standard preconditioning
techniques. Thus, here we propose new methods for the high-contrast elasticity
equation with performance independent of the high-contrast and the multi-scale
structure of the elasticity problem. The solvers are based on two-levels domain
decomposition techniques with a carefully constructed coarse level to deal with
the high-contrast and multi-scale nature of the problem. The construction
utilizes spectral equivalence between scalar diffusion and each displacement
block of the elasticity problems and, in contrast to previous solutions
proposed in the literature, is able to select the appropriate dimension of the
coarse space automatically. The new methods inherit the advantages of domain
decomposition techniques, such as easy parallelization and scalability. The
presented numerical experiments demonstrate the excellent performance of the
proposed methods.

Within this context, here we investigate the possibility of using terminated
unidirectional plasmonic waveguides to enhance typically weak nonlinear effects
by orders of magnitude. We theoretically demonstrate remarkable levels of
electric field enhancement and confinement (field hot-spots) when the
unidirectional waveguiding structure is terminated with a suitable boundary
that fully stops the one-way mode. Such a large field enhancement, originating
from a nonresonant effect, is fundamentally different from the narrow-band
field concentration effects in resonant plasmonic structures. Instead, it is
analogous to the broadband response of plasmonic tapers, but without the need
for any adiabatic impedance matching. We show that this effect can indeed lead
to a substantial boosting of nonlinear light-matter interactions, exemplified
by an improvement of several orders of magnitude in the
third-harmonic-generation efficiency, which is of large significance for
several applications. More broadly, our findings show the potential of extreme
nonreciprocal configurations for enhanced wave-matter interactions.

(NDR) effect due to a Joule-heating-induced metal-insulator transition of the
Ti4O7 conductive filament. Carrier transport analysis of all multilevel
switching I-V curves show that while the insulating regime follows the space
charge limited current (SCLC) model for all resistance states, the conduction
in the metallic regime is dominated by SCLC and trap-assisted tunneling (TAT)
for low- and high-resistance states respectively. A non-monotonic conductance
evolution is observed in the insulating regime, as opposed to the continuous
and gradual conductance increase and decrease obtained in the metallic regime
during the multilevel SET and RESET operations. Cryogenic transport analysis
coupled to an analytical model accounting for the
metal-insulator-transition-induced NDR effects and the resistance states of the
device provide new insights on the conductive filament evolution dynamics and
resistive switching mechanisms. Our findings suggest that the non-monotonic
conductance evolution in the insulating regime is due to the combined effects
of longitudinal and radial variations of the Ti4O7 conductive filament during
the switching. This behavior results from the interplay between temperature-
and field-dependent geometrical and physical characteristics of the filament.

due to the structure of the diffusion environment. To address this issue, this
paper studies the capacity of the diffusion based molecular communication by
exploiting both time and concentration level of the released molecules for
information transfer. The transmitter releases molecules in one of the
sub-intervals with a level of concentration both determined by input data,
hereby applying joint time and concentration (JTAC) modulation. The observation
time, at the receiver, which is equal to symbol period, is divided to some
sub-intervals, not necessarily equal to the number of sub-intervals in the
transmitter, and the number of received molecules in each sub-interval is
counted. We propose three practical schemes, depending on how the receiver uses
the number of molecules counted in the sub-intervals and find the lower bound
on capacity in each case. Moreover, the symmetric Kullback-Liebler (KL)
divergence metric is used to obtain a computable upper bound on the JTAC
channel capacity. Finally, the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm is used to compute the
capacity numerically, and to determine how tight the derived bounds are. Our
numerical results indicate that our bounds are tight especially in environments
with high diffusion coefficient. The improvements compared to the conventional
concentration based modulation and timing based modulation are also
demonstrated.

In this paper, we take an initial step towards an understanding of such hybrid

Furthermore, our analysis matches closely our experimental observations under

is not possible to conduct a second reference measurement on the same physical
system to compare the measurement outcome with a more accurate value of the
measured quantity. Here, I show that a direct evaluation of measurement
uncertainties is possible when the measurement outcomes are used to compensate
the small amount of decoherence induced in a probe qubit by carefully
controlled interactions with the system. Since the original uncertainty of the
target observable causes fluctuating phase shifts in the probe qubit, any
additional information obtained about the target observable can be used to
compensate a part of the decoherence by applying a conditional phase shift to
the reference qubit. The magnitude of this negative feedback corresponds to an
estimate of the target observable, and the uncompensated decoherence defines
the uncertainty of that estimate. The results of the analysis show that the
uncertainties of the estimates are given by the uncertainties introduced by
Ozawa in Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105 (2003) and the optimal estimates are given by
the weak values associated with the different measurement outcomes. Feedback
compensation of decoherence therefore demonstrates the empirical validity of
definitions of errors and estimates that combine the initial information of the
input state with the additional information provided by each measurement
outcome.

available, local data are exploited by the subsystems in order to construct the
local terminal set and terminal cost, which guarantee recursive feasibility and
asymptotic stability, as well as performance improvement over iterations. In

of dynamical systems from high-dimensional sensory observations. Learning
controllable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this
challenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space,
estimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the
latent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a
representation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to
achieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In
this paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first
formulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by
a policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model
control-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for
CARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature
(PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of
CARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control
algorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm,
namely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant
improvement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control,
and demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided
CARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss
function, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy. We
evaluate the proposed algorithms by extensive experiments on benchmark tasks

that, for some classification tasks, RKHS methods can replace NNs without a
large loss in performance. On the other hand, two-layers NNs are known to
encode richer smoothness classes than RKHS and we know of special examples for
which SGD-trained NN provably outperform RKHS. This is true even in the wide
network limit, for a different scaling of the initialization.
  How can we reconcile the above claims? For which tasks do NNs outperform
RKHS? If covariates are nearly isotropic, RKHS methods suffer from the curse of
dimensionality, while NNs can overcome it by learning the best low-dimensional
representation. Here we show that this curse of dimensionality becomes milder
if the covariates display the same low-dimensional structure as the target
function, and we precisely characterize this tradeoff. Building on these
results, we present the spiked covariates model that can capture in a unified
framework both behaviors observed in earlier work.
  We hypothesize that such a latent low-dimensional structure is present in

specific perturbations of the training distribution degrade the performances of
RKHS methods much more significantly than NNs.

We adopt a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework for OCIM, but
unlike the non-competitive setting, the important monotonicity property
(influence spread increases when influence probabilities on edges increase) no
longer holds due to the competitive nature of propagation, which brings a
significant new challenge to the problem. We provide a nontrivial proof showing
that the Triggering Probability Modulated (TPM) condition for CMAB still holds
in OCIM, which is instrumental for our proposed algorithms OCIM-TS and OCIM-OFU
to achieve sublinear Bayesian and frequentist regret, respectively. We also
design an OCIM-ETC algorithm that requires less feedback and easier offline
computation, at the expense of a worse frequentist regret bound. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.

a hierarchical framework that integrates a local dynamic path planner with a
longer term objective based planner and advanced motion control methods, whilst
taking into consideration the dynamic responses of moving individuals within
the environment. The framework is motivated by and synthesizes our recent work
on energy aware mission planning, path planning in dynamic environments, and
receding horizon motion control. In this paper we detail the proposed framework
and outline its integration on a robotic platform. We evaluate the strategy in
extensive simulated trials, traversing between objective waypoints to complete
tasks such as soil sampling, weeding and recharging across a dynamic

adapted and applied to study the evolution of oil droplets in a turbulent jet
including the effects of droplet breakup. A key unknown in simulating secondary
breakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated
within the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection
inflow condition is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often
unrealistic. In order to provide more realistic inlet conditions for LES, we
develop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution of the
dispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of
advection, radial turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in
the regions closer to the jet nozzle that cannot be resolved using coarse LES.
The model is validated with experimental data measured far from the nozzle. The
1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a
coarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of
the discretized droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES
approach and scalar transport equations are solved for each bin. LES results
are compared to published experimental data, with good agreement and we examine
the statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse
oil droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline
decay rate of the concentration for different droplet sizes is modified in the
breakup dominated zone. Unlike Reynolds averaged approaches, LES also allows us
to quantify size distribution variability due to turbulence. We quantify the
radial and axial distributions and the variability of key quantities such as
the Sauter mean diameter, total surface area and droplet breakup time-scale and
explore their sensitivity to the Weber number.

methods to interpret the contribution of features for the general public and

high area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) (0.90),
accuracy (0.90), sensitivity (0.94), and specificity (0.97) with highly

functions applied to multivariate random variables with arbitrary
distributions. Rather than assuming a particular distribution, we assume that
we are only given the first four moments of the distribution. The goal is to
summarize the distribution using a small number of quadrature nodes which are
called $\sigma$-points. We achieve this by choosing nodes and weights in order
to match the specified moments of the distribution. The classical scaled
unscented transform (SUT) matches the mean and covariance of a distribution. In
this paper, introduce the higher order unscented transform (HOUT) which also
matches any given skewness and kurtosis tensors. It turns out that the key to
matching the higher moments is the rank-1 tensor decomposition. While the
minimal rank-1 decomposition is NP-complete, we present a practical algorithm
for computing a non-minimal rank-1 decomposition and prove convergence in
linear time. We then show how to combine the rank-1 decompositions of the
moments in order to form the $\sigma$-points and weights of the HOUT. By
passing the $\sigma$-points through a nonlinear function and applying our
quadrature rule we can estimate the moments of the output distribution. We
prove that the HOUT is exact on arbitrary polynomials up to fourth order.
Finally, we numerically compare the HOUT to the SUT on nonlinear functions
applied to non-Gaussian random variables including an application to
forecasting and uncertainty quantification for chaotic dynamics.

ranging from weather forecasting to drug design. The veracity of these

Massively parallel simulations predict the system dynamics by resolving all
spatiotemporal scales, often at a cost that prevents experimentation while
their findings may not allow for generalisation. On the other hand reduced
order models are fast but limited by the frequently adopted linearization of
the system dynamics and/or the utilization of heuristic closures. Here we
present a novel systematic framework that bridges large scale simulations and
reduced order models to Learn the Effective Dynamics (LED) of diverse complex
systems. The framework forms algorithmic alloys between non-linear machine
learning algorithms and the Equation-Free approach for modeling complex
systems. LED deploys autoencoders to formulate a mapping between fine and
coarse-grained representations and evolves the latent space dynamics using
recurrent neural networks. The algorithm is validated on benchmark problems and
we find that it outperforms state of the art reduced order models in terms of
predictability and large scale simulations in terms of cost. LED is applicable
to systems ranging from chemistry to fluid mechanics and reduces the
computational effort by up to two orders of magnitude while maintaining the
prediction accuracy of the full system dynamics. We argue that LED provides a
novel potent modality for the accurate prediction of complex systems.

concept of the total deflection angle of a light ray. The concept is defined by
the difference between the sum of internal angles of two triangles; one of the
triangles lies on curved spacetime distorted by a gravitating body and the
other on its background. The triangle required to define the total deflection
angle can be realized by setting three laser-beam baselines as in planned space
missions such as LATOR, ASTROD-GW, and LISA. Accordingly, the new total
deflection angle is, in principle, measurable by gauging the internal angles of
the triangles. The new definition of the total deflection angle can provide a
geometrically and intuitively clear interpretation. Two formulas are proposed
to calculate the total deflection angle on the basis of the Gauss--Bonnet
theorem. It is shown that in the case of the Schwarzschild spacetime, the
expression for the total deflection angle $\alpha_{\rm Sch}$ reduces to
Epstein--Shapiro's formula when the source of a light ray and the observer are
located in an asymptotically flat region. Additionally, in the case of the
Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetime, the expression for the total deflection
angle $\alpha_{\rm SdS}$ comprises the Schwarzschild-like parts and coupling
terms of the central mass $m$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the
form of ${\cal O}(\Lambda m)$ instead of ${\cal O}(\Lambda/m)$. Furthermore,
$\alpha_{\rm SdS}$ does not include the terms characterized only by the
cosmological constant $\Lambda$.

we demonstrate that intermediate neural representations add more flexibility to
neural networks and can be advantageous over raw inputs. We consider a fixed,
randomly initialized neural network as a representation function fed into
another trainable network. When the trainable network is the quadratic Taylor
model of a wide two-layer network, we show that neural representation can
achieve improved sample complexities compared with the raw input: For learning
a low-rank degree-$p$ polynomial ($p \geq 4$) in $d$ dimension, neural
representation requires only $\tilde{O}(d^{\lceil p/2 \rceil})$ samples, while
the best-known sample complexity upper bound for the raw input is
$\tilde{O}(d^{p-1})$. We contrast our result with a lower bound showing that
neural representations do not improve over the raw input (in the infinite width
limit), when the trainable network is instead a neural tangent kernel. Our
results characterize when neural representations are beneficial, and may
provide a new perspective on why depth is important in deep learning.

recombined by applying a temporal sequence of Raman pulses during the expansion
of a cloud of cold atoms behaving approximately as a point source. The PSI can
work as a sensitive multi-axes gyroscope that can automatically filter out the
signal from accelerations. The phase shift arising from rotations is
proportional to the momentum transferred to each atom from the Raman pulses.
Therefore, by increasing the momentum transfer, it should be possibly to
enhance the sensitivity of the PSI. Here, we investigate the degree of
enhancement in sensitivity that could be achieved by augmenting the PSI with
large momentum transfer (LMT) employing a sequence of many Raman pulses with
alternating directions. Contrary to typical approaches used for describing a
PSI, we employ a model under which the motion of the center of mass of each
atom is described quantum mechanically. We show how increasing Doppler shifts
lead to imperfections, thereby limiting the visibility of the signal fringes,
and identify ways to suppress this effect by increasing the effective,
two-photon Rabi frequencies of the Raman pulses. Taking into account the effect
of spontaneous emission, we show that, for a given value of the one-photon Rabi
frequency, there is an optimum value for the number of pulses employed, beyond
which the net enhancement in sensitivity begins to decrease. For a one-photon
Rabi frequency of 200 MHz, for example, the peak value of the factor of
enhancement in sensitivity is ~39, for a momentum transfer that is ~69 times as
large as that for a conventional PSI. We also find that this peak value scales

$p_t^e(n)/p(n)$, which also gives $p_t^o(n)/p(n)$ since $p_t^e(n) + p_t^0(n) =
p(n)$. For even $t$, we show that $$\lim\limits_{n \to \infty}

intriguing finding is that the flat band does not modify the Dirac cone of
Bi2Se3 around the Dirac point. Furthermore, we found that the flat band and the
Dirac surface states of Bi2Se3 have opposite energy shifts with electron
doping. This opens a novel way of controlling the spin texture of photocurrents

this flat band remarkably distinguishable from previous findings and our

fundamental problems in computer science, which finds application in fields
such as computational biology, text processing, information retrieval, data
compression etc. It is well known that (decision version of) the problem of
finding the length of a LCS of an arbitrary number of input sequences (which we
refer to as Multi-LCS problem) is NP-complete. Jiang and Li [SICOMP'95] showed
that if Max-Clique is hard to approximate within a factor of $s$ then Multi-LCS
is also hard to approximate within a factor of $\Theta(s)$. By the NP-hardness
of the problem of approximating Max-Clique by Zuckerman [ToC'07], for any
constant $\delta>0$, the length of a LCS of arbitrary number of input sequences
of length $n$ each, cannot be approximated within an $n^{1-\delta}$-factor in
polynomial time unless {\tt{P}}$=${\NP}. However, the reduction of Jiang and Li
assumes the alphabet size to be $\Omega(n)$. So far no hardness result is known
for the problem of approximating Multi-LCS over sub-linear sized alphabet. On
the other hand, it is easy to get $1/|\Sigma|$-factor approximation for strings
of alphabet $\Sigma$.
  In this paper, we make a significant progress towards proving hardness of
approximation over small alphabet by showing a polynomial-time reduction from
the well-studied \emph{densest $k$-subgraph} problem with {\em perfect
completeness} to approximating Multi-LCS over alphabet of size $poly(n/k)$. As
a consequence, from the known hardness result of densest $k$-subgraph problem
(e.g. [Manurangsi, STOC'17]) we get that no polynomial-time algorithm can give
an $n^{-o(1)}$-factor approximation of Multi-LCS over an alphabet of size
$n^{o(1)}$, unless the Exponential Time Hypothesis is false.

J1007+2115 is the second quasar now known at $z>7.5$, deep into the
reionization epoch. The quasar is powered by a $(1.5\pm0.2)\times10^9$
$M_{\odot}$ supermassive black hole (SMBH), based on its broad MgII
emission-line profile from Gemini and Keck near-IR spectroscopy. The SMBH in
J1007+2115 is twice as massive as that in quasar J1342+0928 at $z=7.54$, the
current quasar redshift record holder. The existence of such a massive SMBH
just 700 million years after the Big Bang significantly challenges models of
the earliest SMBH growth. Model assumptions of Eddington-limited accretion and
a radiative efficiency of 0.1 require a seed black hole of $\gtrsim 10^{4}$
$M_{\odot}$ at $z=30$. This requirement suggests either a massive black hole
seed as a result of direct collapse or earlier periods of rapid black hole
growth with hyper-Eddington accretion and/or a low radiative efficiency. We
measure the damping wing signature imprinted by neutral hydrogen absorption in
the intergalactic medium (IGM) on J1007+2115's Ly$\alpha$ line profile, and
find that it is weaker than that of J1342+0928 and two other $z\gtrsim7$
quasars. We estimate an IGM volume-averaged neutral fraction $\langle
x\rm_{HI}\rangle=0.39^{+0.22}_{-0.13}$. This range of values suggests a patchy
reionization history toward different IGM sightlines. We detect the 158 $\mu$m
[C II] emission line in J1007+2115 with ALMA; this line centroid yields a
systemic redshift of $z=7.5149\pm0.0004$ and indicates a star formation rate of

foreground within the bounding boxes, is generated from the given instance
masks and applied to the extracted embedding features. In the tracking stage,
object instance masks are aligned by feature similarity and motion consistency
using the Hungarian association algorithm. Moreover, object re-identification

sequential decision process on graphs and train a GNN-based policy network with
reinforcement learning to learn the optimal query strategy. By jointly training
on several source graphs with full labels, we learn a transferable active
learning policy which can directly generalize to unlabeled target graphs.
Experimental results on multiple datasets from different domains prove the
effectiveness of the learned policy in promoting active learning performance in
both settings of transferring between graphs in the same domain and across
different domains.

for constructions of optical systems with robust functionalities. Conventional
studies for such polarization independence are generally restricted to special
states of either linear or circular polarizations, widely neglecting
elliptically-polarized states that are generically present in realistic
applications. Here we present a comprehensive recipe to achieve invariant
scattering properties (including extinction, scattering and absorption) for
arbitrary polarizations, requiring only rotation symmetry and absence of
optical activities. It is discovered that sole rotation symmetries can
effectively decouple the two scattering channels that originate from the
incident circularly polarized waves of opposite handedness, leading to
invariance of all scattering properties for any polarizations on the same
latitude circle of the Poincar\'{e} sphere. Further incorporations of extra
inversion or mirror symmetries would eliminate the optical activities and thus
ensure scattering property invariance for arbitrary polarizations. In sharp
contrast to previous investigations that rely heavily on complicated algebraic
formulas, our arguments are fully intuitive and geometric, bringing to surface
the essential physical principles rather than obscuring them. The
all-polarization invariance we reveal is induced by discrete spatial symmetries
of the scattering configurations, underlying which there are functioning laws
of reciprocity and conservation of parity and helicity. This symmetry-protected
intrinsic invariance is robust against any symmetry-preserving perturbations,
which may render extra flexibilities for designing optical devices with stable

structural natural frequency corresponding to this mode is estimated using an

non-convex/non-concave functions with a wide spectrum of applications. The
celebrated property of this class of functions - continuous submodularity -
enables both exact minimization and approximate maximization in poly. time.
Continuous submodularity is obtained by generalizing the notion of
submodularity from discrete domains to continuous domains. It intuitively
captures a repulsive effect amongst different dimensions of the defined
multivariate function.
  In this paper, we systematically study continuous submodularity and a class
of non-convex optimization problems: continuous submodular function
maximization. We start by a thorough characterization of the class of
continuous submodular functions, and show that continuous submodularity is
equivalent to a weak version of the diminishing returns (DR) property. Thus we
also derive a subclass of continuous submodular functions, termed continuous
DR-submodular functions, which enjoys the full DR property. Then we present
operations that preserve continuous (DR-)submodularity, thus yielding general
rules for composing new submodular functions. We establish intriguing
properties for the problem of constrained DR-submodular maximization, such as
the local-global relation. We identify several applications of continuous
submodular optimization, ranging from influence maximization, MAP inference for
DPPs to provable mean field inference. For these applications, continuous
submodularity formalizes valuable domain knowledge relevant for optimizing this
class of objectives. We present inapproximability results and provable
algorithms for two problem settings: constrained monotone DR-submodular
maximization and constrained non-monotone DR-submodular maximization. Finally,
we extensively evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

applications in graph generation, graph modeling, graph analytics, community
detection among others. They are the archetypal examples of dense subgraphs.
While there are several different definitions of near-cliques, most of them
share the attribute that they are cliques that are missing a small number of
edges. Clique counting is itself considered a challenging problem. Counting
near-cliques is significantly harder more so since the search space for
near-cliques is orders of magnitude larger than that of cliques.
  We give a formulation of a near-clique as a clique that is missing a constant
number of edges. We exploit the fact that a near-clique contains a smaller
clique, and use techniques for clique sampling to count near-cliques. This
method allows us to count near-cliques with 1 or 2 missing edges, in graphs
with tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, there was no
known efficient method for this problem, and we obtain a 10x - 100x speedup
over existing algorithms for counting near-cliques.
  Our main technique is a space-efficient adaptation of the Tur\'an Shadow
sampling approach, recently introduced by Jain and Seshadhri (WWW 2017). This
approach constructs a large recursion tree (called the Tur\'an Shadow) that
represents cliques in a graph. We design a novel algorithm that builds an
estimator for near-cliques, using an online, compact construction of the
Tur\'an Shadow.

understanding (NLU) and achieved state-of-the-art results in various NLU tasks.
However, its success requires large deep neural networks and huge amount of
data, which result in long training time and impede development progress. Using
stochastic gradient methods with large mini-batch has been advocated as an
efficient tool to reduce the training time. Along this line of research, LAMB
is a prominent example that reduces the training time of BERT from 3 days to 76
minutes on a TPUv3 Pod. In this paper, we propose an accelerated gradient
method called LANS to improve the efficiency of using large mini-batches for
training. As the learning rate is theoretically upper bounded by the inverse of
the Lipschitz constant of the function, one cannot always reduce the number of
optimization iterations by selecting a larger learning rate. In order to use
larger mini-batch size without accuracy loss, we develop a new learning rate
scheduler that overcomes the difficulty of using large learning rate. Using the
proposed LANS method and the learning rate scheme, we scaled up the mini-batch
sizes to 96K and 33K in phases 1 and 2 of BERT pretraining, respectively. It

contain the probability distribution of unperturbed, clean data. The radius of
the ambiguity set is a function of the privacy budget, spread of the data, and

For general distributions, the distributionally-robust optimization problem can
relaxed as a regularized machine learning problem with the Lipschitz constant

regression, this regularizer is the dual norm of the model parameters. For
Gaussian data, the distributionally-robust optimization problem can be solved
exactly to find an optimal regularizer. This approach results in an entirely

of differing densities are investigated using incompressible (low-speed) direct
numerical simulations. The simulations are performed in the temporal
configuration with very large domain sizes, to allow the mixing layers to reach
prolonged states of fully-turbulent self-similar growth. Imposing a mean
density variation breaks the mean symmetry relative to the classical
single-fluid temporal mixing layer problem. Unlike prior variable-density
mixing layer simulations in which the streams are composed of the same fluids
with dissimilar thermodynamic properties, the density variations are presently
due to compositional differences between the fluid streams, leading to
different mixing dynamics. Variable-density (non-Boussinesq) effects introduce
strong asymmetries in the flow statistics that can be explained by the
strongest turbulence increasingly migrating to the lighter fluid side as free
stream density difference increases. Interface thickness growth rates also
reduce, with some thickness definitions particularly sensitive to the
corresponding changes in alignment between density and streamwise velocity
profiles. Additional asymmetries in the sense of statistical distributions of
densities at a given position within the mixing layer reveal that fine scales
of turbulence are preferentially sustained in lighter fluid, which also is
where fastest mixing occurs. These effects influence statistics involving
density fluctuations, which have important implications for mixing and more
complicated phenomena that are sensitive to the mixing dynamics, such as
combustion.

run-time $T$, the dominant dynamics are compressed in the neighborhood of a
subspace whose dimension is the smallest integer larger than the time-bandwidth
product $\delf=(f_{\max}-f_{\min})T$. We also show how the distribution of

reinforcement learning approach for jointly optimizing policy and reward from

yields the expert policy), for which existing understanding is very limited.
Such global convergence has been shown only for the linear (or linear-type) MDP
and linear (or linearizable) reward. In this paper, we study GAIL under general
MDP and for nonlinear reward function classes (as long as the objective
function is strongly concave with respect to the reward parameter). We
characterize the global convergence with a sublinear rate for a broad range of
commonly used policy gradient algorithms, all of which are implemented in an
alternating manner with stochastic gradient ascent for reward update, including
projected policy gradient (PPG)-GAIL, Frank-Wolfe policy gradient (FWPG)-GAIL,

central concern in the image transformation tasks. Perceptual learning

image transformation. In this paper, we argue that, among the features
representation from the pre-trained classification network, only limited
dimensions are related to human visual perception, while others are irrelevant,
although both will affect the final image transformation results. Under such an
assumption, we try to disentangle the perception-relevant dimensions from the

network includes the pre-training part and a feature selection layer, followed
by the contrastive learning module, which utilizes the transformed results,
target images, and task-oriented distorted images as the positive, negative,

the perception-relevant dimensions and suppressing the irrelevant ones by using
the triplet loss, so that the original representation can be disentangled for
better perceptual quality. Experiments on various image transformation tasks
demonstrate the superiority of our framework, in terms of human visual

forces the sum of the quadratic divergences to be zero, or almost negligible;
this is known as the Veltman condition. Even if one assumes the existence of
some new physics at a high scale, the fine-tuning problem is not eradicated,
although it is softer than what it would have been with a Planck scale momentum
cut-off. We study such divergences in an effective theory framework, and
construct the Veltman condition with dimension-six operators. We show that
there are two classes of diagrams, the one-loop and the two-loop ones, that
contribute to quadratic divergences, but the contribution of the latter is
suppressed by a loop factor of $1/16\pi^2$. There are only six dimension-six
operators that contribute to the one-loop category, and the Wilson coefficients
of these operators play an important role towards softening the fine-tuning
problem. We find the parameter space for the Wilson coefficients that satisfies
the extended Veltman condition, and also discuss why one need not bother about
the $d>6$ operators. The parameter space is consistent with the theoretical and
experimental bounds of the Wilson coefficients, and should act as a guide to
the model builders.

scans using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The normalized
NFL reflectance map was processed by an azimuthal filter to reduce directional
reflectance bias due to variation of beam incidence angle. The peripapillary
area of the map was divided into 160 superpixels. Average reflectance was the
mean of superpixel reflectance. Low-reflectance superpixels were identified as
those with NFL reflectance below the 5 percentile normative cutoff. Focal
reflectance loss was measure by summing loss in low-reflectance superpixels.
Results: Thirty-five normal, 30 pre-perimetric and 35 perimetric glaucoma

the normalized NFL reflectance, as measured by the pooled superpixel standard
deviation (SD), from 0.73 to 0.57 dB (p<0.001, paired t-test) and reduced the
population SD from 2.14 to 1.78 dB (p<0.001, t-test). Most glaucomatous
reflectance maps showed characteristic patterns of contiguous wedge or diffuse

sensitivity than the best NFL thickness parameter (overall, inferior, or focal
loss volume): 53% v. 23% (p=0.027) in PPG eyes and 100% v. 80% (p=0.023) in PG

reduces the variability of NFL reflectance measurements. Focal NFL reflectance
loss has excellent glaucoma diagnostic accuracy compared to the standard NFL

sparse, in the sense that most of its components vanish. In the framework of
compressed sensing, general results guaranteeing exact recovery have been
proven. In practice, sparse solutions are often computed combining
$\ell_1$-penalized least squares optimization with an appropriate numerical
scheme to accomplish the task. A computationally efficient alternative for
finding sparse solutions to linear inverse problems is provided by Bayesian
hierarchical models, in which the sparsity is encoded by defining a
conditionally Gaussian prior model with the prior parameter obeying a
generalized gamma distribution. An iterative alternating sequential (IAS)
algorithm has been demonstrated to lead to a computationally efficient scheme,
and combined with Krylov subspace iterations with an early termination
condition, the approach is particularly well suited for large scale problems.
Here the Bayesian approach to sparsity is extended to problems whose solution
allows a sparse coding in an overcomplete system such as composite frames. It
is shown that among the multiple possible representations of the unknown, the
IAS algorithm, and in particular, a hybrid version of it, is effectively
identifying the most sparse solution. Computed examples show that the method is
particularly well suited not only for traditional imaging applications but also
for dictionary learning problems in the framework of machine learning.

distortion (RSD) terms in the resulting approximation are distinct to the
Limber approximation, providing an accurate result for multipoles as low as
$\ell\simeq10$, where the corresponding Limber approximation is completely
inaccurate. At equal redshift the accuracy of the density and RSD (standard)
terms is around 0.2% for $z<3$ and 0.5% at $z=5$, even to $\ell<50$. At unequal
redshifts, if we consider the total power spectrum, the precision is better
than 5% only for very small redshift differences, $\delta <\delta_0 (\simeq
3.6\times10^{-4}(1+z)^{2.14})$ where the standard terms are well-approximated,
or for large enough redshift differences $\delta >\delta_1 (\simeq
0.33(r(z)H(z))/(z+1))$ where the lensing terms dominate. The flat sky
expressions for the pure lensing and the lensing-density cross-correlation
terms are equivalent to the Limber approximation. For arbitrary redshift
differences, the Limber approximation achieves an accuracy of 0.5% (above
$\ell\simeq 40$ for pure lensing and $\ell\simeq 80$ for density-lensing).
Besides being very accurate, the flat sky approximation is computationally much
simpler and can therefore be very useful for data analysis and forecasts with
MCMC methods. This will be particularly crucial for upcoming galaxy surveys
that will measure the power spectrum of galaxy number counts.

electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). We experimentally verified the
mean field approach to weakly-interacting Rydberg polaritons, and observed the
phase shift and attenuation induced by the dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). The
DDI-induced phase shift or attenuation can be viewed as a consequence of the
elastic or inelastic collisions among the Rydberg polaritons. Using a
weakly-interacting system, we further observed that a larger DDI strength
caused a width of the momentum distribution of Rydberg polaritons at the exit
of the system to become notably smaller as compared with that at the entrance.
In this study, we took $n =32$ and the atomic (or polariton) density of
5$\times10^{10}$ (or 2$\times10^{9}$) cm$^{-3}$. The observations demonstrate
that the elastic collisions are sufficient to drive the thermalization process
in this weakly-interacting many-body system. The combination of the $\mu$s-long
interaction time due to the high-OD EIT medium and the $\mu$m$^2$-size
collision cross section due to the DDI suggests a new and feasible platform for
the Bose-Einstein condensation of the Rydberg polaritons.

and carbonaceous (CC) meteorites reveal the presence of two distinct reservoirs
in the solar protoplanetary disk that were likely separated by Jupiter.
However, the extent of material exchange between these reservoirs, and how this
affected the composition of the inner disk are not known. Here we show that NC
meteorites display broadly correlated isotopic variations for Mo, Ti, Cr, and
Ni, indicating the addition of isotopically distinct material to the inner
disk. The added material resembles bulk CC meteorites and Ca-Al-rich inclusions
in terms of its enrichment in neutron-rich isotopes, but unlike the latter
materials is also enriched in s-process nuclides. The comparison of the
isotopic composition of NC meteorites with the accretion ages of their parent
bodies reveals that the isotopic variations within the inner disk do not
reflect a continuous compositional change through the addition of CC dust,
indicating an efficient separation of the NC and CC reservoirs and limited
exchange of material between the inner and outer disk. Instead, the isotopic
variations among NC meteorites more likely record a rapidly changing
composition of the disk during infall from the Sun's parental molecular cloud,
where each planetesimal locks the instant composition of the disk when it
forms. A corollary of this model is that late-formed planetesimals in the inner
disk predominantly accreted from secondary dust that was produced by collisions
among pre-existing NC planetesimals.

that strong ethnic residential segregation can be the unintended outcome of a
self-reinforcing dynamic driven by choices of individuals with rather tolerant
ethnic preferences. There are only few attempts to apply this view to school
choice, another important arena in which ethnic segregation occurs. In the
current paper, we explore with an agent-based theoretical model similar to
those proposed for residential segregation, how ethnic tolerance among parents
can affect the level of school segregation. More specifically, we ask whether
and under which conditions school segregation could be reduced if more parents
hold tolerant ethnic preferences. We move beyond earlier models of school
segregation in three ways. First, we model individual school choices using a
random utility discrete choice approach. Second, we vary the pattern of ethnic
segregation in the residential context of school choices systematically,
comparing residential maps in which segregation is unrelated to parents' level
of tolerance to residential maps reflecting their ethnic preferences. Thirdly,
we introduce heterogeneity in tolerance levels among parents belonging to the
same group. Our simulation experiments suggest that ethnic school segregation
can be a very robust phenomenon, occurring even when about half of the
population prefers mixed to segregated schools. However, we also identify a
sweet spot in the parameter space in which a larger proportion of tolerant
parents makes the biggest difference. This is the case when the preference for
nearby schools weighs heavily in parents' utility function and the residential
map is only moderately segregated. Further experiments are presented that
unravel the underlying mechanisms.

designated stops, our simulation covers the range of load-anywhere behavior to
that of well-spaced stops. The interplay of passenger arrival rates and bus
densities drives crossover transitions from platooning to non-platooned

either decreasing the passenger arrival rate or increasing the bus density. The
critical passenger arrival rate at which platoons are dissolved is an
exponential function of vehicle density. We also find that at low densities,
spacing stops close together induces platooned states, which reduces system
speeds and increases waiting times of passengers.

of the objective function decrease between two inner solver iterations and
shows the convergence to a stationary point of the full problem. More
importantly, we also show that convergence is preserved even when the inner
solver is inexact, under sufficient decay of the error across iterations. Our

distributions of hadrons are commonly employed to quantify the azimuthal
anisotropy of particle production relative to the collision symmetry planes.
While lower order Fourier coefficients ($\textit{v}_{2}$ and $\textit{v}_{3}$)
are more directly related to the corresponding eccentricities of the initial
state, the higher-order flow harmonics ($\textit{v}_{n>3}$) can be induced by a
mode-coupled response to the lower-order anisotropies, in addition to a linear
response to the same-order anisotropies. These higher-order flow harmonics and
their linear and mode-coupled contributions can be used to more precisely
constrain the initial conditions and the transport properties of the medium in
theoretical models. The multiparticle azimuthal cumulant method is used to
measure the linear and mode-coupled contributions in the higher-order
anisotropic flow, the mode-coupled response coefficients, and the correlations
of the event plane angles for charged particles as functions of centrality and
transverse momentum in Au+Au collisions at nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass

language is embodied, grounded in most, if not all, sensory and sensorimotor
modalities, and acquired by means of crossmodal integration. However,
characterising the underlying mechanisms in the brain is difficult and
explaining the grounding of language in crossmodal perception and action
remains challenging. In this paper, we present a neurocognitive model for
language grounding which reflects bio-inspired mechanisms such as an implicit
adaptation of timescales as well as end-to-end multimodal abstraction. It
addresses developmental robotic interaction and extends its learning
capabilities using larger-scale knowledge-based data. In our scenario, we
utilise the humanoid robot NICO in obtaining the EMIL data collection, in which
the cognitive robot interacts with objects in a children's playground
environment while receiving linguistic labels from a caregiver. The model
analysis shows that crossmodally integrated representations are sufficient for
acquiring language merely from sensory input through interaction with objects
in an environment. The representations self-organise hierarchically and embed
temporal and spatial information through composition and decomposition. This
model can also provide the basis for further crossmodal integration of

effective at covering instruction cache misses. The key to FDIP's effectiveness
is having a sufficiently large BTB to accommodate the application's branch
working set. In this work, we introduce several optimizations that
significantly extend the reach of the BTB within the available storage budget.
Our optimizations target nearly every source of storage overhead in each BTB
entry; namely, the tag, target address, and size fields.
  We observe that while most dynamic branch instances have short offsets, a
large number of branches has longer offsets or requires the use of full target
addresses. Based on this insight, we break-up the BTB into multiple smaller
BTBs, each storing offsets of different length. This enables a dramatic
reduction in storage for target addresses. We further compress tags to 16 bits
and avoid the use of the basic-block-oriented BTB advocated in prior FDIP
variants. The latter optimization eliminates the need to store the basic block
size in each BTB entry. Our final design, called FDIP-X, uses an ensemble of 4
BTBs and always outperforms conventional FDIP with a unified
basic-block-oriented BTB for equal storage budgets.

whose removal is effective in decomposing the graph into smaller
sub-components. The node--removal process is generally used to test network
robustness against failures. Most of the available studies assume that the node
removal task is always successful. Yet, we argue that this assumption is
unrealistic. Indeed, the removal process should take into account also the
strength of the targeted node itself, to simulate the failure scenarios in a
more effective and realistic fashion. Unlike previous literature, herein a {\em
probabilistic node failure model} is proposed, in which nodes may fail with a
particular probability, considering two variants, namely: {\em Uniform} (in
which the nodes survival-to-failure probability is fixed) and {\em Best
Connected} (BC) (where the nodes survival probability is proportional to their
degree). To evaluate our method, we consider five popular centrality metrics
carrying out an experimental, comparative analysis to evaluate them in terms of
{\em effectiveness} and {\em coverage}, on four real-world graphs. By
effectiveness and coverage we mean the ability of selecting nodes whose removal
decreases graph connectivity the most. Specifically, the graph spectral radius
reduction works as a proxy indicator of effectiveness, and the reduction of the
largest connected component (LCC) size is a parameter to assess coverage. The
metric that caused the biggest drop has been then compared with the Benchmark
analysis (i.e, the non-probabilistic degree centrality node removal process) to
compare the two approaches. The main finding has been that significant
differences emerged through this comparison with a deviation range that varies
from 2\% up to 80\% regardless of the dataset used that highlight the existence
of a gap between the common practice with a more realistic approach.

properties of the amorphous alloys. A high-efficacy prediction of the
propensity for those activated processes from solely the atomic positions,
however, has remained a daunting challenge. Recently, employing well-designed
site environment descriptors and machine learning (ML), notable progress has
been made in predicting the propensity for stress-activated $\beta$ processes
(i.e., shear transformations) from the static structure. However, the complex
tensorial stress field and direction-dependent activation would induce
non-trivial noises in the data, limiting the accuracy of the structure-property
mapping learned. Here, we focus on the thermally activated elementary
excitations and generate high-quality data in several Cu-Zr MGs, allowing
quantitative mapping of the potential energy landscape. After fingerprinting
the atomic environment with short- and medium-range interstice distribution, ML
can identify the atoms with strong resistance or high compliance to thermal
activation, at an unprecedented accuracy over ML models for stress-driven
activation events. Interestingly, a quantitative ""between-task"" transferring
test reveals that our learnt model can also generalize to predict the
propensity of shear transformation. Our dataset is potentially useful for
benchmarking future ML models on structure-property relationships in MGs.

networks (DNNs) in the presence of noisy (incorrect) labels. It has been shown
that the commonly used Cross Entropy (CE) loss is not robust to noisy labels.
Whilst new loss functions have been designed, they are only partially robust.
In this paper, we theoretically show by applying a simple normalization that:
any loss can be made robust to noisy labels. However, in practice, simply being
robust is not sufficient for a loss function to train accurate DNNs. By
investigating several robust loss functions, we find that they suffer from a
problem of underfitting. To address this, we propose a framework to build
robust loss functions called Active Passive Loss (APL). APL combines two robust
loss functions that mutually boost each other. Experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the family of new loss functions created by our APL
framework can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods by large
margins, especially under large noise rates such as 60% or 80% incorrect

are increasingly inspired and transformed from computer vision based AI
systems. Although an array of adversarial training and/or loss function based
defense techniques have been developed and proved to be effective in computer
vision, defending against adversarial attacks on medical images remains largely
an uncharted territory due to the following unique challenges: 1) label
scarcity in medical images significantly limits adversarial generalizability of
the AI system; 2) vastly similar and dominant fore- and background in medical
images make it hard samples for learning the discriminating features between
different disease classes; and 3) crafted adversarial noises added to the
entire medical image as opposed to the focused organ target can make clean and
adversarial examples more discriminate than that between different disease
classes. In this paper, we propose a novel robust medical imaging AI framework

Adversarial Detection (UAD), followed by designing a new measure for assessing

a modified version of HoVer-Net model to achieve instance segmentation.

overcome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Recurrent Learned Video
Compression (RLVC) approach with the Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and Recurrent
Probability Model (RPM). Specifically, the RAE employs recurrent cells in both
the encoder and decoder. As such, the temporal information in a large range of
frames can be used for generating latent representations and reconstructing
compressed outputs. Furthermore, the proposed RPM network recurrently estimates
the Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the latent representation, conditioned
on the distribution of previous latent representations. Due to the correlation
among consecutive frames, the conditional cross entropy can be lower than the
independent cross entropy, thus reducing the bit-rate. The experiments show
that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art learned video compression
performance in terms of both PSNR and MS-SSIM. Moreover, our approach
outperforms the default Low-Delay P (LDP) setting of x265 on PSNR, and also has
better performance on MS-SSIM than the SSIM-tuned x265 and the slowest setting

approach to reducing traffic loads. By encoding content via maximum distance
separable (MDS) codes, coded fragments can be collectively cached at small-cell
base stations (SBSs) to enhance caching efficiency. However, content popularity
is usually time-varying and unknown in practice. As a result, cache contents
are anticipated to be intelligently updated by taking into account limited
caching storage and interactive impacts among SBSs. In response to these
challenges, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)

the goal of minimizing long-term expected fronthaul traffic loads, we first
model dynamic coded caching as a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision
process. Owing to MDS coding, the resulting decision-making falls into a class
of constrained reinforcement learning problems with continuous decision
variables. To deal with this difficulty, we custom-build a novel DRL algorithm
by embedding homotopy optimization into a deep deterministic policy gradient
formalism. Next, to empower the caching framework with an effective trade-off
between complexity and performance, we propose centralized, partially and fully
decentralized caching controls by applying the derived DRL approach. Simulation

circularly and linearly polarized light, respectively, in
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{T}$ being
individually broken. Taking $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric magnetic topological
quantum material bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as an example,
we predict the presence of large MIC in the terahertz frequency regime which
can be magnetically switched between two AFM states with time-reversed spin
orderings. While NSC vanishes in $\mathcal{T}$-symmetric systems, external
electric field breaks $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry and enables large NSC response
which can be electrically switched. MIC and NSC are perpendicular to each other
upon linearly $x$/$y$-polarized light, and are highly tunable under electric
field, resulting in giant nonlinear photocurrent response down to a few THz
regime. It suggests bilayer AFM MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a tunable platform with rich

context of oil spill detection in SAR. Specifically, after being detected, each
oil spill is also classified according to different categories pertaining to
its shape and texture characteristics. The classification results provide

time-domain audio source separation based on dual-path recurrent neural network
(DPRNN). DPRNN is a simple but effective model for a long sequential data.
While DPRNN is quite efficient in modeling a sequential data of the length of
an utterance, i.e., about 5 to 10 second data, it is harder to apply it to
longer sequences such as whole conversations consisting of multiple utterances.
It is simply because, in such a case, the number of time steps consumed by its
internal module called inter-chunk RNN becomes extremely large. To mitigate
this problem, this paper proposes a multi-path RNN (MPRNN), a generalized
version of DPRNN, that models the input data in a hierarchical manner. In the
MPRNN framework, the input data is represented at several (>3)
time-resolutions, each of which is modeled by a specific RNN sub-module. For
example, the RNN sub-module that deals with the finest resolution may model
temporal relationship only within a phoneme, while the RNN sub-module handling
the most coarse resolution may capture only the relationship between utterances
such as speaker information. We perform experiments using simulated
dialogue-like mixtures and show that MPRNN has greater model capacity, and it
outperforms the current state-of-the-art DPRNN framework especially in online
processing scenarios.

infinite number of bosons, we investigate the non-Markovian effect (short-time
behavior of the reduced dynamics in the quantum isochoric processes (QIPs)) on
work extraction after infinite repetition of the cycles. We focus on the
parameter region where energy transferred to the reservoir can come back to the
system in a short-time regime, which we call energy backflow to show partial
quantum-mechanical reversibility. As a situation completely different from
macroscopic thermodynamics, we find that the interaction energy is finite and
negative by evaluating the average energy change of the reservoir during the
QIPs by means of the full-counting statistics, corresponding to the two-point
measurements. The feature leads us to the following findings: (1) the Carnot
theorem is consistent with a definition of work including the interaction
energy, although the commonly used definition of work excluding the interaction
leads to a serious conflict with the thermodynamic law, and (2) the energy
backflow can increase the work extraction. Our findings show that we need to
pay attention to the interaction energy in designing a quantum Otto engine
operated in a finite time, which requires us to include the non-Markovian

the qdot degrees-of-freedom act as a dynamical lattice for the photons and a

in the GP system can be derived, in the Thomas-Fermi approximation, from a
system of three GP equations, which includes the wave function of heavy neutral
atoms. In the system with fully repulsive contact interactions, we construct
stable spatially periodic patterns (density waves, DWs). The transition to DWs
is identified by analysis of the modulational instability of a uniformly mixed
neutral state. The DW pattern, which represents the system's ground state (GS),
is predicted by a variational approximation. In 2D, a stable pattern is
produced too, with a quasi-1D shape. The 1D system with contact self-attraction
in each component produces bright solitons of three types: neutral ones, with
fully mixed components; dipoles, with the components separated by the
inter-species contact repulsion; and quadrupoles, with a layer of one component
sandwiched between side lobes formed by the other. The transition from the
neutral solitons to dipoles is accurately modeled analytically. A chart of the
GSs of the different types (neutral solitons, dipoles, or quadrupoles) is

see that the regularity of the value function is

low luminosity state ($L\lesssim10^{35}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$) is accompanied by
a dramatic spectral change. Namely, the typical power-law-like spectrum with
high energy cutoff transforms into a two-component structure with a possible
cyclotron absorption feature on top of it. It was proposed that these spectral
characteristics can be explained qualitatively by the emission of cyclotron
photons in the atmosphere of the neutron star caused by collisional excitation
of electrons to upper Landau levels and further comptonization of the photons
by electron gas. The latter is expected to be overheated in a thin top layer of
the atmosphere. In this paper, we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the
radiative transfer in the atmosphere of an accreting neutron star while
accounting for a resonant scattering of polarized X-ray photons by thermally
distributed electrons. The spectral shape is shown to be strongly
polarization-dependent in soft X-rays ($\lesssim 10\,{\rm keV}$) and near the
cyclotron scattering feature. The results of our numerical simulations are
tested against the observational data of X-ray pulsar A 0535+262 in the low
luminosity state. We show that the spectral shape of the pulsar can be
reproduced by the proposed theoretical model. The applications of the discovery
to the observational studies of accreting neutron stars are discussed.

singular nonnegative Toeplitz matrix admits a unique characterization in terms
of spectral lines which are associated to an oscillatory signal. This is the
content of the famous Carath\'{e}odory-Fej\'{e}r theorem. Its importance lies
in the practice of extracting the signal component from noise, providing
insights in modeling, filtering, and estimation. The multivariate counterpart
of the theorem concerning block-Toeplitz matrices is less well understood, and
in this paper, we aim to partially address this issue. To this end, we first
establish an existence result of the line spectrum representation for a finite

a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of the representation, which indeed
holds true in the special case of bivariate time series. Equivalently, we
obtain the Vandermonde decomposition for positive semidefinite block-Toeplitz

frequency estimation with two measurement channels within the recently

reduce or even inhibit the planet's atmospheric escape. AU Mic is thought to
have a wind mass-loss rate that is up to $1000$ times larger than the solar
wind mass-loss rate ($\dot{M}_\odot$). To investigate this dichotomy, we
perform 3D hydrodynamics simulations of the stellar wind--planetary atmosphere

from a `no wind' scenario to up to a stellar wind with a mass-loss rate of
$1000~\dot{M}_\odot$. We find that, as the stellar wind becomes stronger, the
planetary evaporation rate decreases from $6.5\times 10^{10}$ g/s to half this
value. With a stronger stellar wind, the atmosphere is forced to occupy a
smaller volume, affecting transit signatures. Our predicted Ly-$\alpha$
absorption drops from $\sim 20\%$, in the case of `no wind' to barely any
Ly-$\alpha$ absorption in the extreme stellar wind scenario. Future Ly-$\alpha$

the intra cluster medium and are, in general, forming stars at high rate with
respect to non-stripped galaxies of similar stellar masses. We find that,
unless giant molecular clouds in the disk are unbound by ram pressure leading
to exceptionally high CO--to--$\rm H_2$ conversion factors, these galaxies have
a molecular gas content 4-5 times higher than normal galaxies of similar
masses, and molecular gas depletion times ranging from $\sim$1 to 9 Gyr,
corresponding to generally very low star formation efficiencies. The molecular
gas mass within the disk is a factor between 4 and $\sim$100 times higher than
the neutral gas mass, as opposed to the disks of normal spirals that contain
similar amounts of molecular and neutral gas. Intriguingly, the molecular plus
neutral total amount of gas is similar to that in normal spiral galaxies of

combined these data to perform a comprehensive study of the disc architecture

environments, it is crucial that end-users may correctly understand their
robotic team-partners, in order to collaboratively complete a task. To increase
action understanding, users demand more explainability about the decisions by
the robot in particular situations. Recently, explainable robotic systems have
emerged as an alternative focused not only on completing a task satisfactorily,
but also on justifying, in a human-like manner, the reasons that lead to making
a decision. In reinforcement learning scenarios, a great effort has been
focused on providing explanations using data-driven approaches, particularly
from the visual input modality in deep learning-based systems. In this work, we
focus rather on the decision-making process of reinforcement learning agents
performing a task in a robotic scenario. Experimental results are obtained
using 3 different set-ups, namely, a deterministic navigation task, a
stochastic navigation task, and a continuous visual-based sorting object task.
As a way to explain the goal-driven robot's actions, we use the probability of
success computed by three different proposed approaches: memory-based,
learning-based, and introspection-based. The difference between these
approaches is the amount of memory required to compute or estimate the
probability of success as well as the kind of reinforcement learning
representation where they could be used. In this regard, we use the
memory-based approach as a baseline since it is obtained directly from the
agent's observations. When comparing the learning-based and the
introspection-based approaches to this baseline, both are found to be suitable
alternatives to compute the probability of success, obtaining high levels of
similarity when compared using both the Pearson's correlation and the mean
squared error.

for a Hermitian Yukawa interaction, there is no (pseudo)scalar dynamical mass
generation, but there is fermion dynamical mass generation, provided one adds a
bare (pseudo)scalar mass. For this case, the hermitian anomaly terms play a
similar role in inducing dynamical mass generation for fermions as the
four-fermion attractive interactions. For antihermitian Yukawa interactions, an
antihermitian anomaly resists mass generation. The axial background terms
assist dynamical mass generation induced by antihermitian Yukawa interactions,
in the sense that the larger the magnitude of the background, the larger the
dynamical mass. For hermitian Yukawa interactions, however, the situation is
the opposite, in the sense that the larger the background the smaller the
dynamical mass. We also compare the anomaly-induced dynamical mass with the
radiative fermion mass in models of sterile neutrinos, and find that in cases
where the dynamical mass occurs, the latter dominates over the anomalously

of the order minutes and search for clues as to their formation mechanisms in

identify downflows here were sampled by IRIS on the 20th and 21st May 2015.
Imaging data from the Hinode and SDO satellites provided context about the
wider solar atmosphere. Four downflows were identified and analysed. The
potential super-sonic components of these downflows had widths of around 2"" and
evolved over time-scales of the order minutes. The measured apparent downflow
velocities were structured both in time and space, with the highest apparent
velocities occurring above a bright region detected in Si IV 1400 {\AA} images.
Downflows with apparent velocities below 50 km s^{-1} were observed to extend a
few arcsecs away from the foot-points suggesting the potential super-sonic
components are linked to larger-scale flows. The electron density and mass flux
for these events were within the ranges 10^{9.6}-10^{10.2} cm^{-3} and
10^{-6.81}-10^{-7.48} g cm^{-2} s^{-1}, respectively. Each downflow formed at
the foot-point of thin `fingers' extending out around 3-5"" in Si IV 1400 {\AA}

appear, disappear, and recur within time-scales of less than one hour in
sunspots. As potential super-sonic downflow signatures were detected at the

probable members with membership probability higher than $50\%$ by using proper
motion and parallax data taken from Gaia~DR2. The mean proper motion of the
cluster is obtained as $\mu_{x}=-8.83\pm0.01$ and $\mu_{y}=1.49\pm0.006$ mas

is an old open cluster with a bunch of red giant stars. The overall mass
function slope for main-sequence stars is found as $1.46\pm0.18$ within the
mass range 0.75$-$2.0 $M_\odot$, which is in fair agreement with Salpeter's

Galactic orbits are obtained for NGC 4337. We found that this object follows a

radiation reheats a spherical region around every black hole to a high
temperature and the electroweak symmetry is restored there. A domain wall is
formed separating the region with the symmetric vacuum from the asymmetric
region where electroweak baryogenesis takes place. First order phase transition
is not needed. In Brans-Dicke cosmologies black hole accretion can be strong
enough to lead to black holes domination which extends the lifetime of black
holes and therefore baryogenesis. The analysis of the whole scenario, finally,
results in the observed baryon number which can be achieved for a CP-violation
angle that is predicted by observationally accepted Two-Higgs Doublet Models.
The advantage of our proposed scenario is that naturally provides both black

that maximized the Vora-Value (a measure which relates to the closeness of the

sensitivities to a set of orthonormal basis. In this formulation, the
Luther-optimization algorithm is shown to almost optimize the Vora-Value.

correlations beyond the simple two-coordinate picture for this molecule, we
analyze in detail the evolution of the relevant correlations with temperature
as well as the impact of nuclear quantum effects down to the ultra-low
temperature regime of 1 K. We find that quantum delocalization and zero-point

deep quantum regime. At intermediate temperatures of approximately 100 to 800

starts to correctly describe trends in the correlations whereas it even
qualitatively fails below 100 K. Finally, a classical description of the nuclei
provides correlations that are in quantitative agreement with the quantum ones
only at temperatures exceeding 1000 K. This data-intensive analysis has been
made possible due to recent developments of machine learning techniques based
on neural network potentials in full dimensionality that allow us to
exhaustively sample both, the classical and quantum ensemble of protonated

studied in depth. In the present work, we present a bound of the target risk
which incorporates both weights and invariant representations. Our theoretical
analysis highlights the role of inductive bias in aligning distributions across
domains. We illustrate it on standard benchmarks by proposing a new learning
procedure for UDA. We observed empirically that weak inductive bias makes
adaptation more robust. The elaboration of stronger inductive bias is a
promising direction for new UDA algorithms.

$e \precsim e' : \tau$, which states that a program $e$ refines a program $e'$

execution rules in separation-logic style for manipulating the judgment,

carry out refinement proofs in ReLoC. We implement tactics for interactive

approximation can be obtained using *weight queries*. Given some data set of
examples, a weight query presents one of the examples to an oracle, which
returns the probability, according to the target distribution, of observing
examples similar to the presented example. This oracle can represent, for
instance, counting queries to a database of the target population, or an
interface to a search engine which returns the number of results that match a

set examples and performs corresponding weight queries. The algorithm finds a
reweighting of the data set that approximates the weights according to the
target distribution, using a limited number of weight queries. We derive an
approximation bound on the total variation distance between the reweighting
found by the algorithm and the best achievable reweighting. Our algorithm takes
inspiration from the UCB approach common in multi-armed bandits problems, and
combines it with a new discrepancy estimator and a greedy iterative procedure.

lead to deviations from the Shockley diode equation that is typical for

measured from electro-luminescence spectra. We also elucidate how the behaviour

non-cooperation (NC)-NOMA scheme, the conventional relaying (CR)-NOMA scheme,

$\alpha$-helical protein, can behave as Thouless quantum pumps when a rotating
electric field is applied perpendicularly to their helical axes. Here we
investigate the influence of long-range hoppings on this topological pumping of
electrons in single-helical organic molecules. Under variation of the
long-range hoppings governed by a decay exponent $\mu$, we find an energy gap
in the molecular band structure closes at a critical value $\mu_c$ of the decay
exponent and reopens for $\mu$ deviating from $\mu_c$. The relevant bulk bands
in a pumping cycle acquire different Chern numbers in the strong ($\mu<\mu_c$)
and weak ($\mu>\mu_c$) long-range hopping regimes, with a sudden jump at
criticality. This topological phase transition is also shown to separate two
distinct behaviors of the midgap end states in the pumping process. The end
states carry quantized current pumped by the rotating electric field and the
current forms a plateau by sweeping the Fermi energy over the gap. In the
strong hopping phase, the quantized current plateau is positive, which is
reversed to a negative one with smaller amplitude in the weak hopping phase.
However, the reversal is a smooth crossover, not a sharp transition, due to the
finite sizes of the molecules. We show that these transport characteristics of
the topological phase transition could also be observed at finite temperatures.

two types of intrinsic spin-orbit interactions, uniform (Kane-Mele type) and

magnetic orbital effects. Employing a continuum model approach, we derive
analytic expressions for low-energy Landau levels, which can be used to extract
local orbital and spin-orbit coupling parameters from scanning probe

fingerprints of relative and absolute magnitudes of intrinsic spin-orbit
coupling in the spectra. The inverted band structure of graphene proximitized
by WSe$_2$ leads to an interesting crossing of Landau states across the bulk
gap at a crossover field, providing insights into the size of Rashba spin-orbit

the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling by analyzing the symmetry in energy and

the strong response to the magnetic field of Dirac electrons in proximitized

learning strategies. In traditional social learning, agents solve a distributed
multiple hypothesis testing problem by performing two operations at each
instant: first, agents incorporate information from private observations to
form their beliefs over a set of hypotheses; second, agents combine the
entirety of their beliefs locally among neighbors. Within a sufficiently
informative environment and as long as the connectivity of the network allows
information to diffuse across agents, these algorithms enable agents to learn
the true hypothesis. Instead of sharing the entirety of their beliefs, this
work considers the case in which agents will only share their beliefs regarding
one hypothesis of interest, with the purpose of evaluating its validity, and
draws conditions under which this policy does not affect truth learning. We
propose two approaches for sharing partial information, depending on whether
agents behave in a self-aware manner or not. The results show how different

characteristics of the inference problem. Furthermore, the analysis
interestingly points to the possibility of deceiving the network, as long as

accumulated capital injection. We first transform the original problem with
floor constraints into an unconstrained control problem, however, under a

a Neumann boundary condition. By employing the dual transform, the
probabilistic representation and some stochastic flow analysis, the existence
of the unique classical solution to the HJB equation is established. The

Strings $S_1$ and $S_2$ of length $n$ are given to two identical players
(encoders), who independently compute sketches (summaries) $\mathtt{sk}(S_1)$
and $\mathtt{sk}(S_2)$, respectively, so that upon receiving the two sketches,
a third player (decoder) is able to compute (or approximate)
$\mathsf{sh}(S_1,S_2)$ with high probability.
  This paper primarily focuses on the more general $k$-mismatch version of the
problem, where the decoder is allowed to declare a failure if
$\mathsf{sh}(S_1,S_2)>k$, where $k$ is a parameter known to all parties. Andoni
et al. (STOC'13) introduced exact circular $k$-mismatch sketches of size
$\widetilde{O}(k+D(n))$, where $D(n)$ is the number of divisors of $n$. Andoni
et al. also showed that their sketch size is optimal in the class of linear
homomorphic sketches.
  We circumvent this lower bound by designing a (non-linear) exact circular
$k$-mismatch sketch of size $\widetilde{O}(k)$; this size matches
communication-complexity lower bounds. We also design $(1\pm
\varepsilon)$-approximate circular $k$-mismatch sketch of size
$\widetilde{O}(\min(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{k}, \varepsilon^{-1.5}\sqrt{n}))$,
which improves upon an $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}\sqrt{n})$-size sketch of
Crouch and McGregor (APPROX'11).

planet was recently discovered from preliminary analysis of radial velocity
observations and confirmed to be transiting its host star from photometric data
from the NASA's \textit{TESS} mission. We obtained radial velocity measurements
of AU\,Mic over the course of two partially observable transits and one full
transit of planet b from high-resolution spectroscopic observations made with
the {\textsc{Minerva}}-Australis telescope array. Only a marginal detection of
the Rossiter--McLaughlin effect signal was obtained from the radial velocities,
in part due to AU Mic being an extremely active star and the lack of full
transit coverage plus sufficient out-of-transit baseline. As such, a precise
determination of the obliquity for AU\,Mic\,b is not possible in this study and
we find a sky-projected spin-orbit angle of $\lambda =
47{^{+26}_{-54}}^{\circ}$. This result is consistent with both the planet's
orbit being aligned or highly misaligned with the spin-axis of its host star.
Our measurement independently agrees with, but is far less precise than
observations carried out on other instruments around the same time that measure
a low obliquity orbit for the planet. AU\,Mic is the youngest exoplanetary
system for which the projected spin-orbit angle has been measured, making it a
key data point in the study of the formation and migration of exoplanets --
particularly given that the system is also host to a bright debris disk.

fast algorithms for extracting knowledge from these data. We are motivated here
by three electrical measures for the analysis of large small-world graphs $G =
(V, E)$ -- i.e., graphs with diameter in $O(\log |V|)$, which are abundant in
complex network analysis. From a computational point of view, the three
measures have in common that their crucial component is the diagonal of the
graph Laplacian's pseudoinverse, $L^\dagger$. Computing diag$(L^\dagger)$
exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix
multiplication -- and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time.
Moreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space -- hardly feasible for
large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e.g., using the
Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of $O(\log |V| /
\epsilon^2)$ Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is
still very expensive for large inputs.
  In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm that requires the
solution of only one Laplacian linear system. The remaining parts are purely
combinatorial -- mainly sampling uniform spanning trees, which we relate to
diag$(L^\dagger)$ via effective resistances. For small-world networks, our
algorithm obtains a $\pm \epsilon$-approximation with high probability, in a
time that is nearly-linear in $|E|$ and quadratic in $1 / \epsilon$. Another
positive aspect of our algorithm is its parallel nature due to independent
sampling. We thus provide two parallel implementations of our algorithm: one

science, and psychology, among other disciplines. Studying the time-varying
relationships between items is crucial for educational assessment or designing
marketing strategies from survey questions. Although dynamic network models
have been widely developed, we cannot apply them directly to item response data
because there are multiple systems of nodes with various types of local
interactions among items, resulting in multiplex network structures. We propose
a new model to study these temporal interactions among items by embedding the
functional parameters within the exponential random graph model framework.
Inference on such models is difficult because the likelihood functions contain
intractable normalizing constants. Furthermore, the number of functional
parameters grows exponentially as the number of items increases. Variable
selection for such models is not trivial because standard shrinkage approaches
do not consider temporal trends in functional parameters. To overcome these
challenges, we develop a novel Bayes approach by combining an auxiliary
variable MCMC algorithm and a recently-developed functional shrinkage method.
We apply our algorithm to survey and review data sets, illustrating that the
proposed approach can avoid the evaluation of intractable normalizing constants
as well as the detection of significant temporal interactions among items.
Through a simulation study under different scenarios, we examine the
performance of our algorithm. Our method is, to our knowledge, the first
attempt to select functional variables for models with intractable normalizing
constants.

rule are used in selection problems such as hiring or college admission to
reduce inequalities based on sensitive demographic attributes. These mechanisms
are often viewed as introducing a trade-off between selection fairness and
utility. In recent work, however, Kleinberg and Raghavan showed that, in the
presence of implicit bias in estimating candidates' quality, the Rooney rule
can increase the utility of the selection process.
  We argue that even in the absence of implicit bias, the estimates of
candidates' quality from different groups may differ in another fundamental
way, namely, in their variance. We term this phenomenon implicit variance and
we ask: can fairness mechanisms be beneficial to the utility of a selection
process in the presence of implicit variance (even in the absence of implicit
bias)? To answer this question, we propose a simple model in which candidates
have a true latent quality that is drawn from a group-independent normal
distribution. To make the selection, a decision maker receives an unbiased
estimate of the quality of each candidate, with normal noise, but whose
variance depends on the candidate's group. We then compare the utility obtained
by imposing a fairness mechanism that we term $\gamma$-rule (it includes
demographic parity and the four-fifths rule as special cases), to that of a
group-oblivious selection algorithm that picks the candidates with the highest
estimated quality independently of their group. Our main result shows that the
demographic parity mechanism always increases the selection utility, while any
$\gamma$-rule weakly increases it. We extend our model to a two-stage selection
process where the true quality is observed at the second stage. We discuss
multiple extensions of our results, in particular to different distributions of
the true latent quality.

gives rise to new states of matter, including superconductivity and
charge-density-wave formation. When exciting such a condensed system, it is
commonly assumed that the ultrafast laser pulse disturbs primarily the
electronic order, which in turn destabilizes the atomic structure. Contrary to
this conception, we show here that structural destabilization of few atoms
causes melting of the macroscopic ordered charge-density wave in 1T-TiSe2.
Using ultrafast pump-probe non-resonant and resonant X-ray diffraction, we
observe full suppression of the Se 4p orbital order and the atomic structure at
excitation energies more than one order of magnitude below the suggested
excitonic binding energy. Complete melting of the charge-density wave occurs
4-5 times faster than expected from a purely electronic charge-screening
process, strongly suggesting a structurally assisted breakup of excitonic
correlations. Our experimental data clarifies several questions on the
intricate coupling between structural and electronic order in stabilizing the
charge-density-wave in 1T-TiSe2. The results further show that
electron-phonon-coupling can lead to different, energy dependent
phase-transition pathways in condensed matter systems, opening new
possibilities in the conception of non-equilibrium phenomena at the ultrafast

abelianization functor under inverse limits. Our main result in [BaSh] was that
if $\mathcal{T}$ is a countable directed poset and $G:\mathcal{T}\to\mathcal{G}
rp$ is a diagram of groups that satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, then
the natural map $$\mathrm{Ab}({\lim}_{t\in\mathcal{T}}G_t)\to
{\lim}_{t\in\mathcal{T}}\mathrm{Ab}(G_t)$$ is surjective, and its kernel is a
cotorsion group. The abelianization is an example of a left adjoint functor
from groups to abelian groups.
  In this paper we study the behaviour under inverse limits of left adjoint
functors from pointed sets to abelian groups. Such functors are classified by
abelian groups, where to the abelian group $A$ corresponds the left adjoint
functor $L_A:\mathcal{S} \text{et}_*\to\mathcal{A} \text{b}$ given by
$L_A(Y)=\bigoplus_{Y\setminus\{*\}}A.$ If $\mathcal{T}$ is a directed poset and
$X:\mathcal{T}\to\mathcal{S} \text{et}_*$ is a is diagram of pointed sets, we
show that the natural map $$\rho:L_A({\lim}_{t\in\mathcal{T}}X_t)
\to{\lim}_{t\in\mathcal{T}}L_A(X_t)$$ is injective. If, in addition,
$\mathcal{T}$ is countable and $X$ satisfies the Mittag-Leffler condition, we
show that the cokernel of $\rho$ is an algebraically compact group. Compared
with the main result in [BaSh], algebraically compact is much stronger then
cotorsion as it also requires the Ulm length to be $\leq 1$.
  We also show that this result, even in its weak form of cotorsion, does not
extend to uncountable diagrams. Namely, if $A$ is not the product of a
divisible group and a bounded group, we construct a directed poset
$\mathcal{T}$ with $|\mathcal{T}|=2^{\aleph_0}$ and a diagram
$X:\mathcal{T}\to\mathcal{S} \text{et}_*$, that satisfies the Mittag-Leffler
condition, such that the cokernel of $\rho$ is not cotorsion.

  Regression Models With Application to Complex Flow Problems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, numerical methods in industrial applications have evolved
from a pure predictive tool towards a means for optimization and control. Since
standard numerical analysis methods have become prohibitively costly in such
multi-query settings, a variety of reduced order modeling (ROM) approaches have
been advanced towards complex applications. In this context, the driving
application for this work is twin-screw extruders (TSEs): manufacturing devices
with an important economic role in plastics processing. Modeling the flow
through a TSE requires non-linear material models and coupling with the heat
equation alongside intricate mesh deformations, which is a comparatively
complex scenario. We investigate how a non-intrusive, data-driven ROM can be
constructed for this application. We focus on the well-established proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD) with regression albeit we introduce two
adaptations: standardizing both the data and the error measures as well as --
inspired by our space-time simulations -- treating time as a discrete
coordinate rather than a continuous parameter. We show that these steps make
the POD-regression framework more interpretable, computationally efficient, and
problem-independent. We proceed to compare the performance of three different
regression models: Radial basis function (RBF) regression, Gaussian process
regression (GPR), and artificial neural networks (ANNs). We find that GPR
offers several advantages over an ANN, constituting a viable and
computationally inexpensive non-intrusive ROM. Additionally, the framework is
open-sourced to serve as a starting point for other practitioners and
facilitate the use of ROM in general engineering workflows.

Lipschitz-bounded transformations of the input distribution is established. The

learns meta-features supporting the characterization of a (labelled) dataset.
The first task consists of predicting whether two dataset patches are extracted

the learning performance achieved by a hyper-parameter configuration under a
fixed algorithm (ranging in k-NN, SVM, logistic regression and linear

effective temperature ($\rm T_{eff}$), surface gravity ($\log g$), and
metallicity ($\rm[Fe/H]$), which best fit the data using an empirical
interpolator based on the Medium-resolution Isaac Newton Telescope library of
empirical spectra (MILES), as implemented by the University of Lyon
Spectroscopic analysis Software (Koleva et al. 2008, ULySS) package. While we
analyzed all 8646 spectra from the first release of MaStar, since MaStar has a
wider parameter-space coverage than MILES, not all of these fits are robust. In
addition, not all parameter regions covered by MILES yield robust results,
likely due to the non-uniform coverage of the parameter space by MILES. We
tested the robustness of the method using the MILES spectra itself and
identified a proxy based on the local density of the training set. With this
proxy, we identified 7503 MaStar spectra with robust fitting results. They
cover the range from 3179K to 20,517K in effective temperature ($\rm T_{eff}$),

problem in the world of communication complexity. While both deterministic and
randomized communication complexities for this problem are known to be
$\Theta(n)$, it is also known that if the sets are assumed to be drawn from
some restricted set systems then the communication complexity can be much
lower. In this work, we explore how communication complexity measures change
with respect to the complexity of the underlying set system. The complexity
measure for the set system that we use in this work is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis
(VC) dimension. More precisely, on any set system with VC dimension bounded by
$d$, we analyze how large can the deterministic and randomized communication
complexities be, as a function of $d$ and $n$.
  In this paper, we construct two natural set systems of VC dimension $d$,
motivated from geometry. Using these set systems we show that the deterministic
and randomized communication complexity can be $\widetilde{\Theta}\left(d\log
\left( n/d \right)\right)$ for set systems of VC dimension $d$ and this matches
the deterministic upper bound for all set systems of VC dimension $d$. We also
study the deterministic and randomized communication complexities of the set
intersection problem when sets belong to a set system of bounded VC dimension.
We show that there exists set systems of VC dimension $d$ such that both
deterministic and randomized (one-way and multi-round) complexity for the set
intersection problem can be as high as $\Theta\left( d\log \left( n/d \right)

problems in image processing and imaging. Recent works proposed to exploit
image non-local similarity for inverse problems by grouping similar patches and
demonstrated state-of-the-art results in many applications. However, compared
to classic methods based on filtering or sparsity, most of the non-local
algorithms are time-consuming, mainly due to the highly inefficient and
redundant block matching step, where the distance between each pair of
overlapping patches needs to be computed. In this work, we propose a novel
Self-Convolution operator to exploit image non-local similarity in a
self-supervised way. The proposed Self-Convolution can generalize the
commonly-used block matching step and produce equivalent results with much
cheaper computation. Furthermore, by applying Self-Convolution, we propose an
effective multi-modality image restoration scheme, which is much more efficient
than conventional block matching for non-local modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate that (1) Self-Convolution can significantly speed up most of the
popular non-local image restoration algorithms, with two-fold to nine-fold
faster block matching, and (2) the proposed multi-modality image restoration
scheme achieves superior denoising results in both efficiency and effectiveness

the over-simplified assumption that the covariance of the noise in SGD is (or
can be upper bounded by) constant, although it is actually state-dependent. In
this work, we conduct a formal study on the dynamic behavior of SGD with
state-dependent noise. Specifically, we show that the covariance of the noise
of SGD in the local region of the local minima is a quadratic function of the
state. Thus, we propose a novel power-law dynamic with state-dependent
diffusion to approximate the dynamic of SGD. We prove that, power-law dynamic
can escape from sharp minima exponentially faster than flat minima, while the
previous dynamics can only escape sharp minima polynomially faster than flat

found to exist in many defense methods and cause a false signal of robustness.
In this paper, we identify a more subtle situation called Imbalanced Gradients
that can also cause overestimated adversarial robustness. The phenomenon of
imbalanced gradients occurs when the gradient of one term of the margin loss
dominates and pushes the attack towards to a suboptimal direction. To exploit
imbalanced gradients, we formulate a Margin Decomposition (MD) attack that
decomposes a margin loss into individual terms and then explores the
attackability of these terms separately via a two-stage process. We also
propose a multi-targeted and ensemble version of our MD attack. By
investigating 24 defense models proposed since 2018, we find that 11 models are
susceptible to a certain degree of imbalanced gradients and our MD attack can
decrease their robustness evaluated by the best standalone baseline attack by
more than 1%. We also provide an in-depth investigation on the likely causes of
imbalanced gradients and effective countermeasures. Our code is available at

captures a component of the binary, forming a new binary. This has been well
studied in encounters between a star--planet pair and a single star. Here we
explore the application of the exchange mechanism to a planet--satellite pair
and another planet in the gravitational potential of a central star. As a case
study, we focus on encounters between a satellite-bearing object and Neptune.
We investigate whether Neptune can capture satellites from that object and if
the captured satellites have orbits analogous to the Neptunian moons Triton and
Nereid. Using $N$-body simulations, we study the capture probability at
different encounter distances. Post-capture, we use a simple analytical
argument to estimate how the captured orbits evolve under collisional and tidal
effects. We find that the average capture probability reaches $\sim$$10\%$ if
Neptune penetrates the donor planet's satellite system. Most moons grabbed by
Neptune acquire highly eccentric orbits. Post-capture, around half of those
captured, especially those on tight orbits, can be circularised, either by
tides only or by collisions+tides, turning into Triton-like objects. Captures
further out, on the other hand, stay on wide and eccentric orbits like that of
Nereid. Both moon types can be captured in the same encounter and they have
wide distributions in orbital inclination. Therefore, Triton naturally has a
$\sim$50\% chance of being retrograde. A similar process potentially applies to
an exoplanetary system, and our model predicts that exomoons can jump from one
planet to another during planetary scattering. Specifically, there should be
two distinct populations of captured moons: one on close-in circular orbits and
the other on far-out eccentric orbits. The two populations may have highly
inclined prograde or retrograde orbits.

ALMA to search for vibrationally excited aminoacetonitrile toward Sgr B2(N1).
On the basis of these spectroscopic predictions, we report the interstellar
detection of aminoacetonitrile in its $v_{11}=1$ and $v_{18}=1$ vibrational
states toward Sgr B2(N1) in addition to emission in its vibrational ground
state. The intensities of the identified $v_{11}=1$ and $v_{18}=1$ lines are
consistent with the detected $v=0$ lines under LTE at a temperature of 200 K
for an aminoacetonitrile column density of $1.1 \times 10^{17}$ cm$^{-2}$.

machine learning models during the past years. The related supermodular
maximization models (submodular minimization) also offer an abundance of

maximizing a submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, there is much
less work on the corresponding supermodular maximization problems.
  We give a broad parameterized family of monotone functions which includes
submodular functions and a class of supermodular functions containing diversity
functions. Functions in this parameterized family are called
\emph{$\gamma$-meta-submodular}. We develop local search algorithms with
approximation factors that depend only on the parameter $\gamma$. We show that
the $\gamma$-meta-submodular families include well-known classes of functions
such as meta-submodular functions ($\gamma=0$), metric diversity functions and

based on negative-type distances or Jensen-Shannon divergence (both with

94, 104508 (2016). The authors of the first one presented the phase diagram
which interpolates the trivial and non-trivial topological states. However, the
next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping term has been neglected, although it is
several orders of magnitude stronger than the internal spin-orbit coupling. We
use the mean-field approximation to derive the phase diagram of the attractive
KMH model with NNN hoping at half filling. The phase diagram without and the
phase diagram with NNN hopping are significantly different in the non-trivial
topological region. The possibility to have superconducting instability in the
attractive KMH model has been analyzed in the second paper within the T-matrix
approximation. The question that naturally arises here is about the
contributions due to the bubble diagrams, which are included in the
Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equation, but neglected by the T-matrix approximation. To
answer this question, we apply the BS formalism to calculate the slope of the
Goldstone mode and the corresponding sound velocity. We found 4% difference
between the values of the sound velocity provided by the T-matrix approximation
and the BS equation. This small difference confirm previously reported result
that close to the phase transition boundary the bubble-diagram contributions
are not important.

$+34$ days, revealing He I features with P-Cygni profiles at 1.083 and
2.058$\mu$m. Using the optical spectra of PTF10hgi and SN2019hge as templates,
we examine 70 SLSN-I discovered by ZTF in the first two years of operation and
found additional five SLSN-I with distinct He-features. The excitation of He\,I
atoms in normal core collapse supernovae requires non-thermal radiation, as
proposed by previous studies. These He-rich events can not be explained by
traditional $^{56}$Ni mixing model because of their blue spectra, high peak
luminosity and slow rising time scales. Magnetar models offer a possible
solution since pulsar winds naturally generate high energy particles as sources
of non-thermal excitation. An alternative model is ejecta interaction with
H-poor CSM which may be supported by the observed light curve undulations.
These six SLSN-Ib appear to have relatively low-peak luminosities (rest-frame

a negative values between $-0.90$ and $-0.27$. For the turnover sources, the

integral, introduces the two-frequency spatial Wigner distribution (TFSWD) to
efficiently account for specularities and occlusions that may be present in the
hidden space and cannot be characterized with $\mathcal{P}$-field formalism
alone. However, because the paraxial assumption is likely violated in many, if
not most, NLoS scenarios, in the present paper we overcome that limitation by
deriving a nonparaxial propagation formula for the $\mathcal{P}$ field using
the Rayleigh--Sommerfeld diffraction integral. We also propose a
Rayleigh--Sommerfeld propagation formula for the TFSWD and provide a derivation
that is valid under specific partial-coherence conditions. Finally, we report a
pair of differential equations that characterize free-space TFSWD propagation
without restriction.

between different layers of the solar atmosphere. We investigate the nature and
dynamics of two small-scale quiet-Sun rotating structures in the chromosphere.
We analyse two chromospheric structures that show clear rotational patterns in
spectropolarimetric observations taken with the Interferometric Bidimensional
Spectrometer (IBIS) at the Ca II 8542 \AA~ line. We present the detection of
spectropolarimetric signals that manifest the magnetic nature of rotating
structures in the chromosphere. Our observations show two long-lived structures
of plasma that each rotate clockwise inside a 10 arcsec$^{2}$~ quiet-Sun
region. Their circular polarization signals are 5-10 times above the noise
level. Line-of-sight Doppler velocity and horizontal velocity maps from the
observations reveal clear plasma flows at and around the two structures. An MHD
simulation shows these two structures are plausibly magnetically connected.
Wave analysis suggests that the observed rotational vortex pattern could be due
to a combination of slow actual rotation and a faster azimuthal phase speed
pattern of a magneto-acoustic mode. Our results imply that the vortex
structures observed in the Sun's chromosphere are magnetic in nature and that
they can be connected locally through the chromosphere.

continuous-time non-reversible Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The
methodology begins by representing the target density as a density, $e^{-U}$,

moves from one elliptical orbit to another according to a rate function which
can be written in terms of $U$. We demonstrate that the method is easy to
implement and demonstrate empirically that it can out-perform existing
benchmark piecewise deterministic Markov processes such as the bouncy particle
sampler and the Zig-Zag. In the Bayesian statistics context, these competitor
algorithms are of substantial interest in the large data context due to the
fact that they can adopt data subsampling techniques which are exact (ie induce
no error in the stationary distribution). We demonstrate theoretically and
empirically that we can also construct a control-variate subsampling boomerang
sampler which is also exact, and which possesses remarkable scaling properties
in the large data limit. We furthermore illustrate a factorised version on the

methods (e.g. based on convolutional neural networks or random forest
classifiers) incorporate additional post-processing steps to ensure that the
resulting masks fulfill expected connectivity constraints. These methods
operate under the hypothesis that contiguous pixels with similar aspect should
belong to the same class. Even if valid in general, this assumption does not
consider more complex priors like topological restrictions or convexity, which
cannot be easily incorporated into these methods. Post-DAE leverages the latest
developments in manifold learning via denoising autoencoders. First, we learn a
compact and non-linear embedding that represents the space of anatomically
plausible segmentations. Then, given a segmentation mask obtained with an
arbitrary method, we reconstruct its anatomically plausible version by
projecting it onto the learnt manifold. The proposed method is trained using
unpaired segmentation mask, what makes it independent of intensity information
and image modality. We performed experiments in binary and multi-label
segmentation of chest X-ray and cardiac magnetic resonance images. We show how
erroneous and noisy segmentation masks can be improved using Post-DAE. With
almost no additional computation cost, our method brings erroneous

detection loophole is avoided. Four concise quantum circuits determining the
expectation values of the relevant observables are used for a two-qubit system.
It is possible to add an ancilla qubit to these circuits and eventually only
measure the ancilla to obtain the relevant information. For a four-qubit NISQ
computer, two algorithms yielding the same averages, however also guaranteeing
a random choice of the observable, are developed. A freedom-of-choice loophole
is therefore avoided. Including an additional ancilla reduces the number of
measurements by one since in this case only the ancillas need to be measured.
Note that these methods, using the NISQ device, are intrinsically quantum
mechanical. Locality loopholes cannot be excluded on present NISQ systems.
Results of simulations on the QX simulator of Quantum Inspire are presented.
The Bell inequality is indeed found to be violated, even if some additional
noise is included by means of the depolarizing channel error model. The

sampling rate in the training dataset, or when a machine learning practioner
rebalances their training dataset. Sampling bias causes large discrepancies
between model performance in the lab and in more realistic settings. It is
omnipresent in medical imaging applications, yet is often overlooked at
training time or addressed on an ad-hoc basis. Our approach is based on
Bayesian risk minimization. For arbitrary likelihood models we derive the
associated bias corrected loss for training, exhibiting a direct connection to
information gain. The approach integrates seamlessly in the current paradigm of
(deep) learning using stochastic backpropagation and naturally with Bayesian
models. We illustrate the methodology on case studies of lung nodule malignancy
grading.

nanomechanical manipulation of fundamental interfacial symmetry possible within
a single device. Here we report highly tunable second harmonic generation (SHG)

crystals, and introduce the term twistoptics to describe studies of optical
properties in dynamically twistable vdW systems. We observe SHG intensity
modulated by a factor of more than 50, polarization patterns determined by
moir\'e interface symmetry, and enhanced conversion efficiency for bulk

$10^{10.43} M_{\odot}$ are $0.13 \pm 0.04$ mag brighter in $H$ than SNeIa in
less massive galaxies. The same set of SNeIa observed at optical wavelengths,
after width-color-luminosity corrections, exhibit a $0.10 \pm 0.03$ mag offset
in the Hubble residuals. We observe an outlier population ($|\Delta H_{\rm

moves the mass threshold to $10^{10.65} M_{\odot}$ and reduces the step in $H$
band to $0.08 \pm 0.04$ mag, but the equivalent optical mass step is increased
to $0.13 \pm 0.04$ mag. We conclude the outliers do not drive the
brightness--host-mass correlation. Less massive galaxies preferentially host
more higher-stretch SNeIa, which are intrinsically brighter and bluer. It is
only after correction for width-luminosity and color-luminosity relationships
that SNeIa have brighter optical Hubble residuals in more massive galaxies.
Thus finding SNeIa are intrinsically brighter in $H$ in more massive galaxies
is an opposite correlation to the intrinsic (pre-width-luminosity correction)
optical brightness. If dust and the treatment of intrinsic color variation were
the main driver of the host galaxy mass correlation, we would not expect a
correlation of brighter $H$-band SNeIa in more massive galaxies.

applied to artefacts generated by multiple movements of the patient.
Furthermore, it can be used to correct motion for the case where $k$-space has
been under-sampled, to shorten the scan time, as is common when using methods
such as parallel imaging or compressed sensing. Experimental results on both

medical image classification tasks, but often deep models lack
interpretability. The ability of these models to explain their decisions is
important for fostering clinical trust and facilitating clinical translation.
Furthermore, for many problems in medicine there is a wealth of existing
clinical knowledge to draw upon, which may be useful in generating
explanations, but it is not obvious how this knowledge can be encoded into DL
models - most models are learnt either from scratch or using transfer learning
from a different domain. In this paper we address both of these issues. We
propose a novel DL framework for image-based classification based on a
variational autoencoder (VAE). The framework allows prediction of the output of
interest from the latent space of the autoencoder, as well as visualisation (in
the image domain) of the effects of crossing the decision boundary, thus
enhancing the interpretability of the classifier. Our key contribution is that
the VAE disentangles the latent space based on `explanations' drawn from
existing clinical knowledge. The framework can predict outputs as well as
explanations for these outputs, and also raises the possibility of discovering
new biomarkers that are separate (or disentangled) from the existing knowledge.
We demonstrate our framework on the problem of predicting response of patients
with cardiomyopathy to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) from cine
cardiac magnetic resonance images. The sensitivity and specificity of the
proposed model on the task of CRT response prediction are 88.43% and 84.39%

understanding of the factors contributing to CRT response.

solve. In this paper, we delve into the application of a disruptive technique

the multiloop topologies that first appear at four loops and assemble them in a

effective diagnostics of wafer bin maps, wherein a key challenge is to detect
how defective chips tend to spatially cluster on a wafer--a problem known as
spatial pattern recognition. Recently, there has been a growing interest in
mixed-type spatial pattern recognition--when multiple defect patterns, of
different shapes, co-exist on the same wafer. Mixed-type spatial pattern
recognition entails two central tasks: (1) spatial filtering, to distinguish
systematic patterns from random noises; and (2) spatial clustering, to group
filtered patterns into distinct defect types. Observing that spatial filtering
is instrumental to high-quality mixed-type pattern recognition, we propose to
use a graph-theoretic method, called adjacency-clustering, which leverages
spatial dependence among adjacent defective chips to effectively filter the raw
wafer maps. Tested on real-world data and compared against a state-of the-art
approach, our proposed method achieves at least 46% gain in terms of internal
cluster validation quality (i.e., validation without external class labels),
and about ~5% gain in terms of Normalized Mutual Information--an external
cluster validation metric based on external class labels. Interestingly, the
margin of improvement appears to be a function of the pattern complexity, with
larger gains achieved for more complex-shaped patterns.

Spitzer Exploration Program Red Worlds (ID: 13067, 13175 and 14223) exclusively
targeted TRAPPIST-1, a nearby (12pc) ultracool dwarf star orbited by seven
transiting Earth-sized planets, all well-suited for a detailed atmospheric
characterization with the upcoming JWST. In this paper, we present the global
results of the project. We analyzed 88 new transits and combined them with 100
previously analyzed transits, for a total of 188 transits observed at 3.6 or
4.5 $\mu$m. We also analyzed 29 occultations (secondary eclipses) of planet b
and eight occultations of planet c observed at 4.5 $\mu$m to constrain the
brightness temperatures of their daysides. We identify several orphan
transit-like structures in our Spitzer photometry, but all of them are of low
significance. We do not confirm any new transiting planets. We estimate for
TRAPPIST-1 transit depth measurements mean noise floors of $\sim$35 and 25 ppm
in channels 1 and 2 of Spitzer/IRAC, respectively. most of this noise floor is
of instrumental origins and due to the large inter-pixel inhomogeneity of IRAC
InSb arrays, and that the much better interpixel homogeneity of JWST
instruments should result in noise floors as low as 10ppm, which is low enough
to enable the atmospheric characterization of the planets by transit
transmission spectroscopy. We construct updated broadband transmission spectra
for all seven planets which show consistent transit depths between the two
Spitzer channels. We identify and model five distinct high energy flares in the
whole dataset, and discuss our results in the context of habitability. Finally,
we fail to detect occultation signals of planets b and c at 4.5 $\mu$m, and can
only set 3$\sigma$ upper limits on their dayside brightness temperatures (611K
for b 586K for c).

Photonic neural networks target the realizations of neurons, network

the development of a nanophotonic hardware platform of fast and
energy-efficient photonic neurons via arrays of high-quality vertical cavity
surface emitting lasers (VCSELs). The developed $5\times5$ VCSEL arrays provide
high optical injection locking efficiency through homogeneous fabrication
combined with individual control over the laser wavelengths. Injection locking
is crucial for the reliable processing of information in VCSEL-based photonic
neurons, and we demonstrate the suitability of the VCSEL arrays by injection
locking measurements and current-induced spectral fine-tuning. We find that our
investigated array can readily be tuned to the required spectral homogeneity,
and as such show that VCSEL arrays based on our technology can act as highly
energy efficient and ultra-fast photonic neurons for next generation photonic
neural networks. Combined with fully parallel photonic networks our substrates
are promising for ultra-fast operation reaching 10s of GHz bandwidths, and we
show that a nonlinear transformation based on our lasers will consume only
about 100 fJ per VCSEL, which is highly competitive, compared to other
platforms.

accelerometer, and a magnetometer to obtain measurements and estimate attitude.
Under this paradigm of sensor fusion, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is the

propose a novel estimation technique called extended H2 filter that can
overcome the limitations of the EKF, specifically with respect to computational

attitude-estimation algorithm using unit quaternions. The H2 optimal filter
gain is designed offline about a nominal operating point by solving a convex
optimization problem, and the filter dynamics is implemented using the
nonlinear system dynamics. This implementation of this H2 optimal estimator is
referred as the extended H2 estimator. The proposed technique is tested on four
cases corresponding to long time-scale motion, fast time-scale motion,
transition from hover to forward flight for VTOL aircrafts, and an entire
flight cycle (from take-off to landing). Its results are compared against that
of the EKF in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics.

relationships and directions among the growth rate of confirmed cases
(GROWTHC), exchange rate (GEX) and SENSEX value (GSENSEX) are remaining the
same across different pre and post-lockdown phases, attempting to capture any
potential changes over time via the vector autoregressive (VAR) models. A
positive correlation is found between the growth rate of confirmed cases and
the growth rate of exchange rate, and a negative correlation between the growth
rate of confirmed cases and the growth rate of SENSEX value. However, on
applying a vector autoregressive (VAR) model, it is observed that an increase
in the confirmed COVID-19 cases causes no significant change in the values of
the exchange rate and SENSEX index. The result varies if the analysis is split
across different time periods - before lockdown, the four phases of lockdown,
and the first phase of unlock. Nuanced and sensible interpretations of the
numeric results indicate significant variability across time in terms of the
relation between the variables of interest. The detailed knowledge about the
varying patterns of dependence could potentially help the policy makers and

investigate relationships between network fingerprint, changes in omic measures

tridecenedioate, moderated the relationship between 1) miR-505 and DMN
fingerprint and 2) the relationship between DMN fingerprint and worsening VR
Balance measures (all p less than or equal to 0.05). In addition, the
similarity in DMN over the season was negatively related to cumulative number
of HAEs above 80G, and DMN fingerprint was less similar across the season in
athletes relative to age-matched non-athletes. miR-505 was also positively
related to average number of HAEs above 25G per session. It is important to
note that tridecenedioate has a double bond making it a candidate for ROS
scavenging. These findings between a candidate ROS-related metabolite,
inflammatory miRNA, altered brain imaging and diminished behavioral performance
suggests that impact athletes may experience chronic neuroinflammation. The
rigorous permutation-based mediation/moderation may provide a methodology for

data mining. A large number of algorithms have been studied to factorize
matrices. Among them, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a commonly used
method. Heterogeneous systems with multi-core CPUs and GPUs have become more
and more promising recently due to the prevalence of GPUs in general-purpose
data-parallel applications. Due to the large computational cost of MF, we aim
to improve the efficiency of SGD-based MF computation by utilizing the massive
parallel processing power of heterogeneous multiprocessors. The main challenge
in parallel SGD algorithms on heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems lies in the
granularity of the matrix division and the strategy to assign tasks. We design
a novel strategy to divide the matrix into a set of blocks by considering two
aspects. First, we observe that the matrix should be divided nonuniformly, and
relatively large blocks should be assigned to GPUs to saturate the computing
power of GPUs. In addition to exploiting the characteristics of hardware, the
workloads assigned to two types of hardware should be balanced. Aiming at the
final division strategy, we design a cost model tailored for our problem to
accurately estimate the performance of hardware on different data sizes. A
dynamic scheduling policy is also used to further balance workloads in
practice. Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm achieves high
efficiency with a high quality of training quality.

Geometric restrictions can hinder the motion of individuals and, combined with

methodologies are not always readily extendable to heterogeneous environments:
in these situations predictions of crowded transport behaviour within
heterogeneous environments rely on computationally intensive mesh-based
approaches. Here, we take a different approach by employing networked
representations of complex environments to provide an efficient framework
within which the interactions between networked geometry and crowding can be
explored. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to: extract detailed
information at the level of the whole population or an individual within it;
identify the topological features of environments that enable accurate
prediction of transport phenomena; and, provide insights into the design of
optimal environments.

maps, are critical inputs for a wide range of agriculture and food security

farming (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa). These maps are especially critical in times
of crisis when decision makers need to rapidly design and enact
agriculture-related policies and mitigation strategies, including providing
humanitarian assistance, dispersing targeted aid, or boosting productivity for

have readily accessible ground truth data on croplands necessary for training

collecting labels for rapid response. We present a method for rapid mapping of
croplands in regions where little to no ground data is available. We present
results for this method in Togo, where we delivered a high-resolution (10 m)

equations in both theories. We studied two position operators, a canonical one

the particle subspace. In 1+1 dimensions the particle position operator, not
the canonical position operator, provides the conserved Lorentz generator. The
mass moment defined by the canonical position operator needs an additional
unphysical spin-like operator to become the conserved Lorentz generator in 1+1
dimensions. In 2+1 dimensions, the sum of the orbital angular momentum given by
the canonical position operator and the spin angular momentum becomes a
constant of motion. However, orbital and spin angular momentum do not conserve
separately. On the other hand the orbital angular momentum given by the
particle position operator and its corresponding spin angular momentum become a

lot of work incorporating edge features along with node features for prediction
tasks. One of the main difficulties in using edge features is that they are
often handcrafted, hard to get, specific to a particular domain, and may
contain redundant information. In this work, we present a framework for
creating new edge features, applicable to any domain, via a combination of
self-supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition to this, we use
Forman-Ricci curvature as an additional edge feature to encapsulate the local
geometry of the graph. We then encode our edge features via a Set Transformer
and combine them with node features extracted from popular GNN architectures
for node classification in an end-to-end training scheme. We validate our work
on three biological datasets comprising of single-cell RNA sequencing data of
neurological disease, \textit{in vitro} SARS-CoV-2 infection, and human
