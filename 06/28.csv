Here, ZnO nanowire-in-fiber hybrids with internal architectural order are
introduced, exhibiting a combination of polarized stimulated emission, low
propagation losses of light modes, and structural flexibility. Ultrafast
transient absorption experiments on the electrospun material show optical gain
which gives rise to amplified spontaneous emission, with threshold lower than
the value found in films. These systems are highly flexible and can
conveniently conform to curved surfaces, which makes them appealing active

the deep sea due to the physical limitations caused by technical challenges and
enormous costs. Deep sea images are very different from the images taken in
shallow waters and this area did not get much attention from the community. The
shortage of deep sea images and the corresponding ground truth data for
evaluation and training is becoming a bottleneck for the development of
underwater computer vision methods. Thus, this paper presents a physical
model-based image simulation solution, which uses an in-air texture and depth
information as inputs, to generate underwater image sequences taken by robots
in deep ocean scenarios. Different from shallow water conditions, artificial
illumination plays a vital role in deep sea image formation as it strongly
affects the scene appearance. Our radiometric image formation model considers
both attenuation and scattering effects with co-moving spotlights in the dark.
By detailed analysis and evaluation of the underwater image formation model, we
propose a 3D lookup table structure in combination with a novel rendering

  Centralities in Multidimensional Complex Networks","17 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In complex network analysis, centralities based on shortest paths, such as
betweenness and closeness, are widely used. More recently, many complex systems
are being represented by time-varying, multilayer, and time-varying multilayer
networks, i.e. multidimensional (or high order) networks. Nevertheless, it is
well-known that the aggregation process may create spurious paths on the
aggregated view of such multidimensional (high order) networks. Consequently,
these spurious paths may then cause shortest-path based centrality metrics to
produce incorrect results, thus undermining the network centrality analysis. In
this context, we propose a method able to avoid taking into account spurious
paths when computing centralities based on shortest paths in multidimensional
(or high order) networks. Our method is based on MultiAspect Graphs~(MAG) to
represent the multidimensional networks and we show that well-known centrality
algorithms can be straightforwardly adapted to the MAG environment. Moreover,
we show that, by using this MAG representation, pitfalls usually associated
with spurious paths resulting from aggregation in multidimensional networks can
be avoided at the time of the aggregation process. As a result, shortest-path
based centralities are assured to be computed correctly for multidimensional
networks, without taking into account spurious paths that could otherwise lead
to incorrect results. We also present a case study that shows the impact of
spurious paths in the computing of shortest paths and consequently of
shortest-path based centralities, such as betweenness and closeness, thus
illustrating the importance of this contribution.

quantum technologies. Currently available methods to fabricate the NV center
often involve complex processes such as N implantation. By contrast, in a
diamond-like compound C3BN, creating a boron (B) vacancy immediately leads to
an NV center analog. We use the strongly constrained and appropriately normed
(SCAN) semilocal density functional - this functional leads to nearly the same
zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy as the experiment and as obtained from the more
time-consuming hybrid density functional calculations - to explore the
potential of this NV center analog as a novel spin qubit for applications in
quantum information processing. We show that the NV center analog in C3BN
possesses many similar properties to the NV center in diamond including a wide
band gap, weak spin-orbit coupling, an energetically stable negatively charged
state, a highly localized spin density, a paramagnetic triplet ground state,
and strong hyperfine interactions, which are the properties that make the NV
center in diamond stand out as a suitable quantum bit (qubit). We predict the
NV center analog in C3BN to exhibit two ZPL energies that correspond to longer
wavelengths close to the ideal telecommunication band for quantum
communications. C3BN studied here represents only one example of A3XY (A: group
IV element; X/Y: group III/V elements) compounds. We expect many other
compounds of this family to have similar NV center analogs with a wide range of
ZPL energies and functional properties, promising to be new hosts of qubits for
quantum technology applications. Furthermore, A3XY compounds often contain
group IV elements such as silicon and germanium, so they are compatible with

computational limits is a common challenge for information retrieval and
recommendation systems. Tree models, which formulate targets as leaves of a
tree with trainable node-wise scorers, have attracted a lot of interests in
tackling this challenge due to their logarithmic computational complexity in
both training and testing. Tree-based deep models (TDMs) and probabilistic
label trees (PLTs) are two representative kinds of them. Though achieving many
practical successes, existing tree models suffer from the training-testing
discrepancy, where the retrieval performance deterioration caused by beam
search in testing is not considered in training. This leads to an intrinsic gap
between the most relevant targets and those retrieved by beam search with even
the optimally trained node-wise scorers. We take a first step towards
understanding and analyzing this problem theoretically, and develop the concept
of Bayes optimality under beam search and calibration under beam search as
general analyzing tools for this purpose. Moreover, to eliminate the

However, not only does a network evolve, but often the way that it evolves,
itself evolves. Thus, knowing, in addition to patterns' frequencies, for how
long and how regularly they have occurred---i.e., their persistence---can add
to our understanding of evolving networks. In this work, we propose the problem
of mining activity that persists through time in continually evolving
networks---i.e., activity that repeatedly and consistently occurs. We extend
the notion of temporal motifs to capture activity among specific nodes, in what
we call activity snippets, which are small sequences of edge-updates that
reoccur. We propose axioms and properties that a measure of persistence should
satisfy, and develop such a persistence measure. We also propose PENminer, an
efficient framework for mining activity snippets' Persistence in Evolving
Networks, and design both offline and streaming algorithms. We apply PENminer
to numerous real, large-scale evolving networks and edge streams, and find
activity that is surprisingly regular over a long period of time, but too
infrequent to be discovered by aggregate count alone, and bursts of activity
exposed by their lack of persistence. Our findings with PENminer include
neighborhoods in NYC where taxi traffic persisted through Hurricane Sandy, the
opening of new bike-stations, characteristics of social network users, and
more. Moreover, we use PENminer towards identifying anomalies in multiple

  Learning Theory, ALT 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information-theoretic quantities like entropy and mutual information have
found numerous uses in machine learning. It is well known that there is a
strong connection between these entropic quantities and submodularity since
entropy over a set of random variables is submodular. In this paper, we study
combinatorial information measures that generalize independence, (conditional)
entropy, (conditional) mutual information, and total correlation defined over
sets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize
the corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via
submodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically,
we show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular
mutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other
fixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial
derivatives satisfy a non-negativity property. This turns out to include a
number of practically useful cases such as the facility location and set-cover
functions. We study specific instantiations of the submodular information
measures on these, as well as the probabilistic coverage, graph-cut, and
saturated coverage functions, and see that they all have mathematically
intuitive and practically useful expressions. Regarding applications, we
connect the maximization of submodular (conditional) mutual information to
problems such as mutual-information-based, query-based, and privacy-preserving
summarization -- and we connect optimizing the multi-set submodular mutual
information to clustering and robust partitioning.

~$10^{-12}-10^{-10}$ for $NH_2CHO$, and ~$10^{-11}-10^{-9}$ for $C_2H_5CN$. The
abundances of $CH_3OCHO$, $CH_3OCH_3$, and $C_2H_5CN$ are very strongly

show the strongest correlations in most parameters, and a nearly constant ratio
(~1) over a remarkable ~9 orders of magnitude in luminosity for a wide variety
of sources: pre-stellar to evolved cores, low- to high-mass objects, shocks,
Galactic clouds, and comets. This indicates that COMs chemistry is likely early
developed and then preserved through evolved phases. Moreover, the molecular
abundances clearly increase with evolution. We consider $CH_3OCHO$ and
$CH_3OCH_3$ to be most likely chemically linked: they could e.g. share a common
precursor, or be formed one from the other. We propose a general scenario for
all COMs, involving a formation in the cold, earliest phases of star formation
and a following increasing desorption with the progressive heating of the
evolving core.

the skin with significant morbidity, characterized by hyper proliferation of

believed to be multifactorial with numerous key components. Methods: In order
to cast light on the complex molecular interactions in psoriasis vulgaris at
both protein-protein interactions and transcriptomics levels, we analyzed a set
of microarray gene expression analysis consisting of 170 paired lesional and
non-lesional samples. Afterwards, a network analysis was conducted on
protein-protein interaction network of differentially expressed genes based on
micro- and macro-level network metrics at a systemic level standpoint. Results:
We found 17 top communicative genes, all of which experimentally proven to be
pivotal in psoriasis were identified in two modules, namely, cell cycle and
immune system. Intra- and inter-gene interaction subnetworks from the top
communicative genes might provide further insight into the corresponding
characteristic mechanisms. Conclusions: Potential gene combinations for
therapeutic/diagnostics purposes were identified. Moreover, our proposed

there a sense in which computational models estimated through machine learning

production is the most relevant performance metric for an adaptive physical
agent and compare the results to the maximum-likelihood principle that guides
machine learning. Within the class of physical agents that most efficiently
harvest energy from their environment, we demonstrate that an efficient agent's
model explicitly determines its architecture and how much useful work it
harvests from the environment. We then show that selecting the maximum-work
agent for given environmental data corresponds to finding the
maximum-likelihood model. This establishes an equivalence between
nonequilibrium thermodynamics and dynamic learning. In this way, work
maximization emerges as an organizing principle that underlies learning in

non-negative matrix factorization provide superior performance in
interpretability and fidelity based on computational and human subject

geophysics and are regarded as chaotic processes resulting from a dynamo
mechanism. In this article, we use the polarity scale data set for the last 170
Myr from the ocean's floor to provide robust evidence for an inverse
relationship between the complexity of sequences of consecutive polarity
intervals and the respective reversal rate. In particular the variability of
sequences of polarity intervals reaches a minimum in the mid-Jurassic when a
maximum reversal rate is found. This raises the possibility of epochs of high
regularity in the reversal process geodynamo. To shed light on this process, We
investigate the transition from regular to chaotic regime in a minimal model
for geomagnetic reversals. We show that even in a chaotic regime, near to the
transition the system retains the signature of regular behavior. We suggest
that geomagnetic reversals have switched between different degrees of
irregularity, with a dominant periodicity around 70 kyrs that results from a

long charging time, short driving range, cost and insufficient charging

applications where the training data may contain sensitive information. To
provide formal and rigorous privacy guarantee, many learning systems now
incorporate differential privacy by training their models with (differentially)
private SGD. A key step in each private SGD update is gradient clipping that
shrinks the gradient of an individual example whenever its L2 norm exceeds some
threshold. We first demonstrate how gradient clipping can prevent SGD from
converging to stationary point. We then provide a theoretical analysis that
fully quantifies the clipping bias on convergence with a disparity measure
between the gradient distribution and a geometrically symmetric distribution.
Our empirical evaluation further suggests that the gradient distributions along
the trajectory of private SGD indeed exhibit symmetric structure that favors

evaluated consistently for several equations of state corresponding to
different values of the slope parameter $L$. Direct Urca processes, which are
allowed from a critical $L$-value onwards, enhance the bulk viscosity and have
large influence on the $r$-mode features, such as the instability boundary and
spin-down properties of newborn neutron stars. The magnitude of the changes in
the $r$-mode properties induced by the direct Urca processes are driven by the
$L$-value of the equation of state and the mass of the pulsar. The study has
been done by using a family of equations of state of $\beta$-equilibrated
neutron star matter obtained with the finite range simple effective
interaction, which provides realistic results for nuclear matter and finite
nuclei properties. These equations of state predict the same properties in
symmetric nuclear matter and have the same value of the symmetry energy
parameter, $E_s(\rho_0)$, but differ in the slope parameter $L$. The range
chosen for the variation of $L$ is decided from the tidal deformability data
extracted from the GW170817 event and the maximum mass constraint.

these spectra in the framework of the semi-empirical ``spectroscopic model''

comparing and analyzing measured and synthetic spectra on the basis of the
calculated and corrected atomic data. The three different sets of atomic data

to verify the methods for calculating the atomic data with an accuracy within

with the spectra measured in the wide range of plasma conditions within the
experimental accuracy of 10\%. Corrected atomic data made it possible to
perform an accurate diagnostics of plasma parameters: plasma temperatures and
relative ion abundances in the tokamak plasma. This procedure provided also a
method for determining the temperature of the plasma core with high accuracy
within 5\% in a good agreement with the diagnostics technique based on the
electron cyclotron emission. The relative ion abundances obtained by the

GPT-GNN introduces a self-supervised attributed graph generation task to
pre-train a GNN so that it can capture the structural and semantic properties
of the graph. We factorize the likelihood of the graph generation into two
components: 1) Attribute Generation and 2) Edge Generation. By modeling both
components, GPT-GNN captures the inherent dependency between node attributes

facilitate accessible banking and to support customers in making financial
decisions. Chatbots are increasing in prevalence, sometimes even equipped to
mimic human social rules, expectations and norms, decreasing the necessity for
human-to-human interaction. As banks and financial advisory platforms move
towards creating bots that enhance the current state of consumer trust and
adoption rates, we investigated the effects of chatbot vignettes with and
without socio-emotional features on intention to use the chatbot for financial
support purposes. We conducted a between-subject online experiment with N = 410
participants. Participants in the control group were provided with a vignette
describing a secure and reliable chatbot called XRO23, whereas participants in
the experimental group were presented with a vignette describing a secure and
reliable chatbot that is more human-like and named Emma. We found that Vignette
Emma did not increase participants' trust levels nor lowered their privacy
concerns even though it increased perception of social presence. However, we
found that intention to use the presented chatbot for financial support was
positively influenced by perceived humanness and trust in the bot. Participants
were also more willing to share financially-sensitive information such as
account number, sort code and payments information to XRO23 compared to Emma -
revealing a preference for a technical and mechanical FinBot in information
sharing. Overall, this research contributes to our understanding of the
intention to use chatbots with different features as financial technology, in
particular that socio-emotional support may not be favoured when designed
independently of financial function.

macroscopic models for interactions as appearing in social processes. There are
two main characteristics the models take into account, namely a network
structure of interactions, which we treat by an appropriate mesoscopic
description, and a different role of interacting agents. The latter differs
from interactions treated in classical statistical mechanics in the sense that
the agents do not have symmetric roles, but there is rather an active and a
passive agent. We will demonstrate how a certain form of kinetic equations can
be obtained to describe such interactions at a mesoscopic level and moreover
obtain macroscopic models from monokinetics solutions of those.
  The derivation naturally leads to systems of nonlocal reaction-diffusion
equations (or in a suitable limit local versions thereof), which can explain
spatial phase separation phenomena found to emerge from the microscopic
interactions. We will highlight the approach in three examples, namely the
evolution and coarsening of dialects in human language, the construction of
social norms, and the spread of an epidemic.

nodes. Previous results have shown that these higher-order interactions can
profoundly modify the dynamics of contagion processes, resulting in
bistability, hysteresis, and explosive transitions. In this paper, we present
and analyze a hyperdegree-based mean-field description of the dynamics of the
SIS model on hypergraphs, i.e. networks with higher-order interactions, and
illustrate its applicability with the example of a hypergraph where contagion
is mediated by both links (pairwise interactions) and triangles (three-way
interactions). We consider various models for the organization of link and
triangle structure, and different mechanisms of higher-order contagion and
healing. We find that explosive transitions can be suppressed by heterogeneity
in the link degree distribution, when links and triangles are chosen
independently, or when link and triangle connections are positively correlated
when compared to the uncorrelated case. We verify these results with
microscopic simulations of the contagion process and with analytic predictions
derived from the mean-field model. Our results show that the structure of
higher-order interactions can have important effects on contagion processes on
hypergraphs.

poor contrast. Thalamus Optimized Multi-Atlas Segmentation (THOMAS) provides
automatic segmentation of 12 thalamic nuclei using white-matter-nulled (WMn)
MPRAGE sequence at 7T. Application of THOMAS to Magnetization Prepared 2 Rapid
Gradient Echo (MP2RAGE) sequence acquired at 7T has been investigated in this
study.
  Methods: 8 healthy volunteers and 5 pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis
patients were recruited at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and scanned
at Siemens 7T with WMn-MPRAGE and multi-echo MP2RAGE (ME-MP2RAGE) sequences.
White-matter-nulled contrast was synthesized (MP2-SYN) from T1 maps from
ME-MP2RAGE sequence. Thalamic nuclei were segmented using THOMAS joint label
fusion algorithm from WMn-MPRAGE and MP2-SYN datasets. THOMAS pipeline was
modified to use majority voting to segment the bias corrected MP2-UNI images.
Thalamic nuclei from MP2-SYN and MP2-UNI images were evaluated against
corresponding nuclei obtained from WMn-MPRAGE images using dice coefficients,
volume similarity indices (VSI) and distance between centroids.
  Results: For MP2-SYN, dice > 0.85 and VSI > 0.95 was achieved for the 5
larger nuclei and dice > 0.6 and VSI > 0.7 was achieved for the 7 smaller
nuclei. The dice and VSI were slightly higher whilst the distance between
centroids were smaller for MP2-SYN compared to MP2-UNI, indicating improved
performance using the synthesized WMn image.
  Discussion: THOMAS algorithm can successfully segment thalamic nuclei in
routinely acquired bias-free MP2RAGE images with essentially equivalent quality
when evaluated against WMn-MPRAGE, hence has wider applicability in studies
focused on thalamic involvement in aging and disease.

decrease swarm performance, causing robot failures and influencing the
cooperation effectiveness between the human and the robot swarm. Therefore,
given the quick-transition requirements and the introduced uncertainty, it is
challenging for a human-swarm system to respond to emergent tasks, compared
with executing normal tasks where a gradual transition between tasks is
allowed. Human trust reveals the behavior expectations of others and is used to
adjust unsatisfactory behaviors for better cooperation. Inspired by human
trust, in this paper, a trust-aware reflective control (Trust-R) is developed
to dynamically calibrate human-swarm cooperation. Trust-R, based on a weighted
mean subsequence reduced algorithm (WMSR) and human trust modeling, helps a
swarm to self-reflect its performance from the perspective of human trust; then
proactively correct its faulty behaviors in an early stage before a human
intervenes. One typical task scenario {emergency response} was designed in the
real-gravity simulation environment, and a human user study with 145 volunteers
was conducted. Trust-R's effectiveness in correcting faulty behaviors in
emergency response was validated by the improved swarm performance and
increased trust scores.

respectively, weak and moderate departures from GR, in boxes of sizes
$62\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ and $25\,h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ using $2\times512^3$ dark
matter particles and initial gas cells. This allows us to explore, for the
first time, the impact of baryonic physics on galactic scales in braneworld
models of modified gravity and to make predictions on the stellar content of
dark matter haloes and galaxy evolution through cosmic time in these models. We
find significant differences between the GR and nDGP models in the power
spectra and correlation functions of gas, stars and dark matter of up to $\sim
25$ per cent on large scales. Similar to their impact in the standard
cosmological model ($\Lambda$CDM), baryonic effects can have a significant
influence over the clustering of the overall matter distribution, with a sign
that depends on scale. Studying the degeneracy between modified gravity and
galactic feedback in these models, we find that these two physical effects on
matter clustering can be cleanly disentangled, allowing for a method to
accurately predict the matter power spectrum with baryonic effects included,
without having to run hydrodynamical simulations. Depending on the braneworld
model, we find differences compared with GR of up to $\sim15$ per cent in
galaxy properties such as the stellar-to-halo-mass ratio, galaxy stellar mass
function, gas fraction and star formation rate density. The amplitude of the
fifth force is reduced by the presence of baryons in the very inner part of
haloes, but this reduction quickly becomes negligible above $\sim0.1$ times the
halo radius.

planes with small magnetic Reynolds number and constant transverse magnetic
field orthogonal to the planes. A method is presented that allows to take 3D
effects into account in a 2D equation of motion thanks to a model for the
transverse velocity profile. The latter is obtained by using a double
perturbation asymptotic development both in the core flow and in the Hartmann
layers arising along the planes. A new model is thus built that describes
inertial effects in these two regions. Two separate classes of phenomena are
thus pointed out : the one related to inertial effects in the Hartmann layer
gives a model for recirculating flows and the other introduces the possibility
of having a transverse dependence of the velocity profile in the core flow. The
''recirculating'' velocity profile is then introduced in the transversally
averaged equation of motion in order to provide an effective 2D equation of
motion. Analytical solutions of this model are obtained for two experimental
configurations : isolated vortices aroused by a point electrode and
axisymmetric parallel layers occurring in the MATUR (MAgneticTURbulence)
experiment. The theory is found to give a satisfactory agreement with the
experiment so that it can be concluded that recirculating flows are actually
responsible for both vortices core spreading and excessive dissipative behavior
of the axisymmetric side wall layers.

Despite a substantial body of theoretical work concerning MC, the lack of

make overly simplifying assumptions about the implications of the channel

developing theoretical models and devising communication methods for MC. On the

nonlinear, time-varying channel properties that cannot be always tackled by
conventional information and communication tools and technologies (ICT). As a
result, the reliability of the existing MC methods, which are mostly adopted

is highly questionable. As the first step to remove this discrepancy, in this
study, we report on the fabrication of a nanoscale MC receiver based on

not only cause bulk metallic conductivity, preventing the measurement of
quantum transport in surface states, but may also affect magnetism and
topological properties. In this paper, we show by density functional theory
calculations that the strain induced by the internal heterostructure promotes
the formation of large-size-mismatched antisite defect BiMn in MnBi2Te4; such
strain is further enhanced in MnBi4Te7, giving rise to even higher BiMn
density. The abundance of intrinsic BiMn donors results in degenerate n-type
conductivity under the Te-poor growth condition. Our calculations suggest that
growths in a Te-rich condition can lower the Fermi level, which is supported by
our transport measurements. We further show that the internal strain can also
enable efficient doping by large-size-mismatched substitutional NaMn acceptors,
which can compensate BiMn donors and lower the Fermi level. Na doping may pin
the Fermi level inside the bulk band gap even at the Te-poor limit in MnBi2Te4.
Furthermore, facile defect formation in MnSb2Te4 and its implication in Sb
doping in MnBi2Te4 as well as the defect segregation in MnBi4Te7 are discussed.
The defect engineering and doping strategies proposed in this paper will

""memory-augmented hierarchical-classification network (MahiNet)"", performs
coarse-to-fine classification where each coarse class can cover multiple fine

and accurate dose calculation based on a deep learning technique. A two
dimensional (2D) fluence map was first converted into a three dimensional (3D)
volume using ray traversal algorithm. A 3D U-Net like deep residual network was
then established to learn a mapping between this converted 3D volume, CT and 3D
dose distribution. Therefore an indirect relationship was built between a
fluence map and its corresponding 3D dose distribution without using
significantly complex neural networks. 200 patients, including nasopharyngeal,
lung, rectum and breast cancer cases, were collected and applied to train the
proposed network. Additional 47 patients were randomly selected to evaluate the
accuracy of the proposed method through comparing dose distributions, dose
volume histograms (DVH) and clinical indices with the results from a treatment
planning system (TPS), which was used as the ground truth in this study.
Results: The proposed deep learning based dose calculation algorithm achieved
good predictive performance. For 47 tested patients, the average per-voxel bias
of the deep learning calculated value and standard deviation (normalized to the
prescription), relative to the TPS calculation, is 0.17%. The average deep
learning calculated values and standard deviations for relevant clinical
indices were compared with the TPS calculated results and the t-test p-values
demonstrated the consistency between them. Conclusions: In this study we
developed a new deep learning based dose calculation method. This approach was
evaluated by the clinical cases with different sites. Our results demonstrated
its feasibility and reliability and indicated its great potential to improve
the efficiency and accuracy of radiation dose calculation for different
treatment modalities

Laplacian term encouraging nearby query samples to have consistent label
assignments. Our transductive inference does not re-train the base model, and
can be viewed as a graph clustering of the query set, subject to supervision

Following a simple cross-entropy training on the base classes, and without
complex meta-learning strategies, we conducted comprehensive experiments over
five few-shot learning benchmarks. Our LaplacianShot consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by significant margins across different models,

relies on rotation-driven plasma oscillations, rather than on a beam-driven
instability, and suggest that it may be the generic radio emission mechanism
for pulsars. We identify these oscillations as superluminal longitudinal waves
in the pulsar plasma, and point out that these waves can escape directly in the
O~mode. We argue that the frequency of the oscillations is
$\omega_0\approx\omega_{\rm p}(2\langle\gamma\rangle)^{1/2}/\gamma_{\rm s}$,
where $\gamma_{\rm s}$ is the Lorentz factor of bulk streaming motion and
$\langle\gamma\rangle$ is the mean Lorentz factor in the rest frame of the
plasma. The dependence of the plasma frequency $\omega_{\rm p}$ on radial
distance implies a specific frequency-to-radius mapping, $\omega_0\propto
r^{-3/2}$. Escape of the energy in these oscillations is possible if they are
generated in overdense, field-aligned regions that we call fibers; the wave
energy is initially refracted into underdense regions between the fibers, which
act as ducts. Some implications of the model for the interpretation of pulsar
radio emission are discussed.

the statistical estimator particularly when the data contain noise. Kratscher

measurement procedures by Cont et al. [2]. In this paper, we follow the stream
of research to propose a quantitative approach for verifying the statistical
robustness of tail-dependent law invariant risk measures. A distinct feature of
our approach is that we use the Fortet-Mourier metric to quantify the variation
of the true underlying probability measure in the analysis of the discrepancy
between the laws of the plug-in estimators of law invariant risk measure based
on the true data and perturbed data, which enables us to derive an explicit
error bound for the discrepancy when the risk functional is Lipschitz
continuous with respect to a class of admissible laws. Moreover, the newly
introduced notion of Lipschitz continuity allows us to examine the degree of
robustness for tail-dependent risk measures. Finally, we apply our quantitative
approach to some well-known risk measures to illustrate our theory.

large intrinsic phonon thermal conductivity mainly due to the large
acoustic-optic phonon frequency gaps. The phonon thermal conductivity is
reduced by two orders of magnitude as the phonon-isotope and phonon-electron
scatterings are considered, which also induce the nontrivial
temperature-independent behavior of phonon thermal conductivity. Nesting Fermi
surfaces exist in both TiN and HfN, which cause the strong electron-phonon
coupling strengths and heavily harm the transport of phonons and electrons. The
phonon component takes an abnormally large ratio in total thermal conductivity,
as 29% for TiN and 26% for HfN at 300 K. The results for thin films are also

reasonable enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient, with a maximum of $1000~\mu

reduced as the length of the superlattice scales up, although the power factor

utilizes this sparsity to avoid generating the full adjacency matrix, and
importantly reduces the graph generation time complexity to $O((n + m)\log n)$.
Furthermore, during training this autoregressive model can be parallelized with
$O(\log n)$ synchronization stages, which makes it much more efficient than
other autoregressive models that require $\Omega(n)$. Experiments on several

unknown objects in the context of relatively simple tasks, such as bin-picking.
Existing methods for more constrained problems, however, such as deliberate
placement in a tight region, depend more critically on shape information to
achieve safe execution. This work deals with pick-and-constrained placement of
objects without access to geometric models. The objective is to pick an object
and place it safely inside a desired goal region without any collisions, while
minimizing the time and the sensing operations required to complete the task.
An algorithmic framework is proposed for this purpose, which performs
manipulation planning simultaneously over a conservative and an optimistic
estimate of the object's volume. The conservative estimate ensures that the
manipulation is safe while the optimistic estimate guides the sensor-based
manipulation process when no solution can be found for the conservative
estimate. To maintain these estimates and dynamically update them during
manipulation, objects are represented by a simple volumetric representation,
which stores sets of occupied and unseen voxels. The effectiveness of the
proposed approach is demonstrated by developing a robotic system that picks a
previously unseen object from a table-top and places it in a constrained space.
The system comprises of a dual-arm manipulator with heterogeneous end-effectors
and leverages hand-offs as a re-grasping strategy. Real-world experiments show
that straightforward pick-sense-and-place alternatives frequently fail to solve
pick-and-constrained placement problems. The proposed pipeline, however,
achieves more than 95% success rate and faster execution times as evaluated

systems of cold atoms into collective states of heavy, even-even nuclei and to
identify a related physical example. This is accompanied by the determination
of observables of conformal symmetry in nuclear structure. A Hamiltonian is
defined that governs the scattering process of an incident pair of two slow
neutrons onto a heavy, even-even target nucleus in the framework of the
Interacting Boson Model of nuclear structure. A unitary pair-collective state
interaction is introduced along with the effective range expansion of a
pair-collective state scattering length. The solutions to the coupled channels
equations provide a scattering state for the two neutrons that couples with
intermediate states of the $A+2n$ compound nucleus. The unitary limit manifests
itself when the intermediate states correspond to pair-collective state
resonances the positions of which coincide with the energies of IBM states of
the closed channels. The position and the width of each resonance is measurable
via the fluctuation of the cross section which tunes the pair-collective state
scattering length. Conformal symmetry is represented in a tower of equally
spaced states that emerges at the unitary limit from two-boson excitations on
the IBM state of the closed channel. These tower states are experimentally
testable as a regularity pattern of fluctuations of the cross section, in terms
of regular positions and widths. The manifestation of the unitary limit and
conformal symmetry via fluctuations of the cross section indicates the $A+2n$
compound nucleus as a physical laboratory for the examination of the BCS-BEC
crossover, of an underlying critical point and of algebras with infinite number

later we have checked the imprints of these new couplings on a number of

but still no individual coupling is able to accommodate all of the available

check their range that simultaneously satisfy constraints of $B$-Physics and

Unfortunately, the main energy efficiency mechanisms of 802.11, namely PSM and
APSD, fall short when used in IoT applications. PSM increases latency and
intensifies channel access contention after each beacon instance, and APSD does
not inform stations about when they need to wake up to receive their downlink
packets. In this paper, we present a new mechanism---edge-assisted predictive
sleep scheduling (EAPS)---to adjust the sleep duration of stations while they
expect downlink packets. We first implement a Linux-based access point that
enables us to collect parameters affecting communication latency. Using this
access point, we build a testbed that, in addition to offering traffic pattern
customization, replicates the characteristics of real-world environments. We
then use multiple machine learning algorithms to predict downlink packet
delivery. Our empirical evaluations confirm that when using EAPS the energy
consumption of IoT stations is as low as PSM, whereas the delay of packet
delivery is close to the case where the station is always awake.

widely studied recently, because of their high-speed processing capability and

the image prior from the spatial domain, and suffer from the problem of
spatially variant noise, which limits their performance in real-world image
denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a discrete wavelet denoising CNN
(WDnCNN), which restores images corrupted by various noise with a single model.
Since most of the content or energy of natural images resides in the
low-frequency spectrum, their transformed coefficients in the frequency domain
are highly imbalanced. To address this issue, we present a band normalization
module (BNM) to normalize the coefficients from different parts of the
frequency spectrum. Moreover, we employ a band discriminative training (BDT)
criterion to enhance the model regression. We evaluate the proposed WDnCNN, and
compare it with other state-of-the-art denoisers. Experimental results show
that WDnCNN achieves promising performance in both synthetic and real noise
reduction, making it a potential solution to many practical image denoising
applications.

Increased functionalities, such as low power consumption, can be achieved by
building complementary circuits featuring two or more OECTs. Complementary
circuits commonly combine both p- and n-type transistors to reduce power draw.
While p-type OECTs are readily available, n-type OECTs are less common mainly
due to poor stability of the n-type active channel material in aqueous
electrolyte. Additionally, an OECT based complementary circuit requires well
matched transport properties in the p- and n-type materials. Here, a
complementary circuit is made using a pair of OECTs having polyaniline (PANI)
as the channel material in both transistors. PANI is chosen due to its unique
behaviour exhibiting a peak in current versus gate voltage when used as an
active channel in an OECT. The PANI based circuit is shown to have excellent
performance with gain of ~ 7 and could be transferred on a flexible
biocompatible chitosan substrate with demonstrated operation in aqueous
electrolyte. This study extends the capabilities of conjugated polymer based
OECTs.

described the lemniscate in 1694. The Fagnano discovered the double angle

more general addition theorem(1751). The lemniscate function was subsequently
proposed by Gauss around the year 1800. These insights are summarized by Jacobi
as the theory of elliptic functions. A leaf function is an extended lemniscate
function. Some formulas of leaf functions have been presented in previous
papers; these included the addition theorem of this function and its
application to nonlinear equations. In this paper, the geometrical properties
of leaf functions at n = 2 and the geometric relation between the angle theta

relationship between the leaf functions sleaf2(l) and cleaf2(l) is derived

be trained end-to-end. The structure of the compositional model enables
CompositionalNets to decompose images into objects and context, as well as to
further decompose object representations in terms of individual parts and the
objects' pose. The generative nature of our compositional model enables it to
localize occluders and to recognize objects based on their non-occluded parts.
We conduct extensive experiments in terms of image classification and object
detection on images of artificially occluded objects from the PASCAL3D+ and
ImageNet dataset, and real images of partially occluded vehicles from the
MS-COCO dataset. Our experiments show that CompositionalNets made from several
popular DCNN backbones (VGG-16, ResNet50, ResNext) improve by a large margin
over their non-compositional counterparts at classifying and detecting
partially occluded objects. Furthermore, they can localize occluders accurately

control, it has undergone different modifications to tailor it to traffic
problems with promising results. Most of these BP variants are based on an
assumption of perfect knowledge of traffic conditions throughout the network at
all times, specifically the queue lengths (more accurately, the traffic
volumes). However, it has been well established that accurate queue length
information at signalized intersections is never available except in fully
connected environments. Although connected vehicle technologies are developing
quickly, we are still far from a fully connected environment in the real world.
This paper test the effectiveness of BP control when incomplete or imperfect
knowledge about traffic conditions is available. We combine BP control with a
speed/density field estimation module suitable for a partially connected
environment. We refer to the proposed system as a BP with estimated queue
lengths (BP-EQ). We test the robustness of BP-EQ to varying levels of connected
vehicle penetration, and we compared BP-EQ with the original BP (i.e., assuming
accurate knowledge of traffic conditions), a real-world adaptive signal
controller, and optimized fixed timing control using microscopic traffic
simulation with field calibrated data. Our results show that with a connected
vehicle penetration rate as little as 10%, BP-EQ can outperform the adaptive
controller and the fixed timing controller in terms of average delay,
throughput, and maximum stopped queue lengths under high demand scenarios.

observed throughout reciprocal space, with a strongly renormalized dispersion
and multiple soft modes compared to linear spin wave theory. We propose an
empirical parametrization that can quantitatively capture the complete
dispersions in the three-dimensional Brillouin zone and explicitly show that
the dispersion renormalizations have the direct consequence that one to two
magnon decays are avoided throughout reciprocal space, whereas such decays
would be allowed for the unrenormalized dispersions. At higher energies, we
observe a very strong continuum of excitations with highly-structured intensity
modulations extending up at least 4x the maximum one-magnon energy. The
one-magnon intensities decrease much faster upon increasing energy than
predicted by linear spin wave theory and the higher-energy continuum contains
much more intensity than can be accounted for by a two-magnon cross-section,
suggesting a significant transfer of spectral weight from the high-energy
magnons into the higher-energy continuum states. We attribute the strong
dispersion renormalizations and substantial transfer of spectral weight to
continuum states to the effect of quantum fluctuations and interactions beyond
the spin wave approximation, and make connections to theoretical approaches
that might capture such effects. Finally, through measurements in a strong
applied magnetic field, we find evidence for magnetic domains with opposite
senses for the spin rotation in the 120 degree ordered ground state, as
expected in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, when the sense

images. Many different schemes have been proposed for the restoration of
intensity SAR images. Among the different possible approaches, methods based on
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently shown to reach
state-of-the-art performance for SAR image restoration. CNN training requires
good training data: many pairs of speckle-free / speckle-corrupted images. This
is an issue in SAR applications, given the inherent scarcity of speckle-free
images. To handle this problem, this paper analyzes different strategies one
can adopt, depending on the speckle removal task one wishes to perform and the
availability of multitemporal stacks of SAR data. The first strategy applies a
CNN model, trained to remove additive white Gaussian noise from natural images,
to a recently proposed SAR speckle removal framework: MuLoG (MUlti-channel
LOgarithm with Gaussian denoising). No training on SAR images is performed, the
network is readily applied to speckle reduction tasks. The second strategy
considers a novel approach to construct a reliable dataset of speckle-free SAR
images necessary to train a CNN model. Finally, a hybrid approach is also
analyzed: the CNN used to remove additive white Gaussian noise is trained on
speckle-free SAR images. The proposed methods are compared to other
state-of-the-art speckle removal filters, to evaluate the quality of denoising
and to discuss the pros and cons of the different strategies. Along with the
paper, we make available the weights of the trained network to allow its usage
by other researchers.

However, this standard setting might be suboptimal for training classifiers and
also requires huge computational overhead when deployed in practice. To address
these issues, we propose a new framework for action recognition in videos,
called {\em Dynamic Sampling Networks} (DSN), by designing a dynamic sampling
module to improve the discriminative power of learned clip-level classifiers
and as well increase the inference efficiency during testing. Specifically, DSN
is composed of a sampling module and a classification module, whose objective
is to learn a sampling policy to on-the-fly select which clips to keep and
train a clip-level classifier to perform action recognition based on these
selected clips, respectively. In particular, given an input video, we train an
observation network in an associative reinforcement learning setting to
maximize the rewards of the selected clips with a correct prediction. We
perform extensive experiments to study different aspects of the DSN framework
on four action recognition datasets: UCF101, HMDB51, THUMOS14, and ActivityNet
v1.3. The experimental results demonstrate that DSN is able to greatly improve
the inference efficiency by only using less than half of the clips, which can
still obtain a slightly better or comparable recognition accuracy to the
state-of-the-art approaches.

regime of strong QCD. The experimental program within Hall~B at Jefferson
Laboratory based on data acquired with the CLAS spectrometer using electron and
photon beams with energies up to 6~GeV has already considerably extended the
scope of research in hadron physics in joint efforts between experiment and
phenomenological data analysis. Impressive progress in relating the hadron
structure observables inferred from the data to the strong QCD mechanisms
underlying hadron mass generation has been achieved in the past decade. These
results will be considerably extended with data from the experimental program
with the new CLAS12 spectrometer that has begun data taking using electron
beams with energies up to 11~GeV. With this extended kinematic reach the
structure of nucleon resonances will be probed at the highest photon
virtualities ever achieved in the studies of exclusive electroproduction, which
will allow for the exploration of the distance scale where $>$98\% of light
hadron mass emerges from QCD in the transition of the strong interaction from
the regime of quark-gluon confinement to perturbative QCD.

Fabric Image Representation Encoding Network (FIRENet), a universal

implicitly learnt to best suit the target dataset(s). For diverse-scale feature
extraction, a 3D extension of atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP3D) is used

In the first experiment, FIRENet performed 3D universal bone segmentation of
multiple musculoskeletal datasets of the human knee, shoulder and hip joints

When tested for transfer learning, FIRENet further exhibited excellent single

insights into the action mechanism of caffeine, we report on its effects on the
phase behaviour and microscopic dynamics of a dioctadecyldimethylammonium
bromide (DODAB) lipid membrane, as studied quasielastic neutron scattering
(QENS). Tracking the elastic scattering intensity as a function of temperature
showed that caffeine does not alter the phase behaviour of the DODAB membrane
and that transition temperatures remain almost unaltered. However, QENS
measurements revealed caffeine significantly modulates the microscopic dynamics
of the lipids in the system, and that the effects depend on the structural
arrangement of the lipids in the membrane. In the coagel phase, caffeine acts
as a plasticizing agent which enhances the membrane dynamics. However, in the
fluid phase the opposite effect is observed; caffeine behaves like a stiffening
agent, restricting the lipid dynamics. Further analysis of the QENS data
indicates that in the fluid phase, caffeine restricts both lateral and internal
motions of the lipids in the membrane. The present study illustrates how
caffeine regulates the fluidity of the membrane by modulating the dynamics of
constituent lipids depending on the physical state of the bilayer.

intervention strategies. We consider local and non-local modes of disease
transmission. The first simulates transmission through social contacts in the
vicinity of the place of residence while the second through social contacts in
public places: schools, hospitals, airports, etc., where many people meet, who
live in remote geographic locations. Epidemic spreading is modeled as a
discrete-time stochastic process on random geometric networks. We use the
Monte-Carlo method in the simulations. The~following assumptions are made. The
basic reproduction number is 2.5 and the infectious period lasts approximately
ten days. Infections lead to SARS in about one percent of cases, which are
likely to lead to respiratory default and death, unless the patient receives an
appropriate medical treatment. The~healthcare system capacity is simulated by
the availability of respiratory ventilators or intensive care beds. Some
parameters of the model, like mortality rates or the number of respiratory
ventilators per 100000 inhabitants, are chosen to simulate the real values for
the USA and Poland. In the simulations we compare `do-nothing' strategy with
mitigation strategies based on social distancing and reducing social mixing. We
study epidemics in the pre-vaccine era, where immunity is obtained only by
infection. The model applies only to epidemics for which reinfections are rare
and can be neglected. The results of the simulations show that strategies that
slow the development of an epidemic too much in the early stages do not
significantly reduce the overall number of deaths in the long term, but

We design a novel 3D LSC segmentation encoder-decoder network, which introduces

addition operation applied on positional embeddings and word embeddings brings
mixed correlations between the two heterogeneous information resources. It may
bring unnecessary randomness in the attention and further limit the
expressiveness of the model. Second, we question whether treating the position
of the symbol \texttt{[CLS]} the same as other words is a reasonable design,
considering its special role (the representation of the entire sentence) in the
downstream tasks. Motivated from above analysis, we propose a new positional
encoding method called \textbf{T}ransformer with \textbf{U}ntied

TUPE computes the word contextual correlation and positional correlation
separately with different parameterizations and then adds them together. This
design removes the mixed and noisy correlations over heterogeneous embeddings
and offers more expressiveness by using different projection matrices.
Furthermore, TUPE unties the \texttt{[CLS]} symbol from other positions, making
it easier to capture information from all positions. Extensive experiments and
ablation studies on GLUE benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Codes and models are released at

driving cars operate in unstable environments with sensor noise and incomplete
data, it is desirable for object detectors to take the localization uncertainty
into account. However, there are several limitations of the existing
uncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model
the uncertainty of the heterogeneous object properties with different
characteristics and scales, such as location (center point) and scale (width,
height), which could be difficult to estimate. 2) They model box offsets as
Gaussian distributions, which is not compatible with the ground truth bounding
boxes that follow the Dirac delta distribution. 3) Since anchor-based methods
are sensitive to anchor hyper-parameters, their localization uncertainty could
also be highly sensitive to the choice of hyper-parameters. To tackle these
limitations, we propose a new localization uncertainty estimation method called
UAD for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures the uncertainty in
four directions of box offsets (left, right, top, bottom) that are homogeneous,
so that it can tell which direction is uncertain, and provide a quantitative
value of uncertainty in [0, 1]. To enable such uncertainty estimation, we
design a new uncertainty loss, negative power log-likelihood loss, to measure
the localization uncertainty by weighting the likelihood loss by its IoU, which
alleviates the model misspecification problem. Furthermore, we propose an
uncertainty-aware focal loss for reflecting the estimated uncertainty to the
classification score. Experimental results on COCO datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly improves FCOS, by up to 1.8 points, without
sacrificing computational efficiency.

design, encode the area law which governs the scaling of entanglement entropy
in quantum systems with short range interactions but are hindered by the high
computational complexity scaling with bond dimension (D). GFMC is a highly
efficient method, but it usually suffers from the infamous negative sign
problem which can be avoided by the fixed node approximation in which a guiding
wave function is utilized to modify the sampling process. The trade-off for the
absence of negative sign problem is the introduction of systematic error by
guiding wave function. In this work, we combine these two methods, PEPS and
GFMC, to take advantage of both of them. PEPS are very accurate variational
wave functions, while at the same time, only contractions of single-layer
tensor network are necessary in GFMC, which reduces the cost substantially.
Moreover, energy obtained in GFMC is guaranteed to be variational and lower
than the variational energy of the guiding PEPS wave function. Benchmark
results of $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on square lattice are provided.

with model dynamics driven by an attachment function $f:\mathbb{Z}_+\to
\mathbb{R}_+$. At each stage a new vertex enters the system and connects to a
vertex $v$ in the current tree with probability proportional to
$f(\text{degree}(v))$. The main goal of this study is to understand the
performance of root finding algorithms. A large body of work (e.g. the work of
Bubeck, Devroye and Lugosi or Jog and Loh) has emerged in the last few years in
using techniques based on the Jordan centrality measure and its variants to
develop root finding algorithms. Given an unlabelled unrooted tree, one
computes the Jordan centrality for each vertex in the tree and for a fixed
budget $K$ outputs the optimal $K$ vertices (as measured by Jordan centrality).
Under general conditions on the attachment function $f$, we derive necessary
and sufficient bounds on the budget $K(\epsilon)$ in order to recover the root
with probability at least $1-\epsilon$. For canonical examples such as linear
preferential attachment and uniform attachment, these general results give
matching upper and lower bounds for the budget. We also prove persistence of
the optimal $K$ Jordan centers for any $K$, i.e. the existence of an almost
surely finite random time $n^*$ such that for $n \geq n^*$ the identity of the
$K$-optimal Jordan centers in $\{\mathcal{T}_f(n):n\geq n^*\}$ does not change,
thus describing robustness properties of this measure. Key technical
ingredients in the proofs of independent interest include sufficient conditions
for the existence of exponential moments for limits of (appropriately
normalized) continuous time branching processes within which the models
$\{\mathcal{T}_f(n):n\geq n^*\}$ can be embedded, as well as rates of
convergence results to these limits.

capability of analogy, we propose analogical image translation (AIT). Given
images of two styles in the source domain: $\mathcal{A}$ and
$\mathcal{A}^\prime$, along with images $\mathcal{B}$ of the first style in the
target domain, learn a model to translate $\mathcal{B}$ to $\mathcal{B}^\prime$

::\mathcal{B}:\mathcal{B}^\prime$. AIT is especially useful for translation
scenarios in which training data of one style is hard to obtain but training
data of the same two styles in another domain is available. For instance, in
the case from normal conditions to extreme, rare conditions, obtaining real
training images for the latter case is challenging but obtaining synthetic data
for both cases is relatively easy. In this work, we are interested in adding
adverse weather effects, more specifically fog effects, to images taken in
clear weather. To circumvent the challenge of collecting real foggy images, AIT
learns with synthetic clear-weather images, synthetic foggy images and real
clear-weather images to add fog effects onto real clear-weather images without
seeing any real foggy images during training. AIT achieves this zero-shot image
translation capability by coupling a supervised training scheme in the
synthetic domain, a cycle consistency strategy in the real domain, an
adversarial training scheme between the two domains, and a novel network
design. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method for zero-short image

originating from quantum spacetime at the Planck scale. Dark energy drives
inflation and reheating by reducing its value for massive particle-antiparticle
pairs production and oscillation, resulting in a holographic and massive pair
plasma state. The back-and-forth reaction of dark energy and massive pairs
slows inflation to its end and starts reheating by rapidly producing stable and
unstable pairs. We introduce the Boltzmann-type rate equation describing the
back-and-forth reaction. It forms a close set with Friedman equations and
reheating equations for unstable pairs decay to relativistic particles. The
numerical solutions show preheating, massive pairs dominated and genuine
reheating episodes. We obtain the reheating temperature and entropy in terms of
the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0 < r < 0.047$ consistently with observations.
Stable massive pairs represent cold dark matter particles and weakly interact

\Gamma_N \propto \Gamma(r/\lambda)^{2(N-1)} (\Gamma is the radiative decay rate
of an individual atom, r and \lambda are the system size and the wavelength of
the radiation, respectively), i.e., considerably smaller than in any of the

sufficient to ensure the minimum of the spontaneous decay rate of the

estimated by computer simulation using two separate state-of-the-art web-based

addressed are these: 1. Can mask use by the general population limit the spread
of SARS-CoV-2 in a country? 2. What types of masks exist, and how elaborate
must a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be
applied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some
possible future research questions regarding masks and SARS-CoV-2. Results are
as follows: (1) The results indicate that any type of mask, even simple
home-made ones, may be effective. Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering
new patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed ""one-mask
protection"") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be
critical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to > 50% was found to be
advantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of
intensive care. As the default parameters of the software included another
intervention, it seems possible to combine mask and other interventions. (2)
Masks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late
stage in an epidemic. However, early implementation helps reduce the cumulative
and total number of cases. (3) The simulations suggest that it might be
possible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a
limited period. The results from these simulations are encouraging, but do not
necessarily represent the real-life situation, so it is suggested that clinical
trials of masks are now carried out while continuously monitoring effects and
side-effects.

analyses show that methyl carbamate is more stable isomer than glycine. Because
of this, there could be a higher chance for methyl carbamte to exist in the
interstellar medium as compared to glycine. Despite immense searches, till now
glycine has not been detected in the ISM, therefore it is worthwhile to search
its isomer methyl carbamate. In this paper, we present the constraints of
methyl carbamate formation under the interstellar conditions. Large complex
organic molecules are favorably produced in hot-corino environments of low mass
protostars. We for the first time carried out astrochemical modeling focusing
on the formation of methyl carbamate in physical conditions similar to
hot-corino objects. Consequently, we examined ALMA archival data for existing
spectral line observations toward hot corinos NGC1333 IRAS 4A2 and IRAS 16293B.
Within the common spectral range towards these sources, we found three features
are possibly related to the spectral transitions of methyl carbamate and
consequently estimate the upper limit of column densities. Results of chemical
modeling are consistent with the observational upper limit of estimated column
density/abundance toward the sources. This may hint the validation of the
proposed formation mechanism. Future observations using telescope like ngVLA
may confirm the presence of MC toward the hot corinos.

One is the set of linearly independent generally covariant scalar-tensor
monomials, the other is the set of linearly independent spatially covariant
gravity monomials. We argue that these two types of linear space are isomorphic
to each other in the sense of gauge fixing/recovering procedures. We then
identify the subspaces in the spatially covariant gravity, which are spanned by
linearly independent monomials built of the extrinsic and intrinsic curvature,
the lapse function as well as their spatial derivatives, up to the fourth order
in the total number of derivatives. The vectors in these subspaces, i.e.,
spatially covariant polynomials, automatically propagate at most three degrees
of freedom. As a result, their images under the gauge recovering mappings are
automatically the subspaces of scalar-tensor theory that propagate up to three
degrees of freedom as long as the scalar field is timelike. The mappings from
the spaces of spatially covariant gravity to the spaces of scalar-tensor theory
are encoded in the projection matrices, of which we also derived the
expressions explicitly. Our formalism and results can be useful in deriving the
generally covariant higher derivative scalar-tensor theory without ghost(s).

to substantial shrinkage towards a poorly estimated regression surface. In this
paper, we introduce a new class of robust, empirically-driven regression
weights that target estimation of the small domain means under potential
misspecification of the global regression model. Our regression weights are a
convex combination of the model-based weights associated with the best linear
unbiased predictor (BLUP) and those associated with the observed best predictor
(OBP). The compromise parameter in this convex combination is found by
minimizing a novel, unbiased estimate of the mean-squared prediction error for
the small domain means, and we label the associated small domain estimates the
""compromise best predictor"", or CBP. Using a data-adaptive mixture for the
regression weights enables the CBP to possess the robustness of the OBP while
retaining the main advantages of the EBLUP whenever the regression model is
correct. We demonstrate the use of the CBP in an application estimating gait

a Banach algebra $A$ and a Banach $A$-bimodule $B$, we investigate the
vanishing of the first Hochschild cohomology groups $H^1(A^n,B^m)$ and
$H_{w^*}^1(A^n,B^m)$, where $0\leq m,n\leq 3$. For amenable Banach algebra $A$,
we show that there are Banach $A$-bimodules $C$, $D$ and elements
$\mathfrak{a}, \mathfrak{b}\in A^{**}$ such that
$$Z^1(A,C^*)=\{R_{D^{\prime\prime}(\mathfrak{a})}:~D\in
Z^1(A,C^*)\}=\{L_{D^{\prime\prime}(\mathfrak{b})}:~D\in Z^1(A,D^*)\}.$$ where,
for every $b\in B$, $L_{b}(a)=ba$ and $R_{b}(a)=a b,$ for every $a\in A$.
Moreover, under a condition, we show that if the second transpose of a
continuous derivation from the Banach algebra $A$ into $A^*$ i.e., a continuous
linear map from $A^{**}$ into $A^{***}$, is a derivation, then $A$ is Arens
regular. Finally, we show that if $A$ is a dual left strongly irregular Banach
algebra such that its second dual is amenable, then $A$ is reflexive.

networks with user cooperation. Novel coded caching schemes are proposed for
both centralized and decentralized caching settings, by efficiently exploiting
time and cache resources and creating parallel data delivery at the server and
users. We derive a lower bound on the transmission delay and show that the
proposed centralized coded caching scheme is \emph{order-optimal} in the sense
that it achieves a constant multiplicative gap within the lower bound. Our
decentralized coded caching scheme is also order-optimal when each user's cache
size is larger than the threshold $N(1-\sqrt[{K-1}]{ {1}/{(K+1)}})$
(approaching 0 as $K\to \infty$), where $K$ is the total number of users and
$N$ is the size of file library. Moreover, for both the centralized and
decentralized caching settings, our schemes obtain an additional
\emph{cooperation gain} offered by user cooperation and an additional
\emph{parallel gain} offered by the parallel transmission among the server and
users. It is shown that in order to reduce the transmission delay, the number
of users parallelly sending signals should be appropriately chosen according to
user's cache size, and alway letting more users parallelly send information
could cause high transmission delay.

artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS),
and support vector machine (SVM), to predict monthly groundwater level (GWL),
evaluate uncertainty analysis of predictions and spatial variation analysis.
The six schemes, including grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), cat swarm
optimization (CSO), weed algorithm (WA), genetic algorithm (GA), krill
algorithm (KA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), were used to hybridize
for improving the performance of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS models. Groundwater level
(GWL) data of Ardebil plain (Iran) for a period of 144 months were selected to
evaluate the hybrid models. The pre-processing technique of principal component
analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce input combinations from monthly time
series up to 12-month prediction intervals. The results showed that the
ANFIS-GOA was superior to the other hybrid models for predicting GWL in the
first piezometer and third piezometer in the testing stage. The performance of
hybrid models with optimization algorithms was far better than that of
classical ANN, ANFIS, and SVM models without hybridization. The percent of
improvements in the ANFIS-GOA versus standalone ANFIS in piezometer 10 were
14.4%, 3%, 17.8%, and 181% for RMSE, MAE, NSE, and PBIAS in the training stage
and 40.7%, 55%, 25%, and 132% in testing stage, respectively. The improvements
for piezometer 6 in train step were 15%, 4%, 13%, and 208% and in the test step
were 33%, 44.6%, 16.3%, and 173%, respectively, that clearly confirm the
superiority of developed hybridization schemes in GWL modeling. Uncertainty
analysis showed that ANFIS-GOA and SVM had, respectively, the best and worst
performances among other models. In general, GOA enhanced the accuracy of the
ANFIS, ANN, and SVM models.

coarse to fine digital image inference. It not only provides the classes of the
image objects, but also provides the location of the image objects which have

segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects belonging

systems. Among all the energy storage technologies, battery systems may provide
flexibility to the power grid in a more distributed and decentralized way. In
countries with deregulated electricity markets, grid-connected battery systems
should be operated under the specific market design of the country. In this
work, using the Spanish electricity market as an example, the barriers to
grid-connected battery systems are investigated using utilization analysis. The
concept of ""potentially profitable utilization time"" is proposed and introduced
to identify and evaluate future potential grid applications for battery
systems. The numerical and empirical analysis suggests that the high cycle cost
for battery systems is still the main barrier for grid-connected battery
systems. In Spain, for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market, it is
required that the battery wear cost decreases to 15 Euro/MWh to make the
potentially profitable utilization rate higher than 20%. Nevertheless, the
potentially profitable utilization of batteries is much higher in the
applications when higher flexibility is demanded. The minimum required battery
wear cost corresponding to 20% potentially profitable utilization time
increases to 35 Euro/MWh for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market and
ancillary services, and 50 Euro/MWh for upward secondary reserve. The results
of this study contribute to the awareness of battery storage technology and its
flexibility in grid applications. The findings also have significant
implications for policy makers and market operators interested in promoting
grid-connected battery storage under a deregulated power market.

running the CNN training on single CPU/GPU. However it is known that using
ensembles of classifiers increases the performance. Also, the training times

Ensemble learning has been used in the past for traditional methods to a
varying extent and is a hot topic. With the advent of deep learning, ensemble
learning has been applied to the former as well. However, an area which is
unexplored and has potential is One-Versus-All (OVA) deep ensemble learning. In
this paper we explore it and show that by using OVA ensembles of deep networks,
improvements in performance of deep networks can be obtained. As shown in this
paper, the classification capability of deep networks can be further increased
by using an ensemble of binary classification (OVA) deep networks. We implement
a novel technique for the case of digit image recognition and test and evaluate
it on the same. In the proposed approach, a single OVA deep network classifier
is dedicated to each category. Subsequently, OVA deep network ensembles have

travel industry. In many practical situations, the only available information
is the flight search query performed by the customer with no additional profile
knowledge. In general, customer flight bookings are driven by prices, duration,
number of connections, and so on. However, not all customers might assign the
same importance to each of those criteria. Here comes the need of grouping
together all flight searches performed by the same kind of customer, that is
having the same booking criteria. The effectiveness of some set of
recommendations, for a single cluster, can be measured in terms of the number
of bookings historically performed. This effectiveness measure plays the role
of a feedback, that is an external knowledge which can be recombined to
iteratively obtain a final segmentation. In this paper, we describe our Online
Travel Agencies (OTA) flight search use case and highlight its specific
features. We address the flight search segmentation problem motivated above by
proposing a novel algorithm called Split-or-Merge (S/M). This algorithm is a
variation of the Split-Merge-Evolve (SME) method. The SME method has already
been introduced in the community as an iterative process updating a clustering
given by the K-means algorithm by splitting and merging clusters subject to
feedback independent evaluations. No previous application of the SME method to
the real-word data is reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.
Here, we provide experimental evaluations over real-world data to the SME and
the S/M methods. The impact on our domain-specific metrics obtained under the
SME and the S/M methods suggests that feedback clustering techniques can be
very promising in the handling of the domain of OTA flight searches.

of the data is collected from the implicit feedbacks of users. This causes two
difficulties in designing effective algorithms: first, the majority of users
only have a few interactions with the system and there is no enough data for
learning; second, there are no negative samples in the implicit feedbacks and
it is a common practice to perform negative sampling to generate negative
samples. However, this leads to a consequence that many potential positive
samples are mislabeled as negative ones and data sparsity would exacerbate the
mislabeling problem. To solve these difficulties, we regard the problem of
recommendation on sparse implicit feedbacks as a semi-supervised learning task,
and explore domain adaption to solve it. We transfer the knowledge learned from
dense data to sparse data and we focus on the most challenging case -- there is
no user or item overlap. In this extreme case, aligning embeddings of two
datasets directly is rather sub-optimal since the two latent spaces encode very
different information. As such, we adopt domain-invariant textual features as
the anchor points to align the latent spaces. To align the embeddings, we
extract the textual features for each user and item and feed them into a domain
classifier with the embeddings of users and items. The embeddings are trained
to puzzle the classifier and textual features are fixed as anchor points. By
domain adaptation, the distribution pattern in the source domain is transferred
to the target domain. As the target part can be supervised by domain
adaptation, we abandon negative sampling in target dataset to avoid label
noise. We adopt three pairs of real-world datasets to validate the
effectiveness of our transfer strategy. Results show that our models outperform
existing models significantly.

easy to collect and generally applicable. However, predicting users' preference
on implicit feedback data is a challenging task since we can only observe
positive (voted) samples and unvoted samples. It is difficult to distinguish
between the negative samples and unlabeled positive samples from the unvoted
ones. Existing works, such as Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), sample
unvoted items as negative samples uniformly, therefore suffer from a critical
noisy-label issue. To address this gap, we design an adaptive sampler based on
noisy-label robust learning for implicit feedback data.
  To formulate the issue, we first introduce Bayesian Point-wise Optimization
(BPO) to learn a model, e.g., Matrix Factorization (MF), by maximum likelihood
estimation. We predict users' preferences with the model and learn it by
maximizing likelihood of observed data labels, i.e., a user prefers her
positive samples and has no interests in her unvoted samples. However, in
reality, a user may have interests in some of her unvoted samples, which are
indeed positive samples mislabeled as negative ones. We then consider the risk
of these noisy labels, and propose a Noisy-label Robust BPO (NBPO). NBPO also
maximizes the observation likelihood while connects users' preference and
observed labels by the likelihood of label flipping based on the Bayes'
theorem. In NBPO, a user prefers her true positive samples and shows no
interests in her true negative samples, hence the optimization quality is
dramatically improved. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets
show the significant improvement of our proposed optimization methods.
