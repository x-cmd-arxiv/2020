as sensor systems and mobile phones. Accelerating nonlinear mapping will
directly speed up online systems. Previously the authors of this paper proposed
a Dendrite Net (DD) with enormously lower time complexity than the existing
nonlinear mapping algorithms; however, there still are redundant calculations
in DD. This paper presents a DD with an acceleration module (AC) to accelerate
nonlinear mapping further. We conduct three experiments to verify whether DD
with AC has lower time complexity while retaining DD's nonlinear mapping
properties and system identification properties: The first experiment is the
precision and identification of unary nonlinear mapping, reflecting the
calculation performance using DD with AC for basic functions in online systems.
The second experiment is the mapping precision and identification of the
multi-input nonlinear system, reflecting the performance for designing online
systems via DD with AC. Finally, this paper compares the time complexity of DD
and DD with AC and analyzes the theoretical reasons through repeated
experiments. Results: DD with AC retains DD's excellent mapping and
identification properties and has lower time complexity. Significance: DD with
AC can be used for most engineering systems, such as sensor systems, and will
speed up computation in these online systems. The code of DD with AC is

  Predictions vs. Flood Insurance Maps",,,,,"econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prior literature has argued that flood insurance maps may not capture the
extent of flood risk. This paper performs a granular assessment of coastal
flood risk in the mortgage market by using physical simulations of hurricane
storm surge heights instead of using FEMA's flood insurance maps. Matching
neighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests
that coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm
surge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when
using flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of
originations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The
share of agency mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in
the flood insurance 100-year floodplain. Mortgages in storm surge areas are
more likely to be complex: non-fully amortizing features such as interest-only
or adjustable rates. Households may also be more vulnerable in storm surge
areas: median household income is lower, the share of African Americans and
Hispanics is substantially higher, the share of individuals with health
coverage is lower. Price-to-rent ratios are declining in storm surge areas
while they are increasing in flood insurance areas. This paper suggests that
uncovering future financial flood risk requires scientific models that are
independent of the flood insurance mapping process.

range of magnetic field profiles to high accuracy over large interior volumes,
and simulate them in real-world shields whose passive components have finite

be adapted to design active--passive magnetic field shaping systems that
accurately generate any physical user-specified static magnetic field in the
interior of a closed cylindrical shield of any length, enabling the development

(NIWs) in the ocean, and the NIW is believed to solve the puzzle of mesoscale
energy budget by absorbing energy from mesoscale eddies followed by a forward
cascade of NIW energy which finally dissipates at the ocean interior. This work
studies the turbulent energy transfer in the NIW--quasigeostrophic mean
mesoscale eddy coupled system based on a previously derived two-dimensional
model which has a Hamiltonian structure and inherits conserved quantities in
the Boussinesq equations (Xie \& Vanneste, \textit{J. Fluid Mech.}, vol. 774,
2015, pp. 147--169). Based on the conservation of energy, potential enstrophy
and wave action, we propose a heuristic argument predicting the existence of
phase transition with changing the relative strength between NIW and mean flow.
By running forced-dissipative numerical simulations with varying parameter $R$,
the ratio of the magnitude of NIW and mean-flow forcing, we justify the
existence of phase transition, which is found to be second-order, around
critical value $R_c$. When $0<R<R_c$, energy transfers bidirectionally, wave
action transfers downscale, and vorticity form strong cyclones. While when
$R>R_c$, energy transfers downscale, wave action transfers bidirectionally, and
vortex filaments are dominant. We find the catalytic wave induction (CWI)
mechanism where the NIW induces a downscale energy flux of the mean flow. The
CWI mechanism differs from the stimulated loss of balance by the absence of
energy conversion from the mesoscale eddy to NIW, and it is found to be
effective in the toy-model study, making it potentially important for ocean
energetics.

However, there is a lack of statistical tools available for combining multiple

  Here, to facilitate inference on the relationship between multiple
metabolomic biomarkers and food intake in an intervention study conducted under

proposed. The proposed model draws on factor analytic and mixture of experts
models, describing intake as a continuous latent variable whose value gives
raise to the observed biomarker values. We employ a mixture of Gaussian
distributions to flexibly model the latent variable. A Bayesian hierarchical
modelling framework provides flexibility to adapt to different biomarker
distributions and facilitates prediction of the latent intake along with its

and both the robot hand and the environment. By trading off hand contacts for
environmental contacts, a shared grasp requires fewer contacts with the hand,
and enables manipulation even when a full grasp is not possible. Previous
research has used shared grasps for non-prehensile manipulation such as
pivoting and tumbling. This paper treats the problem more generally, with
methods to select the best shared grasp and robot actions for a desired object
motion. The central issue is to evaluate the feasible contact modes: for each
contact, whether that contact will remain active, and whether slip will occur.
Robustness is important. When a contact mode fails, e.g., when a contact is
lost, or when unintentional slip occurs, the operation will fail, and in some
cases damage may occur. In this work, we enumerate all feasible contact modes,
calculate corresponding controls, and select the most robust candidate. We can
also optimize the contact geometry for robustness. This paper employs
quasi-static analysis of planar rigid bodies with Coulomb friction to derive
the algorithms and controls. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of shared
grasping and the use of our methods in representative experiments and examples.

linear multi-arm bandit problems. While conceptually and computationally
simple, this method highly relies on the confidence bounds, failing to strike
the optimal exploration-exploitation if these bounds are not properly set. In
the literature, confidence bounds are typically derived from concentration
inequalities based on assumptions on the reward distribution, e.g.,
sub-Gaussianity. The validity of these assumptions however is unknown in
practice. In this work, we aim at learning the confidence bound in a
data-driven fashion, making it adaptive to the actual problem structure.
Specifically, noting that existing UCB-typed algorithms are not differentiable
with respect to confidence bound, we first propose a novel differentiable
linear bandit algorithm. Then, we introduce a gradient estimator, which allows
the confidence bound to be learned via gradient ascent. Theoretically, we show
that the proposed algorithm achieves a
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\hat{\beta}\sqrt{dT})$ upper bound of $T$-round regret,
where $d$ is the dimension of arm features and $\hat{\beta}$ is the learned
size of confidence bound. Empirical results show that $\hat{\beta}$ is
significantly smaller than its theoretical upper bound and proposed algorithms
outperforms baseline ones on both simulated and real-world datasets.

we propose a distance loss, which can be applied on the Siamese network
fine-tuning, by optimizing the model based on the relevant distance between

pre-train the weights of proposed Siamese neural network, which are fine-tuned

speech, since it is one of the most ubiquitous and frequently used
bio-behavioral signals. Our target data comes from the RAVDESS dataset, while
the CREMA-D and eNTERFACE'05 are used as source data, respectively. Our results
indicate that the proposed distance loss is able to greatly benefit the
fine-tuning process of Siamese network. Also, the selection of source data has
more effect on the Siamese network performance compared to the number of frozen

modelling pairwise differences in the field of transfer learning for automatic

methods that have identified specific candidates and pressure-temperature (P-T)
conditions for synthesis. These theoretical advances have prompted improvements
in experimental techniques to test these predictions. As a result, experimental
studies of simple binary hydrides under pressure have yielded high critical
superconducting transition temperatures (Tc), of 260 K in LaH10, close to the
commonly accepted threshold for room temperature, 293 K, at pressures near 180
GPa. We successfully synthesized a metallic La-based superhydride from La metal
and ammonia borane, NH3BH3, and find a multi-step transition with a Tc of 294 K
for the highest onset. When subjected to subsequent thermal excursions to
higher temperatures that promoted a chemical reaction to what we believe is a
ternary or higher order system, the transition temperature was driven to higher
temperatures. Although the reaction does not appear to be complete, the onset
temperature was pushed from 294 K to 556 K before the experiments had to be
terminated. The results provide evidence for hot superconductivity well above
room temperature, in line with recent predictions for a higher order hydride
under pressure.

full-star models have been carried out in the anelastic approximation using
spectral methods. Although it makes long time steps possible, this approach
excludes the physics of sound waves completely and rather high artificial
viscosity and thermal diffusivity are needed for numerical stability. Direct
comparison with observations is thus limited. Aims. We explore the capabilities
of our compressible multidimensional hydrodynamics code SLH to simulate stellar
oscillations. Methods. We compare some fundamental properties of internal
gravity and pressure waves in 2D SLH simulations to linear wave theory using
two test cases: (1) an interval gravity wave packet in the Boussinesq limit and
(2) a realistic $3\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with a convective core and a
radiative envelope. Oscillation properties of the stellar model are also
discussed in the context of observations. Results. Our tests show that
specialized low-Mach techniques are necessary when simulating oscillations in
stellar interiors. Basic properties of internal gravity and pressure waves in
our simulations are in good agreement with linear wave theory. As compared to
anelastic simulations of the same stellar model, we can follow internal gravity
waves of much lower frequencies. The temporal frequency spectra of velocity and
temperature are flat and compatible with observed spectra of massive stars.
Conclusion. The low-Mach compressible approach to hydrodynamical simulations of
stellar oscillations is promising. Our simulations are less dissipative and
require less luminosity boosting than comparable spectral simulations. The
fully-compressible approach allows the coupling of gravity and pressure waves
to be studied too.

detection of IGWs across a large number of O and early-B stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and explain the ubiquitous detection of stochastic
variability in the photospheres of massive stars. Methods. We combined
high-precision time-series photometry from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite with high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy of 70 stars with
spectral types O and B to probe the relationship between the photometric
signatures of IGWs and parameters such as spectroscopic mass, luminosity, and
macroturbulence. Results. A relationship is found between the location of a
star in the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the amplitudes and
frequencies of stochastic photometric variability in the light curves of
massive stars. Furthermore, the properties of the stochastic variability are
statistically correlated with macroturbulent velocity broadening in the
spectral lines of massive stars. Conclusions. The common ensemble morphology
for the stochastic low-frequency variability detected in space photometry and
its relationship to macroturbulence is strong evidence for IGWs in massive
stars, since these types of waves are unique in providing the dominant
tangential velocity field required to explain the observed spectroscopy.

microscopic dynamics of individual financial entities and the macroscopic
dynamics of the market as a whole. This elusive, mesoscopic level of
organisation is often sought for via factor models that ultimately decompose
the market according to geographic regions and economic industries. However, at
a more general level the presence of mesoscopic structure might be revealed in
an entirely data-driven approach, looking for a modular and possibly
hierarchical organisation of the empirical correlation matrix between financial
time series. The crucial ingredient in such an approach is the definition of an
appropriate null model for the correlation matrix. Recent research showed that
community detection techniques developed for networks become intrinsically
biased when applied to correlation matrices. For this reason, a method based on
Random Matrix Theory has been developed, which identifies the optimal
hierarchical decomposition of the system into internally correlated and
mutually anti-correlated communities. Building upon this technique, here we
resolve the mesoscopic structure of the CDS market and identify groups of
issuers that cannot be traced back to standard industry/region taxonomies,
thereby being inaccessible to standard factor models. We use this decomposition
to introduce a novel default risk model that is shown to outperform more
traditional alternatives.

real-world auctions are necessarily discrete. In this paper, we use a
combination of analytical and computational methods to investigate whether
incorporating discreteness substantially changes the predictions of auction
theory, focusing on the case of uniformly distributed valuations so that our
results bear on the majority of auction experiments. In some cases, we find
that introducing discreteness changes little. For example, the first-price
auction with two bidders and an even number of values has a symmetric

its continuous counterpart as the discretisation goes to zero. In others,

arbitrarily small amount of discreteness into the all-pay auction makes its

geological, and biological systems. The idea of self-organized criticality
(SOC), introduced back in 1987 by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld suggests that, under
certain circumstances, natural systems can seemingly self-tune to a critical
state with its concomitant power-laws and scaling. Theoretical progress allowed
for a rationalization of how SOC works by relating its critical properties to
those of a standard non-equilibrium second-order phase transition that
separates an active state in which dynamical activity reverberates
indefinitely, from an absorbing or quiescent state where activity eventually
ceases. Here, we briefly review these ideas as well as a recent closely-related
concept: self-organized bistability (SOB). In SOB, the very same type of
feedback operates in a system characterized by a discontinuos phase transition,
which has no critical point but instead presents bistability between active and
quiescent states. SOB also leads to scale-invariant avalanches of activity but,
in this case, with a different type of scaling and coexisting with anomalously
large outbursts. Moreover, SOB explains experiments with real sandpiles more
closely than SOC. We review similarities and differences between SOC and SOB by
presenting and analyzing them under a common theoretical framework, covering
recent results as well as possible future developments. We also discuss other
related concepts for ""imperfect"" self-organization such as ""self-organized
quasi-criticality"" and ""self-organized collective oscillations"", of relevance
in e.g. neuroscience, with the aim of providing an overview of feedback

outliers relative to the subset of instances assigned to the same class. The
proposed procedure is non-parametric and requires no specific distributional

different classes. The test is shown to simultaneously control the Type I and
Type II error probabilities whilst also controlling the overall error
probability of the repeated testing invoked in the validation procedure of
initial class labeling. The theoretical results are supplemented with results
from an extensive numerical study, simulating a typical setup for labeling
validation in proteomics work-flow applications. These results illustrate the

The latter condition defines a legged-ring geometry (Kitaev tie) lacking of
translational invariance. In order to study the topological properties of the
system, we generalize the transfer matrix approach through which the emergence
of Majorana modes is studied. We find that geometric frustration gives rise to
a topological phase diagram in which non-trivial phases alternate with trivial
ones at varying the range of the extra hopping and the chemical potential.
Frustration effects are also studied in a translational invariant model
consisting of multiple-ties. In the latter system, the translational invariance
permits to use the topological bulk invariant to determine the phase diagram
and bulk-edge correspondence is recovered. It has been demonstrated that
geometric frustration effects persist even when translational invariance is
restored. These findings are relevant in studying the topological phases of

neutrinos via radio (Askaryan) emission from particle showers when a neutrino
interacts with ice, which is an efficient method for neutrinos with energies
between 10^16 eV and 10^20 eV. The ARIANNA radio detectors are located in
Antarctic ice just beneath the surface. Neutrino observation requires that
radio pulses propagate to the antennas at the surface with minimum distortion
by the ice and firn medium. Using the residual hole from the South Pole Ice
Core Project, radio pulses were emitted from a transmitter located up to 1.7 km
below the snow surface. By measuring these signals with an ARIANNA surface
station, the angular and polarization reconstruction abilities are quantified,
which are required to measure the direction of the neutrino. After deconvolving
the raw signals for the detector response and attenuation from propagation
through the ice, the signal pulses show no significant distortion and agree
with a reference measurement of the emitter made in an anechoic chamber.
Furthermore, the signal pulses reveal no significant birefringence for our
tested geometry of mostly vertical ice propagation. The origin of the
transmitted radio pulse was measured with an angular resolution of 0.37 degrees
indicating that the neutrino direction can be determined with good precision if
the polarization of the radio-pulse can be well determined. In the present
study we obtained a resolution of the polarization vector of 2.7 degrees.

blowup equations that fix these elliptic genera to large extent. The latter

algorithm that, given an efficiently preparable state, computes expectation
values in a finite energy interval around its mean energy. This algorithm is
based on a filtering operator, similar to quantum phase estimation, which
projects out energies outside the desired energy interval. However, instead of
performing this operation on a physical state, it recovers the physical values
by performing interferometric measurements without the need to prepare the
filtered state. We show that the computational time scales polynomially with
the number of qubits, the inverse of the prescribed variance, and the inverse
error. In practice, the algorithm does not require the evolution for long
times, but instead a significant number of measurements in order to obtain
sensible results. Our second algorithm is a quantum-assisted Monte Carlo
sampling method to compute other quantities which approach the expectation
values for the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Using classical Monte
Carlo techniques and the quantum computer as a resource, this method
circumvents the sign problem that is plaguing classical Quantum Monte Carlo
simulations, as long as one can prepare states with suitable energies. All
algorithms can be used with small quantum computers and analog quantum

nuclear breakup region (spectator tagging) represents a unique method for
extracting the neutron spin structure functions and studying nuclear
modifications. The tagged proton momentum controls the nuclear configuration
during the DIS process and enables a differential analysis of nuclear effects.
Such measurements could be performed with the future electron-ion collider
(EIC) and forward proton detectors if deuteron beam polarization could be
achieved.
  Purpose: Develop theoretical framework for polarized deuteron DIS with
spectator tagging. Formulate procedures for neutron spin structure extraction.
  Methods: A covariant spin density matrix formalism is used to describe
general deuteron polarization in collider experiments (vector/tensor,
pure/mixed). Light-front (LF) quantum mechanics is employed to factorize
nuclear and nucleonic structure in the DIS process. A 4-dimensional
representation of LF spin structure is used to construct the polarized deuteron
LF wave function and efficiently evaluate the spin sums. Free neutron structure
is extracted using the impulse approximation and analyticity in the tagged
proton momentum (pole extrapolation).
  Results: General expressions of the polarized tagged DIS observables in
collider experiments. Analytic and numerical study of the polarized deuteron LF
spectral function and nucleon momentum distributions. Practical procedures for
neutron spin structure extraction from the tagged deuteron spin asymmetries.
  Conclusions: Spectator tagging provides new tools for precise neutron spin
structure measurements. D-wave depolarization and nuclear binding effects can
be eliminated through the tagged proton momentum dependence. The methods can be
extended to tensor-polarized observables, spin-orbit effects, and diffractive
processes.

at most on the order of $\frac{1}{\mu_{\min}(1-\gamma)^5\varepsilon^2}+
\frac{t_{mix}}{\mu_{\min}(1-\gamma)}$ up to some logarithmic factor, provided

matches the sample complexity in the synchronous case with independent samples
drawn from the stationary distribution of the trajectory. The second term
reflects the cost taken for the empirical distribution of the Markovian
trajectory to reach a steady state, which is incurred at the very beginning and
becomes amortized as the algorithm runs. Encouragingly, the above bound
improves upon the state-of-the-art result \cite{qu2020finite} by a factor of at

Such tuning of redundancy requires ""code conversion"", i.e., a change in code

conversion is the number of nodes accessed during conversion.
  Existing literature has characterized the access cost of conversion of linear

forward modeling with a bulge, a turbulent rotating disk, and a dark matter

light effective radii and inclinations, and DM masses from abundance matching
scaling relations. Two-thirds or more of the z>1.2 SFGs are baryon dominated
within a few Re of typically 5.5 kpc, and have DM fractions less than maximal
disks (<fDM (Re)>=0.12). At lower redshift (z<1.2) that fraction is less than
one-third. DM fractions correlate inversely with the baryonic angular momentum
parameter, baryonic surface density and bulge mass. Inferred low DM fractions
cannot apply to the entire disk & halo but more plausibly reflect a flattened,

these cores relative to NFW distributions is ~30% of the bulge mass. The
observations are consistent with rapid radial transport of baryons in the first
generation massive gas rich halos forming globally gravitationally unstable

drive DM out of the initial cusps.

and DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant in applications where
privacy can be traded for communication efficiency. We introduce and
investigate the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy
leakage budgets in each direction. For user privacy leakage, we bound the
probability ratios between all possible realizations of DB queries by a
function of a non-negative constant $\epsilon$. For DB privacy, we bound the
mutual information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the

general AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal download cost

of AL-PIR is upper-bounded as $D^{*}(\epsilon,\delta)\leq

The four month-long imaging campaign with the 2 m telescope at the Mount

derived a small mean equivalent radius of about 600 m for the nucleus with an

determined from the geometric appearance of coma structures, which were
enhanced in the images. A long-lasting coma fan was produced by an extended
region at high latitudes on the slowly rotating nucleus, whereas isolated jets
originated from narrow, low latitude active regions on the nucleus. The dust
activity of 41P, despite being difficult to quantify exactly because of an
unknown phase function correction for the comet, indicates a steep radial
profile that falls off with an increasing distance from the Sun. Colors and
flux profiles provide evidence for dust fragmentation in the inner coma of the
comet. A singular outburst event created various dust structures in the coma.
The outburst came from an extended region on the nucleus and was due to either
a landslide on the nucleus or a sudden material release from a subsurface

and the 26Al bubbles they produce form along spiral arms, but, because our
simulation produces material arms that arise spontaneously rather than
propagating arms forced by an external potential, star formation occurs at arm
centres rather than leading edges. As a result, we find a scale height and
rotation speed for 26Al similar to that of the cold ISM. However, we also show
that a synthetic 26Al emission map produced for a possible Solar position at
the edge of a large 26Al bubble recovers many of the major qualitative features
of the observed 26Al sky. This suggests that the observed anomalous 26Al

semi-analytic galaxy formation model, not only do we account for the driving
the evolution of binaries at separations $\lesssim 1$ pc (gas-driven migration,
stellar hardening and triple/quadruple massive black hole systems), but we also
improve on previous studies by accounting for the time spent by black hole
pairs from kpc down to pc separation. We also include the effect of supernova
feedback, which may eject gas from the nuclear region of low-mass galaxies,
thus hampering the growth of black holes via accretion and suppressing their
orbital migration in circumbinary disks. Despite including these novel physical
effects, we predict that the LISA detection rate should still be $\gtrsim 2
\mbox{yr}^{-1}$, irrespective of the model for the black hole seeds at high
redshifts. Scenarios where black holes form from $\sim100 M_\odot$ seeds are
more significantly impacted by supernova feedback. We also find that for

indications of OVI absorption accompanied by little to no detectable NV
absorption. This unusual spectral signature, accompanied by highly non-uniform
absorption from lower ionization state species, indicates that the CGM must be
viewed as a dynamic, multiphase medium, such as occurs in the presence of
turbulence. Motivated by previous isotropic turbulent simulations, we carry out
chemodynamical simulations of stratified media in a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
gravitational potential with a total mass of $10^{12}$ solar masses and
turbulence that decreases radially. The simulations assume a metallicity of 0.3
solar, a redshift zero metagalatic UV background, and they track ionizations,
recombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling using the MAIHEM
package. We compare a suite of ionic column densities with the COS-Halos sample
of low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Turbulence with an average
one-dimensional velocity dispersion approximately 40 km/s, corresponding to an
energy injection rate of approximately $10^{49}$ erg/yr, produces a CGM that
matches many of the observed ionic column densities and ratios. In this
simulation, the NVI to OVI ratio is suppressed from its equilibrium value due
to a combination of radiative cooling and cooling from turbulent mixing. This
level of turbulence is consistent with expectations from observations of better
constrained, higher-mass systems, and could be sustained by energy input from
supernovae, gas inflows, and dynamical friction from dark matter subhalos. We
also conduct a higher resolution run which yields smaller-scale structures, but

calibrated to a high precision. Ironically, the accuracy of the measurement
calibration is fundamentally limited by the accuracy of state preparation,
establishing a vicious cycle. Here, we prove that this cycle can be broken and
the fundamental dependence on the measurement devices significantly relaxed. We
show that exploiting the natural low-rank structure of quantum states of
interest suffices to arrive at a highly scalable blind tomography scheme with a
classically efficient post-processing algorithm. We further improve the
efficiency of our scheme by making use of the sparse structure of the
calibrations. This is achieved by relaxing the blind quantum tomography problem
to the task of de-mixing a sparse sum of low-rank quantum states. Building on
techniques from model-based compressed sensing, we prove that the proposed
algorithm recovers a low-rank quantum state and the calibration provided that
the measurement model exhibits a restricted isometry property. For generic
measurements, we show that our algorithm requires a close-to-optimal number

CO(2-1) observations with ALMA of four low-redshift ($z \sim 0.06$), luminous
($\sim 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) quasars with each matched to a different
star-forming galaxy, having similar redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation
rate. We detected CO(2-1) emission from all quasars, which show diverse
morphologies. Contrary to expectations, $\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ of the quasar
sample, computed from the CO(2-1) luminosity, tends to be smaller than the
comparison sample at $r < 500$ pc; there is no systematic enhancement of
$\Sigma_{\rm mol}$ in our quasars. We discuss four possible scenarios that
would explain the lower molecular gas content (or CO(2-1) luminosity as an
actual observable) at the CND-scale of quasars, i.e., AGN-driven outflows,
gas-rich minor mergers, time-delay between the onsets of a starburst-phase and
a quasar-phase, and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) effects on the gas chemical
abundance and excitation. While not extensively discussed in the literature,
XDR effects can have an impact on molecular mass measurements particularly in
the vicinity of luminous quasar nuclei; therefore higher resolution molecular
gas observations, which are now viable using ALMA, need to be considered.

crucial input parameter into evolutionary models of that system. Here we apply
a purely analytical formalism to estimate lifetimes of the debris phase of
these discs, before they are ground down into dust or are subject to
sublimation from the white dwarf. We compute maximum lifetimes for three
different types of white dwarf discs, formed from (i) radiative YORP breakup of
exo-asteroids along the giant branch phases at 2-100 au, (ii) radiation-less
spin-up disruption of these minor planets at $\sim 1.5-4.5R_{\odot}$, and (iii)
tidal disruption of minor or major planets within about $1.3R_{\odot}$. We
display these maximum lifetimes as a function of disc mass and extent,
constituent planetesimal properties, and representative orbital excitations of
eccentricity and inclination. We find that YORP discs with masses up to
$10^{24}$ kg live long enough to provide a reservoir of surviving cm-sized
pebbles and m- to km-sized boulders that can be perturbed intact to white
dwarfs with cooling ages of up to 10 Gyr. Debris discs formed from the spin or
tidal disruption of these minor planets or major planets can survive in a
steady state for up to respectively 1 Myr or 0.01 Myr, although most tidal
discs would leave a steady state within about 1 yr. Our results illustrate that
dust-less planetesimal transit detections are plausible, and would provide
particularly robust evolutionary constraints. Our formalism can easily be
adapted to individual systems and future discoveries.

September 2017. During the decay of its discovery outburst, and before
returning to quiescence, the source underwent at least four reflaring events,
with peak luminosities of $\sim$10$^{35-36}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (d/4.1 kpc)$^2$. To
investigate the nature of these flares, we analysed a sample of NICER
observations taken with almost daily cadence. In this work we present the
detailed spectral and timing analysis of the evolution of the four reflares.
The higher sensitivity of NICER at lower energies, in comparison with other
X-ray detectors, allowed us to constrain the disc component of the spectrum at
$\sim$0.5 keV. We found that during each reflare the source appears to trace
out a q-shaped track in the hardness-intensity diagram similar to those
observed in black hole binaries during full outbursts. MAXI J1535-571 transits
between the hard state (valleys) and softer states (peaks) during these flares.
Moreover, the Comptonised component is undetected at the peak of the first
reflare, while the disc component is undetected during the valleys. Assuming
the most likely distance of 4.1 kpc, we find that the hard-to-soft transitions
take place at the lowest luminosities ever observed in a black hole transient,
while the soft-to-hard transitions occur at some of the lowest luminosities
ever reported for such systems.

cooling prescription that mimics a real disc which is only gravitationally
unstable in the outer regions. We do this by modelling the cooling using a
simplified method such that the cooling time in the outer parts of the disc is
shorter than in the inner regions, as expected in real discs. We find that both
giant (> M_Sat) and low mass (< M_Nep) planets initially migrate inwards very
rapidly, but are able to slow down in the inner gravitationally stable regions
of the disc without needing to open up a gap. This is in contrast to previous
studies where the cooling was modelled in a more simplified manner where
regardless of mass, the planets were unable to slow down their inward
migration. This shows the important effect the thermodynamics has on planet
migration. In a broader context, these results show that planets that form in
the early stages of the discs' evolution, when they are still quite massive and

instability at relativistic magnetized shocks have been recently invoked to
explain the coherent radio emission of Fast Radio Bursts. By means of
two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, we explore the properties of the
precursor waves in relativistic electron-positron perpendicular shocks as a
function of the pre-shock magnetization $\sigma\gtrsim 1$ (i.e., the ratio of
incoming Poynting flux to particle energy flux) and thermal spread $\Delta
\gamma \equiv kT/mc^2=10^{-5}-10^{-1}$. We measure the fraction $f_\xi$ of
total incoming energy that is converted into precursor waves, as computed in
the post-shock frame. At fixed magnetization, we find that $f_{\xi}$ is nearly
independent of temperature as long as $\Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5}$ (with
only a modest decrease of a factor of three from $\Delta\gamma =10^{-5}$ to
$\Delta\gamma =10^{-1.5}$), but it drops by nearly two orders of magnitude for
$\Delta \gamma \gtrsim 10^{-1}$. At fixed temperature, the scaling with
magnetization $f_\xi\sim 10^{-3}\,\sigma^{-1}$ is consistent with our earlier
one-dimensional results. For our reference $\sigma=1$, the power spectrum of
precursor waves is relatively broad (fractional width $\sim 1-3$) for cold
temperatures, whereas it shows pronounced line-like features with fractional
width $\sim 0.2$ for $10^{-3} \lesssim \Delta \gamma \lesssim 10^{-1.5} $. For
$\sigma\gtrsim 1$, the precursor waves are beamed within an angle $\simeq
\sigma^{-1/2}$ from the shock normal (as measured in the post-shock frame), as
required so they can outrun the shock. Our results can provide
physically-grounded inputs for FRB emission models based on maser emission from

a bistable reaction term. These RDEs have traveling wave solutions. When the
speed of the wave is nonzero, block constructions have been used to prove the
existence or nonexistence of nontrivial stationary distributions. Here, we
follow the approach in a paper by Etheridge, Freeman, and Pennington to show
that in a wide variety of examples when the RDE limit has a bistable reaction
term and traveling waves have speed 0, one can run time faster and further
rescale space to obtain convergence to motion by mean curvature. This opens up
the possibility of proving that the sexual reproduction model with fast
stirring has a discontinuous phase transition, and that in Region 2 of the
phase diagram for the nonlinear voter model studied by Molofsky et al there
were two nontrivial stationary distributions.

the cloud-free, thermal radiative flux from the Earth to outer space. Over 1/3
million lines having strengths as low as $10^{-27}$ cm of the HITRAN database
were used to evaluate the dependence of the forcing on the gas concentrations.
For a hypothetical, optically thin atmosphere, where there is negligible
saturation of the absorption bands, or interference of one type of greenhouse
gas with others, the per-molecule forcings are of order $10^{-22}$ W for
H$_2$O, CO$_2$, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$. For current atmospheric
concentrations, the per-molecule forcings of the abundant greenhouse gases
H$_2$O and CO$_2$ are suppressed by four orders of magnitude. The forcings of
the less abundant greenhouse gases, O$_3$, N$_2$O and CH$_4$, are also
suppressed, but much less so. For current concentrations, the per-molecule
forcings are two to three orders of magnitude greater for O$_3$, N$_2$O and
CH$_4$, than those of H$_2$O or CO$_2$. Doubling the current concentrations of
CO$_2$, N$_2$O or CH$_4$ increases the forcings by a few per cent. These
forcing results are close to previously published values even though the
calculations did not utilize either a CO$_2$ or H$_2$O continuum. The change in
surface temperature due to CO$_2$ doubling is estimated taking into account
radiative-convective equilibrium of the atmosphere as well as water feedback
for the cases of fixed absolute and relative humidities as well as the effect
of using a pseudoadiabatic lapse rate to model the troposphere temperature.

The system aims at helping composers to find a good balance between the
determinism of the compositions and the nondeterminism of the interactions with
the public. Each execution of a Skini score yields to a different but
aesthetically consistent interpretation. This work raises many questions in the
musical fields. How to combine composition and interaction? How to control the
musical style when the audience influences what is to play next? What are the
possible connections with generative music? These are important questions for
the Skini system but they are out of the scope of this paper that focuses
exclusively on the computer science aspects of the system. From that
perspective, the main questions are how to program the scores and in which
language? General purpose languages are inappropriate because their elementary
constructs (i.e., variables, functions, loops, etc.) do not match the
constructions needed to express music and musical constraints. We show that
synchronous programming languages are a much better fit because they rely on
temporal constructs that can be directly used to represent musical scores and
because their malleability enables composers to experiment easily with artistic
variations of their initial scores. The paper mostly focuses on scores
programming. It exposes the process a composer should follow from his very
first musical intuitions up to the generation of a musical artifact. The paper
presents some excerpts of the programming of a classical music composition that
it then precisely relates to an actual recording. Examples of techno music and
jazz are also presented, with audio artifact, to demonstrate the versatility of
the system. Finally, brief presentations of past live concerts are presented as
an evidence of viability of the system.

effective drugs and vaccines gave rise to a wide variety of strategies employed
to fight this worldwide pandemic. Many of these strategies rely on the
repositioning of existing drugs that could shorten the time and reduce the cost

network-based algorithm for drug repositioning, called SAveRUNNER (Searching

quantifying the interplay between the drug targets and the disease-specific
proteins in the human interactome via a novel network-based similarity measure
that prioritizes associations between drugs and diseases locating in the same
network neighborhoods. Specifically, we applied SAveRUNNER on a panel of 14
selected diseases with a consolidated knowledge about their disease-causing
genes and that have been found to be related to COVID-19 for genetic
similarity, comorbidity, or for their association to drugs tentatively
repurposed to treat COVID-19. Focusing specifically on SARS subnetwork, we
identified 282 repurposable drugs, including some the most rumored off-label
drugs for COVID-19 treatments, as well as a new combination therapy of 5 drugs,
actually used in clinical practice. Furthermore, to maximize the efficiency of
putative downstream validation experiments, we prioritized 24 potential
anti-SARS-CoV repurposable drugs based on their network-based similarity
values. These top-ranked drugs include ACE-inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies,
and thrombin inhibitors. Finally, our findings were in-silico validated by
performing a gene set enrichment analysis, which confirmed that most of the
network-predicted repurposable drugs may have a potential treatment effect
against human coronavirus infections.

out-of-the-ecliptic mission for observing the Sun and the heliosphere. The
mission profile is largely based on the Solar Polar Imager concept: initially
spiraling in to a 0.48 AU ecliptic orbit, then increasing the orbital
inclination at a rate of $\sim 10$ degrees per year, ultimately reaching a
heliographic inclination of $>$75 degrees. The orbital profile is achieved
using solar sails derived from the technology currently being developed for the
Solar Cruiser mission, currently under development.
  HISM remote sensing instruments comprise an imaging spectropolarimeter
(Doppler imager / magnetograph) and a visible light coronagraph. The in-situ
instruments include a Faraday cup, an ion composition spectrometer, and
magnetometers. Plasma wave measurements are made with electrical antennas and
high speed magnetometers.
  The $7,000\,\mathrm{m}^2$ sail used in the mission assessment is a direct
extension of the 4-quadrant $1,666\,\mathrm{m}^2$ Solar Cruiser design and
employs the same type of high strength composite boom, deployment mechanism,
and membrane technology. The sail system modelled is spun (~1 rpm) to assure
required boom characteristics with margin. The spacecraft bus features a
fine-pointing 3-axis stabilized instrument platform that allows full science
observations as soon as the spacecraft reaches a solar distance of 0.48 AU.

elongated, and fast rotating body. In contrast to the other dwarf planets, its
size, shape, albedo, and density are not well constrained. Here we report
results of a multi-chord stellar occultation, observed on 2017 January 21.
Secondary events observed around the main body are consistent with the presence
of a ring of opacity 0.5, width 70 km, and radius 2,287$_{-45}^{+75}$ km. The
Centaur Chariklo was the first body other than a giant planet to show a ring
system and the Centaur Chiron was later found to possess something similar to
Chariklo's rings. Haumea is the first body outside the Centaur population with
a ring. The ring is coplanar with both Haumea's equator and the orbit of its
satellite Hi'iaka. Its radius places close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance
with Haumea's spin period. The occultation by the main body provides an
instantaneous elliptical limb with axes 1,704 $\pm$ 4 km x 1,138 $\pm$ 26 km.
Combined with rotational light-curves, it constrains Haumea's 3D orientation
and its triaxial shape, which is inconsistent with a homogeneous body in
hydrostatic equilibrium. Haumea's largest axis is at least 2,322 $\pm$ 60 km,
larger than thought before. This implies an upper limit of 1,885 $\pm$ 80 kg
m$^{-3}$ for Haumea's density, smaller and less puzzling than previous
estimations, and a geometric albedo of 0.51 $\pm$ 0.02, also smaller than
previous estimations. No global N$_2$ or CH$_4$ atmosphere with pressures
larger than 15 and 50 nbar (3-$\sigma$ limits), respectively, is detected.

solar neutrinos via elastic electron scattering. We find that DARWIN will have
the potential to measure the fluxes of five solar neutrino components: $pp$,
$^7$Be, $^{13}$N, $^{15}$O and $pep$. The precision of the $^{13}$N, $^{15}$O
and $pep$ components is hindered by the double-beta decay of $^{136}$Xe and,
thus, would benefit from a depleted target. A high-statistics observation of
$pp$ neutrinos would allow us to infer the values of the weak mixing angle,
$\sin^2\theta_w$, and the electron-type neutrino survival probability, $P_e$,
in the electron recoil energy region from a few keV up to 200 keV for the first
time, with relative precision of 5% and 4%, respectively, at an exposure of 300
ty. An observation of $pp$ and $^7$Be neutrinos would constrain the
neutrino-inferred solar luminosity down to 0.2%. A combination of all flux
measurements would distinguish between the high (GS98) and low metallicity
(AGS09) solar models with 2.1-2.5$\sigma$ significance, independent of external
measurements from other experiments or a measurement of $^8$B neutrinos through
coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering in DARWIN. Finally, we demonstrate
that with a depleted target DARWIN may be sensitive to the neutrino capture
process of $^{131}$Xe.

  Study on Model-Free Control of Markovian Jump Systems","Accepted to L4DC 2020",,,,"math.OC cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Markovian jump linear systems (MJLS) are an important class of dynamical
systems that arise in many control applications. In this paper, we introduce
the problem of controlling unknown (discrete-time) MJLS as a new benchmark for
policy-based reinforcement learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with
mixed continuous/discrete state variables. Compared with the traditional linear
quadratic regulator (LQR), our proposed problem leads to a special hybrid MDP
(with mixed continuous and discrete variables) and poses significant new
challenges due to the appearance of an underlying Markov jump parameter
governing the mode of the system dynamics. Specifically, the state of a MJLS
does not form a Markov chain and hence one cannot study the MJLS control
problem as a MDP with solely continuous state variable. However, one can
augment the state and the jump parameter to obtain a MDP with a mixed
continuous/discrete state space. We discuss how control theory sheds light on
the policy parameterization of such hybrid MDPs. Then we modify the widely used
natural policy gradient method to directly learn the optimal state feedback
control policy for MJLS without identifying either the system dynamics or the
transition probability of the switching parameter. We implement the
(data-driven) natural policy gradient method on different MJLS examples. Our
simulation results suggest that the natural gradient method can efficiently
learn the optimal controller for MJLS with unknown dynamics.

draw from the enormous body of social computing research that studies
individual behavior. Our work bridges this divide by testing whether two
influential social mechanisms used to explain community joining can also
explain the distribution of community sizes. Using agent-based simulations, we
evaluate how well individual-level processes of social exposure and decisions
based on individual expected benefits reproduce empirical community size data
from Reddit. Our simulations contribute to social computing theory by providing
evidence that both processes together---but neither alone---generate realistic
distributions of community sizes. Our results also illustrate the potential

Tau, double-ring disk GO Tau, and multiple-ring disk DL Tau, the same rings are
detected at both wavelengths, with radial locations spanning from 50 to
120\,au. To quantify the dust emission morphology, the observed visibilities
are modeled with a parametric prescription for the radial intensity profile.
The disk outer radii, taken as 95\% of the total flux encircled in the model
intensity profiles, are consistent at both wavelengths for the three disks.
Dust evolution models show that dust trapping in local pressure maxima in the
outer disk could explain the observed patterns. Dust rings are mostly
unresolved. The marginally resolved ring in DS Tau shows a tentatively narrower
ring at the longer wavelength, an observational feature expected from efficient
dust trapping. The spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm mm}$) increases outward and
exhibits local minima that correspond to the peaks of dust rings, indicative of
the changes in grain properties across the disks. The low optical depths
($\tau\sim$0.1--0.2 at 2.9\,mm and 0.2--0.4 at 1.3\,mm) in the dust rings
suggest that grains in the rings may have grown to millimeter sizes. The

a characteristic orientation, and hence can be regarded as an oriented
particle. Theories predict that the trajectories of annihilating defects depend
on their relative orientation. Recently, these predictions have been tested in
experiments on smectic-C films. Those experiments find curved trajectories that
are similar to the predictions, but the detailed relationship between the
defect orientations and the far-field director is different. To understand this
difference, we extend the previous theories by adding the effects of elastic
anisotropy, and find that it significantly changes the curved trajectories.

nucleation on its surface, both nonisothermal and isothermal, are derived in
the framework of Kolmogorov method adapted for this problem. Characteristic
parameters governing the transformation kinetics are determined; the latter is
studied with particular emphasis on the Avrami exponent temporal behavior. It
is shown that the surface-nucleated transformation qualitatively differs from
the bulk-nucleated one at large values of the characteristic parameters due to
the one-dimensional radial growth of the new phase occurring after the complete
transformation of the surface itself at the early stage of the process. This
effect also manifests itself in the considered ensemble of size-distributed
particles and in the grain-boundary nucleated transformations. The logarithmic
normal distribution inherent for the particles obtained by grinding is employed
for numerical calculations and shown to stretch temporally the volume-fraction
and Avrami-exponent dependences for the ensemble of identical particles. A new
model for grain-boundary nucleated transformations alternative to the Cahn
model of random planes is offered; it is based on the ensemble of
size-distributed spherical particles with the possibility for a growing nucleus
to cross grain boundaries. The kinetics of this process is shown to be governed
by the same characteristic parameter, as for a single particle, and
qualitatively differs from the Cahn-model one. In particular, the logarithmic
volume-fraction plot at large values of the governing parameter ends by a
characteristic bend observed on experimental curves for the crystallization of
bulk metallic glasses. This peculiarity together with the form of the plot as a
whole directly indicates to the grain (polycluster) structure of metallic
glasses and nucleation at intercluster boundaries.

energy and modified gravity theories. In particular, galaxy clustering and
gravitational lensing convergence are probes sensitive to modifications of
general relativity. While the standard analysis for these surveys typically
includes power spectra or 2-point correlation functions, it is known that the
bispectrum contains more information, and could offer improved constraints on
parameters when combined with the power spectra. However, the use of bispectra
has been limited so far to one single probe, e.g. the lensing convergence
bispectrum or the galaxy bispectrum. In this paper, we extend the formalism to
explore the power of cross-bispectra between different probes, and exploit
their ability to break parameter degeneracies and improve constraints. We study
this on a test case of lensing convergence and galaxy density auto- and
cross-bispectra, for a particular sub-class of Horndeski theories parametrized
by $c_M$ and $c_B$. Using the 2000 deg$^2$ notional survey of the Nancy Grace
Roman Space Telescope with overlapping photometry from the Rubin Observatory
Legacy Survey of Space and Time, we find that a joint power spectra and
bispectra analysis with three redshift bins at $l_{\rm max} = 1000$ yields
$\sigma_{c_M} = 1.0$ and $\sigma_{c_B} = 0.3$, both a factor of $\sim$1.2
better than the power spectra results; this would be further improved to
$\sigma_{c_M} = 0.7$ and $\sigma_{c_B} = 0.2$ if $l_{\rm max} = 3000$ is taken.
Furthermore, we find that using all possible cross-bispectra between the two
probes in different tomographic bins improves upon auto-bispectra results by a
factor of 1.3 in $\sigma_{c_M}$, 1.1 in $\sigma_{c_B}$ and 1.3 in
$\sigma_{\Omega_m}$. We expect that similar benefits of using cross-bispectra
between probes could apply to other science cases and surveys.

the time needed to switch off mobility and bring the net reproduction number
below the critical threshold of 1 is about one week. Moreover, we observe a
strong relationship between the number of days spent above such threshold
before the lockdown-induced drop in mobility flows and the total number of
infections per 100k inhabitants. Estimating the statistical effect of mobility
flows on the net reproduction number over time, we document a 2-week lag
positive association, strong in March and April, and weaker but still
significant in June. Our study demonstrates the value of big mobility data to

and prevent the spread of the disease, all individuals should be well-informed
of the rapidly changing state of COVID-19. To accomplish this objective, I have
built a website to analyze and deliver the latest state of the disease and
relevant analytical insights. The website is designed to cater to the general
audience, and it aims to communicate insights through various straightforward
and concise data visualizations that are supported by sound statistical
methods, accurate data modeling, state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, and reliable data sources. This paper discusses the major
methodologies which are utilized to generate the insights displayed on the
website, which include an automatic data ingestion pipeline, normalization
techniques, moving average computation, ARIMA time-series forecasting, and
logistic regression models. In addition, the paper highlights key discoveries
that have been derived in regard to COVID-19 using the methodologies.

spontaneous baryogenesis. Here we clarify that this is a generic outcome for
essentially any coupling of an axion-like particle to the Standard Model,
requiring only a non-zero velocity of the classical axion field while baryon or
lepton number violating interactions are present in thermal bath. In
particular, coupling the axions only to gluons is sufficient to generate a
baryon asymmetry in the presence of electroweak sphalerons or the Weinberg
operator. Deriving the transport equation for an arbitrary set of couplings of
the axion-like particle, we provide a general framework in which these results
can be obtained immediately. If all the operators involved are efficient, it
suffices to solve an algebraic equation to obtain the final asymmetries.
Otherwise one needs to solve a simple set of differential equations. This
formalism clarifies some theoretical subtleties such as redundancies in the
axion coupling to the Standard Model particles associated with a field
rotation. We demonstrate how our formalism automatically evades potential
pitfalls in the calculation of the final baryon asymmetry.

dynamics. To this end we introduce an effective Hamiltonian formalism that
describes electronic transitions and small (quantum) nuclear fluctuations along
a classical trajectory of the nuclei. Using this Hamiltonian we derive
equations of motion for the electronic occupation numbers and for the nuclear
coordinates and momenta. We show that in the limit when the number of nuclear
degrees of freedom coupled to a given electronic transition is sufficiently
high (i.e., the strong decoherence limit), the equations of motion for the
electronic occupation numbers become Markovian. Furthermore the transition
rates in these (rate) equations are asymmetric with respect to the
lower-to-higher energy transitions and vice versa. In thermal equilibrium such
asymmetry corresponds to the detailed balance condition. We also study the
equations for the electronic occupations in non-Markovian regime and develop a
surface hopping algorithm based on our formalism. To treat the decoherence
effects we introduce additional ""virtual"" nuclear wavepackets whose
interference with the ""real"" (physical) wavepackets leads to the reduction in
coupling between the electronic states (i.e., decoherence) as well as to the
phase shifts that improve the accuracy of the numerical approach. Remarkably,
the same phase shifts lead to the detailed balance condition in the strong
decoherence limit.

  Education","Proc. of the 16th International CDIO Conference (CDIO'20)",,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a CDIO collaborating member, the School of Mechanical and Electrical
Engineering of Sheridan maintains a curriculum that is deeply rooted in
skills-based learning, experiential learning, and engineering design. To ensure
our graduates are agile and ready for the workforce, we are taking proactive
measures to further improve their learning experiences. An important challenge
still impeding our students knowledge acquisition is the perception that
program courses have disjointed learning outcomes. The course map of programs
is carefully designed in such a way that technical skills acquired in
particular courses gradually build on each other. Despite the traditional
existence of prerequisites and co-requisites, the inaccurate view that courses
function independently persists among students and, occasionally, among faculty
members. One feasible approach to tackle this pedagogical challenge is to
combine various courses into an integrated learning block (ILB) having a
unified mission and objective. At Sheridan's School of MEET, we are applying an
ILB with three engineering courses offered within the same semester for all our
B.Eng. degree programs. The ILB deliverables are based on the design of a
chosen engineering system or subunit in a project-based learning (PBL)
environment. The rationale of this paper is to share our framework for
implementing an ILB in engineering programs and to examine the opportunities
and challenges related to this type of curriculum design. In particular, we
will discuss the methodology by which courses are selected to form an ILB while
taking into account their appropriateness for an industry-driven PBL. This will
be followed up with some of the strategies that are proposed to evaluate the
performance of students in an ILB through formative and summative assessments
based on CDIO competencies.

modeling when the true patient health state is not fully known. Since HMMs
typically have multiple local optima, incorporating additional patient
covariates can improve parameter estimation and predictive performance. To
allow for this, we develop hidden Markov recurrent neural networks (HMRNNs), a
special case of recurrent neural networks that combine neural networks'
flexibility with HMMs' interpretability. The HMRNN can be reduced to a standard
HMM, with an identical likelihood function and parameter interpretations, but
it can also combine an HMM with other predictive neural networks that take
patient information as input. The HMRNN estimates all parameters simultaneously
via gradient descent. Using a dataset of Alzheimer's disease patients, we
demonstrate how the HMRNN can combine an HMM with other predictive neural
networks to improve disease forecasting and to offer a novel clinical
interpretation compared with a standard HMM trained via
expectation-maximization.

Furthermore while much attention has focused on the phenomena of language

the geographical component of language spread on a discrete medium to monitor
the dispersal of language species at a microscopic level. Language dynamics is
modeled through a reaction-diffusion system that occurs on a heterogeneous

that our framework accurately reproduces empirical linguistic trends driven by
a combination of the Turing instability, a mechanism for spontaneous

empirically performs well as a surrogate objective. Typical approaches to
directly optimizing the task loss such as policy gradient and minimum risk

this paper, we develop an alternative method based on random search in the

propose maximum likelihood guided parameter search (MGS), which samples from a
distribution over update directions that is a mixture of random search around
the current parameters and around the maximum likelihood gradient, with each
direction weighted by its improvement in the task loss. MGS shifts sampling to
the parameter space, and scores candidates using losses that are pooled from
multiple sequences. Our experiments show that MGS is capable of optimizing
sequence-level losses, with substantial reductions in repetition and
non-termination in sequence completion, and similar improvements to those of
minimum risk training in machine translation.

absorption of the directional flux of high-energy atmospheric muons produced
during the interaction of cosmic rays with the atmosphere. So this no other
source of radiation is required for this technique. Many muon telescopes are
being built with crossed scintillator bars and so, the resolution of each panel
is essentially given by the total surface of the bar crossings. Enhancing the
resolution may require covering the same area with smaller scintillator bars,
which adds costs and build complexity as more scintillators and fibers are
required. More channels also require more acquisition electronics which have to
be synchronized, increasing the complexity of the system, with associated
operating issues and the final cost. In this work, we propose a novel analysis
approach to obtain a reliable sub-pixel resolution, by measuring and comparing

adding adjustments based on the validation set. We prove the concentration

tidal deformation. Neutron stars, much like any other extended object with
structure, are tidally deformed when under the influence of an external tidal

Concretely, the CRDNN is first trained by computer and then saved in the

the results of a linear stability analysis, we show that if the material
comprising these tails is modeled as adiabatic and the effective adiabatic

variability in the fallback rate, which can manifest as variability in the
lightcurve of the GRB and -- depending on how rapidly the instability operates
-- the prompt emission. The late-time variability induced by the return of

problem where the goal is to optimize the computation task allocation in SSEC
systems while respecting the users' customized privacy settings. It introduces
a novel Game-theoretic Privacy-aware Task Allocation (G-PATA) framework to
achieve the goal. G-PATA includes (i) a bottom-up game-theoretic model to
generate the maximum payoffs at end devices while satisfying the end user's
privacy settings; (ii) a top-down incentive scheme to adjust the rewards for
the tasks to ensure that the task allocation decisions made by end devices meet
the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of the applications. Furthermore, the
framework incorporates an efficient load balancing and iteration reduction
component to adapt to the dynamic changes in status and privacy configurations
of end devices. The G-PATA framework was implemented on a real-world edge

TK1 boards, and Raspberry Pi3). We compare G-PATA with state-of-the-art task
allocation schemes through two real-world social sensing applications. The
results show that G-PATA significantly outperforms existing approaches under
various privacy settings (our scheme achieved as much as 47% improvements in
delay reduction for the application and 15% more payoffs for end devices

adversarial samples: images with imperceptible perturbations, for example, can
fool image classifiers. In this paper, we present the first type-specific
approach to generating adversarial examples for object detection, which entails
detecting bounding boxes around multiple objects present in the image and
classifying them at the same time, making it a harder task than against image
classification. We specifically aim to attack the widely used Faster R-CNN by
changing the predicted label for a particular object in an image: where prior
work has targeted one specific object (a stop sign), we generalise to arbitrary
objects, with the key challenge being the need to change the labels of all
bounding boxes for all instances of that object type. To do so, we propose a
novel method, named Pick-Object-Attack. Pick-Object-Attack successfully adds
perturbations only to bounding boxes for the targeted object, preserving the
labels of other detected objects in the image. In terms of perceptibility, the
perturbations induced by the method are very small. Furthermore, for the first
time, we examine the effect of adversarial attacks on object detection in terms
of a downstream task, image captioning; we show that where a method that can
modify all object types leads to very obvious changes in captions, the changes
from our constrained attack are much less apparent.

Specifically, we consider a qubit bombarded by two-qubit projectiles from a
side. For arbitrary collision times and initial states, we develop the master
equation for sequential and collective collisions. By deriving the
Fokker-Planck equation out of the master equation, we identify the quantum
version of the Rayleigh's heat conduction equation. We find that quantum
discord and entanglement shared between the projectiles can contribute to
genuine heat flow only when they are associated with so-called heat-exchange
coherences. Analogous to Onsager's use of Rayleigh's principle of least
dissipation of energy, we use the entropy production rate to identify the
coherence current. Both coherence and heat flows can be written in the form of
quantum Onsager relations, from which we predict coherent Peltier and coherent
Seebeck effects. The effects can be optimized by the collision times and
collectivity. Finally, we discuss some of the possible experimental
realizations and technological applications of the thermocoherent phenomena in

techniques have unveiled an anomalous peak in the doping dependence of the
London penetration depth which is accompanied by anomalies in the heat capacity
in iron-pnictide superconductors at the optimal composition associated with the
hidden antiferromagnetic quantum critical point. We argue that finite
temperature effects can be a cause of observed features. Specifically we show
that quantum critical magnetic fluctuations under superconducting dome can give
rise to a nodal-like temperature dependence of both specific heat and magnetic
penetration depth in a fully gapped superconductor. In the presence of line
nodes in the superconducting gap fluctuations can lead to the significant
renormalization of the relative slope of $T$-linear penetration depth which is
steepest at the quantum critical point. The results we obtain are general and
can be applied beyond the model we use.

Specifically, we first present the framework of LSTM-based anomaly detection in

structure is modeled through a graph, embedded through a Graph Convolutional
Network, whose states model characteristics of and relations between hands and
objects. These state representations derive from all three levels of
abstraction, and span segments delimited by the making and breaking of
hand-object contact. Short-term dynamics are modeled in two ways: A) through 3D
convolutions, and B) through anticipating the spatiotemporal end points of hand
trajectories, where hands come into contact with objects. Appearance is modeled
through deep spatiotemporal features produced through existing methods. We note
that in Ego-OMG it is simple to swap these appearance features, and thus
Ego-OMG is complementary to most existing action anticipation methods. We
evaluate Ego-OMG on the EPIC Kitchens Action Anticipation Challenge. The
consistency of the egocentric perspective of EPIC Kitchens allows for the
utilization of the hand-centric cues upon which Ego-OMG relies. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, outranking all other previous published methods

Network slicing is a key construct that is used to provide end to end logical

addresses the fundamental issue of trust of a network slice. It presents a

to evaluate the trust of the virtual network functions that compose the network
slice. The proposed model helps to determine the trust of the virtual network
functions as well as the properties that should be satisfied by the virtual

ranked according to different features. However, networks are far from
tree-like structures and the detection of hierarchical ordering remains a
challenge, hindered by the small-world property and the presence of a large
number of cycles, in particular clustering. Here, we use geometric
representations of undirected networks to achieve an enriched interpretation of
hierarchy that integrates features defining popularity of nodes and similarity
between them, such that the more similar a node is to a less popular neighbor
the higher the hierarchical load of the relationship. The geometric approach
allows us to measure the local contribution of nodes and links to the hierarchy
within a unified framework. Additionally, we propose a link filtering method,
the similarity filter, able to extract hierarchical backbones containing the
links that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to the
maximum entropy null model for geometric heterogeneous networks. We applied our
geometric approach to the detection of similarity backbones of real networks in
different domains and found that the backbones preserve local topological
features at all scales. Interestingly, we also found that similarity backbones
favor cooperation in evolutionary dynamics modelling social dilemmas.

Submitted to IEEE Transaction on Smart Grid",,,,"eess.SP cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Smart meters have currently attracted attention because of their high
efficiency and throughput performance. They transmit a massive volume of
continuously collected waveform readings (e.g. monitoring). Although many
compression models are proposed, the unexpected size of these compressed
streams required endless storage and management space which poses a unique
challenge. Therefore, this paper explores the question of can the compressed
smart meter readings be re-compressed? We first investigate the applicability
of re-applying general compression algorithms directly on compressed streams.
The results were poor due to the lack of redundancy. We further propose a novel
technique to enhance the theoretical entropy and exploit that to re-compress.
This is successfully achieved by using unsupervised learning as a similarity
measurement to cluster the compressed streams into subgroups. The streams in
every subgroup have been interleaved, followed by the first derivative to
minimize the values and increase the redundancy. After that, two rotation steps
have been applied to rearrange the readings in a more consecutive format before
applying a developed dynamic run length. Finally, entropy coding is performed.
Both mathematical and empirical experiments proved the significant improvement
of the compressed streams entropy (i.e. almost reduced by half) and the
resultant compression ratio (i.e. up to 50%).

fine-scale by learning dynamic filter weights according to the content of the

recovery when upsampling through the aggregation of information across
different scales. Furthermore, a novel decomposition strategy is proposed to
efficiently construct the 3D filter weights and aggregate the 3D cost volume,
which greatly reduces the computation cost. We first learn the 2D similarities

split the aggregation in a full 3D spatial-disparity space into the aggregation

anti-spoofing models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial
attacks, that are indistinguishable from original data but result in the
incorrect predictions, are dangerous for anti-spoofing models and not in
dispute we should detect them at any cost. To explore this issue, we proposed
to employ Mockingjay, a self-supervised learning based model, to protect
anti-spoofing models against adversarial attacks in the black-box scenario.
Self-supervised learning models are effective in improving downstream task
performance like phone classification or ASR. However, their effect in defense
for adversarial attacks has not been explored yet. In this work, we explore the
robustness of self-supervised learned high-level representations by using them
in the defense against adversarial attacks. A layerwise noise to signal ratio
(LNSR) is proposed to quantize and measure the effectiveness of deep models in
countering adversarial noise. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2019 dataset

design a novel joint hybrid processing framework (JHPF) that allows end-to-end
optimization by using back propagation. The proposed framework includes three
parts: hybrid processing designer, signal flow simulator, and signal
demodulator, which outputs the hybrid processing matrices for the transceiver
by using neural networks (NNs), simulates the signal transmission over the air,
and maps the detected symbols to the original bits by using the NN,
respectively. By minimizing the cross-entropy loss between the recovered and
original bits, the proposed framework optimizes the analog and digital
processing matrices at the transceiver jointly and implicitly instead of
approximating pre-designed label matrices, and its trainability is proved
theoretically. It can be also directly applied to orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing systems by simply modifying the structure of the training data.
Simulation results show the proposed DL-JHPF outperforms the existing hybrid
processing schemes and is robust to the mismatched channel state information
and channel scenarios with the significantly reduced runtime.

To improve robustness, we propose Population-Based Black-Box Optimization

methods. The number of sequences sampled from any method is proportional to the
quality of sequences it previously proposed, allowing P3BO to combine the
strengths of individual methods while hedging against their innate brittleness.
Adapting the hyper-parameters of each of the methods online using evolutionary
optimization further improves performance. Through extensive experiments on

where $\mathsf{P}_0$ is 3-coloring of integers and $\mathsf{P}_1$ is product of
finitely many 2-colorings of integers. We firstly reduce the question to a
lemma which asserts that certain $\Pi^0_1$ class of colorings admit two members
violating a particular combinatorial constraint. Then we took a digression to
see how complex does the class has to be so as to maintain the cross
constraint. We weaken the two members in the lemma in certain way to address an
open question of Cholak, Dzhafarov, Hirschfeldt and Patey, concerning a sort of
Weihrauch degree of stable Ramsey's theorem for pairs. It turns out the
resulted strengthen of the lemma is a basis theorem for $\Pi^0_1$ class with
additional constraint. We look at several such variants of basis theorem, among
them some are unknown. We end up by introducing some results and questions
concerning product of infinitely many colorings.

Rastall gravity. In our approach, the role of dark energy is taken by the
non-conserved sector of the stress energy-momentum tensor. The resultant cosmic
evolution is found to naturally consists of three stages, namely, radiation
dominated, ordinary matter dominated, as well as dark energy and dark matter
dominated eras. Furthermore, for the present model, it is demonstrated that the
eventual fate of the Universe is mostly insensitive to the initial conditions,
in contrast to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, the solution
displays the properties of a dynamic attractor, which is reminiscent of
quintessence and k-essence models. Subsequently, the cosmic coincidence problem
is averted. The amount of deviation from a conserved stress energy-momentum
tensor is shown to be more remarkable during the period when the dark energy
evolves more rapidly. On the other hand, the conservation law is largely
restored for the infinite past and future. The implications of the present
approach are addressed.

applications. However, most existing work focuses on the static transfer
learning setting, and very little is devoted to modeling the time evolving
target domain, such as the online reviews for movies. To bridge this gap, in
this paper, we study a novel continuous transfer learning setting with a time
evolving target domain. One major challenge associated with continuous transfer
learning is the potential occurrence of negative transfer as the target domain
evolves over time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel label-informed
C-divergence between the source and target domains in order to measure the
shift of data distributions as well as to identify potential negative transfer.
We then derive the error bound for the target domain using the empirical
estimate of our proposed C-divergence. Furthermore, we propose a generic
adversarial Variational Auto-encoder framework named TransLATE by minimizing
the classification error and C-divergence of the target domain between
consecutive time stamps in a latent feature space. In addition, we define a
transfer signature for characterizing the negative transfer based on
C-divergence, which indicates that larger C-divergence implies a higher
probability of negative transfer in real scenarios. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our TransLATE
framework.

increasing equivalent width (W Ly{\alpha}). This correlation does not, however,
emerge at z = 3-4, and we use bootstrap simulations to demonstrate that trends
in L B/R should be suppressed by variations in IGM absorption. Our main result
is that the observed blueshifted contribution evolves rapidly downwards with
increasing redshift: L_B/R~30 % at z~0, but drops to 15 % at z~3, and to below
3 % by z~6. Applying further simulations of the IGM absorption to the
unabsorbed COS spectrum, we demonstrate that this decrease in the blue-wing

Ly{\alpha} absorbing systems, with no need for additional H i opacity from
local structure, companion galaxies, or cosmic infall. We discuss our results

token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives,
Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from
the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or

  Limited Visibility, and its Application to Luminous Synchronizer Design",,,,,"cs.DC cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A mobile robot system consists of anonymous mobile robots, each of which
autonomously performs sensing, computation, and movement according to a common
algorithm, so that the robots collectively achieve a given task. There are two
main models of time and activation of the robots. In the semi-synchronous model
(SSYNC), the robots share a common notion of time; at each time unit, a subset
of the robots is activated, and each performs all three actions (sensing,
computation, and movement) in that time unit. In the asynchronous model
(ASYNC), there is no common notion of time, the robots are activated at
arbitrary times, and the duration of each action is arbitrary but finite.
  In this paper, we investigate the problem of synchronizing ASNYC robots with
limited sensing range, i.e., limited visibility. We first present a sufficient
condition for an ASYNC execution of a common algorithm ${\cal A}$ to have a
corresponding SSYNC execution of ${\cal A}$; our condition imposes timing
constraints on the activation schedule of the robots and visibility constraints
during movement. Then, we prove that this condition is necessary (with
probability $1$) under a randomized ASYNC adversary. Finally, we present a
synchronization algorithm for luminous ASYNC robots with limited visibility,
each equipped with a light that can take a constant number of colors. Our
algorithm enables luminous ASYNC robots to simulate any algorithm ${\cal A}$,
designed for the (non-luminous) SSYNC robots and satisfying visibility
constraints.

relied on statistical models that describe the relation between a latent

have been derived to carry out inference at controllable complexity using
recursive computations over the factor graph representing the underlying

(ML) methods. Here we propose a framework that combines model-based algorithms
and data-driven ML tools for stationary time sequences. In the proposed
approach, neural networks are developed to separately learn specific components
of a factor graph describing the distribution of the time sequence, rather than
the complete inference task. By exploiting stationary properties of this
distribution, the resulting approach can be applied to sequences of varying
temporal duration. Learned factor graph can be realized using compact neural
networks that are trainable using small training sets, or alternatively, be
used to improve upon existing deep inference systems. We present an inference
algorithm based on learned stationary factor graphs, which learns to implement
the sum-product scheme from labeled data, and can be applied to sequences of
different lengths. Our experimental results demonstrate the ability of the
proposed learned factor graphs to learn to carry out accurate inference from
small training sets for sleep stage detection using the Sleep-EDF dataset, as
well as for symbol detection in digital communications with unknown channels.

deep learning, improvements in performance have to heavily rely on increasing
model size or capacity to scale to larger and larger datasets, which inevitably
leads to the increase of operations. A high number of operations in deep
leaning increases computational cost and is not suitable for real-time HAR
using mobile and wearable sensors. Though shallow learning techniques often are
lightweight, they could not achieve good performance. Therefore, deep learning
methods that can balance the trade-off between accuracy and computation cost is
highly needed, which to our knowledge has seldom been researched. In this

the RMI when the thickness $L$ is narrower than the wavelength of an interface
modulation $\lambda$. However, if the transition layer becomes broader than
$\lambda$, the perturbed velocity associated with the RMI is reduced
considerably. The suppression condition is interpreted as the cases that the
shock transit time through the transition layer is longer than the sound
crossing time of the modulation wavelength. The fluctuation kinetic energy
decreases as $L^{-p}$ with $p = 2.5$, which indicates that the growth velocity
of the RMI decreases in proportion to $L^{-p/2}$ by the presence of the

labeled data samples collected from end devices or users. Such data samples
often include private information, which the users may not be willing to share.
Federated learning (FL) is an emerging approach to train such learning models
without requiring the users to share their possibly private labeled data. In
FL, each user trains its copy of the learning model locally. The server then
collects the individual updates and aggregates them into a global model. A
major challenge that arises in this method is the need of each user to
efficiently transmit its learned model over the throughput limited uplink
channel. In this work, we tackle this challenge using tools from quantization
theory. In particular, we identify the unique characteristics associated with
conveying trained models over rate-constrained channels, and propose a suitable
quantization scheme for such settings, referred to as universal vector
quantization for FL (UVeQFed). We show that combining universal vector
quantization methods with FL yields a decentralized training system in which
the compression of the trained models induces only a minimum distortion. We
then theoretically analyze the distortion, showing that it vanishes as the
number of users grows. We also characterize the convergence of models trained
with the traditional federated averaging method combined with UVeQFed to the
model which minimizes the loss function. Our numerical results demonstrate the
gains of UVeQFed over previously proposed methods in terms of both distortion
induced in quantization and accuracy of the resulting aggregated model.

developers can solely focus on the application logic of their software, which
is then deployed and completely managed in the cloud. Despite its increasing

achievable on the currently available serverless platforms. Specifically, it is
cumbersome to benchmark such systems in a language- or runtime-independent
manner. Instead, one must resort to a full application deployment, to later
take informed decisions on the most convenient solution along several
dimensions, including performance and economic costs. FaaSdom is a modular
architecture and proof-of-concept implementation of a benchmark suite for
serverless computing platforms. It currently supports the current mainstream
serverless cloud providers (i.e., AWS, Azure, Google, IBM), a large set of
benchmark tests and a variety of implementation languages. The suite fully
automatizes the deployment, execution and clean-up of such tests, providing
insights (including historical) on the performance observed by serverless

The source was in a hard or an intermediate spectral state during this
observation. This is the first time that a detailed spectral analysis of the
persistent emission spectra of XTE J1710-281 has been done up to 30 keV with
improved constraints on its spectral parameters. By simultaneously fitting the
XIS (0.6-9.0 keV) and the HXD-PIN (15.0-30.0 keV) data, we have modelled the
persistent spectrum of the source with models comprising a soft component from
accretion disc and/or neutron star surface/boundary layer and a hard
Comptonizing component. The 0.6-30 keV continuum with neutral absorber can be
described by a multi-colour disc blackbody with an inner disc temperature of
$kT_{\rm disc} = 0.28$ keV, which is significantly Comptonized by the hot
electron cloud with electron temperature of $kT_{\rm e} \approx 5$ keV and
described by photon index $\Gamma = 1.86$. A more complex three-component model
comprising a multi-colour disc blackbody $\approx 0.30$ keV, single temperature
blackbody $\approx 0.65$ keV and Comptonization from the disc, partially
absorbed (about 38 per cent) by an ionized absorber (log($\xi$) $\approx$ 4)

to understand the impact of Galactic environment on the formation and evolution

the fraction of CO in spiral arm and interarm regions is still limited by large
uncertainties in assumed rotation curve models or distance determination
techniques. In this work we use a Bayesian approach to obtain the current best
assessment of the distribution of 13CO from the Galactic Ring Survey. We
performed two different distance estimates that either included or excluded a
model for Galactic features. We also include a prior for the solution of the
kinematic distance ambiguity that was determined from a compilation of
literature distances and an assumed size-linewidth relationship. We find that
the fraction of 13CO emission associated with spiral arm features varies from
76% to 84% between the two distance runs. The vertical distribution of the gas
is concentrated around the Galactic midplane showing FWHM values of ~75 pc. We
do not find any significant difference between gas emission properties
associated with spiral arm and interarm features. In particular the
distribution of velocity dispersion values of gas emission in spurs and spiral
arms is very similar. We detect a trend of higher velocity dispersion values
with increasing heliocentric distance, which we attribute to beam averaging
effects caused by differences in spatial resolution. We argue that the true
distribution of the gas emission is likely more similar to a combination of our
two distance results, and highlight the importance of using complementary
distance estimations to safeguard against the pitfalls of any single approach.
We conclude that the methodology presented in this work is a promising way to
determine distances to gas emission features in Galactic plane surveys.

information entered into it."" This rather trivial statement is the basis behind
one of the driving concepts in biometric recognition: biometric quality.
Quality is nowadays widely regarded as the number one factor responsible for
the good or bad performance of automated biometric systems. It refers to the
ability of a biometric sample to be used for recognition purposes and produce
consistent, accurate, and reliable results. Such a subjective term is
objectively estimated by the so-called biometric quality metrics. These
algorithms play nowadays a pivotal role in the correct functioning of systems,
providing feedback to the users and working as invaluable audit tools. In spite
of their unanimously accepted relevance, some of the most used and deployed
biometric characteristics are lacking behind in the development of these
methods. This is the case of face recognition. After a gentle introduction to
the general topic of biometric quality and a review of past efforts in face
quality metrics, in the present work, we address the need for better face
quality metrics by developing FaceQnet. FaceQnet is a novel open-source face
quality assessment tool, inspired and powered by deep learning technology,
which assigns a scalar quality measure to facial images, as prediction of their
recognition accuracy. Two versions of FaceQnet have been thoroughly evaluated
both in this work and also independently by NIST, showing the soundness of the
approach and its competitiveness with respect to current state-of-the-art
metrics. Even though our work is presented here particularly in the framework
of face biometrics, the proposed methodology for building a fully automated
quality metric can be very useful and easily adapted to other artificial
intelligence tasks.

effective temperature, metallicity) parameters. We aim at unveiling the nature
of the Galactic DCEP V363 Cas and other DCEPs showing cosmic abundances of
lithium in their atmospheres. We have collected three epochs high-resolution
spectroscopy for V363 Cas with HARPS-N@TNG. Accurate stellar parameters:
effective temperatures, gravities, micro-turbulences, radial velocities, and
metal abundances were measured for this star. We detected a lithium abundance
of A(Li)=2.86+-0.10 dex, along with iron, carbon and oxygen abundances of
[Fe/H]=-0.30+-0.12 dex, [C/H]=-0.06+-0.15 dex and [O/H]=0.00+-0.12 dex. V363
Cas is the fifth among the Milky Way DCEPs to exhibit a Li-rich feature. An
analysis of historical time-series spanning a hundred year interval shows that
the period of V363 Cas is increasing, with a sharp acceleration after
HJD=2453000. This is a clear hint of first crossing of the instability strip.
Our results favour the scenario in which the five Galactic Li-rich DCEPs are
first-crossing the instability strip having had slowly-rotating progenitors
during their main sequence phase.

macroscopic description of the plasma. The regularized Kappa-distribution (RKD)
has been introduced to overcome these limitations, but the dispersion
properties of RKD-plasmas are not explored yet. In the present paper we compute
the wavenumber dispersion of the frequency and damping or growth rates for the
electromagnetic modes in plasmas characterized by the RKD. This task is
accomplished by using the grid-based kinetic dispersion solver LEOPARD
developed for arbitrary gyrotropic distributions [P. Astfalk and F. Jenko, J.
Geophys. Res. 122, 89 (2017)]. By reproducing previous results obtained for the
SKD and Maxwellian, we validate the functionality of the code. Furthermore, we
apply the isotropic as well as the anisotropic RKDs to investigate stable
electromagnetic electron-cyclotron (EMEC) and ion-cyclotron (EMIC) modes as
well as temperature-anisotropy-driven instabilities, both for the case $T_\perp
/ T_\parallel > 1$ (EMEC and EMIC instabilities) and for the case $T_\perp /
T_\parallel < 1$ (proton and electron firehose instabilities), where
$\parallel$ and $\perp$ denote directions parallel and perpendicular to the
local time-averaged magnetic field. Provided that the cutoff parameter $\alpha$
is small enough, the results show that the RKDs reproduce the dispersion curves
of the SKD plasmas at both qualitative and quantitative levels. For higher
values, however, physically significant deviation occurs.

data distribution models. The Gaussian distributions, although being the most
common choice, are inadequate in most real world scenarios as they fail to
account for data coming from heavy-tailed populations or contaminated by
outliers. Such problems call for the use of Robust Statistics. The robust
models and estimators are usually based on elliptical populations, making the
latter ubiquitous in all methods of robust statistics. To determine whether
such tools are applicable in any specific case, goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests are
used to verify the ellipticity hypothesis. Ellipticity GoF tests are usually
hard to analyze and often their statistical power is not particularly strong.
In this work, assuming the true covariance matrix is unknown we design and
rigorously analyze a robust GoF test consistent against all alternatives to
ellipticity on the unit sphere. The proposed test is based on Tyler's estimator
and is formulated in terms of easily computable statistics of the data. For its
rigorous analysis, we develop a novel framework based on the exchangeable
random variables calculus introduced by de Finetti. Our findings are supported
by numerical simulations comparing them to other popular GoF tests and
demonstrating the significantly higher statistical power of the suggested

predicts runtime by simulating execution based on the dependency graph.
Daydream maps the low-level traces using DNN domain-specific knowledge, and

whose surface abundances deviate strongly from Solar abundance ratios and
cannot plausibly reflect their birth material composition. These stars are
identified by their high [Ba/Fe] abundance ratios (${\rm [Ba/Fe]}>1.0$dex) in
the LAMOST DR5 spectra analyzed by Xiang et al. (2019). They are almost
exclusively main sequence and subgiant stars with $T_{\rm eff}\gtrsim6300$K.
Their distribution in the Kiel diagram ($T_{\rm eff}$--$\log g$) traces a sharp
border at low temperatures along a roughly fixed-mass trajectory (around
$1.4M_\odot)$ that corresponds to an upper limit in convective envelope mass
fraction of around $10^{-4}$. Most of these stars exhibit distinctly enhanced
abundances of iron-peak elements (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni) but depleted abundances of Mg
and Ca. Rotational velocity measurements from GALAH DR2 show that the majority
of these stars rotate slower than typical stars in an equivalent temperature
range. These characteristics suggest that they are related to the so-called
Am/Fm stars. Their abundance patterns are qualitatively consistent with the
predictions of stellar evolution models that incorporate radiative
acceleration, suggesting they are a consequence of stellar internal evolution
particularly involving the competition between gravitational settling and
radiative acceleration. These peculiar stars constitute 40% of the whole
population of stars with mass above 1.5$M_\odot$, affirming that ""peculiar""
photospheric abundances due to stellar evolution effects are a ubiquitous
phenomenon for these intermediate-mass stars. This large sample of Ba-enhanced
chemically peculiar A/F stars with individual element abundances provides the
statistics to test more stringently the mechanisms that alter the surface
abundances in stars with radiative envelopes.

implements the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST) to test a sharp null

the FBST has been introduced by Pereira et al. (1999) more than two decades ago
and since then, the FBST has shown to be a Bayesian alternative to NHST and
p-values with both theoretical and practical highly appealing properties. The
algorithm provided in the fbst package is applicable to any Bayesian model as
long as the posterior distribution can be obtained at least numerically. The
core function of the package provides the Bayesian evidence against the null
hypothesis, the e-value. Additionally, p-values based on asymptotic arguments
can be computed and rich visualisations for communication and interpretation of
the results can be produced. Three examples of frequently used statistical
procedures in the cognitive sciences are given in this paper which demonstrate
how to apply the FBST in practice using the fbst package. Based on the success
of the FBST in statistical science, the fbst package should be of interest to a
broad range of researchers in psychology and the cognitive sciences and
hopefully will encourage researchers to consider the FBST as a possible
alternative when conducting hypothesis tests of a sharp null hypothesis.

standard choice of viable $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity model i.e. $f(\mathcal{G})=
\alpha\mathcal{G}^{n}$, where $\alpha$ is the model parameter. In particular,
we use conservation relation acquired from the classical Noether approach by
imposing some appropriate initial conditions to construct the metric
potentials. The obtained conserved quantity play vital role in describing the
stellar structure of compact stars. Moreover, by considering an appropriate
numerical solution, some salient features of compact stellar structures like
effective energy density, pressure, energy conditions, stability against
equilibrium of the forces and speed of sound are discussed by assigning the
suitable values of model parameter involved. Our study reveals that the compact
objects in $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity from Noether symmetry approach depend on
the conserved quantity obtained and the model parameter $\alpha$. In nutshell,
Noether symmetries are quite helpful to generate solutions that follow
physically accepted phenomena. Moreover, we observed that these obtained

iteration steps in the original method, the proposed approach is much easier to

crucial considerations for algorithms that are deployed on modern

validate our method against wind tunnel measurements for turbulent flows over

decisions were taken. While to obtain optimal performance it is not critical to
obtain explainable outputs from a learned agent, especially in such a safety
critical field, it is of paramount importance to understand how the network
behaves. This is particularly relevant to interpret failures of such systems.
In this work we propose to train an imitation learning based agent equipped
with an attention model. The attention model allows us to understand what part
of the image has been deemed most important. Interestingly, the use of
attention also leads to superior performance in a standard benchmark using the
CARLA driving simulator.

prediction accuracy. However, this was often achieved at the cost of increased
complexity, raising concerns about the interpretability and the reliability of
deep networks. Recently, an increasing attention has been given to untangling
the complexity of deep networks and quantifying their uncertainty for different
computer vision tasks. Differently, the task of depth completion has not
received enough attention despite the inherent noisy nature of depth sensors.
In this work, we thus focus on modeling the uncertainty of depth data in depth
completion starting from the sparse noisy input all the way to the final
prediction.
  We propose a novel approach to identify disturbed measurements in the input
by learning an input confidence estimator in a self-supervised manner based on
the normalized convolutional neural networks (NCNNs). Further, we propose a
probabilistic version of NCNNs that produces a statistically meaningful
uncertainty measure for the final prediction. When we evaluate our approach on
the KITTI dataset for depth completion, we outperform all the existing Bayesian
Deep Learning approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, quality of the
uncertainty measure, and the computational efficiency. Moreover, our small
network with 670k parameters performs on-par with conventional approaches with
millions of parameters. These results give strong evidence that separating the
network into parallel uncertainty and prediction streams leads to
state-of-the-art performance with accurate uncertainty estimates.

offer a feasible solution to the decentralized channel allocation and AP
selection problems in Enterprise WLAN scenarios. To do so, we empower APs and
stations with agents that, by means of implementing the Thompson sampling
algorithm, explore and learn which is the best channel to use, and which is the
best AP to associate, respectively. Our evaluation is performed over randomly
generated scenarios, which enclose different network topologies and traffic
loads. The presented results show that the proposed adaptive framework using
MABs outperform the static approach (i.e., using always the initial default
configuration, usually random) regardless of the network density and the
traffic requirements. Moreover, we show that the use of the proposed framework
reduces the performance variability between different scenarios. Results also
show that we achieve the same performance (or better) than static strategies

placed on how the agents interact. Even if the agents operate in a completely

investigations or modelling that are either difficult to obtain, inaccurate or
outdated. How can we then estimate the variegated demand for mobility? We
propose a simple method to identify the spatiotemporal demand for public
transit in a city. Using a Gaussian mixture model, we decompose empirical
ridership data into a set of temporal demand profiles representative of
ridership over any given day. A case of approximately 4.6 million daily transit
traces from the Greater London region reveals distinct demand profiles. We find
that a weighted mixture of these profiles can generate any station traffic

characterised by a state space and a transition matrix and recent work has
proposed that neural grid codes provide an efficient representation of the
state space, as eigenvectors of a transition matrix reflecting diffusion across
states, that allows efficient prediction of future state distributions. Here we
extend the eigenbasis prediction model, utilising tools from Fourier analysis,
to prediction over arbitrary translation-invariant directed transition
structures (i.e. displacement and diffusion), showing that a single set of
eigenvectors can support predictions over arbitrary directed actions via
action-specific eigenvalues. We show how to define a ""sense of direction"" to
combine actions to reach a target state (ignoring task-specific deviations from
translation-invariance), and demonstrate that adding the Fourier
representations to a deep Q network aids policy learning in continuous control
tasks. We show the equivalence between the generalised prediction framework and
traditional models of grid cell firing driven by self-motion to perform path
integration, either using oscillatory interference (via Fourier components as
velocity-controlled oscillators) or continuous attractor networks (via analysis
of the update dynamics). We thus provide a unifying framework for the role of
the grid system in predictive planning, sense of direction and path
integration: supporting generalisable inference over directed actions across
different tasks.

motion of a particle in a static and uniform magnetic field. The fifth force
induces a drift of the trajectory that is estimated analytically and compared
to numerical computations for profiles motivated by the ones of a chameleon
field within two nested cylinders. The magnitude of the effect and the
detectability of this drift are discussed to argue that this may offer a new
experimental design to test small fifth force in the laboratory. More
important, at the macroscopic level it induces a current that can in principle
also be measured, and would even allow one to access the transverse profile of

with the local gravity field suppresses the effects of Newtonian gravity that
would be several order larger than the ones of the fifth force otherwise and
the Newtonian gravity of the cavity on the particle is also argued to be
negligible. Given this insight, this experimental set-up, with its two effects

nitrile-bearing species, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios two times higher than
the elemental abundance ratio of 68 in the local ISM. Since the carbon isotopic
ratio is commonly used to evaluate the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios with the

avoid incorrect assumptions. In this work we implemented a gas-grain chemical
model with new isotopic exchange reactions and investigated their introduction

enhancement, for molecules formed starting from atomic carbon. This effect is

Rhebergen et al. (2008) offers a robust method for solving systems of
nonconservative hyperbolic partial differential equations but, as we show here,
does not satisfactorily deal with topography in shallow water flows at lowest
order (so-called DG0, or equivalently finite volume). In particular, numerical
solutions of the space-DG0 discretised one-dimensional shallow water equations
over varying topography are not truly `well-balanced'. A numerical scheme is
well-balanced if trivial steady states are satisfied in the numerical solution;
in the case of the shallow water equations, initialised rest flow should remain
at rest for all times. Whilst the free-surface height and momentum remain
constant and zero, respectively, suggesting that the scheme is indeed
well-balanced, the fluid depth and topography evolve in time. This is both
undesirable and unphysical, leading to incorrect numerical solutions for the
fluid depth, and is thus a concern from a predictive modelling perspective. We
expose this unsatisfactory issue, both analytically and numerically, and
indicate a solution that combines the DGFEM formulation for nonconservative
products with a fast and stable well-balanced finite-volume method. This
combined scheme bypasses the offending issue and successfully integrates
nonconservative hyperbolic shallow water-type models with varying topography at
lowest order. We briefly discuss implications for the definition of a
well-balanced scheme, and highlight applications when higher-order schemes may
not be desired, which give further value to our finding beyond its exposure
alone.

paper, we study the problem of computing distance-generalized core
decomposition on a network. A distance-generalized core, also termed $(k,
h)$-core, is a maximal subgraph in which every vertex has at least $k$ other
vertices at distance no larger than $h$. The state-of-the-art algorithm for
solving this problem is based on a peeling technique which iteratively removes
the vertex (denoted by $v$) from the graph that has the smallest $h$-degree.
The $h$-degree of a vertex $v$ denotes the number of other vertices that are
reachable from $v$ within $h$ hops. Such a peeling algorithm, however, needs to
frequently recompute the $h$-degrees of $v$'s neighbors after deleting $v$,
which is typically very costly for a large $h$. To overcome this limitation, we
propose an efficient peeling algorithm based on a novel $h$-degree updating
technique. Instead of recomputing the $h$-degrees, our algorithm can
dynamically maintain the $h$-degrees for all vertices via exploring a very
small subgraph, after peeling a vertex. We show that such an $h$-degree
updating procedure can be efficiently implemented by an elegant bitmap
technique. In addition, we also propose a sampling-based algorithm and a
parallelization technique to further improve the efficiency. Finally, we
conduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world graphs to evaluate our
algorithms. The results show that, when $h\ge 3$, our exact and sampling-based
algorithms can achieve up to $10\times$ and $100\times$ speedup over the
state-of-the-art algorithm, respectively.

good from an intrinsic point of view (in terms of mean absolute percentage of

to use them as additional features when forecasting demand at the item level.

surgical planning under CT with the feedback of MRI information. While previous
studies have shown paired and unpaired image synthesis from MR to CT, image
synthesis from CT to MR still remains a challenge, since it involves the
addition of extra tissue information. In this manuscript, we have implemented
two different variations of Generative Adversarial Networks exploiting the
cycling consistency and structural similarity between both CT and MR image

spread of the COVID-19 disease, was extended until 31 May 2020 in three
subsequent orders by the Government of India. The extended lockdown has had
significant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue' has likely
set in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the
most crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of
cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368
deaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going to be made on
re-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented
an agent-based city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread
of the infection in large metropolises like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed
in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city
residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of
non-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we
focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for
phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These
include phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public
transportation (modelling of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of
containment zones on controlling infections, and the role of compliance with
respect to various intervention measures including use of masks, case
isolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is
that a phased opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of
20 to 33\%, is a good way to restart economic activity while ensuring that the
city's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle the possible rise in
the number of COVID-19 patients in June and July.

  We used 38 SNRs which associate with GeV/TeV gamma-ray emissions. We
conducted spectral fittings on the gamma-ray spectra using exponential cutoff
power law and broken power law models to estimate the exponential cutoff or the
break energies, both of which are indicators of particle escape. The plots of
the gamma-ray cutoff/break energies over the plasma ages show similar
tendencies to those predicted by simple theories of the particle escape under
conditions in which a shock is interacting with thin interstellar medium or
clouds. The particle escape timescale is estimated as $\sim$100 kyr from
decreasing trends of the total energy of the confined protons with the plasma
age. The large dispersions of the cutoff/break energies of the data may suggest
an intrinsic variety of particle escape environments. This might be the cause

characterized by an indirect band gap, space inversion symmetry, and high
carrier mobility. Strong intrinsic spin-orbit coupling and the possibility to
induce extrinsic spin-orbit fields by gating make PtSe$_2$ attractive for
fundamental spin transport studies as well as for potential spintronics
applications. We perform a systematic theoretical study of the spin-orbit
coupling and spin relaxation in this material. Specifically, we employ first
principles methods to obtain the basic orbital and spin-orbital properties of
PtSe$_2$, also in the presence of an external transverse electric field. We
calculate the spin mixing parameters $b^2$ and the spin-orbit fields $\Omega$
for the Bloch states of electrons and holes. This information allows us to
predict the spin lifetimes due to the Elliott-Yafet and D'yakonov-Perel
mechanisms. We find that $b^2$ is rather large, on the order of $10^{-2}$ and
$10^{-1}$, while $\Omega$ varies strongly with doping, being about $10^{3} -
10^{4}$\,ns$^{-1}$ for %typical Fermi levels in the interval $(10-100)$ meV,
carrier density in the interval $10^{13}-10^{14}$\,cm$^{-2}$ at the electric

the uncertainty principle can be expressed using entropic measures. The
entropic uncertainty relation can be improved by considering an additional
particle as a memory particle. The presence of quantum correlation between the
memory particle and the measured particle reduces the uncertainty. In a curved
space-time, the presence of the Hawking radiation can reduce quantum
correlation. Therefore, concerning the relationship between the quantum

investigate the entropic uncertainty relation in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger

a functional of type 3. We investigate the associated computation theory

associated companion of sets with codes computable in non-monotone induction.
The interest in this functional is motivated from observing that constructions
via non-monotone induction appear as natural in classical analysis in its

  There are two groups of results: We establish strong closure properties of
the least ordinal without a code computable in non-monotone induction, and we
provide a characterisation of the class of functionals of type 3 computable
from non-monotone induction, a characterisation in terms of sequential

with 1.1 million new diagnoses every year. The gold standard for the diagnosis
of prostate cancer is a pathologists' evaluation of prostate tissue.
  To potentially assist pathologists deep-learning-based cancer detection
systems have been developed. Many of the state-of-the-art models are
patch-based convolutional neural networks, as the use of entire scanned slides
is hampered by memory limitations on accelerator cards. Patch-based systems
typically require detailed, pixel-level annotations for effective training.
However, such annotations are seldom readily available, in contrast to the
clinical reports of pathologists, which contain slide-level labels. As such,
developing algorithms which do not require manual pixel-wise annotations, but
can learn using only the clinical report would be a significant advancement for
the field.
  In this paper, we propose to use a streaming implementation of convolutional
layers, to train a modern CNN (ResNet-34) with 21 million parameters end-to-end
on 4712 prostate biopsies. The method enables the use of entire biopsy images
at high-resolution directly by reducing the GPU memory requirements by 2.4 TB.
We show that modern CNNs, trained using our streaming approach, can extract
meaningful features from high-resolution images without additional heuristics,
reaching similar performance as state-of-the-art patch-based and
multiple-instance learning methods. By circumventing the need for manual
annotations, this approach can function as a blueprint for other tasks in
histopathological diagnosis.

become the basis of new technologies that provide secrecy between two

illustrate how these technologies work. In this article we describe a
laboratory exercise in which students perform quantum key distribution with
single photons, and see how the secrecy of the communication is ensured by the
principles of quantum superposition and state projection. We used a table-top
apparatus, similar to those used in correlated-photon undergraduate
laboratories, to implement the Bennett-Brassard-84 protocol with
polarization-entangled photons. Our experiment shows how the communication
between two parties is disrupted by an eavesdropper. We use a simple quartz
plate to mimic how an eavesdropper intercepts, measures, and resends the
photons used in the communication, and we analyze the state of the light to
show how the eavesdropper changes it.

community for research on problems specifically related to health care and
medicine. EHRs have the advantages that they can be easily distributed and
contain many features useful for e.g. classification problems. What makes EHR
data sets different from typical machine learning data sets is that they are
often very sparse, due to their high dimensionality, and often contain
heterogeneous (mixed) data types. Furthermore, the data sets deal with
sensitive information, which limits the distribution of any models learned
using them, due to privacy concerns. For these reasons, using EHR data in
practice presents a real challenge. In this work, we explore using Generative
Adversarial Networks to generate synthetic, heterogeneous EHRs with the goal of
using these synthetic records in place of existing data sets for downstream
classification tasks. We will further explore applying differential privacy
(DP) preserving optimization in order to produce DP synthetic EHR data sets,
which provide rigorous privacy guarantees, and are therefore shareable and
usable in the real world. The performance (measured by AUROC, AUPRC and
accuracy) of our model's synthetic, heterogeneous data is very close to the
original data set (within 3 - 5% of the baseline) for the non-DP model when
tested in a binary classification task. Using strong $(1, 10^{-5})$ DP, our
model still produces data useful for machine learning tasks, albeit incurring a
roughly 17% performance penalty in our tested classification task. We
additionally perform a sub-population analysis and find that our model does not
introduce any bias into the synthetic EHR data compared to the baseline in
either male/female populations, or the 0-18, 19-50 and 51+ age groups in terms

with metallic materials, but have recently been reported in insulators which
display coupled magnetic and structural order parameters. We discuss one such
example, the multiferroic Cu$_3$Nb$_2$O$_8$, which is reported to undergo two
magnetic phase transitions, first to a spin density wave phase at $T_N \approx
26.5K$, and then to a helicoidal structure coupled to an electric polarization
below $T_2 \approx 24K$ [R. D. Johnson, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 107, 137205
(2011)] which breaks the crystallographic inversion symmetry. We apply
spherical polarimetry to confirm the low-temperature magnetic structure, yet
only observe a single magnetic phase transition to helicoidal order. We argue
that the reported spin density wave originates from a decoupling of the
components of the magnetic order parameter, as allowed by symmetry and driven
by thermal fluctuations. This provides a mechanism for the magnetic, but not
nuclear, structure to break inversion symmetry thereby creating an intermediate
phase where the structure imitates a spin density wave. As the temperature is
reduced, this intermediate structure destabilizes the crystal such that a
structural chirality is induced, as reflected by the emergence of the electric
polarization, and the imitation spin density wave relaxes into a generic
helicoid. This provides a situation where the magnetic structure breaks
inversion symmetry while the crystal structure remains centrosymmetric.

of the HII region is limited only to the surface of the molecular cloud, and
does not contribute to the gas compression and star formation. The present
results lend support for the dominant role of cloud-cloud collision in forming
high mass stars in addition to $\sim$20 lower mass stars, which are also likely
formed by the collision. The present case suggests all the high mass stars in

energy transfer efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT). However, the
performance of conventional energy beamforming may seriously degrade due to the
non-linear radio frequency (RF) to direct current (DC) conversion at energy
receivers (ERs). To tackle this issue, this letter proposes a new time-division
energy beamforming, in which different energy beamforming matrices (of high
ranks in general) are time shared to exploit the ""convex-concave"" shape of the
RF-DC power relation at ERs. By considering a particular time duration for WPT,
we maximize the minimum harvested DC energy among all ERs, by jointly
optimizing the energy beamforming matrices and the corresponding time
allocation. In order to solve the non-convex min-DC-energy maximization
problem, we propose an efficient solution by using the techniques of
alternating optimization and successive convex approximation (SCA). Numerical
results show that the proposed time-division energy beamforming design indeed
outperforms the conventional multi-beam and time-division-multiple-access

year still focuses on practical and challenging problems, with three tasks: (1)
cross-channel LID, (2) dialect identification and (3) noisy LID. Based on Kaldi

baselines for the three tasks. These recipes will be online-published, and
available for participants to configure LID systems. The baseline results on

classification of nanoparticles on surfaces that are detected in the far-field
with Coherent Fourier Scatterometry (CFS). We study silicon wafers contaminated
with spherical polystyrene (PSL) nanoparticles (with diameters down to
$\lambda/8$). Starting from the raw data, the proposed framework does the
pre-processing and particle search. Further, the unsupervised clustering
algorithms, such as K-means and DBSCAN, are customized to be used to define the
groups of signals that are attributed to a single scatterer. Finally, the
particle count versus particle size histogram is generated.
  The challenging cases of the high density of scatterers, noise and drift in
the dataset are treated. We take advantage of the prior information on the size
of the scatterers to minimize the false-detections and as a consequence,
provide higher discrimination ability and more accurate particle counting.
Numerical and real experiments are conducted to demonstrate the performance of
the proposed search and cluster-assessment techniques. Our results illustrate
that the proposed algorithm can detect surface contaminants correctly and
effectively.

associated to the three punctures and the $U(1)^3 \times SU(6)$ subgroup of the
$E_8$ symmetry of the E-string theory. All the puncture symmetries are manifest
in the UV and thus we can construct ordinary Lagrangians flowing in the IR to
any compactification of the E-string theory. We generalize this claim and argue
that the ${\cal N}=1$ $SU(N+2)$ SQCD in the middle of the conformal window,
$N_f=2N+4$, is the theory obtained by compactifying the $6d$ minimal
$(D_{N+3},D_{N+3})$ conformal matter SCFT on a sphere with two maximal

recommender systems, with reliability being one of the most important
indicators in the context of collaborative filtering. This paper proposes
Bernoulli Matrix Factorization (BeMF), which is a matrix factorization model,
to provide both prediction values and reliability values. BeMF is a very
innovative approach from several perspectives: a) it acts on model-based
collaborative filtering rather than on memory-based filtering, b) it does not
use external methods or extended architectures, such as existing solutions, to
provide reliability, c) it is based on a classification-based model instead of
traditional regression-based models, and d) matrix factorization formalism is
supported by the Bernoulli distribution to exploit the binary nature of the
designed classification model. The experimental results show that the more
reliable a prediction is, the less liable it is to be wrong: recommendation
quality improves after the most reliable predictions are selected.
State-of-the-art quality measures for reliability have been tested, which shows
that BeMF outperforms previous baseline methods and models.

suppresses the need of manually labeling thousands of images by transforming
synthetic data into realistic-looking data. To achieve this, a CycleGAN model
is used, which transforms a source dataset to approximate the domain
distribution of a target dataset. Secondly, this newly generated data with
perfect labels is utilized to train a semantic segmentation neural network,
U-Net. This method shows generalization capabilities on data with variability
regarding its rotation- position- and lighting conditions. Nevertheless, one of
the caveats of this approach is that the model is unable to generalize well to
other surgical instruments with a different shape from the one used for
training. This is driven by the lack of a high variance in the geometric
distribution of the training data. Future work will focus on making the model
more scale-invariant and able to adapt to other types of surgical instruments
previously unseen by the training.

to $TP$. Here we introduce a novel approach that simplifies the multitask
learning by reducing it to a set of conditioned univariate GPs without the need
for any low rank approximations, therefore completely eliminating the
requirement to select an adequate value for hyperparameter $P$. At the same
time, by extending this approach with both a hierarchical and an approximate
model, the proposed extensions are capable of recovering the multitask
covariance and noise matrices after learning only $2T$ parameters, avoiding the
validation of any model hyperparameter and reducing the overall complexity of
the model as well as the risk of overfitting. Experimental results over
synthetic and real problems confirm the advantages of this inference approach
in its ability to accurately recover the original noise and signal matrices, as
well as the achieved performance improvement in comparison to other state of
art MTGP approaches. We have also integrated the model with standard GP
toolboxes, showing that it is computationally competitive with state of the art
options.

a starting point and an endpoint as input, a neural network is trained to
predict midpoint adaptations that minimize the cost of the resulting trajectory

momentum-resolved charge dynamics from a thin film of semimetallic perovskite
$\mathbf{SrIrO_3}$. We demonstrate that the charge dynamics, characterized by a
broad continuum, is well described in terms of the marginal Fermi liquid
phenomenology. In addition, over a wide temperature regime, the inverse
scattering time is for all momenta close to the Planckian limit
$\mathbf{\tau^{-1}_{\hbar}=k_{\rm B} T/\hbar}$. Thus, $\mathbf{SrIrO_3}$ is a
semimetallic multi-band system that is as correlated as, for example, the
cuprate superconductors. The usual challenge to resolve the charge dynamics in
multi-band systems with very different mobilities is circumvented by taking
advantage of the momentum space selectivity of polarized electronic Raman
scattering. The Raman responses of both hole- and electron-pockets display an
electronic continuum extending far beyond 1000\icm ($\sim$125 meV), much larger
than allowed by the phase space for creating particle-hole pairs in a regular
Fermi liquid. Analyzing this response in the framework of a memory function
formalism, we are able to extract the frequency dependent scattering rate and
mass enhancement factor of both types of charge carriers, which in turn allows
us to determine the carrier-dependent mobilities and electrical resistivities.
The results are well consistent with transport measurement and demonstrate the
potential of this approach to investigate the charge dynamics in multi-band

phenomenon in deep learning, whereby increasing the number of training examples
$N$ causes the generalization error of neural networks to peak when $N$ is of
the same order as the number of parameters $P$. In earlier works, a similar
phenomenon was shown to exist in simpler models such as linear regression,
where the peak instead occurs when $N$ is equal to the input dimension $D$.
Since both peaks coincide with the interpolation threshold, they are often
conflated in the litterature. In this paper, we show that despite their
apparent similarity, these two scenarios are inherently different. In fact,
both peaks can co-exist when neural networks are applied to noisy regression
tasks. The relative size of the peaks is then governed by the degree of
nonlinearity of the activation function. Building on recent developments in the
analysis of random feature models, we provide a theoretical ground for this
sample-wise triple descent. As shown previously, the nonlinear peak at
$N\!=\!P$ is a true divergence caused by the extreme sensitivity of the output
function to both the noise corrupting the labels and the initialization of the
random features (or the weights in neural networks). This peak survives in the
absence of noise, but can be suppressed by regularization. In contrast, the
linear peak at $N\!=\!D$ is solely due to overfitting the noise in the labels,
and forms earlier during training. We show that this peak is implicitly
regularized by the nonlinearity, which is why it only becomes salient at high
noise and is weakly affected by explicit regularization. Throughout the paper,
we compare analytical results obtained in the random feature model with the
outcomes of numerical experiments involving deep neural networks.

renewable power systems consisting of cascaded run-of-the-river hydropower and
volatile energies such as pv and wind are built around the world. In islanded
operation mode, the primary and secondary frequency control, i.e., hydro
governors and automatic generation control (AGC), are responsible for the
frequency stability. However, due to limited water storage capacity of
run-of-the-river hydropower and river dynamics constraints, without
coordination between the cascaded plants, the traditional AGC with fixed
participation factors cannot fully exploit the adjustability of cascaded
hydropower. When imbalances between the volatile energy and load occur, load
shedding can be inevitable. To address this issue, this paper proposes a
coordinated tertiary control approach by jointly considering power system
dynamics and the river dynamics that couples the cascaded hydropower plants.
The timescales of the power system and river dynamics are very different. To
unify the multi-timescale dynamics to establish a model predictive controller
that coordinates the cascaded plants, the relation between AGC parameters and
turbine discharge over a time interval is approximated by a data-based
second-order polynomial surrogate model. The cascaded plants are coordinated by
optimising AGC participation factors in a receding-horizon manner, and load
shedding is minimised. Simulation of a real-life system with real-time pv data
collected on site shows the proposed method significantly reduces load loss

spatial isometries in four spacetime dimensions and propose a general framework
for their study. These configurations are regular on and outside a horizon of
spherical topology. Two different mechanisms allowing for their existence are
identified. The first one relies on the presence of a solitonic limit of the
black holes; when the solitons have no spatial isometries, the black holes,
being a non-linear bound state between the solitons and a horizon, inherit this
property. The second one is related to black hole scalarization, and the
existence of zero modes of the scalar field without isometries around a
spherical horizon. When the zero modes have no spatial isometries, the
backreaction of their non-linear continuation makes the scalarized black holes
inherit the absence of spatial continuous symmetries. A number of general
features of the solutions are discussed together with possible generalizations.

Consequently, this algorithm can optimize the jump function with jump size $k$
in an expected runtime of only $n^{(k + 1)/2}k^{-k/2}e^{O(k)}$ fitness
evaluations (Antipov, Doerr, Karavaev (GECCO 2020)). To obtain this
performance, however, a non-standard parameter setting depending on the jump

  To overcome this difficulty, we propose to choose two parameters of the

distribution. Via a mathematical runtime analysis, we show that this algorithm
with natural instance-independent choices of the distribution parameters on all
jump functions with jump size at most $n/4$ has a performance close to what the
best instance-specific parameters in the previous work obtained. This price for
instance-independence can be made as small as an $O(n\log(n))$ factor. Given
the difficulty of the jump problem and the runtime losses from using mildly
suboptimal fixed parameters (also discussed in this work), this appears to be a
fair price.

Scandinavia, Continental Europe and the Baltic region are non-synchronous AC
systems. This paper presents two cost benefit analyses on the utilization of
HVDC interconnectors in the Nordic countries: in the first we investigate the
utilization of HVDC interconnectors for reserve procurement and, in the second,
we assess the implementation of implicit grid losses on HVDC interconnectors in
the day-ahead market.
  The first analysis is motivated by real events in 2018 where the inertia of
the Nordic system dropped below a critical level and the most critical
generating unit, a nuclear power plant in Sweden, was redispatched to guarantee
the security of the system. In order to guarantee system security while
reducing the costs of preventive actions, in summer 2020 new frequency products
were introduced in the Nordic system: the Fast Frequency Reserves (FFR). HVDC
lines, however, can perform similar tasks at lower costs. In our analysis, we
are, thus, investigating the cost savings of using HVDC lines for frequency
support using their Emergency Power Control (EPC) functionality, instead of
redispatching or FFR.
  The second analysis is based on the proposition of Nordic Transmission System
Operators (TSOs) to introduce linear HVDC loss factors in the market clearing.
With our analysis, we show that linear loss factors can unfairly penalize one
HVDC line over the other, and this can reduce social benefits and jeopardize
revenues of merchant HVDC lines. In this regard, we propose piecewise-linear
loss factors: a simple-to-implement but highly-effective solution. Moreover, we
demonstrate how the introduction of HVDC loss factors is a partial solution,
since it disproportionally increases the AC losses. Our results show that the
additional inclusion of AC loss factors can eliminate this problem.

coimagination method, experimenters tested different settings in different care

analyzed, and presented. However, ease of changing configuration based on
participants, and a quick assessment of captured data remained challenging.
Also, several observers and measurers are needed to conduct the coimagination

automated coimagination support system that can handle such challenges. We aim
to have an automated coimagination support system that can be used easily
either by healthy participants or elderly participants via a natural voice

with healthy participants, and notably, with actual elder participants. Healthy
participants experienced longer speaking round and question-and-answer round

the speaking round. In these preliminary experiments, our initial system showed
the capability to handle different configurations. Healthy participants have
operated the system using voice, while elderly participants managed to use the

considerable challenge and is of the broadest possible interest. The size, both

algorithms to possess time complexities with both variables that are linear or

progress index steps through distinct regions of high sampling density
sequentially. By means of suitable annotations, it allows a compact

(EEG) leads to difficulty in building an affective model with high accuracy
using machine learning algorithms or deep neural networks. Inspired by emerging
deep generative models, we propose three methods for augmenting EEG training
data to enhance the performance of emotion recognition models. Our proposed
methods are based on two deep generative models, variational autoencoder (VAE)
and generative adversarial network (GAN), and two data augmentation strategies.
For the full usage strategy, all of the generated data are augmented to the
training dataset without judging the quality of the generated data, while for
partial usage, only high-quality data are selected and appended to the training
dataset. These three methods are called conditional Wasserstein GAN (cWGAN),
selective VAE (sVAE), and selective WGAN (sWGAN). To evaluate the effectiveness
of these methods, we perform a systematic experimental study on two public EEG
datasets for emotion recognition, namely, SEED and DEAP. We first generate
realistic-like EEG training data in two forms: power spectral density and
differential entropy. Then, we augment the original training datasets with a
different number of generated realistic-like EEG data. Finally, we train
support vector machines and deep neural networks with shortcut layers to build
affective models using the original and augmented training datasets. The
experimental results demonstrate that the augmented training datasets produced
by our methods enhance the performance of EEG-based emotion recognition models
and outperform the existing data augmentation methods such as conditional VAE,
Gaussian noise, and rotational data augmentation.

spatially-discrete, traveling-wave modulation (SD-TWM). A representative
metasurface is considered consisting of columns of time-modulated subwavelength
unit cells, referred to as stixels. SD-TWM is achieved by enforcing a time
delay between temporal waveforms applied to adjacent columns. In contrast to
the continuous traveling-wave modulation commonly assumed in studies of
space-time metasurfaces, here the modulation is spatially discretized. In order
to account for the discretized spatial modulation, a modified Floquet analysis
is introduced based on a new boundary condition that has been derived for
SD-TWM structures. The modified Floquet analysis separates the scattered field
into its macroscopic and microscopic variations. The reported theoretical and
experimental results reveal that the electromagnetic behavior of an SD-TWM
metasurface can be categorized into three regimes. For electrically-large
spatial modulation periods, the microscopic field variation across each stixel
can be neglected. In this regime, the space-time metasurface allows
simultaneous frequency translation and angular deflection. When the spatial
modulation period on the metasurface is electrically small, the microscopic
variation results in new metasurface capabilities such as subharmonic mixing.
When the spatial modulation period of the metasurface is wavelength-scale, the
metasurface allows both subharmonic mixing and angular deflection to be
achieved simultaneously. To verify our analysis, a dual-polarized,
spatio-temporally modulated metasurface, is developed and measured at X-band
frequencies.

COVID-19 pandemic. It is motivated by the desire to reduce passengers'
likelihood of passing close to seated passengers when they take their seats.
However, our prior work on the risk of Ebola spread in airplanes suggested that
the driving force for increased exposure to infection transmission risk is the
clustering of passengers while waiting for others to stow their luggage and
take their seats. In this work, we examine whether the new boarding processes
lead to increased or decreased risk of infection spread. We also study the
reasons behind the risk differences associated with different boarding
processes. We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using
pedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives. Our results show
that back-to-front boarding roughly doubles the infection exposure compared
with random boarding. It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a
typical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping
middle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show
that the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this
case as with middle seats occupied. We show that the increased exposure arises
from the proximity between passengers moving in the aisle and while seated. Our
results suggest that airlines either revert to their earlier boarding process
or adopt the better random process.

The dynamics of the spread is based on four fundamental categories of people in
a population: Tested and infected, Non-Tested but infected, Tested but not
infected, and non-Tested and not infected. The model is based on two levels of
dynamics of spread in the population: at local level and at the global level.
The local level growth is described with data and parameters which include
testing statistics for COVID-19, preventive measures such as nationwide
lockdown, and the migration of people across neighboring locations. In the
context of India, the local locations are considered as districts and migration
or traffic flow across districts are defined by normalized edge weight of the
metapopulation network of districts which are infected with COVID-19. Based on
this local growth, state level predictions for number of people tested with
COVID-19 positive are made. Further, considering the local locations as states,
prediction is made for the country level. The values of the model parameters
are determined using grid search and minimizing an error function while
training the model with real data. The predictions are made based on the
present statistics of testing, and certain linear and log-linear growth of
testing at state and country level. Finally, it is shown that the spread can be
contained if number of testing can be increased linearly or log-linearly by
certain factors along with the preventive measures in near future. This is also
necessary to prevent the sharp growth in the count of infected and to get rid
of the second wave of pandemic.

variational inference models. We show how SGD can be applied on bayesian neural

which to communicate information about a shared computation in a distributed
setting where coordination overhead may not be tolerated, and individual
participants are allowed to temporarily diverge from the overall computation.
Within this setting, there are two classical approaches: state- and
operation-based CRDTs. The former define a commutative, associative, and
idempotent join operation, and their states a monotone join semi-lattice.
State-based CRDTs may be further distinguished into classical- and
$\delta$-state CRDTs. The former communicate their full state after each
update, whereas the latter communicate only the changed state. Op-based CRDTs
communicate operations (not state), thus making their updates non-idempotent.
Whereas op-based CRDTs require little information to be exchanged, they demand
relatively strong network guarantees (exactly-once message delivery), and
state-based CRDTs suffer the opposite problem. Both satisfy strong eventual
consistency (SEC).
  We posit that $\delta$-state CRDTs both (1) require less communication
overhead from payload size, and (2) tolerate relatively weak network
environments, making them an ideal candidate for real-world use of CRDTs. Our
central intuition is a pair of reductions between state-, $\delta$-state, and
op-based CRDTs. We formalize this intuition in the Isabelle interactive theorem
prover and show that state-based CRDTs achieve SEC. We present a relaxed
network model in Isabelle and show that state-based CRDTs still maintain SEC.
Finally, we extend our work to show that $\delta$-state CRDTs maintain SEC when
only communicating $\delta$-state fragments, even under relatively weak network
conditions.

caused by the inefficient, manual track inspections. Government agencies are
seriously concerned about the safe operations of the rail industry after series
of accidents reported across e USA and around the globe, mainly attributed to
track defects. Casualties resulting from track defects result in billions of
dollars loss in public and private investments and loss of revenue due to
downtime, ultimately resulting in loss of the public's confidence. The manual,
mundane, and expensive monitoring of rail track safety can be transform through
the use of drones, computer vision, and machine learning. The primary goal of
this study is to develop multiple algorithms that implement supervised and
semi-supervised learning that accurately analyze whether a track is safe or
unsafe based on simulated training data of train tracks. This includes being
able to develop a Convolutional Neural Network that can identify track defects
using supervised learning without having to specify a particular algorithm for
detecting those defects, and that the new model would both speed up and improve
the quality of the track defect detection process, accompanied with a computer
vision image-processing algorithm. Our other goals included designing and
building a prototype representation of train tracks to simulate track defects,
to precisely and consistently conduct the visual inspection using drones.
Ultimately, the goal demonstrates that the state of good repairs in railway
tracks can be attained through the use of drones, computer vision and machine
learning.

porous electrodes are frequently approximated as comprising spherical particles
of uniform size, leading to the commonly-used single-particle model (SPM) when
transport in the electrolyte is assumed to be fast. Here electrode
heterogeneity is modelled by extending this to a distribution of particle
sizes. Unimodal and bimodal particle-size distributions (PSD) are considered.
For a unimodal PSD, the effect of the spread of the distribution on the cell
dynamics is investigated, and choice of effective particle radius when
approximating by an SPM assessed. Asymptotic techniques are used to derive a
correction to the SPM valid for narrow, but realistic, PSDs. In addition, it is
shown that the heterogeneous internal states of all particles (relevant when
modelling degradation, for example) can be efficiently computed after-the-fact.
For a bimodal PSD, the results are well approximated by a double-particle model
(DPM), with one size representing each mode. Results for lithium iron phosphate
with a bimodal PSD show that the DPM captures an experimentally-observed
double-plateau in the discharge curve, suggesting it is entirely due to
bimodality.

  revealed by snow-powered flow imaging",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  As wind energy continues to expand, increased interaction between wind farms
and their surroundings can be expected. Using natural snowfall to visualize the
air flow in the wake of a utility-scale wind turbine at unprecedented
spatio-temporal resolution, we observe intermittent periods of strong
interaction between the wake and the ground surface and quantify the momentum
flux during these periods. Significantly, we identify two turbine
operational-dependent pathways that lead to these periods of increased
wake-ground interaction. Data from a nearby meteorological tower provides
further insights into the strength and persistence of the enhanced flux for
each pathway under different atmospheric conditions. These pathways allow us to
resolve discrepancies between previous conflicting studies on the impact of
wind turbines on surface fluxes. Furthermore, we use our results to generate a
map of the potential impact of wind farms on surface momentum flux throughout
the Continental United States, providing a valuable resource for wind farm
siting decisions. These findings have implications for agriculture in
particular, as crop growth is significantly affected by surface fluxes.

has been updated based on all activities. On which the interacted network
members with most similar activities have been recommended based on the
specific influence category with sentiment type. After that, the top most
influenceable network members in the basis of the required amount among those

ranking by analyzing the similarity and frequency of their activity contents
with respect to the activity contents of the main user. Through these two
