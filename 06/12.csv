that given the plane where the screen is located, the far-field pattern

holds even for screens whose shape is an arbitrary simply connected smooth

the same, and the graph is rainbow-connected if there is a rainbow path between
each pair of its vertices. The minimum number of colors needed to
rainbow-connect a graph $G$ is the rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by
$\text{rc}(G)$.
  A simple way to rainbow-connect a graph $G$ is to color the edges of a
spanning tree with distinct colors and then re-use any of these colors to color
the remaining edges of $G$. This proves that $\text{rc}(G) \le |V(G)|-1$. We
ask whether there is a stronger connection between tree-like structures and
rainbow coloring than that is implied by the above trivial argument. For
instance, is it possible to find an upper bound of $t(G) -1$ for
$\text{rc}(G)$, where $t(G)$ is the number of vertices in the largest induced
tree of $G$? The answer turns out to be negative, as there are counter-examples
that show that even $c\cdot t(G)$ is not an upper bound for $\text{rc}(G))$ for
any given constant $c$.
  In this work we show that if we consider the forest number $f(G)$, the number
of vertices in a maximum induced forest of $G$, instead of $t(G)$, then
surprisingly we do get an upper bound. More specifically, we prove that
$\text{rc}(G) \leq f(G) + 2$. Our result indicates a stronger connection
between rainbow connection and tree-like structures than that was suggested by
the simple spanning tree based upper bound.

traditional direct heating model of irradiation, whereby energy deposited by
the pulsar wind into the stellar envelope is locally re-emitted, by introducing
heat redistribution via diffusion and convection within the outer stellar
envelope. We approximate the irradiated stellar envelope as a two-dimensional
shell. This allows us to propose an effective equation of energy conservation
that can be solved at a reduced computational cost. We then implement this
model in the \texttt{Icarus} software and use evidence sampling to determine
the most likely convection and diffusion laws for the light curve of the
redback companion of PSR J2215+5135. Redistribution effects concentrate near
the terminator line of pulsar irradiation, and can create apparent hot and cold
spots. Among the models tested for PSR J2215+5135, we find that all models with
heat redistribution are more likely than symmetric direct heating. The
best-fitting redistribution model involves diffusion together with a uniformly
rotating envelope. However, we caution that all models still present serious
systematic effects, and that prior knowledge from pulsar timing, spectroscopy
and distance are key to determine with certainty the most accurate
redistribution law. We propose an extension of the direct heating framework
that allows for exploring a variety of heat redistribution effects. Future work
is necessary to determine the relevant laws from first principles and
empirically using complementary observations.

stability of the GAN, slowing down the training procedure. In this work, we
propose ScoreGAN for fraud review detection that makes use of both review text

incorporated through Information Gain Maximization (IGM) into the loss function
for three reasons. One is to generate score-correlated reviews based on the
scores given to the generator. Second, the generated reviews are employed to
train the discriminator, so the discriminator can correctly label the possible
bot-generated reviews through joint representations learned from the
concatenation of GLobal Vector for Word representation (GLoVe) extracted from
the text and the score. Finally, it can be used to improve the stability and
scalability of the GAN. Results show that the proposed framework outperformed

tidal disruption events (TDEs). We introduce a new physically motivated model
to self-consistently treat TDEs in cosmological simulations, and apply it to
the assembly of a galaxy with final mass $3\times 10^{10}\mathrm{\, M}_\odot$
at $z=6$. This galaxy exhibits a TDE rate of $\sim 10^{-5}\mathrm{\, yr}^{-1}$,
consistent with local observations but already in place when the Universe was
one billion year old. A fraction of the disrupted stars participate in the
growth of MBHs, dominating it until the MBH reaches mass $\sim 5 \times 10^5
\mathrm{\, M}_\odot$, but their contribution then becomes negligible compared
to gas. TDEs could be a viable mechanism to grow light MBH seeds, but fewer
TDEs are expected when the MBH becomes sufficiently massive to reach the
luminosity of, and be detected as, an active galactic nucleus. Galaxy mergers
bring multiple MBHs in the galaxy, resulting in an enhancement of the global
TDE rate in the galaxy by $\sim 1$ order of magnitude during $100\mathrm{\,
Myr}$ around mergers. This enhancement is not on the central MBH, but caused by
the presence of MBHs in the infalling galaxies. This is the first self
consistent study of TDEs in a cosmological environment and highlights that
accretion of stars and TDEs are a natural process occurring in a Milky~Way-mass
galaxy at early cosmic times.

years. Most of existing works tackle the closed-set scenario, assuming that the
source and target domains share the exactly same categories. In practice,
nevertheless, a target domain often contains samples of classes unseen in
source domain (i.e., unknown class). The extension of domain adaptation from
closed-set to such open-set situation is not trivial since the target samples
in unknown class are not expected to align with the source. In this paper, we
address this problem by augmenting the state-of-the-art domain adaptation
technique, Self-Ensembling, with category-agnostic clusters in target domain.
Specifically, we present Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters
(SE-CC) -- a novel architecture that steers domain adaptation with the
additional guidance of category-agnostic clusters that are specific to target
domain. These clustering information provides domain-specific visual cues,
facilitating the generalization of Self-Ensembling for both closed-set and
open-set scenarios. Technically, clustering is firstly performed over all the
unlabeled target samples to obtain the category-agnostic clusters, which reveal
the underlying data space structure peculiar to target domain. A clustering
branch is capitalized on to ensure that the learnt representation preserves
such underlying structure by matching the estimated assignment distribution
over clusters to the inherent cluster distribution for each target sample.
Furthermore, SE-CC enhances the learnt representation with mutual information
maximization. Extensive experiments are conducted on Office and VisDA datasets
for both open-set and closed-set domain adaptation, and superior results are
reported when comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches.

uncertainties to both object classification and bounding box regression tasks.
To this end, we devise a general loss function to cover most region-based

propose a unified sample weighting network to predict a sample's task weights.
Our framework is simple yet effective. It leverages the samples' uncertainty
distributions on classification loss, regression loss, IoU, and probability

jointly learns sample weights for both classification and regression tasks,
which differentiates it from most previous work. (ii). It is a data-driven

effortlessly plugged into most object detectors and achieves noticeable

annotations. In the view of extremely expensive expert labeling, recent
research has shown that the models trained on photo-realistic synthetic data

real images. Despite this progress, without constraining the prediction on real
images, the models will easily overfit on synthetic data due to severe domain
mismatch. In this paper, we novelly exploit the intrinsic properties of
semantic segmentation to alleviate such problem for model transfer.
Specifically, we present a Regularizer of Prediction Transfer (RPT) that
imposes the intrinsic properties as constraints to regularize model transfer in
an unsupervised fashion. These constraints include patch-level, cluster-level
and context-level semantic prediction consistencies at different levels of
image formation. As the transfer is label-free and data-driven, the robustness
of prediction is addressed by selectively involving a subset of image regions
for model regularization. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the
proposal of RPT on the transfer of models trained on GTA5 and SYNTHIA

consistent improvements when injecting the constraints on several neural

electron tomography can measure complete 3D specimen structure of unbounded
object sizes up to a specified cutoff resolution. This breaks the established
Crowther limit when tilt increments are twice the convergence angle or smaller.
Unprecedented 3D resolution is achievable across large objects. Atomic 3D
imaging (1$\unicode{xC5}$) is allowed across extended objects larger than
depth-of-focus (e.g. $>$ 20nm) using available microscopes and modest specimen
tilting ($<$ 3$^\circ$). Furthermore, aberration-corrected tomography follows
the rule of dose-fractionation where a specified total dose can be divided
among tilts and defoci.

from its family of diverse solvers one that performs well on a given problem.
This algorithm selection problem is complicated by the fact that different
phases of the optimization process require different search behavior. While
this can partly be controlled by the algorithm itself, there exist large
differences between algorithm performance. It can therefore be beneficial to
swap the configuration or even the entire algorithm during the run. Long deemed
impractical, recent advances in Machine Learning and in exploratory landscape
analysis give hope that this dynamic algorithm configuration~(dynAC) can
eventually be solved by automatically trained configuration schedules. With
this work we aim at promoting research on dynAC, by introducing a simpler
variant that focuses only on switching between different algorithms, not
configurations. Using the rich data from the Black Box Optimization
Benchmark~(BBOB) platform, we show that even single-switch dynamic Algorithm
selection (dynAS) can potentially result in significant performance gains. We
also discuss key challenges in dynAS, and argue that the BBOB-framework can
become a useful tool in overcoming these.

either the shape of the prominent 10 $\mu$m solid-state features or the overall
flux levels (no more than 20%) for both systems, corroborating that the
population of sub-$\mu$m-sized grains that produce the pronounced solid-state
features is stable over a decadal timescale. We suggest that these
sub-$\mu$m-sized grains were initially generated in an optically thick clump of
debris of mm-sized vapor condensates resulting from a recent violent impact
between large asteroidal or planetary bodies. Because of the shielding from the
stellar photons provided by this clump, intense collisions led to an
over-production of fine grains that would otherwise be ejected from the system
by radiation pressure. As the clump is sheared by its orbital motion and
becomes optically thin, a population of very fine grains could remain in stable
orbits until Poynting-Robertson drag slowly spirals them into the star. We
further suggest that the 3-5 $\mu$m disk variation around HD 113766A is
consistent with a clump/arc of such fine grains on a modestly eccentric orbit

CMB-derived cosmological parameter constraints, due to the degeneracy between
the Thomson-scattering optical depth, $\tau$, and the amplitude of scalar
perturbations, $A_s$. This degeneracy subsequently hinders the ability of
large-scale structure data to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses, a major
target for cosmology in the 2020s. In this work, we explore the kinematic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect as a probe of reionization, and show that it
can be used to mitigate the optical depth degeneracy with high-sensitivity,
high-resolution data from the upcoming CMB-S4 experiment. We discuss the
dependence of the kSZ power spectrum on physical reionization model parameters,
as well as on empirical reionization parameters, namely $\tau$ and the duration
of reionization, $\Delta z$. We show that by combining the kSZ two-point
function and the reconstructed kSZ four-point function, degeneracies between
$\tau$ and $\Delta z$ can be strongly broken, yielding tight constraints on
both parameters. We forecast $\sigma(\tau) = 0.003$ and $\sigma(\Delta z) =
0.25$ for a combination of CMB-S4 and Planck data, including detailed treatment
of foregrounds and atmospheric noise. The constraint on $\tau$ is nearly
identical to the cosmic-variance limit that can be achieved from large-angle

cosmological constraints on the neutrino mass.

transition functions break the global $SU(2)$ symmetry to the Abelian subgroup

from All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and Intermediate Palomar

average model to estimate the variability features of the light curves and
their power spectral density. The characteristic evolution timescale and
amplitude of granulations are further derived from fitting the posterior power
spectral density with the COR function, which is a Harvey-like granulation
model. The consistency of theoretical predictions and results is checked to
verify the correctness of the assumption that granulations on RSGs contribute
to irregular variation. The relations between granulation and stellar
parameters are obtained and compared with the results of red giant branch stars
and Betelgeuse. It is found that the relations are in agreement with
predictions from basic physical process of granulation and fall close to the
extrapolated relations of RGB stars. The granulations in most of the RSGs
evolve at a timescale of several days to a year with the characteristic
amplitude of 10-1000 mmag. The results imply that the irregular variations of
RSGs can be attributed to the evolution of granulations. When comparing the
results from SMC, LMC and M31, the timescale and amplitude of granulation seem
to increase with metallicity. The analytical relations of the granulation
parameters with stellar parameters are derived for the RSG sample of each

instance discrimination pretraining good for transfer learning? What knowledge

of instance discrimination, how can we better exploit human annotation labels
for pretraining? Our findings are threefold. First, what truly matters for the
transfer is low-level and mid-level representations, not high-level
representations. Second, the intra-category invariance enforced by the
traditional supervised model weakens transferability by increasing task
misalignment. Finally, supervised pretraining can be strengthened by following
an exemplar-based approach without explicit constraints among the instances

To this end, we propose \textbf{GNNAdvisor}, an adaptive and efficient runtime
system to accelerate various GNN workloads on GPU platforms. First, GNNAdvisor
explores and identifies several performance-relevant features from both the GNN
model and the input graph, and uses them as a new driving force for GNN
acceleration. Second, GNNAdvisor implements a novel and highly-efficient 2D
workload management, tailored for GNN computation to improve GPU utilization
and performance under different application settings. Third, GNNAdvisor
capitalizes on the GPU memory hierarchy for acceleration by gracefully
coordinating the execution of GNNs according to the characteristics of the GPU
memory structure and GNN workloads. Furthermore, to enable automatic runtime
optimization, GNNAdvisor incorporates a lightweight analytical model for an
effective design parameter search. Extensive experiments show that GNNAdvisor
outperforms the state-of-the-art GNN computing frameworks, such as Deep Graph
Library ($3.02\times$ faster on average) and NeuGraph (up to $4.10\times$

knowledge already encoded in the parameters of pre-trained LMs. In this work,
we provide a first demonstration that LMs can be trained to reliably perform
systematic reasoning combining both implicit, pre-trained knowledge and
explicit natural language statements. To do this, we describe a procedure for
automatically generating datasets that teach a model new reasoning skills, and
demonstrate that models learn to effectively perform inference which involves
implicit taxonomic and world knowledge, chaining and counting. Finally, we show
that ""teaching"" models to reason generalizes beyond the training distribution:
they successfully compose the usage of multiple reasoning skills in single
examples. Our work paves a path towards open-domain systems that constantly
improve by interacting with users who can instantly correct a model by adding
simple natural language statements.

emission lines decorrelated from continuum variations. During this time the
soft X-ray part of the intrinsic spectrum had been strongly absorbed by a
line-of-sight (LOS) obscurer, which was interpreted as the upper part of a disk
wind. Our first paper showed that changes in the LOS obscurer produce the
decorrelation between the absorption lines and the continuum. A second study
showed that the base of the wind shields the BLR, leading to the emission-line
decorrelation. In that study, we proposed the wind is normally transparent with
no effect on the spectrum. Changes in the wind properties alter its shielding
and affect the SED striking the BLR, producing the observed decorrelations. In
this work, we investigate the impact of a translucent wind on the emission
lines. We simulate the obscuration using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST
observations to determine the physical characteristics of the wind. We find
that a translucent wind can contribute a part of the He II and Fe K? emission.
It has a modest optical depth to electron scattering, which explains the
fainter far-side emission in the observed velocity delay maps. The wind
produces the very broad base seen in the UV emission lines and may also be
present in the Fe K? line. Our results highlight the importance of accounting
for the effects of such winds in the analysis of the physics of the central

systems and relate it to a range of existing models. We derive conditions for
diffusion-driven instability of a spatially homogeneous equilibrium analogous
to the classical conditions for a Turing instability in the simplest nontrivial
setting where one domain has a standard reaction-diffusion system, and the
other permits only diffusion. Due to the transverse coupling between these two
regions, standard techniques for computing eigenfunctions of the Laplacian
cannot be applied, and so we propose an alternative method to compute the
dispersion relation directly. We compare instability conditions with full
numerical simulations to demonstrate impacts of the geometry and coupling
parameters on patterning, and explore various experimentally-relevant
asymptotic regimes. In the regime where the first domain is suitably thin, we
recover a simple modulation of the standard Turing conditions, and find that
often the broad impact of the diffusion-only domain is to reduce the ability of
the system to form patterns. We also demonstrate complex impacts of this
coupling on pattern formation. For instance, we exhibit non-monotonicity of
pattern-forming instabilities with respect to geometric and coupling
parameters, and highlight an instability from a nontrivial interaction between
kinetics in one domain and diffusion in the other. These results are valuable

Turing patterns, but also for understanding the role of stratified media in

spatial, and conceptual abstraction. At the lower levels, the agent must
interpret their proprioceptive inputs and control their muscles, and at the
higher levels, the agent must select goals and plan how they will achieve those
goals. It is clear that each of these types of reasoning is amenable to
different types of representations, algorithms, and inputs. In this work, we
introduce a simple, three-level hierarchical architecture that reflects these
distinctions. The low-level controller operates on the continuous
proprioceptive inputs, using model-free learning to acquire useful behaviors.
These in turn induce a set of mid-level dynamics, which are learned by the
mid-level controller and used for model-predictive control, to select a
behavior to activate at each timestep. The high-level controller leverages a
discrete, graph representation for goal selection and path planning to specify
targets for the mid-level controller. We apply our method to a series of
navigation tasks in the Mujoco Ant environment, consistently demonstrating
significant improvements in sample-efficiency compared to prior model-free,
model-based, and hierarchical RL methods. Finally, as an illustrative example

(SIDM) haloes spanning the full observable mass range, from dwarf galaxies to
galaxy clusters. Using realistic simulations that model the baryonic physics
relevant for galaxy formation, we compare the density profiles of haloes
simulated with either SIDM or cold and collisionless dark matter (CDM) to those
inferred from observations of stellar velocity dispersion, gas rotation curves,
weak and strong gravitational lensing, and/or X-ray maps. We make our
comparison in terms of the maximal surface density of haloes, circumventing the
need for semi-analytic or parametric models for dark matter density profiles.
We find that the maximal surface density as a function of halo mass is well
reproduced by CDM simulations that include baryons, while for SIDM with a
velocity-independent cross-section of 1 cm$^2/$g, the simulated galaxy clusters
have mean maximal surface densities that are below those of observed systems by
an amount greater than the standard deviation of the observed maximal surface
density at fixed mass. For less massive systems both CDM and SIDM agree with
the observation equally well.

  projects through identification of signature species using UAVs",,,,,"cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Logged forests cover four million square kilometres of the tropics and
restoring these forests is essential if we are to avoid the worst impacts of
climate change, yet monitoring recovery is challenging. Tracking the abundance
of visually identifiable, early-successional species enables successional
status and thereby restoration progress to be evaluated. Here we present a new
pipeline, SLIC-UAV, for processing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery to map
early-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline is novel because
it comprises: (a) a time-efficient approach for labelling crowns from UAV
imagery; (b) machine learning of species based on spectral and textural
features within individual tree crowns, and (c) automatic segmentation of
orthomosaiced UAV imagery into 'superpixels', using Simple Linear Iterative
Clustering (SLIC). Creating superpixels reduces the dataset's dimensionality
and focuses prediction onto clusters of pixels, greatly improving accuracy. To
demonstrate SLIC-UAV, support vector machines and random forests were used to
predict the species of hand-labelled crowns in a restoration concession in
Indonesia. Random forests were most accurate at discriminating species for
whole crowns, with accuracy ranging from 79.3% when mapping five common
species, to 90.5% when mapping the three most visually-distinctive species. In
contrast, support vector machines proved better for labelling automatically
segmented superpixels, with accuracy ranging from 74.3% to 91.7% for the same
species. Models were extended to map species across 100 hectares of forest. The
study demonstrates the power of SLIC-UAV for mapping characteristic
early-successional tree species as an indicator of successional stage within
tropical forest restoration areas. Continued effort is needed to develop
easy-to-implement and low-cost technology to improve the affordability of
project management.

clinical biopsy images to differentiate between these gastrointestinal diseases
is striking histopathologic overlap between them. In the current study, we
propose four diagnosis techniques for these diseases and address their
limitations and advantages. First, the diagnosis between CD, EE, and Normal
biopsies is considered, but the main challenge with this diagnosis technique is
the staining problem. The dataset used in this research is collected from
different centers with different staining standards. To solve this problem, we
use color balancing in order to train our model with a varying range of colors.
Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL) architecture has been used as another
approach to mitigate the effects of the staining problem. RMDL combines
different architectures and structures of deep learning and the final output of
the model is based on the majority vote. CD is a chronic autoimmune disease
that affects the small intestine genetically predisposed children and adults.
Typically, CD rapidly progress from Marsh I to IIIa. Marsh III is sub-divided
into IIIa (partial villus atrophy), Marsh IIIb (subtotal villous atrophy), and
Marsh IIIc (total villus atrophy) to explain the spectrum of villus atrophy
along with crypt hypertrophy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes. In the
second part of this study, we proposed two ways for diagnosing different stages

as Hierarchical Medical Image Classification (HMIC) to have a model to diagnose

the one hand, net transitions are equipped with guards that simultaneously

extracting relevant values from the database or by generating genuinely fresh

frameworks for the (parameterised) verification of data and processes. We show
that fresh-value injection is a particularly complex feature to handle, and
discuss strategies to tame it. Finally, we discuss how catalog nets relate to

Modified Shortest Remaining Processing Time (M-SRPT) scheduling algorithm, a
simple modification of SRPT, which always schedules jobs according to SRPT
whenever possible, while processes tasks in an arbitrary order. The M-SRPT
algorithm is proved to achieve a competitive ratio of $\Theta(\log \alpha

maximum job workload and minimum job workload, $\beta$ represents the ratio
between maximum non-preemptive task workload and minimum job workload. In
addition, the competitive ratio achieved is shown to be optimal (up to a
constant factor), when there are constant number of machines. We further
consider the problem under Poisson arrival and general workload distribution
(\ie, M/GI/$N$ system), and show that M-SRPT achieves asymptotic optimal mean
response time when the traffic intensity $\rho$ approaches $1$, if job size
distribution has finite support. Beyond finite job workload, the asymptotic
optimality of M-SRPT also holds for infinite job size distributions with
certain probabilistic assumptions, for example, M/M/$N$ system with finite task

with a plasma physics audience in mind. In particular we illustrate (a) how the
slow manifold concept may be used to understand \emph{breakdown} of a reduced
model over sufficiently-long time intervals, and (b) how a discrete-time
analogue of slow manifold theory provides a useful framework for developing
implicit integrators for temporally-stiff plasma models. For readers with more
advanced mathematical training we also use slow manifold reduction to explain
the phenomenon of inheritance of Hamiltonian structure in dissipation-free
reduced plasma models. Various facets of the theory are illustrated in the
context of the Abraham-Lorentz model of a single charged particle experiencing
its own radiation drag. As a culminating example we derive the slow manifold
underlying kinetic quasineutral plasma dynamics up to first-order in

Neural Networks (DNNs), but have recently been shown to be vulnerable to
attacks that produce divergent explanations for nearby inputs. This lack of
robustness is especially problematic in high-stakes applications where
adversarially-manipulated explanations could impair safety and trustworthiness.
Building on a geometric understanding of these attacks presented in recent
work, we identify Lipschitz continuity conditions on models' gradient that lead
to robust gradient-based attributions, and observe that smoothness may also be
related to the ability of an attack to transfer across multiple attribution
methods. To mitigate these attacks in practice, we propose an inexpensive
regularization method that promotes these conditions in DNNs, as well as a
stochastic smoothing technique that does not require re-training. Our
experiments on a range of image models demonstrate that both of these
mitigations consistently improve attribution robustness, and confirm the role
that smooth geometry plays in these attacks on real, large-scale models.

intelligent surfaces while requiring much smaller numbers of reflecting
elements. Consequently, the proposed IRS architecture needs significantly less
channel estimation and beam training overhead and provides higher robustness
compared to classical IRS approaches. Further, thanks to dividing the IRS
reflection process over two surfaces, the position and orientation of these
surfaces can be optimized to extend the wireless communication coverage and
enhance the system performance. In this paper, the achievable rates and
required numbers of elements using the proposed relay-aided IRS architecture

errors when dealing with testing data coming from a distribution different from

accurately quantify its predictive uncertainty and screen out these anomalous
inputs. However, existing OoD detection approaches are prone to errors and even
sometimes assign higher likelihoods to OoD samples. Unlike standard learning
tasks, there is currently no well established guiding principle for designing
OoD detection architectures that can accurately quantify uncertainty. To
address these problems, we first seek to identify guiding principles for
designing uncertainty-aware architectures, by proposing Neural Architecture
Distribution Search (NADS). NADS searches for a distribution of architectures
that perform well on a given task, allowing us to identify common building
blocks among all uncertainty-aware architectures. With this formulation, we are
able to optimize a stochastic OoD detection objective and construct an ensemble
of models to perform OoD detection. We perform multiple OoD detection
experiments and observe that our NADS performs favorably, with up to 57%
improvement in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods among 15 different

spins are even more poorly constrained. Spin misalignment, along with unequal
mass ratios and spin magnitudes, introduces asymmetry in the gravitational
radiation, which imparts a recoil kick to the merged MBH. Understanding how MBH
binary spins evolve is crucial for determining their recoil velocities, their
gravitational wave (GW) waveforms detectable with LISA, as well as their
post-merger retention rate in galaxies and thus their subsequent merger rate.
Here we present a novel study that introduces a sub-resolution model for gas-
and GW-driven MBH binary spin evolution using a population of accreting MBHs
from the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We also model
sub-resolution binary inspiral via dynamical friction, stellar scattering,
viscous gas drag, and GW emission. Our model assumes differential accretion,
which causes greater alignment of the secondary MBH spin in unequal-mass
mergers. We find that 47% of the MBHs in our population merge by $z=0$. Of
these, 19% have misaligned primaries and 10% have misaligned secondaries at the
time of merger in our (conservative) fiducial model. The MBH misalignment
fraction depends strongly on the accretion disc parameters, however. Reducing
accretion rates by a factor of 100, in a thicker disc, yields 79% and 42%
misalignment for primaries and secondaries, respectively. Even in the fiducial
model, more than 12% of binaries experience recoils of $>500$ km s$^{-1}$,
which could displace them at least temporarily from galactic nuclei. We
additionally find that a significant number of systems experience strong
precession.

drug-drug interaction prediction, require to handle multi-relational graphs.
However, handling real-world multi-relational graphs with Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) is often challenging due to their evolving nature, as new entities
(nodes) can emerge over time. Moreover, newly emerged entities often have few
links, which makes the learning even more difficult. Motivated by this
challenge, we introduce a realistic problem of few-shot out-of-graph link
prediction, where we not only predict the links between the seen and unseen
nodes as in a conventional out-of-knowledge link prediction task but also
between the unseen nodes, with only few edges per node. We tackle this problem
with a novel transductive meta-learning framework which we refer to as Graph
Extrapolation Networks (GEN). GEN meta-learns both the node embedding network
for inductive inference (seen-to-unseen) and the link prediction network for
transductive inference (unseen-to-unseen). For transductive link prediction, we
further propose a stochastic embedding layer to model uncertainty in the link
prediction between unseen entities. We validate our model on multiple benchmark
datasets for knowledge graph completion and drug-drug interaction prediction.
The results show that our model significantly outperforms relevant baselines
for out-of-graph link prediction tasks.

back-search algorithm as a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The experiments are
conducted on two weakly-supervised neural-symbolic tasks: (1) handwritten

Bose gases, including the first demonstration of coherent splitting of 2D Bose

imaging only a thin slice of the expanded atom clouds, which will be necessary

limited by the difficulty in isolating it in thickness exceeding 3 atomic

thickness up to 9 layers and areas up to ~50 micrometers square is grown via
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on suspended Cu foils and transferred onto
target substrates via etch-free delamination. The domains of rhombohedral FLG
are identified by Raman spectroscopy and are found to alternate with domains of
Bernal-stacked FLG within the same crystal in a stripe-like configuration. A
combined analysis of micro-Raman mapping, atomic force microscopy and optical
microscopy indicates that the formation of rhombohedral-stacked FLG is strongly
correlated to the copper substrate morphology. Cu step bunching results in
bending of FLG and interlayer displacement along preferential crystallographic
orientations, as determined experimentally by electron microscopy, thus
inducing the stripe-like domains. The growth and transfer of rhombohedral FLG
with the reported thickness and size shall facilitate the observation of
predicted unconventional physics and ultimately add to its technological

and of the historical radial velocities, shows that the current and previous
spectra are best interpreted as showing only a single set of lines of a
moderately rapidly rotating star with slowly variable radial velocity, which is
one of the sources detected by VLBI. We combine our own and other velocities
with the VLBI measurements and new adaptive optics observations to derive the
first astrometric-spectroscopic orbit of the G5 + G9 pair, with a period of
18.18 $\pm$ 0.11 years. We infer dynamical masses of 0.897 $\pm$ 0.022 MSun for

of the population at all ages. Detecting the development of epilepsy, i.e.,
epileptogenesis (EPG), before any seizures occur could allow for early
interventions and potentially more effective treatments. Here, we investigate
if modern machine learning (ML) techniques can detect EPG from intra-cranial
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings prior to the occurrence of any
seizures. For this we use a rodent model of epilepsy where EPG is triggered by
electrical stimulation of the brain. We propose a ML framework for EPG
identification, which combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with a
prediction aggregation method to obtain the final classification decision.
Specifically, the neural network is trained to distinguish five second segments
of EEG recordings taken from either the pre-stimulation period or the
post-stimulation period. Due to the gradual development of epilepsy, there is
enormous overlap of the EEG patterns before and after the stimulation. Hence, a
prediction aggregation process is introduced, which pools predictions over a
longer period. By aggregating predictions over one hour, our approach achieves
an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 on the EPG detection task. This
demonstrates the feasibility of EPG prediction from EEG recordings.

processes in the evolution of very massive stars through the imprints they
leave on their final remnants. Stellar evolution theory predicts the existence
of a gap in the black hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects of
pair-instability. Previously, we showed that the location of the gap is robust
against model uncertainties, but it does depend sensitively on the uncertain
$^{12}\rm{C}\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ rate. This rate is of
great astrophysical significance and governs the production of oxygen at the
expense of carbon. We use the open source MESA stellar evolution code to evolve
massive helium stars to probe the location of the mass gap. We find that the
maximum black hole mass below the gap varies between $40\rm{M}_\odot$ to
$90\rm{M}_\odot$, depending on the strength of the uncertain
$^{12}\rm{C}\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$ reaction rate. With the

detected binary black hole mergers, we expect to constrain the S-factor to
within $\pm10$-$30\rm{\,keV\, barns}$. We also highlight a role for independent
constraints from electromagnetic transient surveys. The unambiguous detection
of pulsational pair instability supernovae would imply that
$S_{300}>79\rm{\,keV\, barns}$. Degeneracies with other model uncertainties
need to be investigated further, but probing nuclear stellar astrophysics poses
a promising science case for the future gravitational wave detectors.

populations that will eventually reach the field. We use Gaia DR2 data to
select members of three open clusters, Alpha~Per, the Pleiades and Praesepe and
to flag cluster members that are likely unresolved binaries due to
overluminosity or elevated astrometric noise. We then identify the resolved
wide binary population in each cluster, separating it from coincident pairings
of unrelated cluster members. We find that these clusters have an average wide
binary fraction in the 300-3000\,AU projected separation range of
2.1$\pm^{0.4}_{0.2}$\% increasing to 3.0$\pm^{0.8}_{0.7}$\% for primaries with

another open cluster (the Hyades) and two populations of young stars that
likely originated in looser associations (Young Moving Groups and the

the recently discovered Antlia 2 galaxy in cold dark matter (CDM) and
self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) scenarios. Our simulations contain six
benchmark models, where we vary the initial halo concentration and the
self-scattering cross section. We adopt well-motivated initial stellar and halo
masses, and our fiducial orbit has a small pericenter. After evolving in the
Milky Way's tidal field, the simulated galaxies experience significant mass
loss and their stellar distributions expand accordingly. These tidal effects
are more prominent if the initial halo concentration is lower and if the
self-scattering cross section is larger. Our results show that Antlia 2-like
galaxies could be realized in CDM if the halo concentration is low and the
stellar distribution is diffuse at the infall time, while these conditions
could be relaxed in SIDM. We also find all the simulated galaxies predict
approximately the same stellar velocity dispersion after imposing selection
criteria for stellar particles. This has important implications for testing
dark matter models using tidally disturbed systems.

network is an important part of wide-area monitoring. Although many
conventional machine learning techniques are very successful in classifying
events, they rely on extracting information from PMU data at control centers
and processing them through CPU/GPUs, which are highly inefficient in terms of
energy consumption. To solve this challenge without compromising accuracy, this
paper presents a novel methodology based on event-driven neuromorphic computing
architecture for classification of power system disturbances. A Spiking Neural
Network (SNN)-based computing framework is proposed, which exploits sparsity in
disturbances and promotes local event driven operation for unsupervised
learning and inference from incoming data. Spatio-temporal information of PMU
signals is first extracted and encoded into spike trains and classification is
achieved with SNN-based supervised and unsupervised learning framework.
Moreover, a QR decomposition-based selection technique is proposed to identify
signals participating in the low rank subspace of multiple disturbance events.
Performance of the proposed method is validated on data collected from a
16-machine, 5-area New England-New York system.

rays (CRs). SNR shocks accelerate CR protons and electrons which reveal key
insights into the non-thermal physics by means of their synchrotron and
$\gamma$-ray emission. The remnant SN 1006 is an ideal particle acceleration
laboratory because it is observed across all electromagnetic wavelengths from
radio to $\gamma$-rays. We perform three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) simulations where we include CR protons and follow the CR electron
spectrum. By matching the observed morphology and non-thermal spectrum of SN
1006 in radio, X-rays and $\gamma$-rays, we gain new insight into CR electron
acceleration and magnetic field amplification. 1. We show that a mixed
leptonic-hadronic model is responsible for the $\gamma$-ray radiation: while
leptonic inverse-Compton emission and hadronic pion-decay emission contribute
equally at GeV energies observed by Fermi, TeV energies observed by imaging air
Cherenkov telescopes are hadronically dominated. 2. We show that quasi-parallel
acceleration (i.e., when the shock propagates at a narrow angle to the upstream
magnetic field) is preferred for CR electrons and that the electron
acceleration efficiency of radio-emitting GeV electrons at quasi-perpendicular
shocks is suppressed at least by a factor ten. This precludes extrapolation of
current one-dimensional plasma particle-in-cell simulations of shock
acceleration to realistic SNR conditions. 3. To match the radial emission
profiles and the $\gamma$-ray spectrum, we require a volume-filling,
turbulently amplified magnetic field and that the Bell-amplified magnetic field
is damped in the immediate post-shock region. Our work connects micro-scale

by the influence of spiral patterns and bar, we study the kinematics of the
stellar disc in a set of spiral galaxy models specifically tailored for this
purpose. We find that, for our models, the induced non-circular motions are
more prominent for spirals with larger pitch angle, the ones typical in late
type galaxies. Moreover, inside corotation, stars rotate slower along the
spiral arms than along the inter-arm, which translates into a local minima or
maxima in the RC, respectively. We also see, from off-plane RC, that the
rotation is faster for stars that at observed closer to the plane, and
diminishes as one looks farther off plane; this trend is more noticeable in our
Sa galaxy model than our Sc galaxy model. Additionally, in a previous work we
found that the diagonal ridges in the $V_{\phi}-R$ plane, revealed through the
Gaia DR2, have a resonant origin due to the spiral arms and bar and that these
ridges project themselves as wiggles in the RC; here, we further notice that
the development of these ridges, and the development of high orbital
eccentricities in the stellar disc are the same. Hence, we conclude that, the
following explanations of bumps and wiggles in RCs are equivalent: they are
manifestations of diagonal ridges in the $V_{\phi}-R$ plane, or of the
rearrangement of the orbital eccentricities in the stellar disc.

which will emit the gravitational wave later at the coalescence. Recent
detections of a few candidates for the ultra-stripped SN have constrained the
properties of the explosion and the progenitor, but little information is given
as to whether the remnant DNS binary will merge within the cosmic age. A large
fraction of the material stripped away from the helium star through the binary
interaction is expected to escape from the system and form circumstellar
material (CSM). The CSM should be traced by radio emission induced by the
collision with the SN ejecta. Based on the stellar evolution models previously
developed, we calculate the expected radio luminosities from ultra-stripped
SNe. We find that high radio luminosity at its maximum can be an indicator of
small separation of a DNS binary leading to its merger within the cosmic age.
Our results can be used to optimize the strategy for the radio follow-up
observations such as observational epochs and frequencies.

fading in the UV/optical, the X-ray flux increased by over an order of
magnitude $\sim$225 d after peak, resulting from the expansion of the X-ray
emitting region. The late-time X-ray emission is well fitted by a blackbody
with an effective radius of $\sim1 \times 10^{12} \text{ cm}$ and a temperature
of $\sim6 \times 10^{5} \text{ K}$. The X-ray hardness ratio becomes softer

equations where the ISM and clusters are modeled self-consistently. To this
end, we employ a Solar neighborhood model of TIGRESS, a magnetohydrodynamic
simulation of the multiphase, star-forming ISM, and post-process the simulation
with an adaptive ray tracing method to transfer UV radiation from star
clusters. We find that the WIM volume filling factor is highly variable, and
sensitive to the rate of ionizing photon production and ISM structure. The mean
WIM volume filling factor rises to ~0.15 at |z|~1 kpc. Approximately half of
ionizing photons are absorbed by gas and half by dust; the cumulative ionizing
photon escape fraction is 1.1%. Our time-averaged synthetic H$\alpha$ line
profile matches WHAM observations on the redshifted (outflowing) side, but has
insufficient intensity on the blueshifted side. Our simulation matches the
Dickey-Lockman neutral density profile well, but only a small fraction of
snapshots have high-altitude WIM density consistent with Reynolds Layer
estimates. We compute a clumping correction factor C = <n_e>/sqrt<n_e^2>~0.2
that is remarkably constant with distance from the midplane and time; this can
be used to improve estimates of ionized gas mass and mean electron density from
observed H$\alpha$ surface brightness profiles in edge-on galaxies.

interactions. They are capable of providing several fundamental and practical
novel features when the mechanical oscillator is cooled down to nearly reach
its ground state. In this framework, measuring the effective temperature of the
oscillator is perhaps the most relevant step in the characterization of those
systems. In conventional schemes, the cavity is driven strongly, and the
overall system is well-described by a linear (Gaussian preserving) Hamiltonian.
Here, we depart from this regime by considering an undriven optomechanical
system via non-Gaussian radiation-pressure interaction. To measure the
temperature of the mechanical oscillator, initially in a thermal state, we use
light as a probe to coherently interact with it and create an entangled state.
We show that the optical probe gets a nonlinear phase, resulting from the
non-Gaussian interaction, and undergoes an incoherent phase diffusion process.
To efficiently infer the temperature from the entangled light-matter state, we
propose using a nonlinear Kerr medium before a homodyne detector. Remarkably,
placing the Kerr medium enhances the precision to nearly saturate the ultimate
quantum bound given by the quantum Fisher information. Furthermore, it also
simplifies the thermometry procedure as it makes the choice of the homodyne
local phase independent of the temperature, which avoids the need for adaptive
sensing protocols.

curves is one-to-one with remarkably little scatter, implying that the dynamics
of a system can be predicted simply by measuring its density profile as traced
by e.g. stellar light or gas emission lines. Extending the relation to
accelerations below those usually probed by practically observable kinematic
tracers is challenging, especially once accounting for faintly emitting
baryons, such as the putative warm-hot intergalactic medium, becomes important.
We show that in the low-acceleration regime, the (inverted) RAR predicts an
unphysical, declining enclosed baryonic mass profile for systems with
`observed' acceleration profiles steeper than $g_{\rm obs}\propto r^{-1}$
(corresponding to density profiles steeper than isothermal - $\rho(r)\propto
r^{-2}$). If the RAR is tantamount to a natural law, such acceleration profiles
cannot exist. We apply this argument to test the compatibility of an
extrapolation of the rotation curve-derived RAR to low accelerations with data
from galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, dwarf spheroidal galaxy stellar kinematic, and
outer Milky~Way dynamical measurements, fully independent of the uncertainties
inherent in direct measurements of the baryonic matter distribution. In all

study the origin and dynamical evolution of NSs, within clusters with different
initial masses, metallicities, primordial binary fractions, and prescriptions
for the compact object natal kicks at birth. We find that the radial profile of
NSs is shaped by the BH content of the cluster, which partially quenches the NS
segregation due to the BH-burning process. This leaves most of the NSs out of
the densest cluster regions, where NS-NS and BH-NS binaries could potentially
form. Due to a large velocity kick that they receive at birth, most of the NSs
escape the host clusters, with the bulk of their retained population made up of
NSs of $\sim 1.3$ M$_\odot$ coming from the electron-capture supernova process.
The details of the primordial binary fraction and pairing can smear out this

remove them altogether. We therefore provide a solution for exploring new
physics \emph{during} data compression. In particular, we store additional
agnostic compressed data points, selected to enable precise constraints of
non-standard physics at a later date. Our procedure is based on the maximal
compression of the MOPED algorithm, which optimally filters the data with
respect to a baseline model. We select additional filters, based on a
generalised principal component analysis, which are carefully constructed to
scout for new physics at high precision and speed. We refer to the augmented

evidences that may indicate the presence of new physics, and fast analytic
estimates of best-fitting parameters when adopting a specific non-standard
theory, without further expensive MCMC analysis. As there may be large numbers

a strong sensitivity to environmental conditions and thus characterization of
the devices based on these materials usually requires measurement systems
operating in high-vacuum. However, conventional optoelectronic probe-station
testing systems are are not compatible with high vacuum operation and
vacuum-compatible versions are rather expensive. Here, we present a high-vacuum
system specifically designed to test electronic and optoelectronic devices
based on 2D materials. This system can be implemented with low budget and it is
mostly based on the assembly of commercially available standard vacuum and

capabilities to characterize optoelectronic devices in a broad range of
wavelengths with fast pumping/venting speed and possibility of modulating the

training set, along with the desired class label. Despite the increasing number
of studies on backdoor attacks and defenses, the underlying factors affecting
the success of backdoor attacks, along with their impact on the learning
algorithm, are not yet well understood. In this work, we aim to shed light on
this issue by unveiling that backdoor attacks induce a smoother decision
function around the triggered samples -- a phenomenon which we refer to as
\textit{backdoor smoothing}. To quantify backdoor smoothing, we define a
measure that evaluates the uncertainty associated to the predictions of a
classifier around the input samples.
  Our experiments show that smoothness increases when the trigger is added to
the input samples, and that this phenomenon is more pronounced for more
successful attacks.
  We also provide preliminary evidence that backdoor triggers are not the only
smoothing-inducing patterns, but that also other artificial patterns can be
detected by our approach, paving the way towards understanding the limitations
of current defenses and designing novel ones.

proving the existence of an invariant set and exponential convergence rates

ordinary differential equation (ODE) with a preconditioner built-in and show
that PAGD is an explicit time-discretization of this ODE, which requires a
natural time step restriction for energy stability. At the continuous time
level, we show an exponential convergence of the ODE solution to its steady
state using a simple energy argument. At the discrete level, assuming the
aforementioned step size restriction, the existence of an invariant set is
proved and a matching exponential rate of convergence of the PAGD scheme is
derived by mimicking the energy argument and the convergence at the continuous
level. Applications of the PAGD method to numerical PDEs are demonstrated with
certain nonlinear elliptic PDEs using pseudo-spectral methods for spatial
discretization, and several numerical experiments are conducted. The results
confirm the global geometric and mesh size-independent convergence of the PAGD

We develop our analysis by means of the gravitational decoupling approach. We
find that trivial deformations of the seed Schwarzschild vacuum preserve the
energy conditions and provide a new mechanism to evade the no-hair theorem

transformations. Under the above conditions i) and ii), this charge
consistently increases the entropy from the minimum value given by the

treatments individually. However, trials of these combinations are lower
priority than the development of novel therapies, which can restrict funding,
timelines and patient availability. This paper develops a novel trial design to
facilitate the evaluation of novel combination therapies that combines elements
of phase II and phase III trials. Methods: This trial uses response adaptive
randomisation to increase the information collected about successful novel drug
combinations and Bayesian dose-response modelling to undertake a
comparative-effectiveness analysis for the most successful dose combination
against a relevant comparator. We used simulation methods to evaluate the
probability of selecting the correct optimal dose combination, the operating
characteristics and predictive power of this design for a trial in pain
management and sedation in paediatric emergency departments. Results: With 410
participants, 5 interim updates of the randomisation ratio and a probability of
effectiveness of 0.93, 0.88 and 0.83 for the three dose combinations, we have
an 83% chance of randomising the largest number of patients to the drug with
the highest probability of effectiveness. Based on this adaptive randomisation
procedure, the comparative effectiveness analysis has a type I error of less
than 5% and a 93% chance of correctly concluding non-inferiority when the
probability of effectiveness for the optimal combination therapy is 0.9. In
this case, the trial has a 77% chance of meeting its dual aims of dose finding

the dual study objectives within a feasible level of recruitment, minimising
the administrative burden and recruitment time for a trial.

existence of a multitude of dark matter 'subhaloes' around galaxies like the
Milky Way. A wide variety of observations have been proposed to look for the
gravitational effects such subhaloes would induce in observable matter. Most of
these approaches pertain to the stellar or cool gaseous phases of matter. Here
we propose a new approach, which is to search for the perturbations that such
dark subhaloes would source in the warm/hot circumgalactic medium (CGM) around
normal galaxies. With a combination of analytic theory, carefully-controlled
high-resolution idealised simulations, and full cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations (the ARTEMIS simulations), we calculate the expected signal and how
it depends on important physical parameters (subhalo mass, CGM temperature, and
relative velocity). We find that dark subhaloes enhance both the local CGM
temperature and density and, therefore, also the pressure. For the pressure and
density, the fluctuations can vary in magnitude from tens of percent (for
subhaloes with M_sub=10^10 Msun) to a few percent (for subhaloes with
M_sub=10^8 Msun), although this depends strongly on the CGM temperature. The
subhaloes also induce fluctuations in the velocity field ranging in magnitude
from a few km/s up to 25 km/s. We propose that X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
effect, radio dispersion measure, and quasar absorption line observations can
be used to measure these fluctuations and place constraints on the abundance
and distribution of dark subhaloes, thereby placing constraints on the nature
of dark matter.

linear convergence. To do so, we utilize recent linear convergence results
under weakened strong-convexity conditions, and further refine the relevant

The method relies on applying a matrix M to the first edge of the control

this method, sufficient conditions on the matrix $M$ are provided, which lead
to the definition of Class A curves, generalising a previous result by Mineur

rotation. However, Cao and Wang have shown counterexamples for such conditions.
In this paper, we revisit Farin's idea of using the subdivision algorithm to
relate the curvature at every point of the curve to the curvature at the
initial point in order to produce a closed formula for the curvature of planar
curves in terms of the eigenvalues of the matrix M and the seed vector for the
curve, the first edge of the control polygon. Moreover, we give new conditions
in order to produce planar curves with monotonic curvature. The main difference
is that we do not require our conditions on the eigenvalues to be preserved

solution based on temporal consistency is proposed. Specifically, in the
training stage, to integrate the temporal consistency constraint, a temporal
self-supervision loss and a class consistency loss are proposed in addition to
the softmax cross-entropy loss. In the deployment stage, a training-free
non-parametric uncertainty estimation module is developed to smooth the
predictions adaptively. Beyond the common evaluation approach, a video
segment-based evaluation is proposed to accommodate more practical scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrated that our solution is more robust against
several presentation attacks in various scenarios, and significantly
outperformed the state-of-the-art on multiple public datasets by at least 40%

In a second step we study the spectral properties of the Schr\""{o}dinger

unveiling the role played by the so-called Weyl coefficient. Indeed, in this

certified by solving a convex relaxation. If the relaxation is loose, however,
then the resulting certificate can be too conservative to be practically
useful. Recently, a less conservative robustness certificate was proposed,
based on a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of the ReLU activation
function. In this paper, we describe a geometric technique that determines
whether this SDP certificate is exact, meaning whether it provides both a
lower-bound on the size of the smallest adversarial perturbation, as well as a
globally optimal perturbation that attains the lower-bound. Concretely, we
show, for a least-squares restriction of the usual adversarial attack problem,
that the SDP relaxation amounts to the nonconvex projection of a point onto a
hyperbola. The resulting SDP certificate is exact if and only if the projection
of the point lies on the major axis of the hyperbola. Using this geometric
technique, we prove that the certificate is exact over a single hidden layer
under mild assumptions, and explain why it is usually conservative for several
hidden layers. We experimentally confirm our theoretical insights using a
general-purpose interior-point method and a custom rank-2 Burer-Monteiro
algorithm.

minimum residual method, we establish a global saddle point system instead of
computing optimal test functions element-by-element. This system allows us to
seek both the approximate solution of the KdV initial boundary value problem

distinguishes itself from other minimum residual methods by using globally
continuous Hilbert spaces, such as H1, while at the same time using broken

classical C0 continuous FE solutions. The unconditional stability of this

a statistically significant difference in curricular complexities exists

Currently, deep learning systems rely on vendor-provided kernel libraries or
various search strategies to get performant tensor programs. These approaches
either require significant engineering effort to develop platform-specific
optimization code or fall short of finding high-performance programs due to
restricted search space and ineffective exploration strategy.
  We present Ansor, a tensor program generation framework for deep learning
applications. Compared with existing search strategies, Ansor explores many
more optimization combinations by sampling programs from a hierarchical
representation of the search space. Ansor then fine-tunes the sampled programs
with evolutionary search and a learned cost model to identify the best
programs. Ansor can find high-performance programs that are outside the search
space of existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, Ansor utilizes a
task scheduler to simultaneously optimize multiple subgraphs in deep neural

instruments and material handling decisions of perioperative services are
critical to hospitals' service levels and costs. However, efficiently
integrating these decisions is challenging due to hospitals' interdependence
and the uncertainties they face. These challenges motivated the development of
this study to answer the following research questions: (R1) How does the
inventory level of surgical instruments, including owned, borrowed and
consigned, impact the efficiency of ORs? (R2) How do material handling
activities impact the efficiency of ORs? (R3) How do integrating decisions
about inventory and material handling impact the efficiency of ORs? Three
discrete event simulation models are developed here to address these questions.
Model 1, Current, assumes no coordination of material handling and inventory
decisions. Model 2, Two Batch, assumes partial coordination, and Model 3,
Just-In-Time (JIT), assumes full coordination. These models are verified and
validated using real life-data from a partnering hospital. A thorough numerical
analysis indicates that, in general, coordination of inventory management of
surgical instruments and material handling decisions has the potential to
improve the efficiency and reduce OR costs. More specifically, a JIT delivery
of instruments used in short-duration surgeries leads to lower inventory levels
without jeopardizing the service level provided.

transition generically arising in random, uncorrelated data. We apply our

revealing correlated gene clusters of diverse biological origin, including cell

show that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- TLS estimation
can be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and
Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the
minimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the
nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural
sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis

gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g.,
returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our
dual certifiers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex

complex biological systems. However, existing simulators do not always take
full advantage of modern hardware and often have a field-specific software
design.
  Results: We present a novel simulation platform called BioDynaMo that
alleviates both of these problems. BioDynaMo features a general-purpose and
high-performance simulation engine. We demonstrate that BioDynaMo can be used
to simulate use cases in: neuroscience, oncology, and epidemiology. For each
use case we validate our findings with experimental data or an analytical
solution. Our performance results show that BioDynaMo performs up to three
orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art baseline. This improvement
makes it feasible to simulate each use case with one billion agents on a single
server, showcasing the potential BioDynaMo has for computational biology
research.

new characterization of group strategy-proofness. In particular, an N-agent
mechanism is group strategy-proof if and only if all its two-agent marginal
mechanisms (defined by holding fixed all but two agents' preferences) are
individually strategy-proof and Pareto efficient. To illustrate their

generalized serial dictatorships, a new class of mechanisms. Our results also

high that the radiative feedback cannot reverse the accretion flow. This
extreme process is a promising mechanism for the rapid growth of seed BHs in
the early universe, which can explain high-redshift quasars powered by billion
solar mass BHs. In theoretical models, spherical symmetry is commonly adopted
for hyperaccretion flows; however, the sustainability of such structures on
timescales corresponding to the BH growth has not been addressed yet. Here we
show that stochastic interactions between the ionizing radiation from the BH
and nonuniform accretion flow can lead to the formation of a rotating gas disk
around the BH. Once the disk forms, the supply of gas to the BH preferentially
occurs via biconical-dominated accretion flow perpendicular to the disk,
avoiding the centrifugal barrier of the disk. Biconical-dominated accretion
flows from opposite directions collide in the vicinity of the BH supplying
high-density, low angular momentum gas to the BH, whereas most of the gas with
nonnegligible angular momentum is deflected to the rotationally supported
outflowing decretion disk. The disk becomes reinforced progressively as more
mass from the biconical flow transfers to the disk and some of the outflowing
gas from the disk is redirected to the biconical accretion funnels through a
meridional structure. This axisymmetric hydrodynamic structure of a
biconical-dominated accretion flow and decretion disk continues to provide
uninterrupted flow of high-density gas to the BH.

strongly convex objectives under the growth condition, which states that the
variance of stochastic gradient is bounded by a multiplicative part that grows
with the full gradient, and a constant additive part. Through the lens of the
growth condition, we investigate four widely used accelerated methods:
Nesterov's accelerated method (NAM), robust momentum method (RMM), accelerated
dual averaging method (ADAM), and implicit ADAM (iADAM). While these methods
are known to improve the convergence rate of SGD under the condition that the
stochastic gradient has bounded variance, it is not well understood how their
convergence rates are affected by the multiplicative noise. In this paper, we
show that these methods all converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with
accelerated convergence rates (compared to SGD) even under the growth
condition. In particular, NAM, RMM, iADAM enjoy acceleration only with a mild
multiplicative noise, while ADAM enjoys acceleration even with a large
multiplicative noise. Furthermore, we propose a generic tail-averaged scheme
that allows the accelerated rates of ADAM and iADAM to nearly attain the
theoretical lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor in the variance term).

minimization (ERM). We show that for unconstrained convex generalized linear
models (GLMs), one can obtain an excess empirical risk of $\tilde
O\left(\sqrt{{\texttt{rank}}}/\epsilon n\right)$, where ${\texttt{rank}}$ is
the rank of the feature matrix in the GLM problem, $n$ is the number of data
samples, and $\epsilon$ is the privacy parameter. This bound is attained via
differentially private gradient descent (DP-GD). Furthermore, via the first
lower bound for unconstrained private ERM, we show that our upper bound is
tight. In sharp contrast to the constrained ERM setting, there is no dependence
on the dimensionality of the ambient model space ($p$). (Notice that
${\texttt{rank}}\leq \min\{n, p\}$.) Besides, we obtain an analogous excess
population risk bound which depends on ${\texttt{rank}}$ instead of $p$.
  For the smooth non-convex GLM setting (i.e., where the objective function is
non-convex but preserves the GLM structure), we further show that DP-GD attains
a dimension-independent convergence of $\tilde
O\left(\sqrt{{\texttt{rank}}}/\epsilon n\right)$ to a
first-order-stationary-point of the underlying objective.
  Finally, we show that for convex GLMs, a variant of DP-GD commonly used in
practice (which involves clipping the individual gradients) also exhibits the
same dimension-independent convergence to the minimum of a well-defined
objective. To that end, we provide a structural lemma that characterizes the
effect of clipping on the optimization profile of DP-GD.

measurements: (i) the incompatibility robustness, connected to Bell violations,
and (ii) the randomness extractable from the outcomes. Since MUBs lie at the
core of several quantum information protocols, our results are of practical

magnetization measurements and single vortex imaging before and after 6 MeV
proton irradiation. The field dependence of the critical current density
($J_\mathrm{c}$) is analyzed through the strong pinning model, with which the
pristine sample is consistent. After the irradiation, the $J_\mathrm{c}$
aberrates from the strong pinning field dependence of $B^{-5/8}$, and evolves
to a weaker $B^{-1/3}$ dependence with an anomalous two-step behavior creating
a cusp like feature. The cusp coincides with the field of the local minima in
the normalized relaxation rate ($S$), manifested by increased pinning due to
increased intervortex interactions followed by fast vortex dynamics caused by
flux activation at higher fields. Furthermore, single vortex imaging reveals
that while long-range triangular correlation of the Abrikosov vortex lattice is
observed in pristine samples, irradiated samples exhibit a highly disordered
glassy vortex state which is more densely packed with increased pinning force.
These artificial defects incorporated via proton irradiation have the same
pinning effect as Co doping which not only shifts the pinning force to a higher
degree but also broadens its distribution, in contrast to P doping which only
broadens the pinning distribution without inducing a shift. All in all, through
this investigation, we provide a systematic understanding of the pinning
behavior in BaFe$_{2}$(As$_{0.67}$P$_{0.33}$)$_2$ through carefully controlling

the difference between the cumulative expected reward of the decision-maker and
that of an oracle with access to the expected reward of each action, over a
sequence of $T$ decisions. Linear Thompson Sampling (LinTS) is a popular
Bayesian heuristic, supported by theoretical analysis that shows its Bayesian
regret is bounded by $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$, matching minimax

bound for LinTS is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{dT})$, which requires
posterior variance inflation and is by a factor of $\sqrt{d}$ worse than the

possible, by demonstrating a randomization bias phenomenon in LinTS that can
cause linear regret without inflation.We propose a data-driven version of LinTS

be able to accurately compute materials properties with minimal empirical
information. First-principles approaches such as the density functional theory
(DFT) provide the best possible accuracy on electronic properties but they are
limited to systems up to a few hundreds, or at most thousands of atoms. On the
other hand, classical molecular dynamics (CMD) simulations and finite element
method (FEM) are extensively employed to study larger and more realistic
systems, but conversely depend on empirical information. Here, we show that
machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained over short ab-initio
molecular dynamics trajectories enable first-principles multiscale modeling, in
which DFT simulations can be hierarchically bridged to efficiently simulate
macroscopic structures. As a case study, we analyze the lattice thermal
conductivity of coplanar graphene/borophene heterostructures, recently
synthesized experimentally (Sci. Adv. 2019; 5: eaax6444), for which no viable
classical modeling alternative is presently available. Our MLIP-based approach
can efficiently predict the lattice thermal conductivity of graphene and
borophene pristine phases, the thermal conductance of complex
graphene/borophene interfaces and subsequently enable the study of effective
thermal transport along the heterostructures at continuum level. This work
highlights that MLIPs can be effectively and conveniently employed to enable
first-principles multiscale modeling via hierarchical employment of DFT/CMD/FEM
simulations, thus expanding the capability for computational design of novel
nanostructures.

  the Container Relocation Problems",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a new optimization model that integrates the multi-port
stowage planning problem with the container relocation problem. This problem is
formulated as a binary mathematical programming model that must find the
containers' move sequence so that the number of relocations during the whole
journey of a ship, as well as the associated port yards is minimized. Modeling
by binary variables to represent the cargo status in a ship and yards makes the
problem very complex to be solved by exact methods. To the best of our
knowledge, this integrated model has not been developed yet as that such
problems are always addressed in a partitioned or hierarchical way. A
demonstration of the benefits of an integrated approach is given. The model is
solved in two different commercial solvers and the results for randomly
generated instances are presented and compared to the hierarchical approach.
Two heuristics approaches are proposed to quickly generate feasible solutions
for warm-starting the model. Extensive computational tests are performed and
the results indicate that the solution approaches can reach optimal solutions
for small sized instances and good quality solutions on real-scale based
instances within reasonable computation time. This is a promising model to
support decisions in these problems in an integrated way.

broadband spectral energy distribution (SED) at $\nu_{\rm s} \geq
$10$^{17}$\,Hz. The BL~Lac object 1ES~2344+514 was included in the EHBL family
because of its impressive shift of the synchrotron peak in 1996. During the
following years, the source appeared to be in a low state without showing any
extreme behaviours. In August 2016, 1ES~2344+514 was detected with the
ground-based $\gamma$-ray telescope FACT during a high $\gamma$-ray state,
triggering multi-wavelength (MWL) observations. We studied the MWL light curves
of 1ES~2344+514 during the 2016 flaring state, using data from radio to VHE
$\gamma$ rays taken with OVRO, KAIT, KVA, NOT, some telescopes of the GASP-WEBT
collaboration at the Teide, Crimean, and St. Petersburg observatories,
\textit{Swift}-UVOT, \textit{Swift}-XRT, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, FACT and MAGIC.
With simultaneous observations of the flare, we built the broadband SED and
studied it in the framework of a leptonic and an hadronic model. The VHE
$\gamma$-ray observations show a flux level of 55\% of the Crab Nebula flux
above 300\,GeV, similar to the historical maximum of 1995. The combination of
MAGIC and \textit{Fermi}-LAT spectra provides an unprecedented characterization
of the inverse-Compton peak for this object during a flaring episode. The
$\Gamma$ index of the intrinsic spectrum in the VHE $\gamma$-ray band is
$2.04\pm0.12_{\rm stat}\pm0.15_{\rm sys}$. We find the source in an extreme
state with a shift of the position of the synchrotron peak to frequencies above
or equal to $10^{18}$\,Hz

interpretative power and reliability with respect to previously demonstrated
methods. BITE employs a forward model based on the pySTRAHL package, built on
the success of the well-known STRAHL code [Dux, IPP Report, 2004], to simulate
impurity transport in magnetically-confined plasmas. In this paper, we focus on
calcium (Ca, Z=20) Laser Blow-Off injections into Alcator C-Mod plasmas.
Multiple Ca atomic lines are diagnosed via high-resolution X-ray Imaging
Crystal Spectroscopy and Vacuum Ultra-Violet measurements. We analyze a
sawtoothing I-mode discharge for which neoclassical and turbulent (quasilinear

diffusion across the entire radial extent, while turbulent convection and

building CNN architectures that achieves full coupling of the channels, and
whose number of parameters is linearly proportional to the width of the

multilevel layer consisting of structured (i.e., grouped) convolutions. Our
examples from supervised image classification show that applying this strategy
to residual networks and MobileNetV2 considerably reduces the number of

hadron structure observables to the strong QCD mechanisms has been achieved
from the {\it ab initio} QCD description of hadron structure in a diverse array
of methods in order to expose emergent phenomena via quasi-particle formation.
The wealth of experimental data and the advances in hadron structure theory
make it possible to gain insight into strong interaction dynamics in the regime
of large quark-gluon coupling (the strong QCD regime), which will address the
most challenging problems of the Standard Model on the nature of the dominant
part of hadron mass, quark-gluon confinement, and the emergence of the ground
and excited state hadrons, as well as atomic nuclei, from QCD. This workshop
aimed to develop plans and to facilitate the future synergistic efforts between
experimentalists, phenomenologists, and theorists working on studies of hadron
spectroscopy and structure with the goal to connect the properties of hadrons
and atomic nuclei available from data to the strong QCD dynamics underlying
their emergence from QCD. These results pave the way for a future breakthrough
extension in the studies of QCD with an Electron-Ion Collider in the U.S.

knowledge that can be queried in a flexible way: after learning the parameters
of a graphical model once, new probabilistic queries can be answered at test
time without retraining. However, when using undirected PGMS with hidden
variables, two sources of error typically compound in all but the simplest
models (a) learning error (both computing the partition function and
integrating out the hidden variables is intractable); and (b) prediction error
(exact inference is also intractable). Here we introduce query training (QT), a
mechanism to learn a PGM that is optimized for the approximate inference
algorithm that will be paired with it. The resulting PGM is a worse model of
the data (as measured by the likelihood), but it is tuned to produce better
marginals for a given inference algorithm. Unlike prior works, our approach
preserves the querying flexibility of the original PGM: at test time, we can
estimate the marginal of any variable given any partial evidence. We
demonstrate experimentally that QT can be used to learn a challenging
8-connected grid Markov random field with hidden variables and that it
consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art AdVIL when tested on three
undirected models across multiple datasets.

risks, but are made complicated by deep uncertainties. One key uncertainty is
the choice of model structure used to estimate coastal hazards. Differences in
model structural choices contribute to uncertainty in estimated coastal hazard,
so it is important to characterize how model structural choice affects
estimates of ESL. Here, we present a collection of 36 ESL data sets, from tide
gauge stations along the United States East and Gulf Coasts. The data are
processed using both annual block maxima and peaks-over-thresholds approaches
for modeling distributions of extremes. We use these data sets to fit a suite
of potentially nonstationary extreme value models by covarying the ESL
statistics with multiple climate variables. We demonstrate how this data set
enables inquiry into deep uncertainty surrounding coastal hazards. For all of
the models and sites considered here, we find that accounting for changes in
the frequency of coastal extreme sea levels provides a better fit than using a
stationary extreme value model.

use the currently largest publicly available annotated dataset ChestX-ray14 of
112,120 chest radiographs of 30,805 patients. Each image was annotated with
either a 'NoFinding' class, or one or more of 14 thoracic pathology labels.
Subjects can have multiple pathologies, resulting in a multi-class, multi-label

ResNet34 architecture, pre-trained on ImageNet, where two key modifications
were incorporated into the training framework: (1) Stochastic gradient descent
with momentum and with restarts using cosine annealing, (2) Variable image
sizes for fine-tuning to prevent overfitting. Additionally, we use a heuristic
algorithm to select a good learning rate. Learning with restarts was used to
avoid local minima. Area Under receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC)

The proposed CCP model ensures that process requirements, which are impacted by
physical and chemical properties of biomass, are met most of the time. We
consider two problem settings, a centralized and a decentralized supply chain.
We propose a mixed-integer linear program to model the blending problem in the
centralized setting and a bilevel program to model the blending problem in the
decentralized setting. We use the sample average approximation (SAA) method to
approximate the chance constraints, and propose solution algorithms to solve
this approximation. We develop a case study for South Carolina using data
provided by the Billion Ton Study. Based on our results, the blends identified
consist mainly of pine and softwood residues. The cost of the centralized
supply chain is 2 to 6% lower, which shows that the assumption of centralized

of a finite subset $\mathcal{A} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, which generalize the
simplicial circuits of the affine-linear matroid induced by $\mathcal{A}$ to a
constrained setting. The $X$-circuits serve as the main tool in our analysis
and exhibit particularly rich combinatorial properties for polyhedral $X$, in
which case the set of $X$-circuits is comprised of one-dimensional cones of
suitable polyhedral fans.
  The framework of $X$-circuits transparently reveals when an $X$-nonnegative
conditional AM/GM-exponential can in fact be further decomposed as a sum of
simpler $X$-nonnegative signomials. We develop a duality theory for
$X$-circuits with connections to geometry of sets that are convex according to
the geometric mean. This theory provides an optimal power cone reconstruction
of conditional SAGE signomials when $X$ is polyhedral. In conjunction with a
notion of reduced $X$-circuits, the duality theory facilitates a
characterization of the extreme rays of conditional SAGE cones.

system utterances remains as a bottleneck. Reinforcement learning (RL) deals
with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the
success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the
comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when
improving the performance on fulfilling user requests. In our work, we (1)
propose modelling the hierarchical structure between dialogue policy and
natural language generator (NLG) with the option framework, called HDNO, where
the latent dialogue act is applied to avoid designing specific dialogue act
representations; (2) train HDNO via hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL),
as well as suggest the asynchronous updates between dialogue policy and NLG
during training to theoretically guarantee their convergence to a local
maximizer; and (3) propose using a discriminator modelled with language models

on MultiWoz 2.0 and MultiWoz 2.1, the datasets on multi-domain dialogues, in
comparison with word-level E2E model trained with RL, LaRL and HDSA, showing
improvements on the performance evaluated by automatic evaluation metrics and

convection cell on the dynamics of the large-scale circulation (LSC)
orientation $\theta_0$. The probability distribution of $\theta_0$ is measured,
and used to obtain a tilt-induced potential acting on $\theta_0$, which is used
in a low-dimensional model of diffusion of $\theta_0$ in a potential. The form
of the potential is sinusoidal in $\theta_0$, and linear in tilt angle for
small tilt angles, which is explained by a simple geometric model of the vector
direction of the mean buoyancy force acting on the LSC. However, the magnitude
of the tilt-induced forcing is found to be two orders of magnitude larger than
previously predicted. When this parameter is adjusted to match values obtained
from the probability distribution of $\theta_0$, the diffusive model can
quantitatively predict effects of tilt on $\theta_0$. In particular, tilt
causes a change in potential barrier height between neighboring corners of a
cubic cell, and changes in the barrier-crossing rate for $\theta_0$ to escape a
corner are predicted with an accuracy of $\pm30\%$. As a cylindrical cell is
tilted, the tilt-induced potential provides a restoring force which induces
oscillations when it exceeds the strength of damping; this critical tilt angle
is predicted within 20\%, and the prediction is consistent with measured
oscillation frequencies. These observations show that a self-consistent
low-dimensional model can be extended to include the dynamics of $\theta_0$ due
to tilt. However, the underprediction of the effect of tilt on $\theta_0$
warrants revisiting the predicted magnitude.

intensity scattering phase functions for these data as well as H-band data
previously taken by GPI. We find the polarized phase function becomes
increasingly more forward scattering as wavelength increases. We fit Mie and
distribution of hollow spheres grain (DHS) models to the extracted functions.
We find that while it is possible to describe generate a satisfactory model for
the total intensity using a DHS model, but not with a Mie model. We find that
no single grain population of DHS or Mie grains of arbitrary composition can
simultaneously reproduce the polarized fraction and total intensity scattering
phase functions, indicating the need for more sophisticated grain models.

approximately every sector of contemporary life. Applications of artificial
intelligence, blockchain technologies, and internet of things are promising to
accelerate digitalization further. As a consequence, the number of data
centers, which provide the services of data processing, storage, and
communication services, is also increasing rapidly. Because data centers are
energy-intensive with significant and growing electricity demand, an energy
model of data centers with temporal, spatial, and predictive analysis
capability is critical for guiding industry and governmental authorities for
making technology investment decisions. However, current models fail to provide
consistent and high dimensional energy analysis for data centers due to severe
data gaps. This can be further attributed to the lack of the modeling
capabilities for energy analysis of data center components including IT
equipment and data center cooling and power provisioning infrastructure in
current energy models. In this research, a technology-based modeling framework,
in hybrid with a data-driven approach, is proposed to address the knowledge
gaps in current data center energy models. The research aims to provide policy
makers and data center energy analysts with comprehensive understanding of data
center energy use and efficiency opportunities and a better understanding of
macro-level data center energy demand and energy saving potentials, in addition
to the technological barriers for adopting energy efficiency measures.

items and find sequential patterns; however, concrete location and time
information in the behavior log, reflecting dynamic and periodic patterns,
joint with the spatial dimension, can be useful for modeling users and
predicting their characteristics. In this work, we propose a novel model based
on graph neural networks for learning user representations from spatiotemporal
behavior data. A behavior log comprises a sequence of sessions; and a session
has a location, start time, end time, and a sequence of adopted items. Our
model's architecture incorporates two networked structures. One is a tripartite
network of items, sessions, and locations. The other is a hierarchical calendar
network of hour, week, and weekday nodes. It first aggregates embeddings of
location and items into session embeddings via the tripartite network, and then
generates user embeddings from the session embeddings via the calendar
structure. The user embeddings preserve spatial patterns and temporal patterns
of a variety of periodicity (e.g., hourly, weekly, and weekday patterns). It
adopts the attention mechanism to model complex interactions among the multiple
patterns in user behaviors. Experiments on real datasets (i.e., clicks on news
articles in a mobile app) show our approach outperforms strong baselines for
predicting missing demographic attributes.

For linear classification, we argue that analyzing convergence to the standard

this work, we first show that it is impossible to guarantee recourse without
access to the true structural equations. To address this limitation, we propose
two probabilistic approaches to select optimal actions that achieve recourse
with high probability given limited causal knowledge (e.g., only the causal
graph). The first captures uncertainty over structural equations under additive
Gaussian noise, and uses Bayesian model averaging to estimate the
counterfactual distribution. The second removes any assumptions on the
structural equations by instead computing the average effect of recourse
actions on individuals similar to the person who seeks recourse, leading to a
novel subpopulation-based interventional notion of recourse. We then derive a
gradient-based procedure for selecting optimal recourse actions, and
empirically show that the proposed approaches lead to more reliable
recommendations under imperfect causal knowledge than non-probabilistic
baselines.

Experiments with a range of deep neural architectures show that simple

of attention.
  We propose an analytically tractable model of query generation, AttEST, that
views both products and the query text as vectors embedded in a latent space.
We prove (and empirically validate) that the point-wise mutual information
(PMI) matrix of the AttEST query text embeddings displays a low-rank behavior

to derive a loss function that maximizes the mutual information between related
queries which is used to train an attention network to learn query embeddings.
This AttEST network beats traditional memory-based LSTM architectures by over
20% on F-1 score. We justify this out-performance by showing that the weights
from the attention mechanism correlate strongly with the weights of the best
linear unbiased estimator (BLUE) for the product vectors, and conclude that
attention plays an important role in variance reduction.

momentum converges to the minimizer at a faster $O(1/T)$ rate. When
interpolation is only approximately satisfied, constant step-size AMSGrad
converges to a neighbourhood of the solution at the same rate, while AdaGrad is
robust to the violation of interpolation. However, even for simple convex
problems satisfying interpolation, the empirical performance of both methods
heavily depends on the step-size and requires tuning, questioning their
adaptivity. We alleviate this problem by automatically determining the
step-size using stochastic line-search or Polyak step-sizes. With these
techniques, we prove that both AdaGrad and AMSGrad retain their convergence

be cast as an optimization problem over manifolds. Being able to incorporate
the underlying geometry for inference while addressing the need for robustness

proving a key lemma that characterizes some crucial properties of geometric

arms, instead of maximizing the expected total reward from $T$ pulls (the
traditional ""sum"" objective), we consider the vector of total rewards earned
from each of the $K$ arms at the end of $T$ pulls and aim to maximize the
expected highest total reward across arms (the ""max"" objective). For this
objective, we show that any policy must incur an instance-dependent asymptotic
regret of $\Omega(\log T)$ (with a higher instance-dependent constant compared
to the traditional objective) and a worst-case regret of
$\Omega(K^{1/3}T^{2/3})$. We then design an adaptive explore-then-commit policy
featuring exploration based on appropriately tuned confidence bounds on the
mean reward and an adaptive stopping criterion, which adapts to the problem
difficulty and achieves these bounds (up to logarithmic factors). We then
generalize our algorithmic insights to the problem of maximizing the expected
value of the average total reward of the top $m$ arms with the highest total
rewards. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our policies
compared to several natural alternatives in practical parameter regimes. We
discuss applications of these new objectives to the problem of grooming an

migration of natural satellites. They result from physical processes occurring
deep inside celestial bodies, whose effects are rarely observable from surface
imaging. For giant planet systems, the tidal migration rate is determined by
poorly understood dissipative processes in the planet, and standard theories
suggest an orbital expansion rate inversely proportional to the power 11/2 in
distance, implying little migration for outer moons such as Saturn's largest
moon, Titan. Here, we use two independent measurements obtained with the
Cassini spacecraft to measure Titan's orbital expansion rate. We find Titan
migrates away from Saturn at 11.3 $\pm$ 2.0 cm/year, corresponding to a tidal
quality factor of Saturn of Q $\simeq$ 100, and a migration timescale of
roughly 10 Gyr. This rapid orbital expansion suggests Titan formed
significantly closer to Saturn and has migrated outward to its current
position. Our results for Titan and five other moons agree with the predictions
of a resonance locking tidal theory, sustained by excitation of inertial waves
inside the planet. The associated tidal expansion is only weakly sensitive to
orbital distance, motivating a revision of the evolutionary history of Saturn's
moon system. The resonance locking mechanism could operate in other systems
such as stellar binaries and exoplanet systems, and it may allow for tidal
dissipation to occur at larger orbital separations than previously believed.

greater interpretability and the clustering of structured objects. Current
state-of-the-art $k$-medoids clustering algorithms, such as Partitioning Around
Medoids (PAM), are iterative and are quadratic in the dataset size $n$ for each
iteration, being prohibitively expensive for large datasets. We propose
BanditPAM, a randomized algorithm inspired by techniques from multi-armed
bandits, that reduces the complexity of each PAM iteration from $O(n^2)$ to
$O(n \log n)$ and returns the same results with high probability, under
assumptions on the data that often hold in practice. As such, BanditPAM matches
state-of-the-art clustering loss while reaching solutions much faster. We
empirically validate our results on several large real-world datasets,
including a coding exercise submissions dataset, the 10x Genomics 68k PBMC
single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
In these experiments, we observe that BanditPAM returns the same results as
state-of-the-art PAM-like algorithms up to 4x faster while performing up to
200x fewer distance computations. The improvements demonstrated by BanditPAM
enable $k$-medoids clustering on a wide range of applications, including
identifying cell types in large-scale single-cell data and providing scalable

  estimation",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surface registration, the task of aligning several multidimensional point
sets, is a necessary task in many scientific fields. In this work, a novel
statistical approach is developed to solve the problem of nonrigid
registration. While the application of an affine transformation results in
rigid registration, using a general nonlinear function to achieve nonrigid
registration is necessary when the point sets require deformations that change
over space. The use of a local likelihood-based approach using windowed
Gaussian processes provides a flexible way to accurately estimate the nonrigid
deformation. This strategy also makes registration of massive data sets
feasible by splitting the data into many subsets. The estimation results yield
spatially-varying local rigid registration parameters. Gaussian process surface
models are then fit to the parameter fields, allowing prediction of the
transformation parameters at unestimated locations, specifically at observation
locations in the unregistered data set. Applying these transformations results
in a global, nonrigid registration. A penalty on the transformation parameters
is included in the likelihood objective function. Combined with smoothing of
the local estimates from the surface models, the nonrigid registration model
can prevent the problem of overfitting. The efficacy of the nonrigid
registration method is tested in two simulation studies, varying the number of
windows and number of points, as well as the type of deformation. The nonrigid
method is applied to a pair of massive remote sensing elevation data sets
exhibiting complex geological terrain, with improved accuracy and uncertainty
quantification in a cross validation study versus two rigid registration
methods.

Motivated by real-world deployment of AI driven, social-network based suicide
prevention and landslide risk management interventions, this paper focuses on
robust graph covering problems subject to group fairness constraints. We show
that, in the absence of fairness constraints, state-of-the-art algorithms for
the robust graph covering problem result in biased node coverage: they tend to
discriminate individuals (nodes) based on membership in traditionally
marginalized groups. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel formulation of
the robust graph covering problem with group fairness constraints and a
tractable approximation scheme applicable to real-world instances. We provide a
formal analysis of the price of group fairness (PoF) for this problem, where we
show that uncertainty can lead to greater PoF. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on several real-world social networks. Our method yields
competitive node coverage while significantly improving group fairness relative
to state-of-the-art methods.

domain surveys will observe many of these UCBs. We present a new fast periodic
object search tool capable of searching for generic periodic signals based on
the Conditional Entropy algorithm. This new implementation allows for a grid
search over both the period ($P$) and the time derivative of the period
($\dot{P}$). To demonstrate the usage of this tool, we use a small, hand-picked
subset of a UCB population generated from the population synthesis code
\cosmic, as well as a custom catalog for varying periods at fixed intrinsic

domain surveys by using an existing eclipsing binary light curve model
accounting for the change in orbital period due to gravitational radiation. We
find that a search with $\dot{P}$ values is necessary for detecting binaries at
orbital periods less than $\sim$10 min. We also show it is useful in finding

the Udacity driving dataset. Our method, Feudal Steering, is inspired by recent
work in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that operate
on different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works at a
temporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a
higher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the
task into manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust
prediction. Temporal abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than
the steering angle at a single time instance. Composite actions comprise a
subroutine or skill that can be re-used throughout the driving sequence. The
associated subroutine id is the manager network's goal, so that the manager
seeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right turn, a slight
right turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered by
traffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker
network output which is regulated by the manager's high level task. We
demonstrate state-of-the art steering angle prediction results on the Udacity

example, in the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin operators and in the
Klein-Gordon equation. Often the use of a perturbative expansion is the only
recourse when dealing with them. In this work we show that under certain
conditions differential equations can be derived which can be used to find
perturbatively inaccessible approximations to operator square-roots.
Specifically, for the number operator $\hat n=\hat a^\dag a$ we show that the
square-root $\sqrt{\hat n}$ near $\hat n=0$ can be approximated by a polynomial
in $\hat n$. This result is unexpected because a Taylor expansion fails. A
polynomial expression in $\hat n$ is possible because $\hat n$ is an operator,
and its constituents $a$ and $a^\dag$ have a non-trivial commutator
$[a,a^\dag]=1$ and do not behave as scalars. We apply our approach to the zero
mass Klein-Gordon Hamiltonian in a constant magnetic field, and as a main
application, the Holstein-Primakoff representation of spin operators, where we
are able to find new expressions that are polynomial in bosonic operators. We
prove that these new expressions exactly reproduce spin operators. Our
expressions are manifestly Hermitian, which offer an advantage over other
methods, such as the Dyson-Maleev representation.

required students to follow the entire arc of an empirical research cycle

approach was used, where contact time is devoted to discussions and the

the flipped aspect of the instruction methods. We also include considerations

  Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020)",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pre-training is a dominant paradigm in computer vision. For example,
supervised ImageNet pre-training is commonly used to initialize the backbones
of object detection and segmentation models. He et al., however, show a
surprising result that ImageNet pre-training has limited impact on COCO object
detection. Here we investigate self-training as another method to utilize
additional data on the same setup and contrast it against ImageNet
pre-training. Our study reveals the generality and flexibility of self-training
with three additional insights: 1) stronger data augmentation and more labeled
data further diminish the value of pre-training, 2) unlike pre-training,
self-training is always helpful when using stronger data augmentation, in both
low-data and high-data regimes, and 3) in the case that pre-training is
helpful, self-training improves upon pre-training. For example, on the COCO
object detection dataset, pre-training benefits when we use one fifth of the
labeled data, and hurts accuracy when we use all labeled data. Self-training,
on the other hand, shows positive improvements from +1.3 to +3.4AP across all
dataset sizes. In other words, self-training works well exactly on the same
setup that pre-training does not work (using ImageNet to help COCO). On the
PASCAL segmentation dataset, which is a much smaller dataset than COCO, though
pre-training does help significantly, self-training improves upon the
pre-trained model. On COCO object detection, we achieve 54.3AP, an improvement
of +1.5AP over the strongest SpineNet model. On PASCAL segmentation, we achieve
90.5 mIOU, an improvement of +1.5% mIOU over the previous state-of-the-art
result by DeepLabv3+.

charge states, they hold great potential application in spintronics. There have
been tremendous efforts worldwide on searching for suitable candidates of SGSs.
In particularly, there is an increasing interest in searching for Dirac type
SGSs. In the past decade, a large number of Dirac or parabolic type SGSs have
been predicted by density functional theory and some of parabolic SGSs have
been experimentally demonstrated. The SGSs hold great potential for high speed

  Assuming smoothness and strong convexity, we prove rates of convergence for

partially frozen weights, named SemifreddoNets. SemifreddoNets work as
fully-pipelined hardware blocks that are optimized to have an efficient
hardware implementation. Those blocks freeze a certain portion of the
parameters at every layer and replace the corresponding multipliers with fixed
scalers. Fixing the weights reduces the silicon area, logic delay, and memory
requirements, leading to significant savings in cost and power consumption.
Unlike traditional layer-wise freezing approaches, SemifreddoNets make a
profitable trade between the cost and flexibility by having some of the weights
configurable at different scales and levels of abstraction in the model.
Although fixing the topology and some of the weights somewhat limits the
flexibility, we argue that the efficiency benefits of this strategy outweigh
the advantages of a fully configurable model for many use cases. Furthermore,
our system uses repeatable blocks, therefore it has the flexibility to adjust
model complexity without requiring any hardware change. The hardware
implementation of SemifreddoNets provides up to an order of magnitude reduction
in silicon area and power consumption as compared to their equivalent

data that capture the relations between entities being analyzed. Practical
graphs come in huge sizes, offer massive parallelism, and are stored in
sparse-matrix formats such as CSR. To exploit the massive parallelism,
developers are increasingly interested in using GPUs for graph traversal.
However, due to their sizes, graphs often do not fit into the GPU memory. Prior
works have either used input data pre-processing/partitioning or UVM to migrate
chunks of data from the host memory to the GPU memory. However, the large,
multi-dimensional, and sparse nature of graph data presents a major challenge
to these schemes and results in significant amplification of data movement and
reduced effective data throughput. In this work, we propose EMOGI, an
alternative approach to traverse graphs that do not fit in GPU memory using
direct cacheline-sized access to data stored in host memory. This paper
addresses the open question of whether a sufficiently large number of
overlapping cacheline-sized accesses can be sustained to 1) tolerate the long
latency to host memory, 2) fully utilize the available bandwidth, and 3)
achieve favorable execution performance. We analyze the data access patterns of
several graph traversal applications in GPU over PCIe using an FPGA to
understand the cause of poor external bandwidth utilization. By carefully
coalescing and aligning external memory requests, we show that we can minimize
the number of PCIe transactions and nearly fully utilize the PCIe bandwidth
even with direct cache-line accesses to the host memory. EMOGI achieves
2.92$\times$ speedup on average compared to the optimized UVM implementations
in various graph traversal applications. We also show that EMOGI scales better
than a UVM-based solution when the system uses higher bandwidth interconnects
such as PCIe 4.0.

bulk geometry converges to an $AdS_6$ spacetime whose cosmological constant is
produced by the torsion parameters. Furthermore, the torsion induces an
$AdS-dS$ transition on the exterior region. Inside the brane core, the torsion
produces an internal structure even for a single complex scalar field. As the
torsion parameters vary, the brane undergoes a phase transition leading to the
formation of ring-like structures. The bulk-brane Planck mass ration is
modified by the torsion. The analysis of the stress energy condition reveals a
splitting brane process satisfying the weak and strong energy conditions for
some values of the parameters. In addition, we investigate the behaviour of the
gravitational perturbations in this scenario. It turns out that the
gravitational spectrum has a linear behaviour for small masses and is
independent of the torsion parameters for large masses. In the bulk, the
torsion keeps a gapless non-localizable and stable tower of massive modes.
Inside the brane core the torsion produces new barriers and potential wells
leading to small amplitude massive modes and a massless mode localized around
the ring structures.

spectra are tidally locked. The atmospheres on tidally-locked planets likely
exhibit large differences between the day and night side of the planet, the
poles, and the morning versus evening terminators. In this paper, we illustrate
how the combined effects of aerosols and day-night temperature gradients shape
transit spectra of tidally-locked exoplanets when full 3D structures are taken
into account and evaluate the implications for retrievals of atmospheric
properties. To do this, we have developed a new code, METIS, which can compute
transit spectra for an arbitrary longitude-latitude-altitude grid of
temperatures and pressures. Using METIS, we pair flexible treatments of clouds
and hazes with simple parameterized day-night temperature gradients to compute
transit spectra and perform retrieval experiments across a wide array of
possible exoplanet atmospheric properties. Our key findings are that: (1) the
presence of aerosols typically increases the effects of day-night temperature
gradients on transit spectra; (2) ignoring day-night temperature gradients when
attempting to perform Bayesian parameter estimation will still return biased
results when aerosols are present, as has already been shown for clear
atmospheres in the literature; (3) when a day-night temperature gradient is
present and accounted for in the retrieval model, some transit spectra can
provide sufficient information to constrain temperatures and the width of the
transition from day to night. The presence of clouds and hazes can actually
tighten such constraints, but also weaken constraints on metallicity. This
paper represents a step towards the larger goal of developing models and theory

adversarial networks (GANs) often suffer from inferior performance due to
unstable training, especially for text generation. To solve this issue, we
propose a new variational GAN training framework which enjoys superior training
stability. Our approach is inspired by a connection of GANs and reinforcement
learning under a variational perspective. The connection leads to (1)
probability ratio clipping that regularizes generator training to prevent
excessively large updates, and (2) a sample re-weighting mechanism that
improves discriminator training by downplaying bad-quality fake samples.
Moreover, our variational GAN framework can provably overcome the training
issue in many GANs that an optimal discriminator cannot provide any informative
gradient to training generator. By plugging the training approach in diverse
state-of-the-art GAN architectures, we obtain significantly improved
performance over a range of tasks, including text generation, text style
transfer, and image generation.

complex architectures during early development to result in an organized and

formation of complex architecture in the developing brain is the emergence of
traveling spatio-temporal waves of neuronal activity across the growing brain.
Inspired by this strategy, we attempt to efficiently self-organize large neural
networks with an arbitrary number of layers into a wide variety of
architectures. To achieve this, we propose a modular tool-kit in the form of a
dynamical system that can be seamlessly stacked to assemble multi-layer neural
networks. The dynamical system encapsulates the dynamics of spiking units,
their inter/intra layer interactions as well as the plasticity rules that
control the flow of information between layers. The key features of our
tool-kit are (1) autonomous spatio-temporal waves across multiple layers
triggered by activity in the preceding layer and (2) Spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) learning rules that update the inter-layer connectivity based
on wave activity in the connecting layers. Our framework leads to the
self-organization of a wide variety of architectures, ranging from multi-layer
perceptrons to autoencoders. We also demonstrate that emergent waves can
self-organize spiking network architecture to perform unsupervised learning,

well-supported by popular autodiff systems, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.
Originally, these systems have been developed to compute derivatives of
differentiable functions, but in practice, they are commonly applied to
functions with non-differentiabilities. For instance, neural networks using
ReLU define non-differentiable functions in general, but the gradients of
losses involving those functions are computed using autodiff systems in
practice. This status quo raises a natural question: are autodiff systems
correct in any formal sense when they are applied to such non-differentiable
functions? In this paper, we provide a positive answer to this question. Using
counterexamples, we first point out flaws in often-used informal arguments,
such as: non-differentiabilities arising in deep learning do not cause any
issues because they form a measure-zero set. We then investigate a class of
functions, called PAP functions, that includes nearly all (possibly
non-differentiable) functions in deep learning nowadays. For these PAP
functions, we propose a new type of derivatives, called intensional
derivatives, and prove that these derivatives always exist and coincide with
standard derivatives for almost all inputs. We also show that these intensional
derivatives are what most autodiff systems compute or try to compute
essentially. In this way, we formally establish the correctness of autodiff
systems applied to non-differentiable functions.

disease(CAD) is commonly triggered by abnormal myocardial perfusion

variability of coronary artery perfusion distribution, opportunity exists to
better align anatomic stenosis with perfusion abnormalities to improve
revascularization decisions. This study aims to develop a 3D multi-modality
fusion approach to assist decision-making for PCI. Methods. Coronary arteries
from fluoroscopic angiography(FA) were reconstructed into 3D artery anatomy.
Left ventricular(LV) epicardial surface was extracted from SPECT. The 3D artery
anatomy was non-rigidly fused with the LV epicardial surface. The accuracy of
the 3D fusion was evaluated via both computer simulation and real patient data.
For technical validation, simulated FA and MPI were integrated and then
compared with the ground truth from a digital phantom. For clinical validation,
FA and SPECT images were integrated and then compared with the ground truth
from CT angiograms. Results. In the technical evaluation, the distance-based
mismatch error between simulated fluoroscopy and phantom arteries is
1.86(SD:1.43)mm for left coronary arteries(LCA) and 2.21(SD:2.50)mm for right
coronary arteries(RCA). In the clinical validation, the distance-based mismatch
errors between the fluoroscopy and CT arteries were 3.84(SD:3.15)mm for LCA and
5.55(SD:3.64)mm for RCA. The presence of the corresponding fluoroscopy and CT
arteries in the AHA 17-segment model agreed well with a Kappa value of 0.91(95%
CI: 0.89-0.93) for LCA and 0.80(CI: 0.67-0.92) for RCA. Conclusions. Our fusion
approach is technically accurate to assist PCI decision-making and is
clinically feasible to be used in the catheterization laboratory. There is an
opportunity to improve the decision-making and outcomes of PCI in stable CAD.

latent factor based models which are effectively capture the global information

combined these two types of CF models to derive a hybrid model with the

major challenge in the field of computational drug repositioning, which
restricts the inference ability of relevant models. Inspired by the memory

the memory unit and the attention mechanism are combined to generate the

ancillary information of drugs and diseases can help to alleviate the cold

outperformed non-feature based unsupervised methods and achieved comparable
accuracy to skeleton-based supervised methods. However, such methods rely on
K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) associating sequences to actions, and general
features with no annotated data would correspond to approximate clusters which
could be further enhanced. Our system proposes an iterative semi-supervised
method to address this challenge and to actively learn the association of
clusters and actions. The method utilizes latent space embedding and clustering
of the unsupervised encoder-decoder to guide the selection of sequences to be
annotated in each iteration. Each iteration, the selection aims to enhance
action recognition accuracy while choosing a small number of sequences for
annotation. We test the approach on human skeleton-based action recognition

strong upper bounds on the uniform stability of the stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) algorithm on sufficiently smooth convex losses. These results led to
important progress in understanding of the generalization properties of SGD and
several applications to differentially private convex optimization for smooth
losses.
  Our work is the first to address uniform stability of SGD on {\em nonsmooth}
convex losses. Specifically, we provide sharp upper and lower bounds for
several forms of SGD and full-batch GD on arbitrary Lipschitz nonsmooth convex
losses. Our lower bounds show that, in the nonsmooth case, (S)GD can be
inherently less stable than in the smooth case. On the other hand, our upper
bounds show that (S)GD is sufficiently stable for deriving new and useful
bounds on generalization error. Most notably, we obtain the first
dimension-independent generalization bounds for multi-pass SGD in the nonsmooth
case. In addition, our bounds allow us to derive a new algorithm for
differentially private nonsmooth stochastic convex optimization with optimal
excess population risk. Our algorithm is simpler and more efficient than the

from any initial guess. However, the actual amount of data needed by this
theoretical guarantee is very pessimistic, as it must prevent spurious local
minima from existing anywhere, including at adversarial locations. In contrast,
prior work based on good initial guesses have more realistic data requirements,
because they allow spurious local minima to exist outside of a neighborhood of
the solution. In this paper, we quantify the relationship between the quality
of the initial guess and the corresponding reduction in data requirements.
Using the restricted isometry constant as a surrogate for sample complexity, we
compute a sharp threshold number of samples needed to prevent each specific

Optimizing the threshold over regions of the landscape, we see that for initial

scalable code-domain nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) with applications to
emerging low-capacity scenarios. The problem definition in this paper is
inspired by three major requirements of the next generations of wireless
networks. Firstly, the proposed scheme is particularly beneficial in
low-capacity regimes which is important in practical scenarios of utmost
interest such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and massive machine-type
communication (mMTC). Secondly, we employ code-domain NOMA to efficiently share
the scarce common resources among the users. Finally, the proposed recursive
approach enables code-domain NOMA with low-complexity detection algorithms that
are scalable with the number of users to satisfy the requirements of massive
connectivity. To this end, we propose a novel encoding and decoding scheme for
code-domain NOMA based on factorizing the pattern matrix, for assigning the
available resource elements to the users, as the Kronecker product of several
smaller factor matrices. As a result, both the pattern matrix design at the
transmitter side and the mixed symbols' detection at the receiver side can be
performed over matrices with dimensions that are much smaller than the overall
pattern matrix. Consequently, this leads to significant reduction in both the
complexity and the latency of the detection. We present the detection algorithm
for the general case of factor matrices. The proposed algorithm involves
several recursions each involving certain sets of equations corresponding to a
certain factor matrix. We then characterize the system performance in terms of
average sum rate, latency, and detection complexity. Our latency and complexity
analysis confirm the superiority of our proposed scheme in enabling large
pattern matrices.

Comments welcome",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uhlmann's fidelity function is one of the most widely used similarity
measures in quantum theory. One definition of this function is that it is the
minimum classical fidelity associated with a quantum-to-classical measurement
procedure of two quantum states. In 2010, Matsumoto introduced another fidelity
function which is dual to Uhlmann's in the sense that it is the maximimum
classical fidelity associated with a classical-to-quantum preparation procedure
for two quantum states. Matsumoto's fidelity can also be defined using the
well-established notion definition of the matrix geometric mean. In this work,
we examine Matsumoto's fidelity through the lens of semidefinite programming to
give simple proofs that it possesses many desirable properties for a similarity
measure, including monotonicity under quantum channels, joint concavity, and
unitary invariance. Finally, we provide a geometric interpretation of this
fidelity in terms of the Riemannian space of positive definite matrices, and
show how this picture can be useful in understanding some of its peculiar
properties.

of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) in hBN is induced by the index
contrast between the silicon waveguide and the surrounding air, thereby
eliminating the need for deleterious etching of the hBN. We verify the behavior
of HPhP waveguiding in both straight and curved trajectories, and validate
their propagation characteristics within an analytical waveguide theoretical

component of various e-commerce platforms, which aims to predict the next
interacted item based on a given session. Most of existing SR models only focus
on exploiting the consecutive items in a session interacted by a certain user,
to capture the transition pattern among the items. Although some of them have
been proven effective, the following two insights are often neglected. First, a
user's micro-behaviors, such as the manner in which the user locates an item,
the activities that the user commits on an item (e.g., reading comments, adding
to cart), offer fine-grained and deep understanding of the user's preference.
Second, the item attributes, also known as item knowledge, provide side
information to model the transition pattern among interacted items and
alleviate the data sparsity problem. These insights motivate us to propose a
novel SR model MKM-SR in this paper, which incorporates user Micro-behaviors
and item Knowledge into Multi-task learning for Session-based Recommendation.
Specifically, a given session is modeled on micro-behavior level in MKM-SR,
i.e., with a sequence of item-operation pairs rather than a sequence of items,
to capture the transition pattern in the session sufficiently. Furthermore, we
propose a multi-task learning paradigm to involve learning knowledge embeddings
which plays a role as an auxiliary task to promote the major task of SR. It
enables our model to obtain better session representations, resulting in more
precise SR recommendation results. The extensive evaluations on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate MKM-SR's superiority over the state-of-the-art SR models,
justifying the strategy of incorporating knowledge learning.

learning. Firstly, we extend the actor-critic architecture to actor-critic-N
architecture by introducing more critics beyond rewards. Secondly, we combine
the reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to formulate the
proposed potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning approach
(actor-critic-2). This can be seen as a combination of the model-based
gradients and the model-free gradients in policy improvement. State with large
potential field often contains a strong prior information, such as pointing to
the target at a long distance or avoiding collision by the side of an obstacle.
In this situation, we should trust potential-field-based critic more as policy
evaluation to accelerate policy improvement, where action policy tends to be
guided. For example, in practical application, learning to avoid obstacles
should be guided rather than learned by trial and error. State with small
potential filed is often lack of information, for example, at the local minimum
point or around the moving target. At this time, we should trust reward-based
critic as policy evaluation more to evaluate the long-term return. In this
case, action policy tends to explore. In addition, potential field evaluation
can be combined with planning to estimate a better state value function. In
this way, reward design can focus more on the final stage of reward, rather
than reward shaping or phased reward. Furthermore, potential field evaluation
can make up for the lack of communication in multi-agent cooperation problem,
i.e., multi-agent each has a reward-based critic and a relative unified
potential-field-based critic with prior information. Thirdly, simplified
experiments on predator-prey game demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

disentanglement with self-supervised learning to identify changes and

Specifically, we propose a new definition of disentanglement by formulating a

self-supervised learning in such a way that changes in a single factor induce
change along one direction in the representation space. We implement this
model, named Longitudinal Self-Supervised Learning (LSSL), via a standard
autoencoding structure with a cosine loss to disentangle brain age from the
image representation. We apply LSSL to two longitudinal neuroimaging studies to
highlight its strength in extracting the brain-age information from MRI and
revealing informative characteristics associated with neurodegenerative and
neuropsychological disorders. Moreover, the representations learned by LSSL
facilitate supervised classification by recording faster convergence and higher

has a significant influence on the dynamics of epidemic spreading. In the real
scenario, individuals have a different level of awareness for self-protection
when facing the outbreak of an epidemic. To investigate the effects of the
heterogeneous self-awareness distribution on the epidemic dynamics, we propose
a resource-epidemic coevolution model in this paper. We first study the effects
of the heterogeneous distributions of node degree and self-awareness on the
epidemic dynamics on artificial networks. Through extensive simulations, we
find that the heterogeneity of self-awareness distribution suppresses the
outbreak of an epidemic, and the heterogeneity of degree distribution enhances
the epidemic spreading. Next, we study how the correlation between node degree
and self-awareness affects the epidemic dynamics. The results reveal that when
the correlation is positive, the heterogeneity of self-awareness restrains the
epidemic spreading. While, when there is a significant negative correlation,
strong heterogeneous or strong homogeneous distribution of the self-awareness
is not conducive for disease suppression. We find an optimal heterogeneity of
self-awareness, at which the disease can be suppressed to the most extent.
Further research shows that the epidemic threshold increases monotonously when
the correlation changes from most negative to most positive, and a critical
value of the correlation coefficient is found. When the coefficient is below
the critical value, an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness exists;
otherwise, the epidemic threshold decreases monotonously with the decline of
the self-awareness heterogeneity. At last, we verify the results on four

neural architectures are hard to preserve in the latent space if architecture
representation learning and search are coupled, resulting in less effective

architecture representations using only neural architectures without their
accuracies as labels considerably improve the downstream architecture search
efficiency. To explain these observations, we visualize how unsupervised
architecture representation learning better encourages neural architectures
with similar connections and operators to cluster together. This helps to map
neural architectures with similar performance to the same regions in the latent

smooth, which considerably benefits diverse downstream search strategies.

voice conversion have significantly increased the usability of voice conversion
since the source and target DBs are no longer required for matching contents.
In this approach, the PPGs are used as the linguistic bridge between source and
target speaker features. However, this PPG-based non-parallel voice conversion
has some limitation that it needs two cascading networks at conversion time,
making it less suitable for real-time applications and vulnerable to source
speaker intelligibility at conversion stage. To address this limitation, we
propose a new non-parallel voice conversion technique that employs a single
neural network for direct source-to-target voice parameter mapping. With this
single network structure, the proposed approach can reduce both conversion time
and number of network parameters, which can be especially important factors in
embedded or real-time environments. Additionally, it improves the quality of
voice conversion by skipping the phone recognizer at conversion stage. It can
effectively prevent possible loss of phonetic information the PPG-based
indirect method suffers. Experiments show that our approach reduces number of
network parameters and conversion time by 41.9% and 44.5%, respectively, with
improved voice similarity over the original PPG-based method.

Our proposed two-layer framework differs from previous classification attempts
in three distinct ways: 1) the outputs of the two layers are combined using
Bayes' rule to choose the transportation mode with the largest posterior
probability; 2) the proposed framework combines the new extracted features with
traditionally used time domain features to create a pool of features; and 3) a
different subset of extracted features is used in each layer based on the
classified modes. Several machine learning techniques were used, including
k-nearest neighbor, classification and regression tree, support vector machine,
random forest, and a heterogeneous framework of random forest and support
vector machine. Results show that the classification accuracy of the proposed
framework outperforms traditional approaches. Transforming the time domain
features to the frequency domain also adds new features in a new space and
provides more control on the loss of information. Consequently, combining the
time domain and the frequency domain features in a large pool and then choosing
the best subset results in higher accuracy than using either domain alone. The
proposed two-layer classifier obtained a maximum classification accuracy of
97.02%.

the following advantages: (1) The methods are free from a production run: I.e.,
all snapshots from all iterations can be used for analyses. (2) The methods are
free from fine tuning of a weight function (probability distribution function

not used to proceed the iterative simulations. Thus, a canonical ensemble
(i.e., a thermally equilibrated ensemble) is generated from the resultant
snapshots. (4) If a poorly-sampled region emerges in sampling, selective
sampling can be performed focusing on the poorly-sampled region without

unexpected objects such as extrasolar planets and supernova in time domain
astronomy. Due to the rapid growth of data volume, traditional manual methods
are becoming extremely hard and infeasible for continuously analyzing
accumulated observation data. To meet such demands, we designed and implemented
a special tool named AstroCatR that can efficiently and flexibly reconstruct
time series data from large-scale astronomical catalogues. AstroCatR can load
original catalogue data from Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files or
databases, match each item to determine which object it belongs to, and finally
produce time series datasets. To support the high-performance parallel
processing of large-scale datasets, AstroCatR uses the extract-transform-load
(ETL) preprocessing module to create sky zone files and balance the workload.
The matching module uses the overlapped indexing method and an in-memory
reference table to improve accuracy and performance. The output of AstroCatR
can be stored in CSV files or be transformed other into formats as needed.
Simultaneously, the module-based software architecture ensures the flexibility
and scalability of AstroCatR. We evaluated AstroCatR with actual observation
data from The three Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST3). The experiments
demonstrate that AstroCatR can efficiently and flexibly reconstruct all time

because of overestimation bias and imprecise estimate. Specifically,
overestimation bias is from the maximum operator over noise estimate, which is
exaggerated using the estimate of a subsequent state. Inspired by the recent
advance of deep reinforcement learning and Double Q-learning, we introduce the
decorrelated double Q-learning (D2Q). Specifically, we introduce the
decorrelated regularization item to reduce the correlation between value
function approximators, which can lead to less biased estimation and low
variance. The experimental results on a suite of MuJoCo continuous control
tasks demonstrate that our decorrelated double Q-learning can effectively
improve the performance.

construction for Carr and Vempala's theorem that any feasible solution to the
IP's linear-programming relaxation, when scaled by the instance integrality

for studying the integrality gap of IP formulations. We demonstrate that with
experiments studying the integrality gap of two problems: optimally augmenting
a tree to a 2-edge-connected graph and finding a minimum-cost 2-edge-connected
multi-subgraph (2EC). We also give a simplified algorithm, Dom2IP, that more

their ability to learn multiple tasks sequentially. From the perspective of the
well established plasticity-stability dilemma, neural networks tend to be
overly plastic, lacking the stability necessary to prevent the forgetting of
previous knowledge, which means that as learning progresses, networks tend to
forget previously seen tasks. This phenomenon coined in the continual learning
literature, has attracted much attention lately, and several families of
approaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. However, there
has been limited prior work extensively analyzing the impact that different
training regimes -- learning rate, batch size, regularization method-- can have
on forgetting. In this work, we depart from the typical approach of altering
the learning algorithm to improve stability. Instead, we hypothesize that the
geometrical properties of the local minima found for each task play an
important role in the overall degree of forgetting. In particular, we study the
effect of dropout, learning rate decay, and batch size, on forming training
regimes that widen the tasks' local minima and consequently, on helping it not
to forget catastrophically. Our study provides practical insights to improve
stability via simple yet effective techniques that outperform alternative
baselines.

emission of the host star reproducing the non-detection of Ly$\alpha$ planetary
absorption. Methods: We model the escaping planetary atmosphere, the stellar
wind, and their interaction employing a multi-fluid, three-dimensional
hydrodynamic code. We assume a planetary atmosphere composed of hydrogen and
helium. We run models varying the stellar high-energy emission and stellar
mass-loss rate, further computing for each case the Ly$\alpha$ synthetic
planetary atmospheric absorption and comparing it with the observations.
Results: We find that a non-detection of Ly$\alpha$ in absorption employing the
stellar high-energy emission estimated from far-ultraviolet and X-ray data
requires a stellar wind with a stellar mass-loss rate about six times lower
than solar. This result is a consequence of the fact that, for $\pi$ Men c,
detectable Ly$\alpha$ absorption can be caused exclusively by energetic neutral
atoms, which become more abundant with increasing the velocity and/or the
density of the stellar wind. By considering, instead, that the star has a
solar-like wind, the non-detection requires a stellar ionising radiation about
four times higher than estimated. This is because, despite the fact that a
stronger stellar high-energy emission ionises hydrogen more rapidly, it also
increases the upper atmosphere heating and expansion, pushing the interaction
region with the stellar wind farther away from the planet, where the planet
atmospheric density that remains neutral becomes smaller and the production of
energetic neutral atoms less efficient. Conclusions: Comparing the results of
our grid of models with what is expected and estimated for the stellar wind and
high-energy emission, respectively, we support the idea that the atmosphere of
$\pi$ Men c is likely not hydrogen-dominated.

serious concern. For phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronized converters,
synchronization stability during grid faults requires that PLL can
resynchronize with the power grid. It is of great significance for meeting grid
code specifications such as reactive current support. However, the
synchronization in the context of high-impedance weak grid is not always
readily achieved. On one hand, the terminal voltage of converters is changeable
due to being susceptible to the output current. One the other hand, there is
interaction between multiple converters interconnected to the grid. Therefore,
loss of synchronism (LOS) of converters during grid faults likely occurs.
Previous research has investigated the LOS issue of single-converter
infinite-bus (SCIB) system, but mostly overlooked the interaction between
multiple converters. Previous efforts to address the issue of LOS are also in
doubt for multi-converter systems. This paper develops a multi-converter

processes taking values in a 2-smooth Banach space. As a first application we
prove that if $(S(t,s))_{0\leq s\leq T}$ is a $C_0$-evolution family of
contractions on a $2$-smooth Banach space $X$ and $(W_t)_{t\in [0,T]}$ is a
cylindrical Brownian motion on a probability space $(\Omega,P)$, then for every
$0<p<\infty$ there exists a constant $C_{p,X}$ such that for all progressively
measurable processes $g: [0,T]\times \Omega\to X$ the process $(\int_0^t
S(t,s)g_sdW_s)_{t\in [0,T]}$ has a continuous modification and $$E\sup_{t\in

p<\infty$ one may take $C_{p,X} = 10 D \sqrt{p},$ where $D$ is the constant in
the definition of $2$-smoothness for $X$.
  Our result improves and unifies several existing maximal estimates and is
even new in case $X$ is a Hilbert space. Similar results are obtained if the
driving martingale $g_tdW_t$ is replaced by more general $X$-valued martingales
$dM_t$. Moreover, our methods allow for random evolution systems, a setting
which appears to be completely new as far as maximal inequalities are
concerned.
  As a second application, for a large class of time discretisation schemes we
obtain stability and pathwise uniform convergence of time discretisation
schemes for solutions of linear SPDEs $$ du_t = A(t)u_tdt + g_tdW_t, \quad u_0
= 0,$$ Under spatial smoothness assumptions on the inhomogeneity $g$,
contractivity is not needed and explicit decay rates are obtained. In the
parabolic setting this sharpens several know estimates in the literature;
beyond the parabolic setting this seems to provide the first systematic
approach to pathwise uniform convergence to time discretisation schemes.

aggregating its neighbors, have become an effective computational tool in
downstream applications. Over-smoothing is one of the key issues which limit
the performance of GNNs as the number of layers increases. It is because the
stacked aggregators would make node representations converge to
indistinguishable vectors. Several attempts have been made to tackle the issue
by bringing linked node pairs close and unlinked pairs distinct. However, they
often ignore the intrinsic community structures and would result in sub-optimal
performance. The representations of nodes within the same community/class need
be similar to facilitate the classification, while different classes are
expected to be separated in embedding space. To bridge the gap, we introduce
two over-smoothing metrics and a novel technique, i.e., differentiable group
normalization (DGN). It normalizes nodes within the same group independently to
increase their smoothness, and separates node distributions among different
groups to significantly alleviate the over-smoothing issue. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that DGN makes GNN models more robust to
over-smoothing and achieves better performance with deeper GNNs.

problem. However, once launched in real applications, the high-accuracy pattern
recognition systems may become unstable and unreliable, due to the lack of
robustness in open and changing environments. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive review of research towards robust pattern recognition from the
perspective of breaking three basic and implicit assumptions: closed-world
assumption, independent and identically distributed assumption, and clean and
big data assumption, which form the foundation of most pattern recognition
models. Actually, our brain is robust at learning concepts continually and
incrementally, in complex, open and changing environments, with different
contexts, modalities and tasks, by showing only a few examples, under weak or
noisy supervision. These are the major differences between human intelligence
and machine intelligence, which are closely related to the above three
assumptions. After witnessing the significant progress in accuracy improvement
nowadays, this review paper will enable us to analyze the shortcomings and
limitations of current methods and identify future research directions for

evaluate a new policy using historical data obtained from behavior policies

not take this issue into account and are based on the assumption that samples

sequence, we consider using evaluation data or sample splitting with a two-step

paradigm, drawing tremendous attention in both academia and industry. A unique
characteristic of FL is heterogeneity, which resides in the various hardware
specifications and dynamic states across the participating devices.
Theoretically, heterogeneity can exert a huge influence on the FL training
process, e.g., causing a device unavailable for training or unable to upload
its model updates. Unfortunately, these impacts have never been systematically
studied and quantified in existing FL literature.
  In this paper, we carry out the first empirical study to characterize the
impacts of heterogeneity in FL. We collect large-scale data from 136k
smartphones that can faithfully reflect heterogeneity in real-world settings.
We also build a heterogeneity-aware FL platform that complies with the standard
FL protocol but with heterogeneity in consideration. Based on the data and the
platform, we conduct extensive experiments to compare the performance of
state-of-the-art FL algorithms under heterogeneity-aware and
heterogeneity-unaware settings. Results show that heterogeneity causes
non-trivial performance degradation in FL, including up to 9.2% accuracy drop,
2.32x lengthened training time, and undermined fairness. Furthermore, we
analyze potential impact factors and find that device failure and participant
bias are two potential factors for performance degradation. Our study provides
insightful implications for FL practitioners. On the one hand, our findings
suggest that FL algorithm designers consider necessary heterogeneity during the
evaluation. On the other hand, our findings urge system providers to design
specific mechanisms to mitigate the impacts of heterogeneity.

touching between the valence band and the conduction band when the Rashba SOC
is large enough to dominant the competition. We find that these touching points

between species where random fluctuations are relevant. The master equation
provides the evolution of the probability distribution across the discrete
state space consisting of vectors of population counts for each species.
However, since its exact solution is often elusive, several analytical
approximations have been proposed. The deterministic rate equation (DRE) gives
a macroscopic approximation as a compact system of differential equations that
estimate the average populations for each species, but it may be inaccurate in
the case of nonlinear interaction dynamics. Here we propose finite state
expansion (FSE), an analytical method mediating between the microscopic and the
macroscopic interpretations of a stochastic reaction network by coupling the
master equation dynamics of a chosen subset of the discrete state space with
the mean population dynamics of the DRE. An algorithm translates a network into
an expanded one where each discrete state is represented as a further distinct
species. This translation exactly preserves the stochastic dynamics, but the
DRE of the expanded network can be interpreted as a correction to the original
one. The effectiveness of FSE is demonstrated in models that challenge
state-of-the-art techniques due to intrinsic noise, multi-scale populations,

onto the intersection of the affine subspaces when the sum of the corresponding
linear subspaces is closed. Inspired by this, in this work, we systematically
study the relation between the projection onto intersection of halfspaces and
hyperplanes, and the composition of projections onto halfspaces and
hyperplanes. In addition, as by-products, we provide the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
conditions for characterizing the optimal solution of convex optimization with
finitely many equality and inequality constraints in Hilbert spaces and
construct an explicit formula for the projection onto the intersection of

problems. An important and timely special case is when the regressors are
overparameterized and perfectly interpolate their training data. We examine a
parameter transfer mechanism whereby a subset of the parameters of the target
task solution are constrained to the values learned for a related source task.
We analytically characterize the generalization error of the target task in
terms of the salient factors in the transfer learning architecture, i.e., the
number of examples available, the number of (free) parameters in each of the
tasks, the number of parameters transferred from the source to target task, and
the relation between the two tasks. Our non-asymptotic analysis shows that the
generalization error of the target task follows a two-dimensional double
descent trend (with respect to the number of free parameters in each of the
tasks) that is controlled by the transfer learning factors. Our analysis points
to specific cases where the transfer of parameters is beneficial as a
substitute for extra overparameterization (i.e., additional free parameters in
the target task). Specifically, we show that the usefulness of a transfer
learning setting is fragile and depends on a delicate interplay among the set
of transferred parameters, the relation between the tasks, and the true
solution. We also demonstrate that overparameterized transfer learning is not
necessarily more beneficial when the source task is closer or identical to the
target task.

temporal intervals of action classes with only video-level labels. To this end,
it is crucial to separate frames of action classes from the background frames
(i.e., frames not belonging to any action classes). In this paper, we present a
new perspective on background frames where they are modeled as
out-of-distribution samples regarding their inconsistency. Then, background
frames can be detected by estimating the probability of each frame being
out-of-distribution, known as uncertainty, but it is infeasible to directly
learn uncertainty without frame-level labels. To realize the uncertainty
learning in the weakly-supervised setting, we leverage the multiple instance
learning formulation. Moreover, we further introduce a background entropy loss
to better discriminate background frames by encouraging their in-distribution
(action) probabilities to be uniformly distributed over all action classes.
Experimental results show that our uncertainty modeling is effective at
alleviating the interference of background frames and brings a large
performance gain without bells and whistles. We demonstrate that our model

challenging because there are many appropriate responses for a given context.
Existing evaluation models merely compare the generated response with the
ground truth response and rate many of the appropriate responses as
inappropriate if they deviate from the ground truth. One approach to resolve
this problem is to consider the similarity of the generated response with the
conversational context. In this paper, we propose an automatic evaluation model
based on that idea and learn the model parameters from an unlabeled
conversation corpus. Our approach considers the speakers in defining the
different levels of similar context. We use a Twitter conversation corpus that
contains many speakers and conversations to test our evaluation model.
Experiments show that our model outperforms the other existing evaluation
metrics in terms of high correlation with human annotation scores. We also show
that our model trained on Twitter can be applied to movie dialogues without any
additional training. We provide our code and the learned parameters so that
they can be used for automatic evaluation of dialogue response generation

distance-based algorithms for inferring phylogenetic trees follow the
closest-pair joining scheme. This is one of the approaches used in hierarchical
clustering. And although phylogenetic inference algorithms may seem rather
different, the main difference among them resides on how one defines cluster
proximity and on which optimization criterion is used. Both cluster proximity
and optimization criteria rely often on a model of evolution. In this work we
review, and we provide an unified view of these algorithms. This is an

platforms using machine learning algorithms. The effectiveness of matching
algorithms heavily depends on the learned representations for the candidates
and job posts. In this paper, we propose to learn comprehensive and effective
representations of the candidates and job posts via feature fusion. First, in
addition to applying deep learning models for processing the free text in
resumes and job posts, which is adopted by existing methods, we extract
semantic entities from the whole resume (and job post) and then learn features
for them. By fusing the features from the free text and the entities, we get a
comprehensive representation for the information explicitly stated in the
resume and job post. Second, however, some information of a candidate or a job
may not be explicitly captured in the resume or job post. Nonetheless, the
historical applications including accepted and rejected cases can reveal some
implicit intentions of the candidates or recruiters. Therefore, we propose to
learn the representations of implicit intentions by processing the historical
applications using LSTM. Last, by fusing the representations for the explicit
and implicit intentions, we get a more comprehensive and effective
representation for person-job fit. Experiments over 10 months real data show
that our solution outperforms existing methods with a large margin. Ablation
studies confirm the contribution of each component of the fused representation.
The extracted semantic entities help interpret the matching results during the

analyze the effects of backdoor attacks on federated meta-learning, where users
train a model that can be adapted to different sets of output classes using
only a few examples. While the ability to adapt could, in principle, make
federated learning frameworks more robust to backdoor attacks (when new

successful and persist after additional training. To address these
vulnerabilities, we propose a defense mechanism inspired by matching networks,
where the class of an input is predicted from the similarity of its features
with a support set of labeled examples. By removing the decision logic from the

distribution of fluctuated intensities) are formed due to the interference of
light travelling along different optical paths, preventing the perception of
structure, absolute location and dimension of a target within or on the other
side of the medium. Currently, the prevailing techniques such as wavefront
shaping, optical phase conjugation, scattering matrix measurement, and speckle
autocorrelation imaging can only picture the target structure in the absence of
prior information. Here we show that a scattering medium can be conceptualized
as an assembly of randomly packed pinhole cameras, and the corresponding
speckle pattern is a superposition of randomly shifted pinhole images. This
provides a new perspective to bridge target, scattering medium, and speckle
pattern, allowing one to localize and profile a target quantitatively from
speckle patterns perceived from the other side of the scattering medium, which
is impossible with all existing methods. The method also allows us to interpret
some phenomena of diffusive light that are otherwise challenging to understand.
For example, why the morphological appearance of speckle patterns changes with
the target, why information is difficult to be extracted from thick scattering
media, and what determines the capability of seeing through scattering media.
In summary, the concept, whilst in its infancy, opens a new door to unveiling

downstream tasks, it remains unclear how they compare in terms of basic
perceptual abilities such as detection, figure-ground segmentation and tracking
of objects. To close this gap, we design a benchmark with four data sets of
varying complexity and seven additional test sets featuring challenging
tracking scenarios relevant for natural videos. Using this benchmark, we
compare the perceptual abilities of four object-centric approaches: ViMON, a
video-extension of MONet, based on recurrent spatial attention, OP3, which
exploits clustering via spatial mixture models, as well as TBA and SCALOR,
which use explicit factorization via spatial transformers. Our results suggest
that the architectures with unconstrained latent representations learn more
powerful representations in terms of object detection, segmentation and
tracking than the spatial transformer based architectures. We also observe that
none of the methods are able to gracefully handle the most challenging tracking
scenarios despite their synthetic nature, suggesting that our benchmark may

of one- and two-qubit gates and interactions. For most physical
implementations, however, it may be advantageous to explore state components
and interactions that depart from this universal paradigm and offer faster or
more robust access to more advanced operations on the system. In this article,
we show that adiabatic passage along the dark eigenstate of excitation exchange
interactions can be used to implement fast multi-qubit Toffoli (C$_k$-NOT) and
fan-out (C-NOT$^k$) gates. This mechanism can be realized by simultaneous
excitation of atoms to Rydberg levels, featuring resonant exchange interaction.
Our theoretical estimates and numerical simulations show that these multi-qubit
Rydberg gates are possible with errors below 1% for up to 20 qubits. The
excitation exchange mechanism is ubiquitous across experimental platforms and
we show that similar multi-qubit gates can be implemented in superconducting
circuits.

stationary covariance function. Although it is useful in modeling data, the
learning of the SM kernel is generally difficult because optimizing a large
number of parameters for the SM kernel typically induces an over-fitting,
particularly when a gradient-based optimization is used. Also, a longer
training time is required. To improve the training, we propose an approximate
Bayesian inference for the SM kernel. Specifically, we employ the variational
distribution of the spectral points to approximate SM kernel with a random
Fourier feature. We optimize the variational parameters by applying a
sampling-based variational inference to the derived evidence lower bound (ELBO)
estimator constructed from the approximate kernel. To improve the inference, we
further propose two additional strategies: (1) a sampling strategy of spectral
points to estimate the ELBO estimator reliably and thus its associated
gradient, and (2) an approximate natural gradient to accelerate the convergence
of the parameters. The proposed inference combined with two strategies
accelerates the convergence of the parameters and leads to better optimal
parameters.

practical performances prevents further understanding of existing optimizers
and the development of more advanced optimization methods. In this paper, we
provide adaptive gradient methods a novel analysis with an additional mild
assumption, and revise AdaGrad to \radagrad for matching a better provable
convergence rate. To find an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary
point in non-convex objectives, we prove random shuffling \radagrad achieves a
$\tilde{O}(T^{-1/2})$ convergence rate, which is significantly improved by
factors $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$ and $\tilde{O}(T^{-1/6})$ compared with existing
adaptive gradient methods and random shuffling SGD, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, it is the first time to demonstrate that adaptive gradient

Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the additional

Building on this viewpoint, this paper introduces a graph-based approach that
capitalizes on the idea that the graph topology of precursor molecules is
largely unaltered during a chemical reaction. The model first predicts the set
of graph edits transforming the target into incomplete molecules called
synthons. Next, the model learns to expand synthons into complete molecules by

probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) framework, a shaping device outputs
sequences that follow a certain nonuniform distribution. In case of
constant-composition (CC) distribution matching (CCDM), the sequences differ
only in the ordering of their constituent symbols, whereas the number of
occurrences of each symbol is constant in every output block. Recent results by
Amari \textit{et al.} have shown that the CCDM block length can have a
considerable impact on the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after fiber
transmission. So far, no explanation for this behavior has been presented.
Furthermore, the block-length dependence of the SNR seems not to be fully
aligned with previous results in the literature. This paper is devoted to a
detailed analysis of the nonlinear fiber interactions for CC sequences. We
confirm in fiber simulations the inverse proportionality of SNR with CCDM block
length and present two explanations. The first one, which only holds in the
short-length regime, is based on how two-dimensional symbols are generated from
shaped amplitudes in the PAS framework. The second, more general explanation
relates to an induced shuffling within a sequence, or equivalently a limited
concentration of identical symbols, that is an inherent property for short CC
blocks, yet not necessarily present for long blocks. This temporal property
results in weaker nonlinear interactions, and thus higher SNR, for short CC
sequences. For a typical multi-span fiber setup, the SNR difference is
numerically demonstrated to be up to 0.7dB. Finally, we evaluate a heuristic
figure of merit that captures the number of runs of identical symbols in a
concatenation of several CC sequences. For moderate block lengths up to
approximately 100 symbols, this metric suggests that limiting the number of
identical-symbol runs can be beneficial.

Balancing those non-confounders, including instrumental variables and

the learning of the student policy, albeit with the constraint that the teacher

we propose a new framework for transfer learning where the teacher and the
student can have arbitrarily different state- and action-spaces. To handle this
mismatch, we produce embeddings which can systematically extract knowledge from
the teacher policy and value networks, and blend it into the student networks.
To train the embeddings, we use a task-aligned loss and show that the

Using a set of challenging simulated robotic locomotion tasks involving

performance gap between distribution matching schemes and sphere shaping
techniques such as enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). HCSS is based on an
architecture that is different from the trellis-based setup of ESS. It allows
to tailor the used HCSS compositions to the transmission channel and to take
into account complexity constraints. We further discuss in detail multiset
ranking (MR) and subset ranking (SR) as alternatives to arithmetic-coding (AC)
CCDM. The advantage of MR over AC is that it requires less sequential
operations for mapping. SR operates on binary alphabets only, which can
introduce some additional rate loss when a nonbinary-to-binary transformation
is required. However, the binomial coefficients required for SR can be
precomputed and stored in a lookup table (LUT). We perform an analysis of rate
loss and decoding performance for the proposed techniques and compare them to
other prominent amplitude shaping schemes. For medium to long block lengths,
MR-HCSS and SR-HCSS are shown to have similar performance to ESS. SR-HCSS and

increases the interpretability of generative models such as Variational

work presents a representation learning framework that explicitly promotes
disentanglement by encouraging orthogonal directions of variations. The
proposed objective is the sum of an autoencoder error term along with a
Principal Component Analysis reconstruction error in the feature space. This

optimization problems such as the Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP) have
seen a surge of interest recently, but remain intractable and inefficient
beyond graphs with few hundreds of nodes. While state-of-the-art
learning-driven approaches for TSP perform closely to classical solvers when
trained on trivially small sizes, they are unable to generalize the learnt
policy to larger instances at practical scales. This work presents an
end-to-end neural combinatorial optimization pipeline that unifies several
recent papers in order to identify the inductive biases, model architectures
and learning algorithms that promote generalization to instances larger than
those seen in training. Our controlled experiments provide the first principled
investigation into such zero-shot generalization, revealing that extrapolating
beyond training data requires rethinking the neural combinatorial optimization
pipeline, from network layers and learning paradigms to evaluation protocols.
Additionally, we analyze recent advances in deep learning for routing problems
through the lens of our pipeline and provide new directions to stimulate future
research.

Additionally, the sensitivity is significantly enhanced around the mechanical
resonances of the cavity. We present experimental result of such an experiment

Furthermore, in the model of relaxion DM, we improve on existing constraints
over the whole DM mass range by about one order of magnitude, and up to six

compare probability distributions, the computational effort required to compute
them remains expensive, growing in general quadratically in the size $n$ of the
support of these distributions. Indeed, solving optimal transport (OT) with an
entropic regularization requires computing a $n\times n$ kernel matrix (the
neg-exponential of a $n\times n$ pairwise ground cost matrix) that is
repeatedly applied to a vector. We propose to use instead ground costs of the
form $c(x,y)=-\log\dotp{\varphi(x)}{\varphi(y)}$ where $\varphi$ is a map from
the ground space onto the positive orthant $\RR^r_+$, with $r\ll n$. This
choice yields, equivalently, a kernel $k(x,y)=\dotp{\varphi(x)}{\varphi(y)}$,
and ensures that the cost of Sinkhorn iterations scales as $O(nr)$. We show
that usual cost functions can be approximated using this form. Additionaly, we
take advantage of the fact that our approach yields approximation that remain
fully differentiable with respect to input distributions, as opposed to
previously proposed adaptive low-rank approximations of the kernel matrix, to
train a faster variant of OT-GAN \cite{salimans2018improving}.

arbitrary number of nodes, rather than just two. A large number of real-world
datasets are of this form - for example, list of recipients of emails sent from
an organization, users participating in a discussion thread or subject labels

  In this work, we empirically study a number of real-world hypergraph datasets

introduce the multi-level decomposition method, which represents each
hypergraph by a set of pairwise graphs. Each pairwise graph, which we refer to

subsets of k nodes. We empirically find that at each decomposition level, the
investigated hypergraphs obey five structural properties. These properties
serve as criteria for evaluating how realistic a hypergraph is, and establish a
foundation for the hypergraph generation problem. We also propose a hypergraph
generator that is remarkably simple but capable of fulfilling these evaluation
metrics, which are hardly achieved by other baseline generator models.

the mode the system is operating on, the output trajectory is generated by one

transmission and send the corrupted data to the cloud. We provide mathematical
tools (based on output-regulation techniques) to properly design distorting
mechanisms so that: 1) the original and distorted trajectories lead to the same

well to another task, set of queries, or dataset. In this work, we empirically

decomposition (PGD) is proposed to compute parametric solutions involving
turbulent incompressible flows of interest in an industrial context, using
OpenFOAM. The PGD framework is applied for the first time to the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations in the turbulent regime, to compute a generalised
solution for velocity, pressure and turbulent viscosity, explicitly depending
on the design parameters of the problem. In order to simulate flows of
industrial interest, a minimally intrusive implementation based on OpenFOAM
SIMPLE algorithm applied to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations with
the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model is devised. The resulting PGD strategy is
applied to parametric flow control problems and achieves both qualitative and
quantitative agreement with the full order OpenFOAM solution for
convection-dominated fully-developed turbulent incompressible flows, with
Reynolds number up to one million.

considers a seemingly unrelated regression model with measurement error in the
covariates and introduces two novel estimation methods: a pure Bayesian
algorithm (based on Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques) and its mean field
variational Bayes (MFVB) approximation. The MFVB method has the added advantage
of being computationally fast and can handle big data. An issue pertinent to
measurement error models is parameter identification, and this is resolved by
employing a prior distribution on the measurement error variance. The methods
are shown to perform well in multiple simulation studies, where we analyze the
impact on posterior estimates arising due to different values of reliability
ratio or variance of the true unobserved quantity used in the data generating
process. The paper further implements the proposed algorithms in an application
drawn from the health literature and shows that modeling measurement error in
the data can improve model fitting.

Videos showing individual fragments were available in some cases. The results
demonstrated that meteoroids do not fragment randomly but in two distinct
phases. The first phase typically corresponds to low strengths of 0.04 - 0.12
MPa. In 2/3 of cases, the first phase was catastrophic or nearly catastrophic
with at least 40% of mass lost. The second phase corresponds to 0.9 - 5 MPa for
confirmed meteorite falls and to somewhat lower strengths, from about 0.5 MPa

ordinary chondritic meteorites cited in the literature, 20 - 40 MPa. We
interpret the second phase as being due by cracks in meteoroids and the first

of a user identifier and an ad placement identifier. The real-world challenges
we had to tackle consist mainly of tracking the dependencies on both the user
and placement in an highly non-stationary environment and of dealing with
censored bid observations. These challenges led us to make the following design
choices: (i) we adopted a relatively simple non-parametric regression model of
auction revenue based on an incremental time-weighted matrix factorization
which implicitly builds adaptive users' and placements' profiles; (ii) we
jointly used a non-parametric model to estimate the first and second bids'
distribution when they are censored, based on an on-line extension of the
Aalen's Additive model.
  Our engine is a component of a deployed system handling hundreds of web

conflicts in concurrent systems. Traditionally, mutual exclusion algorithms
have been designed under the assumption that a process does not fail while
acquiring/releasing a lock or while executing its critical section. However,
failures do occur in real life, potentially leaving the lock in an inconsistent
state. This gives rise to the problem of \emph{recoverable mutual exclusion
(RME)} that involves designing a mutual exclusion algorithm that can tolerate
failures, while maintaining safety and liveness properties.
  One of the important measures of performance of any ME algorithm, including
an RME algorithm, is the number of \emph{remote memory references (RMRs)} made
by a process (for acquiring and releasing a lock as well as recovering the lock
structure after a failure). The best known RME algorithm solves the problem for
$n$ processes in sub-logarithmic number of RMRs, given by
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{\log n}{\log \log n})$, irrespective of the number of
failures in the system.
  In this work, we present a new algorithm for solving the RME problem whose
RMR complexity gradually \emph{adapts} to the number of failures that have
occurred in the system ""recently"". In the absence of failures, our algorithm
generates only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ RMRs. Furthermore, its RMR complexity is given

almost all governments worldwide to take drastic measures to respond to the

social and psychological tensions within populations. While the adopted
mitigation measures (including the lockdown) have generally proven useful,
policymakers are now facing a critical question: how and when to lift the
mitigation measures? A carefully-planned exit strategy is indeed necessary to
recover from the pandemic without risking a new outbreak. Classically, exit
strategies rely on mathematical modeling to predict the effect of public health
interventions. Such models are unfortunately known to be sensitive to some key
parameters, which are usually set based on rules-of-thumb.In this paper, we
propose to augment epidemiological forecasting with actual data-driven models
that will learn to fine-tune predictions for different contexts (e.g., per
country). We have therefore built a pandemic simulation and forecasting toolkit
that combines a deep learning estimation of the epidemiological parameters of
the disease in order to predict the cases and deaths, and a genetic algorithm
component searching for optimal trade-offs/policies between constraints and
objectives set by decision-makers. Replaying pandemic evolution in various
countries, we experimentally show that our approach yields predictions with
much lower error rates than pure epidemiological models in 75% of the cases and
achieves a 95% R2 score when the learning is transferred and tested on unseen
countries. When used for forecasting, this approach provides actionable
insights into the impact of individual measures and strategies.

the broadening of the switching current distributions. Aside from the high
potential for future applications, these findings raised fundamental questions
on the origin of these phenomena. To date, two complementary hypotheses are
under debate: an electrostatically-triggered orbital polarization at the

any direct injection of quasiparticles through the substrate thereby making
cold electron field emission through the vacuum the only possible charge
transport mechanism. With the aid of a fully numerical 3D model in combination
with the observed phenomenology and thermal considerations we can rule out,
with any realistic likelihood, the occurrence of cold electron field emission.
Excluding these two trivial phenomena is pivotal in light of understanding the
microscopic nature of gating effect in superconducting nanostructures, which
represents an unsolved puzzle in contemporary superconductivity. Yet, from the

sequential multi-label extreme learning machine (OSML-ELM) and stochastic
gradient descent (SGD), has achieved promising performance. However, these
works do not take label dependencies into consideration and lack a theoretical
analysis of loss functions. Accordingly, we propose a novel online metric
learning paradigm for multi-label classification to fill the current research
gap. Generally, we first propose a new metric for multi-label classification
which is based on $k$-Nearest Neighbour ($k$NN) and combined with large margin
principle. Then, we adapt it to the online settting to derive our model which
deals with massive volume ofstreaming data at a higher speed online.
Specifically, in order to learn the new $k$NN-based metric, we first project
instances in the training dataset into the label space, which make it possible
for the comparisons of instances and labels in the same dimension. After that,
we project both of them into a new lower dimension space simultaneously, which
enables us to extract the structure of dependencies between instances and
labels. Finally, we leverage the large margin and $k$NN principle to learn the
metric with an efficient optimization algorithm. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for our method.
Comprehensive experiments on a number of benchmark multi-label datasets
validate our theoretical approach and illustrate that our proposed online
metric learning (OML) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

defect-related transport mechanisms. Here is shown the fundamental role of the
microstructure of HZO films setting the balance between those contributions.
The oxide film presents coherent or incoherent grain boundaries, associated to
the existence of monoclinic and orthorhombic phases in HZO films, which are
dictated by the mismatch with the substrates for epitaxial growth. These grain
boundaries are the toggle that allows to obtain either large (up to 450 %) and
fully reversible genuine polarization controlled electroresistance when only
the orthorhombic phase is present or an irreversible and extremely large
(1000-100000 %) electroresistance when both phases coexist.

First of all, it is found using the overall data yields worse results, and

find data matching is crucial. Mandarin data is closely matched with the
Mandarin part in the code-switching data, while English data is not. However,
Mandarin data only helps on those utterances that are significantly

time-averaged spectral properties and relative duration. We then use the

finally analyze the time-resolved spectra of the most promising candidates. We
find no convincing lens candidates. The most similar pairs are single-pulsed
GRBs with relatively few time bins for the spectral analysis. This is best
explained by similarities within the GRB population rather than lensing.

employment of diverse base learners as value functions such as neural networks,
decision trees, or logistic regressions to reinforce the selection process of

mechanisms, including soft voting and stochastic choice to approximate optimal
sampling policy. The evaluation conducted on four datasets evidently highlights
the benefits of using RDS method over traditional sampling approaches. Our

intrinsically chaotic, the need to use ensemble methods is fundamental and
holds regardless of the duration of the simulations performed. We discuss the

ergodic rate in terms of OWC system parameters. We also develop an exact
integral-form expression of these performance metrics using the half-harmonic
mean of individual SNRs to validate the tightness of the derived analytical
expressions. The numerical and simulation analysis shows that the proposed
dual-hop relaying has significant performance improvement when comparing to the
direct transmission over considered channel impairments. Compared to the direct
transmission, the relay-assisted system requires almost $30$ times less
transmission power to achieve the same outage probability. The considered
system also provides a significant gain in the average SNR and ergodic rate for

GCNs tend to suffer performance drop when the model gets deep. Previous works
focus on PROPs to study and mitigate this issue, but the role of TRANs is
barely investigated. In this work, we study performance degradation of GCNs by
experimentally examining how stacking only TRANs or PROPs works. We find that
TRANs contribute significantly, or even more than PROPs, to declining
performance, and moreover that they tend to amplify node-wise feature variance
in GCNs, causing variance inflammation that we identify as a key factor for
causing performance drop. Motivated by such observations, we propose a
variance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which
scales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance
degradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow
ones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results
with shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and
can well generalize to other GNN architectures. Code is publicly available at

[0.003, 10]$, we observe the exponent $\chi\approx 1/2$, in agreement with
Spiegel's mixing length theory. For a no-slip bottom surface we observe a
transition from $\chi\approx 1/2$ for $Pr \leq 0.04$ to $\chi\approx 1/6$ for
$Pr \geq 0.04$, in agreement with scaling predictions by Bouillaut et al. The
latter scaling regime stems from heat accumulation in the stagnant layer
adjacent to a no-slip bottom boundary, which we characterise by comparing the
local contributions of diffusive and convective thermal fluxes.

teacher network to guide the learning of a student network, has emerged as an
important technique for model compression and transfer learning. Unlike
previous works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as activation and
attention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and
model-agnostic approach for extracting ""richer dark knowledge"" from the
pre-trained teacher model. We show that the seemingly different
self-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For example,
when performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy
predictions of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of
semantic and pose information. By exploiting the similarity between those
self-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively transfer the
hidden information from the teacher to the student. In this paper, we discuss
practical ways to exploit those noisy self-supervision signals with selective
transfer for distillation. We further show that self-supervision signals
improve conventional distillation with substantial gains under few-shot and
noisy-label scenarios. Given the richer knowledge mined from self-supervision,
our knowledge distillation approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
standard benchmarks, i.e., CIFAR100 and ImageNet, under both
similar-architecture and cross-architecture settings. The advantage is even
more pronounced under the cross-architecture setting, where our method
outperforms the state of the art CRD by an average of 2.3% in accuracy rate on

external source can influence the perturbation behavior is an interesting topic
to investigate. When the source acts as an initial pulse, it is intuitively
acceptable that the existing quasinormal frequencies will remain unchanged.
However, the confirmation of such an intuition is not trivial for the rotating
black hole, since the eigenvalues in the radial and angular parts of the master
equations are coupled. We show that for the rotating black holes, a moderate
source term in the master equation in the Laplace s-domain does not modify the
quasinormal modes. Furthermore, we generalize our discussions to the case where
the external source serves as a driving force. Different from an initial pulse,
an external source may further drive the system to experience new perturbation
modes. To be specific, novel dissipative singularities might be brought into
existence and enrich the pole structure. This is a physically relevant
scenario, due to its possible implication in modified gravity. Our arguments
are based on exploring the pole structure of the solution in the Laplace
s-domain with the presence of the external source. The analytical analyses are
verified numerically by solving the inhomogeneous differential equation and
extracting the dominant complex frequencies by employing the Prony method.

networks, backpropagation, is implausible for real neural networks: neurons
need to know their outgoing weights; training alternates between a bottom-up
forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning); and the
algorithm often needs precise labels of many data points. Biologically
plausible approximations to backpropagation, such as feedback alignment, solve
the weight transport problem, but not the other two. Thus, fully biologically
plausible learning rules have so far remained elusive. Here we present a family
of learning rules that does not suffer from any of these problems. It is
motivated by the information bottleneck principle (extended with kernel
methods), in which networks learn to compress the input as much as possible
without sacrificing prediction of the output. The resulting rules have a
3-factor Hebbian structure: they require pre- and post-synaptic firing rates
and an error signal - the third factor - consisting of a global teaching signal
and a layer-specific term, both available without a top-down pass. They do not
require precise labels; instead, they rely on the similarity between pairs of
desired outputs. Moreover, to obtain good performance on hard problems and
retain biological plausibility, our rules need divisive normalization - a known
feature of biological networks. Finally, simulations show that our rules
perform nearly as well as backpropagation on image classification tasks.

temperature was noted at heights within the surface layer during the passage of
a gust front in the afternoon time. Consequently, this temperature drop created
an interface which separated two different turbulent regimes. In one regime the
turbulent temperature fluctuations were large and energetic, whereas in the
other regime they were weak and quiescent. Given its uniqueness, we
investigated the size distribution and aggregation properties of the turbulent
structures related to these two regimes. We found that, the size distributions
of the turbulent structures for both of these regimes displayed a clear
power-law signature. Since power-laws are synonymous with scale-invariance,
this indicated the passing of the gust front initiated a scale-free response
which governed the turbulent characteristics of the temperature fluctuations.
We propose a hypothesis to link such behaviour with the self organized
criticality as observed in the complex systems. However, the temporal
organization of the turbulent structures, as indicated by their clustering
tendencies, differed between these two regimes. For the regime, corresponding
to large temperature fluctuations, the turbulent structures were significantly
clustered, whose clustering properties changed with height. Contrarily, for the
other regime where the temperature fluctuations were weak, the turbulent
structures remained less clustered with no discernible change being observed
with height.

allows multiple distributed devices to train models remotely, collaboratively,

weak conditional convergence can even be proved to be equivalent. Moreover, it
can be shown that every copula $C$ is the weak conditional limit of a sequence
of checkerboard copulas. After proving these three main results and pointing
out some consequences we sketch some implications for two recently introduced

dimensional output. The method is based on the privacy loss distribution
formalism and it uses the recently introduced fast Fourier transform based
accounting technique. We carry out an error analysis of the method in terms of
moment bounds of the privacy loss distribution which leads to rigorous lower
and upper bounds for the true $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-values. As an application,
we present a novel approach to accurate privacy accounting of the subsampled
Gaussian mechanism. This completes the previously proposed analysis by giving
strict lower and upper bounds for the privacy parameters. We demonstrate the
performance of the accountant on the binomial mechanism and show that our
approach allows decreasing noise variance up to 75 percent at equal privacy
compared to existing bounds in the literature. We also illustrate how to
compute tight bounds for the exponential mechanism applied to counting queries.

exfoliating transition metal dichalcogenides TMDs are an ideal playground for
elastic deformation, as they can sustain large elastic strains, up to a few

proven challenging for researchers to identify. We investigated 1T-ZrS2 and
1T-ZrSe2, exfoliable semiconductors with large bandgaps. Under compressive
deformation, both TMDs dramatically change their physical properties. 1T-ZrSe2
undergoes a reversible transformation into an exotic three-dimensional lattice,

experiment, the high packing density resulted in a `skimming flow' regime with
very little flow penetration into the canopy. This led to a surprisingly

process of bipolar and multi-polar planetary nebulae. There is growing
consensus that collimated jets create cavities with dense walls in the
slowly-expanding (10--20 ~km~s$^{-1}$) envelope ejected in previous
evolutionary phases, leading to the observed morphologies. However, the
launching of the jet and the way it interacts with the circumstellar material
to create such asymmetric morphologies have remained poorly known. Here we
present for the first time CO emission from the asymptotic giant branch star
W43A that traces the whole stream of a jet, from the vicinity of its driving
stellar system out to the regions where it shapes the circumstellar envelope.
We found that the jet has a launch velocity of 175~km~s$^{-1}$ and decelerates
to a velocity of 130~km~s$^{-1}$ as it interacts with circumstellar material.
The continuum emission reveals a bipolar shell with a compact bright dot in the
centre that pinpoints the location of the driving source of the jet. The
kinematical ages of the jet and the bipolar shell are equal,
$\tau$$\sim$60~years, indicating that they were created simultaneously,
probably by a common underlying mechanism, and in an extremely short time.
These results provide key initial conditions for the theoretical models that
aim to explain the formation of bipolar morphologies in the circumstellar
envelopes of low and intermediate mass stars.

deploy ML models in production, and adapt them to continuously changing data
sets, models, research techniques, software, and hardware. The CK concept is to
decompose complex systems and ad-hoc research projects into reusable
sub-components with unified APIs, CLI, and JSON meta description. Such
components can be connected into portable workflows using DevOps principles
combined with reusable automation actions, software detection plugins, meta
packages, and exposed optimization parameters. CK workflows can automatically
plug in different models, data and tools from different vendors while building,
running and benchmarking research code in a unified way across diverse
platforms and environments. Such workflows also help to perform whole system
optimization, reproduce results, and compare them using public or private
scoreboards on the CK platform (https://cKnowledge.io). For example, the
modular CK approach was successfully validated with industrial partners to
automatically co-design and optimize software, hardware, and machine learning
models for reproducible and efficient object detection in terms of speed,
accuracy, energy, size, and other characteristics. The long-term goal is to
simplify and accelerate the development and deployment of ML models and systems

spectral resolutions such that thermal broadening becomes relevant. The
inversion methods are compared on synthetic data (generated with the lognormal

the iterative Gauss-Newton method offers the most accurate reconstruction, in
particular at small S/N, but has also the largest numerical complexity and
requires the strongest assumptions. The other two algorithms are faster,
comparably precise at small noise-levels, and, in the case of the statistical
approach, more robust against inaccurate assumptions on the thermal history of
the intergalactic medium (IGM). We use these results to refine the statistical
approach using regularization. Our new approach has low numerical complexity

resources. A developer in such an environment still needs to deal with all the
complications of building a distributed software system. Different
orchestration systems are built to provide that abstraction; however, they do
not solve the inherent challenges of distributed systems, such as
synchronization issues or resilience to failures. This paper introduces Nefele,
a decentralized process orchestration system that automatically deploys and
manages individual processes, rather than containers/VMs, within a cluster.
Nefele is inspired by the Single System Image (SSI) vision of mitigating the
intricacies of remote execution, yet it maintains the flexibility and
performance of virtualized infrastructures. Nefele offers a set of APIs for
building cloud-native applications that lets the developer easily build,
deploy, and scale applications in a cloud environment. We have implemented and
deployed Nefele on a cluster in our datacenter and evaluated its performance.
Our evaluations show that Nefele can effectively deploy, scale, and monitor
processes across a distributed environment, while it incorporates essential
primitives to build a distributed software system.

  Compartment Thermal Model of Power Modules","conference paper under review - conference ICIPE 20",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate knowledge of temperatures in power semiconductor modules is crucial
for proper thermal management of such devices. Precise prediction of
temperatures allows to operate the system at the physical limit of the device
avoiding undesirable over-temperatures and thus improve reliability of the
module. Commonly used thermal models can be based on detailed expert knowledge
of the device's physical structure or on precise and complete temperature
distribution measurements. The latter approach is more often used in the
industry. Recently, we have proposed a linear time invariant state-space
thermal model based on a compartment representation and its identification
procedure that is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm from
incomplete temperature data. However, the model still requires to measure
temperatures of all active elements. In this contribution, we aim to relax the
need for all measurements. Therefore, we replace the previous dark gray-box
approach with a structured compartment model. The structure of the model is
designed by a mesh-based discretization of the physical layout of the module.
All compartments are assumed to share parameters that are identified from the
data of the measured elements. Temperatures of the unmeasured elements are
predicted using the shared parameters. Identification of the parameters is
possible only with suitable regularization due to limited amount of the data.
In particular, the model tightening is accomplished by sharing parameters among
compartments and by constraining the process covariance matrix of the model in
this contribution. Applicability of the proposed identification procedure is
discussed in terms of growing state-space and therefore speeding up of the
identification algorithm is suggested. Performance of the proposed approach is
tested and demonstrated on simulated data.

effective description of DM scenarios across different energy scales. The
framework remains applicable at collider energies and is capable of reproducing
the correct relic abundance by including a dynamical mediator particle to the
dark sector, while maintaining correlations dictated by gauge invariance in a
`model-independent' way. Taking into account present and future constraints
from direct- and indirect-detection experiments, from collider searches for
missing energy and for scalar resonances in vector-boson, di-jet, and
Higgs-pair final states, as well as from the relic abundance as measured by
Planck, we determine viable regions in the parameter space, both for scalar and
pseudoscalar mediator. In particular, we point out regions where cancellations
in the direct-detection cross section appear leading to allowed islands for
scalar mediators that could be missed in a naive simplified-model approach, but
are present in the full $D=5$ effective theory, as well as a general opening of
the parameter space due to consistently considering all operators at a given
mass dimension. Thus, canonical WIMP-like scenarios can survive even the next
generation of direct-detection experiments in different mass regimes, while
potentially becoming testable at the high-luminosity LHC.

properties of the Darcy-Rayleigh-Taylor system in the limit of large P\'eclet

the mixing zone, the balance between gravity and viscous forces results in a
non-self-similar growth of elongated plumes, whose length increases linearly in
time while their width follows a diffusive growth. The mass-transfer Nusselt

a universal scaling in porous convection at high Ra numbers. Finally, we find

PAUS filters have been considered, ranging from 455 to 515 nm in steps of 10
nm, which allows the observation of Ly$\alpha$ emission in a range $2.7<z<3.3$.
The cross-correlation is simulated first in an area of 100 deg$^2$ (PAUS
projected coverage), and second in two hypothetical scenarios: a deeper PAUS
(complete up to $i_{\rm AB}<24$ instead of $i_{\rm AB}<23$, observation time
x6), and an extended PAUS coverage of 225 deg$^2$ (observation time x2.25). A
hydrodynamic simulation of size 400 Mpc/h is used to simulate both extended
Ly$\alpha$ emission and absorption, while the foregrounds in PAUS images have
been simulated using a lightcone mock catalogue. Using an optimistic estimation
of uncorrelated PAUS noise, the total probability of a non-spurious detection
is estimated to be 1.8\% and 4.5\% for PAUS-eBOSS and PAUS-DESI , from a run of
1000 simulated cross-correlations with different realisations of instrumental
noise and quasar positions. The hypothetical PAUS scenarios increase this

correlated noise directly measured from PAUS images, these probabilities become
negligible. Despite these negative results, some evidences suggest that this

resonances seed chaotic dynamics into the networks. Long range networks provide
well connected resonances with ergodization controlled by the individual
resonance chaos time scales. Short range networks instead yield a dramatic
slowing down of ergodization in action space, and lead to rare resonance
diffusion. We use Josephson junction chains as a paradigmatic study case. We
exploit finite time average distributions to characterize the thermalizing
dynamics of actions. We identify a novel action resonance diffusion regime
responsible for the slowing down. We extract the diffusion coefficient of that
slow process and measure its dependence on the proximity to the integrable

adding weak action noise, as a proof of concept.

emerge from location-based variation and manifest at specific scales or
resolutions. To identify dominant features, we propose a sequential application
of multiresolution decomposition and variogram function estimation.
Multiresolution decomposition separates data into additive components, and in
this way enables the recognition of their dominant features. A dedicated
multiresolution decomposition method is developed for arbitrary gridded spatial
data, where the underlying model includes a precision and spatial-weight matrix
to capture spatial correlation. The data are separated into their components by
smoothing on different scales, such that larger scales have longer spatial
correlation ranges. Moreover, our model can handle missing values, which is
often useful in applications. Variogram function estimation can be used to
describe properties in spatial data. Such functions are therefore estimated for
each component to determine its effective range, which assesses the
width-extent of the dominant feature. Finally, Bayesian analysis enables the
inference of identified dominant features and to judge whether these are
credibly different. The efficient implementation of the method relies mainly on
a sparse-matrix data structure and algorithms. By applying the method to
simulated data we demonstrate its applicability and theoretical soundness. In
disciplines that use spatial data, this method can lead to new insights, as we
exemplify by identifying the dominant features in a forest dataset. In that
application, the width-extents of the dominant features have an ecological
interpretation, namely the species interaction range, and their estimates
support the derivation of ecosystem properties such as biodiversity indices.

Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of
schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown""
(from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these
interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time.
Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by
incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay.
Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were
estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series.
Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as
reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and
March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are
found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at
April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From
March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below
one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be
attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes.
Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly.
Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus,
the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover,
assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates
and the influence of test volume.

a human operator's control of complex dynamic machines and achieve tasks that
would otherwise be challenging, or impossible, for the user on their own. Our
method assumes no a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Instead, both the
dynamics and information about the user's interaction are learned from
observation through the use of a Koopman operator. Using the learned model, we
define an optimization problem to compute the autonomous partner's control
policy. Finally, we dynamically allocate control authority to each partner
based on a comparison of the user input and the autonomously generated control.
We refer to this idea as model-based shared control (MbSC). We evaluate the
efficacy of our approach with two human subjects studies consisting of 32 total
participants (16 subjects in each study). The first study imposes a linear
constraint on the modeling and autonomous policy generation algorithms. The
second study explores the more general, nonlinear variant. Overall, we find
that model-based shared control significantly improves task and control metrics
when compared to a natural learning, or user only, control paradigm. Our
experiments suggest that models learned via the Koopman operator generalize
across users, indicating that it is not necessary to collect data from each
individual user before providing assistance with MbSC. We also demonstrate the
data-efficiency of MbSC and consequently, it's usefulness in online learning
paradigms. Finally, we find that the nonlinear variant has a greater impact on
a user's ability to successfully achieve a defined task than the linear
variant.

On the other side, there is also growing concern about its precarious impact on

  Regression",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper investigates the use of nonparametric kernel-regression to obtain
a tasksimilarity aware meta-learning algorithm. Our hypothesis is that the use
of tasksimilarity helps meta-learning when the available tasks are limited and
may contain outlier/ dissimilar tasks. While existing meta-learning approaches
implicitly assume the tasks as being similar, it is generally unclear how this
task-similarity could be quantified and used in the learning. As a result, most
popular metalearning approaches do not actively use the
similarity/dissimilarity between the tasks, but rely on availability of huge
number of tasks for their working. Our contribution is a novel framework for
meta-learning that explicitly uses task-similarity in the form of kernels and
an associated meta-learning algorithm. We model the task-specific parameters to
belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the kernel function captures
the similarity across tasks. The proposed algorithm iteratively learns a
meta-parameter which is used to assign a task-specific descriptor for every
task. The task descriptors are then used to quantify the task-similarity
through the kernel function. We show how our approach conceptually generalizes
the popular meta-learning approaches of model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) and
Meta-stochastic gradient descent (Meta-SGD) approaches. Numerical experiments
with regression tasks show that our algorithm outperforms these approaches when
the number of tasks is limited, even in the presence of outlier or dissimilar
tasks. This supports our hypothesis that task-similarity helps improve the
metalearning performance in task-limited and adverse settings.

spectroscopy, combined with theoretical calculations, to obtain an in-depth
understanding of the layer-dependent magnetic properties in MnBi2Te4. The
magnetic behavior of MnBi2Te4 exhibits evident odd-even layer-number effect,
i.e. the oscillations of the coercivity of the hysteresis loop (at {\mu}0Hc)
and the spin-flop transition (at {\mu}0H1), concerning the Zeeman energy and
magnetic anisotropy energy. In the even-number septuple layers, an anomalous
magnetic hysteresis loop is observed, which is attributed to the
thickness-independent surface-related magnetization. Through the linear-chain
model, we can clarify the odd-even effect of the spin-flop field and determine
the evolution of magnetic states under the external magnetic field. The
mean-field method also allows us to trace the experimentally observed magnetic
phase diagrams to the magnetic fields, layer numbers and especially,

in this area has leveraged the approximation power of artificial neural

challenge in this new approach is the need to obtain, given the original

specific product density function. This is particularly challenging when
estimating CMI.
  In this paper, we introduce a new technique, based on k nearest neighbors
(k-NN), to perform the resampling and derive high-confidence concentration
bounds for the sample average. Then the technique is employed to train a neural
network classifier and the CMI is estimated accordingly. We propose three
estimators using this technique and prove their consistency, make a comparison
between them and similar approaches in the literature, and experimentally show
improvements in estimating the CMI in terms of accuracy and variance of the
estimators.

progress in recent years. The pioneering work PointNet offered a direct
analysis of point clouds. However, due to its architecture PointNet is not able
to capture local structures. To overcome this drawback, the same authors have
developed PointNet++ by applying PointNet to local areas. The local areas are
defined by center points and their neighbors. In PointNet++ and its further
developments the center points are determined with a Farthest Point Sampling
(FPS) algorithm. This has the disadvantage that the center points in general do
not have meaningful local areas. In this paper, we introduce the neural
Local-Area-Learning Network (LocAL-Net) which places emphasis on the selection
and characterization of the local areas. Our approach learns critical points
that we use as center points. In order to strengthen the recognition of local
structures, the points are given additional metric properties depending on the
local areas. Finally, we derive and combine two global feature vectors, one
from the whole point cloud and one from all local areas. Experiments on the
datasets ModelNet10/40 and ShapeNet show that LocAL-Net is competitive for part
segmentation. For classification LocAL-Net outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

backpropagation through time, which requires storing a complete history of
network states, and prohibits updating the weights `online' (after every
timestep). Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) eliminates the need for history
storage and allows for online weight updates, but does so at the expense of
computational costs that are quartic in the state size. This renders RTRL
training intractable for all but the smallest networks, even ones that are made
highly sparse.
  We introduce the Sparse n-step Approximation (SnAp) to the RTRL influence
matrix, which only keeps entries that are nonzero within n steps of the
recurrent core. SnAp with n=1 is no more expensive than backpropagation, and we
find that it substantially outperforms other RTRL approximations with
comparable costs such as Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization. For highly
sparse networks, SnAp with n=2 remains tractable and can outperform
backpropagation through time in terms of learning speed when updates are done
online. SnAp becomes equivalent to RTRL when n is large.

neighbourhood parameters of AGN and non-AGN samples. Using the NASA-Sloan
Atlas, both the local environment and the immediate environment of dwarf
galaxies with $z \leq 0.055$ are analysed. Of the 145,155 galaxies in the
catalogue, 62,258 of them are classified as dwarf galaxies, and by employing
two AGN selection methods based on emission line fluxes (BPT and WHAN), 4,476
are found to have AGN characteristics in their optical spectra. Regardless of
selection method, this study finds no discernible differences in environment
between AGN and non-AGN host dwarf galaxies and these results indicate that
environment is not an important factor in triggering AGN activity in dwarf
galaxies. This is in line with existing literature on environments of regular
galaxies with AGNs and suggests universality in terms of reaction to
environment across the mass regime. The biases of AGN selection in low-mass
galaxies, and the biases of different measures of environment are also
considered. It is found that there are several mass-trends in emission line
ratios and that the SDSS fiber covers galaxies non-uniformly with redshift.
These biases should be accounted for in future work by possibly including other
wavelength regimes or mass-weighting of emission line ratios. Lastly, a
discussion of the environment estimation methods is included since they may not
gauge the desired properties due to factors such as time delay or using loosely
constrained proxy parameters.

filtering techniques of data reduction were used to improve the signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio and hence automatically determine depths to the various engrossed
features from gridded geo-referenced airborne magnetic datasets before the DMT
application was performed. Geological source rock models (GSRM) (i.e., rock
contacts, dykes) served as the delineated features based on their structural
index (SI) values. The anomalies were perpendicularly oriented, with few
inconsequential nonvertical features, and all were generally aligned in NNE-SSW
and NE-SW directions. The DMT approach showed that magnetic anomaly patterns
(MAP) control the SSP and the ground surface stratigraphy (GSS) on a geological
time-scale (GTS) by fusing the subsurface gravitational structural features

subsurface geological source rock features with a maximum depth of
approximately 1.277 km using a 3x3 window size to map the concealed features of

The injection of spin polarized electrons in the conduction band is correctly
reproduced, and a non vanishing spin polarization ($\mathbf{P}$) parallel to
the direction of propagation of the laser ($z$) emerges. A detailed analysis of
the generation and the evolution of $\mathbf{P}(t)$ is discussed. The single
$\mathbf{k}$-point dynamics is a motion of precession around a fixed axis with
constant $|\mathbf{P}|$ and fixed frequency. Instead, the
$\mathbf{k}$-integrated signal shows only a time dependent $P_z(t)$ and decays
few pico seconds after the end of the laser pump due to decoherence.
Decoherence emerges since the individual contributions activated by the pump
give rise to destructive interference. We interpret the results in terms of the
\emph{free induction decay} mechanism proposed some years ago. For the first

quantitative estimate of the associated decay time. Our result also shows a

collaboratively train a machine learning model while keeping the training data

mitigates privacy risk and cost to the same extent as the baseline FL

consists in first considering a ""seed"" known solution in DHOST theories and
then performing a disformal transformation of the metric to obtain a new
solution. In vacuum, the two solutions are equivalent but they become
physically inequivalent when one considers coupling to matter. In that way, we
""disform"" the stealth Kerr black hole solution and we obtain a first analytic
rotating non-stealth solution in DHOST theories, while the associated scalar
field is time-dependent with a constant kinetic density. The new solution is
characterized by three parameters: the mass, the spin and the disformal
parameter which encodes the deviation with respect to the Kerr geometry. We
explore some geometrical properties of the novel disformed Kerr geometry which
is no more Ricci flat, has the same singularity as the Kerr metric, admits an
ergoregion, and is asymptotically flat. Moreover, the hidden symmetry of the
Kerr solution is broken, providing an example of a non-circular geometry in a
higher order theory of gravity. We also discuss geodesic motions and compute
its (disformed) null directions which are interesting tools to understand the
causal structure of the geometry. In addition, to illustrate again the
potentiality of the disformal solution-generating method, we present another
axisymmetric solution for DHOST theories obtained from a disformal
transformation of the generalized Kerr solution of Einstein-Scalar gravity.

two different relativistic mean-field unified inner-crust--core equations of
state, with a different density dependence of the symmetry energy, and an
inner-crust computed within a Thomas-Fermi calculation. Special attention is
given to the crust-core transition density, and the pasta phases effects on the
global properties of stars. The effects of strong magnetic fields and fast
rotation are computed by solving the Einstein-Maxwell equations
self-consistently, taking into account anisotropies induced by the centrifugal
and the Lorentz force. The location of the magnetic field neutral line and the
maximum of the Lorentz force on the equatorial plane are calculated. The
conditions under which they fall inside the inner crust region are discussed.
We verified that models with a larger symmetry energy slope show more
sensitivity to the variation of the magnetic field. One of the maxima of the
Lorentz force, as well as the neutral line, and for a certain range of
frequencies, fall inside the inner crust region. This may have consequences in
the fracture of the crust, and may help explain phenomena associated with star
quakes.

sources of electromagnetic radiation known in the Universe. They are generated
by outflows of plasma ejected at near the speed of light by newly formed
neutron stars or black holes of stellar mass at cosmological distances. Prompt
flashes of MeV gamma rays are followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission
from radio waves to GeV gamma rays, due to synchrotron radiation by energetic
electrons in accompanying shock waves. Although emission of gamma rays at even
higher, TeV energies by other radiation mechanisms had been theoretically
predicted, it had never been detected previously. Here we report the clear
detection of GRB 190114C in the TeV band, achieved after many years of
dedicated searches for TeV emission from GRBs. Gamma rays in the energy range
0.2--1 TeV are observed from about 1 minute after the burst (at more than 50
standard deviations in the first 20 minutes). This unambiguously reveals a new
emission component in the afterglow of a GRB, whose power is comparable to that
of the synchrotron component. The observed similarity in the radiated power and
temporal behaviour of the TeV and X-ray bands points to processes such as
inverse Compton radiation as the mechanism of the TeV emission, while processes
such as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons are disfavoured due to
their low radiative efficiency.

launched from the collapsing cores of dying massive stars. They are
characterised by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in
the keV-MeV band that is likely produced within the jet and lasts from
milliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission. Subsequently, the
interaction of the jet with the external medium generates external shock waves,
responsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months, and
occurs over a broad energy range, from the radio to the GeV bands. The
afterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation by
electrons accelerated at the external shock. Recently, an intense, long-lasting
emission between 0.2 and 1 TeV was observed from the GRB 190114C. Here we
present the results of our multi-frequency observational campaign of
GRB~190114C, and study the evolution in time of the GRB emission across 17
orders of magnitude in energy, from $5\times10^{-6}$ up to $10^{12}$\,eV. We
find that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the
TeV emission constituting a distinct spectral component that has power
comparable to the synchrotron component. This component is associated with the
afterglow, and is satisfactorily explained by inverse Compton upscattering of
synchrotron photons by high-energy electrons. We find that the conditions
required to account for the observed TeV component are not atypical, supporting
the possibility that inverse Compton emission is commonly produced in GRBs.

energy measurements is referred to as ""quantum heat"", which is always zero. In
the framework of quantum stochastic thermodynamics, this is constructed as the
average over the fluctuating quantum heat (FQH), defined as the increase in
expected value of the Hamiltonian along two-point eigenstate trajectories.
However, such a definition has two drawbacks: (i) if the initial state does not
commute with the Hamiltonian and has degeneracies, the higher moments of the
FQH will not be uniquely defined, and therefore it is arguable whether such a
quantity is physically meaningful; (ii) the definition is operationally
demanding as it requires full knowledge of the initial state. In the present
manuscript we show that the FQH is an instance of conditional increase in
energy given sequential measurements, the first of which is with respect to the
eigen-decomposition of the initial state. By coarse-graining this initial
measurement, first by only distinguishing between degenerate subspaces of the
state, and finally by not distinguishing between any subspace at all, we
provide two alternative definitions for the FQH, which we call the partially

quantifiers for purity and mutual information involving spin-parity (discrete)

obtained. For Dirac spinor Wigner operators decomposed into Poincar\'e classes
of $SU(2) \otimes SU(2)$ spinor couplings, a definitive expression for quantum
purity is identified in a twofold way: firstly, in terms of phase-space
positively defined quantities, and secondly, in terms of the {\em spin-parity
traced-out} associated density matrix in the position coordinate
representation, both derived from the original Lorentz covariant phase-space
Wigner representation. Naturally, such a structure supports the computation of
relative (linear) entropies respectively associated to discrete (spin-parity)
and continuous (position-momentum) degrees of freedom. The obtained theoretical
tools are used for quantifying (relative) purities, mutual information as well
as, by means of the quantum concurrence quantifier, the spin-parity quantum
entanglement, for a charged fermion trapped by a uniform magnetic field which,
by the way, has the phase-space structure completely described in terms of
Laguerre polynomials associated to the quantized Landau levels. Our results can
be read as the first step in the systematic computation of the elementary
information content of Dirac-like systems exhibiting some kind of confining

with a universal in-medium correction of the scalar $\sigma$-meson coupling for
nucleons bound in clusters. The obtained value, $g_s/g_s^0 = 0.92 \pm 0.02$, is
larger than that obtained in a previous study not including in-medium effects
in the data analysis. This result implies a smaller effect on the binding
energy of the clusters and, as a consequence, larger melting densities, and an
increased cluster contribution in supernova matter.

barrier loss function. By bounding model internals instead of individual
pixels, our attack admits perturbations closely coupled with the existing
features of the original input, allowing the generated examples to be
natural-looking while having diverse and often substantial pixel distances from
the original input. Enforcing per-neuron distribution quantile bounds allows
addressing the non-uniformity of internal activation values. Our evaluation on
ImageNet and five different model architecture demonstrates that our attack is
quite effective. Compared to the state-of-the-art pixel space attack, semantic
attack, and feature space attack, our attack can achieve the same attack
success/confidence level while having much more natural-looking adversarial

not have any fixed pixel bounds.

  Estimation",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Wideband direction of arrival (DOA) estimation techniques for sensors array
have been studied extensively in the literature. Nevertheless, needing prior
information on the number and directions of sources or demanding heavy
computational load makes most of these techniques less useful in practice. In
this paper, a low complexity subspace-based framework for DOA estimation of
broadband signals, named as wideband modal orthogonality (WIMO), is proposed
and accordingly two DOA estimators are developed. First, a closed-form
approximation of spatial-temporal covariance matrix (STCM) in the uniform
spectrum case is presented. The eigenvectors of STCM associated with non-zero
eigenvalues are modal components of the wideband source in a given bandwidth
and direction. WIMO idea is to extract these eigenvectors at desired DOAs from
the approximated STCM and test their orthogonality to estimated noise subspace.
In the non-uniform spectrum case, WIMO idea can be applied by approximating
STCM through numerical integration. Fortunately, STCM approximation and modal
extraction can be performed offline. WIMO provides DOA estimation without the
conventional prerequisites, such as spectral decomposition, focusing procedure
and, a priori information on the number of sources and their DOAs. Several
numerical examples are conducted to compare the WIMO performance with the
state-of-the-art methods. Simulations demonstrate that the two proposed DOA
estimators achieve superior performance in terms of probability of resolution
and estimation error along with orders of magnitude runtime speedup.

Henneaux and Troessaert who successfully applied the Hamiltonian formalism to
the case of gravity and electrodynamics, thereby deriving the respective
asymptotic symmetry groups of these theories from clear-cut first principles.
These principles include the minimal assumptions that are necessary to ensure
the existence of Hamiltonian structures (phase space, symplectic form,
differentiable Hamiltonian) and, in case of Poincar\'e invariant theories, a
canonical action of the Poincar\'e group. In the first part of the paper we
show how these requirements can be met in the non-abelian SU(N)-Yang-Mills case
by imposing suitable fall-off and parity conditions on the fields. We observe
that these conditions admit neither non-trivial asymptotic symmetries nor
non-zero global charges. In the second part of the paper we discuss possible
gradual relaxations of these conditions by following the same strategy that
Henneaux and Troessaert had employed to remedy a similar situation in the
electromagnetic case. Contrary to our expectation and the findings of Henneaux
and Troessaert for the abelian case, there seems to be no relaxation that meets
the requirements of a Hamiltonian formalism and allows for non-trivial
asymptotic symmetries and charges. Non-trivial asymptotic symmetries and
charges are only possible if either the Poincar\'e group fails to act
canonically or if the formal expression for the symplectic form diverges, i.e.
the form does not exist. This seems to hint at a kind of colour-confinement
built into the classical Hamiltonian formulation of non-abelian gauge theories.

ellipsoids, which is a useful tool to study the structure of gaseous orbits in
the disk. We also present the first estimates of perturbations in gas velocity
dispersion maps by applying an alternative model that considers isotropic and
asymmetric random motions. High-quality velocity dispersion maps of the atomic
medium at various angular resolutions of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 33,
are used to test the anisotropic and isotropic velocity models. The velocity
dispersions of hundreds of individual molecular clouds are also analyzed. The
HI velocity dispersion of M33 is systematically larger along the minor axis,
and lower along the major axis. Isotropy is only possible if asymmetric motions
are considered. Fourier transforms of the HI velocity dispersions reveal a
bisymmetric mode which is mostly stronger than other asymmetric motions and
aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy. Within the anisotropic and
axisymmetric velocity model, the stronger bisymmetry is explained by a radial
component that is larger than the azimuthal component of the ellipsoid of
random motions, thus by gaseous orbits that are dominantly radial. The
azimuthal anisotropy parameter is not strongly dependent on the choice of the
vertical dispersion. The velocity anisotropy parameter of the molecular clouds
is observed highly scattered. Perturbations such as HI spiral-like arms could
be at the origin of the gas velocity anisotropy in M33. Further work is

across a range of challenging settings including nonsmoothness and nonconvexity

one of the component functions in the objective. In this work, our new
theoretical results provide convergence guarantees under a restricted strong
convexity assumption without requiring smoothness or differentiability, while
still allowing differentiable terms to be treated approximately if needed. We
validate these theoretical results empirically, with a simulated example where
both $f$ and $g$ are nondifferentiable -- and thus outside the scope of

combining optical and infrared photometry from the latest public releases of
the following large-scale surveys: UKIRT/UKIDSS, Pan-STARRS, SDSS, and AllWISE.
We checked astrometric consistency with cluster membership using $Gaia$ DR2. A
couple dozen new candidate BDs located inside the tidal radius of Coma Ber are
reported, but none of these are significantly fainter and cooler than
previously known members. A search for Li in three new and five previously
known BD candidate cluster members was performed via spectroscopic observations
using the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4-m GTC. No LiI resonance doublet at
6707.8 A was detected in any of eight Coma Ber targets in the magnitude range
J=15--19 and G=20--23 observed with the GTC. Spectral types and radial
velocities were derived from the GTC spectra. These values confirm the cluster
membership of four L2--L2.5 dwarfs, two of which are new in the literature. The
large Li depletion factors found among the four bona fide BD members in Coma
Ber implies that the LDB must be located at spectral type later than L2.5 in
this cluster. Using the latest evolutionary models for BDs, a lower limit of
550 Myr on the cluster age is set. This constraint has been combined with other
dating methods to obtain an updated age estimate of 780$\pm$230 Myr for the
Coma Ber open cluster. Identification of significantly cooler sub-stellar
cluster members in Coma Ber awaits the advent of the Euclid wide survey, which
should reach a depth of about J=23; this superb sensitivity will make it
possible to determine the precise location of the sub-stellar LDB in this
cluster and to carry out a complete census of its sub-stellar population.

randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant
reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological
quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected
epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various
regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in
each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the
incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that
our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19.

important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models
with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional
epidemic and worldwide pandemic.

starting from the end of February 2020, began spreading along the Italian

extending to the center and south of Italy, including the two main islands.
  Objective. The creation of a forecast model that manages to alert the
decision-making bodies and, in particular, the healthcare system, to hinder the
emergence of any other pandemic outbreaks, or the arrival of subsequent
pandemic waves.
  Methods. A new mathematical model to describe the pandemic is given. The
model includes the class of undiagnosed infected people, and has a multi-region
extension, to cope with the in-time and in-space heterogeneity of the epidemic.
  Results. We obtain a robust and reliable tool for the forecast of the total

Photon-drag shift current proceeds from a `shift current dipole' (a geometric
quantity characterizing interband transitions) and manifests a purely
transverse response in centrosymmetric crystals. This transverse nature
proceeds directly from the shift-vector's pseudovector nature under mirror
operation and underscores its intrinsic geometric origin. Photon-drag shift
current can greatly enhanced by coupling to polaritons and provides a new and

delivery. For example, video applications like transcoding and compression have
till now ignored the fact how speech is delivered and heard. To close the gap
between speech understanding and multimedia video applications, in this paper,
we show the initial experiments by modelling the perception on visual speech
and showing its use case on video compression. On the other hand, in the visual
speech recognition domain, existing studies have mostly modeled it as a
classification problem, while ignoring the correlations between views,
phonemes, visemes, and speech perception. This results in solutions which are
further away from how human perception works. To bridge this gap, we propose a
view-temporal attention mechanism to model both the view dependence and the
visemic importance in speech recognition and understanding. We conduct
experiments on three public visual speech recognition datasets. The
experimental results show that our proposed method outperformed the existing
work by 4.99% in terms of the viseme error rate. Moreover, we show that there
is a strong correlation between our model's understanding of multi-view speech

  https://github.com/RobGeada/bonsai-net-lite",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-shot Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to minimize the computational
expense of discovering state-of-the-art models. However, in the past year
attention has been drawn to the comparable performance of naive random search
across the same search spaces used by leading NAS algorithms. To address this,
we explore the effects of drastically relaxing the NAS search space, and we
present Bonsai-Net, an efficient one-shot NAS method to explore our relaxed
search space. Bonsai-Net is built around a modified differential pruner and can
consistently discover state-of-the-art architectures that are significantly
better than random search with fewer parameters than other state-of-the-art
methods. Additionally, Bonsai-Net performs simultaneous model search and
training, dramatically reducing the total time it takes to generate
fully-trained models from scratch.

  Laser-aided Additive Manufacturing",,,,,"cs.GR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Toolpath planning is an important task in laser aided additive manufacturing
(LAAM) and other direct energy deposition (DED) processes. The deposition
toolpaths for complex geometries with slender structures can be further
optimized by partitioning the sliced 2D layers into sub-regions, and enable the
design of appropriate infill toolpaths for different sub-regions. However,
reported approaches for 2D layer segmentation generally require manual
operations that are tedious and time-consuming. To increase segmentation
efficiency, this paper proposes an autonomous approach based on evolutional
computation for 2D layer segmentation. The algorithm works in an
identify-and-segment manner. Specifically, the largest quasi-quadrilateral is
identified and segmented from the target layer iteratively. Results from case
studies have validated the effectiveness and efficacy of the developed
algorithm. To further improve its performance, a roughing-finishing strategy is
proposed. Via multi-processing, the strategy can remarkably increase the
solution variety without affecting solution quality and search time, thus
providing great application potential in LAAM toolpath planning. To the best of
the authors knowledge, this work is the first to address automatic 2D layer
segmentation problem in LAAM process. Therefore, it may be a valuable
supplement to the state of the art in this area.

are derived for branched polymers with the help of the Isihara formula. We
introduce the Gaussian approximation for the end-to-end vector,
$\vec{r}_{G\nu_{i}}$, from the center of gravity to the $i$th mass point on the
$\nu$th arm. Then, for star polymers, the result is \begin{equation}
\varphi_{star}(s)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{\nu=1}^{f}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\nu}}\left(\frac{d}{2\pi\left\langle
r_{G\nu_{i}}^{2}\right\rangle}\right)^{d/2}\exp\left(-\frac{d}{2\left\langle
r_{G\nu_{i}}^{2}\right\rangle}s^{2}\right)\notag \end{equation} for a
sufficiently large $N$, where $f$ denotes the number of arms. It is found that
the resultant $\varphi_{star}(s)$ is, unfortunately, not Gaussian. For
dendrimers \begin{equation}
\varphi_{dend}(s)=\sum_{h=1}^{g}\omega_{h}\left(\frac{d}{2pi\left\langle
r_{G_{h}}^{2}\right\rangle}\right)^{d/2}\exp\left(-\frac{d}{2\left\langle

denotes the weight fraction of masses in the $h$th generation on a dendrimer
constructed from $g$ generations, so that $\sum_{h=1}^{g}\omega_{h}=1$. To be
specific, $\omega_{1}=1/N$ and $\omega_{h}=(f-1)^{h-2}/N$ for $h\ge 2$. These
distributions can be described by the same grand sum of each Gaussian function
for the end-to-end distance from the center of gravity to each mass point. Note
that for a large $f$ and $g$, the statistical weight of younger generations
becomes dominant. As a consequence, the mass distribution of unperturbed
dendrimers approaches the Gaussian form in the limit of a large $f$ and $g$. It
is shown that the radii of gyration of dendrimers increase logarithmically with
$N$, which leading to the exponent, $\nu_{0}=0$. An example of randomly
branched polymers is also discussed.

which, either pass or stop their pre-activation input when they are 'on' (when
the pre-activation input is positive) or 'off' (when the pre-activation input
is negative) respectively. A deep neural network (DNN) with ReLU activations
has many gates, and the on/off status of each gate changes across input
examples as well as network weights. For a given input example, only a subset
of gates are 'active', i.e., on, and the sub-network of weights connected to
these active gates is responsible for producing the output. At randomised
initialisation, the active sub-network corresponding to a given input example
is random. During training, as the weights are learnt, the active sub-networks
are also learnt, and potentially hold very valuable information. In this paper,
we analytically characterise the role of active sub-networks in deep learning.
To this end, we encode the on/off state of the gates of a given input in a
novel 'neural path feature' (NPF), and the weights of the DNN are encoded in a
novel 'neural path value' (NPV). Further, we show that the output of network is
indeed the inner product of NPF and NPV. The main result of the paper shows
that the 'neural path kernel' associated with the NPF is a fundamental quantity
that characterises the information stored in the gates of a DNN. We show via
experiments (on MNIST and CIFAR-10) that in standard DNNs with ReLU activations
NPFs are learnt during training and such learning is key for generalisation.
Furthermore, NPFs and NPVs can be learnt in two separate networks and such
learning also generalises well in experiments.

recognition problems where our goal is to learn a mapping between input images
of domain $\mathbf{X}_1$ and output images of domain $\mathbf{X}_2$. Current
methods use neural networks with an encoder-decoder structure to learn a
mapping $G:\mathbf{X}_1 \to\mathbf{X}_2$ such that the distribution of images
from $\mathbf{X}_2$ and $G(\mathbf{X}_1)$ are identical, where $G(\mathbf{X}_1)
= d_G (f_G (\mathbf{X}_1))$ and $f_G (\cdot)$ is referred as the encoder and
$d_G(\cdot)$ is referred to as the decoder. Currently, such methods which also
compute an inverse mapping $F:\mathbf{X}_2 \to \mathbf{X}_1$ use a separate
encoder-decoder pair $d_F (f_F (\mathbf{X}_2))$ or at least a separate decoder
$d_F (\cdot)$ to do so. Here we introduce a method to perform cross domain
image-to-image translation across multiple domains using a single
encoder-decoder architecture. We use an auto-encoder network which given an
input image $\mathbf{X}_1$, first computes a latent domain encoding $Z_d = f_d
(\mathbf{X}_1)$ and a latent content encoding $Z_c = f_c (\mathbf{X}_1)$, where
the domain encoding $Z_d$ and content encoding $Z_c$ are independent. And then
a decoder network $g(Z_d,Z_c)$ creates a reconstruction of the original image
$\mathbf{\widehat{X}}_1=g(Z_d,Z_c )\approx \mathbf{X}_1$. Ideally, the domain
encoding $Z_d$ contains no information regarding the content of the image and
the content encoding $Z_c$ contains no information regarding the domain of the
image. We use this property of the encodings to find the mapping across domains
$G: X\to Y$ by simply changing the domain encoding $Z_d$ of the decoder's
input. $G(\mathbf{X}_1 )=d(f_d (\mathbf{x}_2^i ),f_c (\mathbf{X}_1))$ where
$\mathbf{x}_2^i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of $\mathbf{X}_2$.

process is a point process that includes both externally excited joint jumps,
which are distributed according to a shot noise Cox process and two separate
self-excited jumps, which are distributed according to the branching structure
of a Hawkes process with an exponential fertility rate, respectively. We
analyse the theoretical distributional properties for these processes
systematically, based on the piecewise deterministic Markov process developed
by Davis (1984) and the univariate dynamic contagion process theory developed
by Dassios and Zhao (2011). The analytic expression of the Laplace transform of
the compound process and its moments are presented, which have the potential to
be applicable to a variety of problems in credit, insurance, market and other
operational risks. As an application of this process, we provide insurance
premium calculations based on its moments. Numerical examples show that this
compound process can be used for the modelling of aggregate losses from cyber
events. We also provide the simulation algorithm for statistical analysis,

lead to hazardous situations and loss of life. In this paper, an Intelligent
Reputation System (IRS) aims to identify attacking vehicles will be proposed;
the proposed system will rely on opinion generation, trust value collection,
traffic analysis, position based, data collection, and intelligent decision
making by utilizing the multi-parameter Greedy Best First algorithm. The
results of this research will enhance VANET's safety level and will facilitate
the identification of misbehaving vehicles and their messages. The results of
the proposed system have also proven to be superior to other reputational
systems.

broken. According to gauge theories, interaction mediating spin-0 bosons must
be massless. The theory of HySy predicted massive intermediate bosons.
Hypersymmetry field rotation, described in this paper, justifies the mass of
the HySy mediating boson. The mass of intermediate bosons must arise from
dynamical spontaneous breaking of the group of HySy. HySy rotation is performed
in the velocity-dependent D field. The derived rotation of the field is defined
by the spontaneous symmetry breaking and precession of the velocity v around
its third projection in the D field (that produced the mass of the field s
bosons). The latter represents the real and effective velocities of a
boson-emitting particle in the direction towards a target particle. The mass of
the discussed (fictitious) Goldstone bosons can be removed by the unitarity
gauge condition through Higgs (BEH) mechanism. According to the simultaneous
presence of a Standard Model (SM) interaction s symmetry group and the (beyond
SM) HySy group, their bosons should be transformed together. Spontaneous
breakdown of HySy may allow performing a transformation that does not influence
the SM physical state of the investigated system. The paper describes a field
transformation that eliminates the mass of the intermediate bosons, rotates the
SM- and HySy bosons masses together while leaving the SM bosons intact. The
result is an angle that characterises the HySy by a precession mechanism of the
velocity that generates the field. In contrast to the known SM intermediate
bosons, the HySy intermediate bosons have no fixed mass. The mass of the HySy
intermediate bosons (that appear as quanta of a velocity-dependent gauge field
D) depends on the relative velocity of the particles whose interaction they
mediate. So, the derived precession angle is a function of that velocity.
