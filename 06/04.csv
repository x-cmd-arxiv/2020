manifold compactifications of M-theory. In particular, we are interested in
testing a refined version -- the Emergent String Conjecture, in settings with
4d $N=1$ supersymmetry. We find that a weakly coupled, tensionless fundamental
heterotic string does emerge at the infinite distance limit characterized by
shrinking the $K3$-fibre in a TCS $G_2$ manifold. Such a fundamental
tensionless string leads to the parametrically leading infinite tower of
asymptotically massless states, which is in line with the Emergent String
Conjecture. The tensionless string, however, receives quantum corrections. We
check that these quantum corrections do modify the volume of the shrinking
K3-fibre via string duality and hence make the string regain a non-vanishing
tension at the quantum level, leading to a decompactification. Geometrically,
the quantum corrections modify the metric of the classical moduli space and are
expected to obstruct the infinite distance limit. We also comment on another
possible type of infinite distance limit in TCS $G_2$ compactifications, which
might lead to a weakly coupled fundamental type II string theory.

superconductivity and quantum spin liquids, due to easy control of doping level
through gating and sensitive dependence of the magic angle on hydrostatic
pressure. Experimental observations of correlated insulating states,
unconventional superconductivity and ferromagnetism in MATBG indicate that this
system exhibits rich exotic phases. In this work, using density functional
theory calculations in conjunction with the effective screening medium method,
we find the MATBG under pressure at a twisting angle of $2.88\unicode{xb0}$ and
simulate how its electronic states evolve when doping level and out-of-plane
electric field are gate-tuned. Our calculations show that, at doping levels
between two electrons and four holes per moir\'{e} unit cell, a ferromagnetic
solution with spin density localized at AA stacking sites is lower in energy
than the nonmagnetic solution. The magnetic moment of this ferromagnetic state
decreases with both electron and hole doping and vanishes at four
electrons/holes doped per moir\'{e} unit cell. Hybridization between the flat
bands at the Fermi level and the surrounding dispersive bands can take place at
finite doping. Moreover, upon increasing the out-of-plane electric field at
zero doping, a transition from the ferromagnetic state to the nonmagnetic one
is seen. We also analyze the interlayer bonding character due to the flat bands
via Wannier functions. Finally, we report trivial band topology of the flat

  GFD has traditionally been concerned with understanding the very basic
problems that lie at the foundation of dynamical meteorology and
ocean\-ography. Conventionally, and a little ironically, the subject mainly
considers `dry' fluids, meaning it does not concern itself overly much with
phase changes. The subject is often regarded as dry in another way, because it
does not consider problems perceived as relevant to the real world, such as
clouds or rainfall, which have typically been the province of complicated
numerical models. Those models often rely on parameterizations of unresolved
processes, parameterizations that may work very well but that often have a
semi-empirical basis. The consequent dichotomy between the foundations and the
applications prevents progress being made that has both a secure basis in
scientific understanding and a relevance to the Earth's climate, especially
where moisture is concerned. The dichotomy also inhibits progress in
understanding the climate of other planets, where observations are insufficient
to tune the parameterizations that weather and climate models for Earth rely
upon, and a more fundamental approach is called for. Here we discuss four
diverse examples of the problems with moisture: the determination of relative
humidity and cloudiness; the transport of water vapor and its possible change
under global warming; the moist shallow water equations and the Madden-Julian

the information they have. In the MEET-EXCHANGE protocol, only the agents store
information, and exchange their information with each agent they meet.
  We consider the broadcast time of a single piece of information in an
$n$-node graph for the above three protocols, assuming a linear number of
agents that start from the stationary distribution. We observe that there are
graphs on which the agent-based protocols are significantly faster than
PUSH-PULL, and graphs where the converse is true. We attribute the good
performance of agent-based algorithms to their inherently fair bandwidth
utilization, and conclude that, in certain settings, agent-based information
dissemination, separately or in combination with PUSH-PULL, can significantly
improve the broadcast time.
  The graphs considered above are highly non-regular. Our main technical result
is that on any regular graph of at least logarithmic degree, PUSH-PULL and
VISIT-EXCHANGE have the same asymptotic broadcast time. The proof uses a novel
coupling argument which relates the random choices of vertices in PUSH-PULL

time of MEET-EXCHANGE is asymptotically at least as large as the other two's on

contextual factors involving a large amount of distributed information. This
knowledge could include: technology-related tasks, software operating
environments and stakeholder requirements. A major roadblock to using this
knowledge in software development is that most of this information is implicit
and captured in the developers' minds (tacit) or spread through volumes of
documentation. Developers, as they work often have to maintain mental models of
these tasks as they produce the software. As a result, context can be easily
lost or forgotten and developers often use trial-and-error approaches while
finishing the project. This study aims at analyzing whether supporting software
developers with a chatbot during task execution can improve the overall
development experience. The chatbot can assist the developers in executing
different tasks based on implicit contextual information. We propose an
implementation to explore the viability of using textual chatbots to assist
developers automatically and proactively with software development project

Long-running streaks of activity were abandoned and became less common. Weekend
activity decreased and days in which developers made a single contribution
became less common. Synchronization of streaking behavior in the platform's
social network also decreased, suggesting that gamification is a powerful
channel for social influence. Focusing on a set of software developers that
were publicly pursuing a goal to make contributions for 100 days in a row, we
find that some of these developers abandon this quest following the removal of
the public streak counter. Our findings provide evidence for the significant

complexity theory. In this paper we propose a generalization of the approach
used by Strassen in the proof of his 3n/2 border rank lower bound. Our approach
revolves around a problem on commuting matrices:
  Given matrices Z_1,...,Z_p of size n and an integer r>n, are there commuting
matrices Z'_1,...,Z'_p of size r such that every Z_k is embedded as a submatrix
in the top-left corner of Z'_k?
  As one of our main results, we show that this question always has a positive
answer for r larger than rank(T)+n, where T denotes the tensor with slices
Z_1,..,Z_p. Taking the contrapositive, if one can show for some specific
matrices Z_1,...,Z_p and a specific integer r that this question has a negative
answer, this yields the lower bound rank(T) > r-n. There is a little bit of
slack in the above rank(T)+n bound, but we also provide a number of exact
characterizations of tensor rank and symmetric rank, for ordinary and symmetric
tensors, over the fields of real and complex numbers. Each of these
characterizations points to a corresponding variation on the above approach. In
order to explain how Strassen's theorem fits within this framework we also
provide a self-contained proof of his lower bound.

consider effective theories of gravity where in addition to the
Einstein-Hilbert term we include non-minimal couplings of the type $R^3$, $R^4$
and $FFR$. In particular, we study the scattering of gravitons and photons of
frequency $\omega$ off heavy scalars of mass $m$ in the limit $m\gg \omega \gg
|\vec{q}\,|$, where $\vec{q}$ is the momentum transfer. The presence of
non-minimal couplings induces helicity-flip processes which survive the eikonal
limit, thereby promoting the eikonal phase to an eikonal phase matrix. We
obtain the latter from the relevant two-to-two helicity amplitudes that we
compute up to one-loop order, and confirm that the leading-order terms in
$\omega$ exponentiate \`{a} la Amati, Ciafaloni and Veneziano. From the
eigenvalues of the eikonal phase matrix we then extract two physical
observables, to 2PM order: the classical deflection angle and Shapiro time
delay/advance. Whenever the classical expectation of helicity conservation of
the massless scattered particle is violated, i.e. the eigenvalues of the
eikonal matrix are non-degenerate, causality violation due to time advance is a
generic possibility for small impact parameter. We show that for graviton
scattering in the $R^4$ and $FFR$ theories, time advance is circumvented if the
couplings of these interactions satisfy certain positivity conditions, while it
is unavoidable for graviton scattering in the $R^3$ theory and photon
scattering in the $FFR$ theory. The scattering processes we consider mimic the
deflection of photons and gravitons off spinless heavy objects such as
black~holes.

parameters, are often used to model complex dynamics. Most existing methods to
identify unknown governing RODEs from observed data often rely on strong prior
knowledge. Extracting the governing equations from data with less prior
knowledge remains a great challenge. In this paper, we propose a deep neural
network, called RODE-Net, to tackle such challenge by fitting a symbolic
expression of the differential equation and the distribution of parameters
simultaneously. To train the RODE-Net, we first estimate the parameters of the
unknown RODE using the symbolic networks \cite{long2019pde} by solving a set of
deterministic inverse problems based on the measured data, and use a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to estimate the true distribution of the RODE's
parameters. Then, we use the trained GAN as a regularization to further improve
the estimation of the ODE's parameters. The two steps are operated
alternatively. Numerical results show that the proposed RODE-Net can well
estimate the distribution of model parameters using simulated data and can make
reliable predictions. It is worth noting that, GAN serves as a data driven
regularization in RODE-Net and is more effective than the $\ell_1$ based
regularization that is often used in system identifications.

upgrade (MEG II) of the whole detector has been approved to obtain a
substantial increase of sensitivity. Currently MEG II is completing the upgrade
of the various detectors, an engineering run and a pre-commissioning run were
carried out during 2018 and 2019. The new positron tracker is a unique volume,
ultra-light He based cylindrical drift chamber (CDCH), with high granularity: 9
layers of 192 square drift cells, ~6-9 mm wide, consist of ~12000 wires in a
full stereo configuration. To ensure the electrostatic stability of the drift
cells a new wiring strategy should be developed due to the high wire density
(12 wires/cm^2 ), the stringent precision requirements on the wire position and
uniformity of the wire mechanical tension (better than 0.5 g) The basic idea is
to create multiwire frames, by soldering a set of (16 or 32) wires on 40 um
thick custom wire-PCBs. Multiwire frames and PEEK spacers are overlapped
alternately along the radius, to set the proper cell width, in each of the
twelve sectors defined by the spokes of the rudder wheel shaped end-plates.
Despite to the conceptual simplicity of the assembling strategies, the building
of the multiwire frames, with the set requirements, imposes a use of an
automatic wiring system. The MEG II CDCH is the first cylindrical drift chamber
ever designed and built in a modular way and it will allow to track positrons,
with a momentum greater than 45 MeV/c, with high efficiency by using a very
small amount of material, 1.5x10^-3 X0 . We describe the CDCH design and
construction, the wiring phase at INFN-Lecce, the choice of the wires, their
mechanical properties, the assembly and sealing at INFN-Pisa and the
commissioning.

perform as well as fully trained networks. We introduce a formal link between
such networks through their neural tangent kernel (NTK), and well-known
non-local filtering techniques, such as non-local means or BM3D. The filtering
function associated with a given network architecture can be obtained in closed
form without need to train the network, being fully characterized by the random
initialization of the network weights. While the NTK theory accurately predicts
the filter associated with networks trained using standard gradient descent,
our analysis shows that it falls short to explain the behaviour of networks
trained using the popular Adam optimizer. The latter achieves a larger change
of weights in hidden layers, adapting the non-local filtering function during
training. We evaluate our findings via extensive image denoising experiments.

the inclusion of the effects of the minimal coupling with the Maxwell field are

These analytic gauged baby Skyrmions generate a persistent $U(1)$ current which
cannot be turned off continuously as it is tied to the topological charge of
the baby Skyrmions themselves. In the simplest non-trivial case of a gauged

breaking caused by panic escape exhibits a shared feature across species that
one exit is used more than the other when agents escaping from a closed space

by more individuals close to it, namely there is an asymmetric distribution
initially. We used ant groups to investigate how initial distribution of
colonies would influence symmetry breaking in collective escaping.
Surprisingly, there was no positive correlation between symmetry breaking and
the asymmetrically initial distribution, which was quite counter-intuitive. In
the experiments, a flee stage was observed and accordingly a flee-pheromone
model was introduced to depict this special behavior in the early stage of
escaping. Simulation results fitted well with the experiment. Furthermore, the
flee stage duration was calibrated quantitatively and the model reproduced the
observation demonstrated by our previous work. This paper explicitly
distinguished two stages in ant panic escaping for the first time, thus

  In this paper, we develop Squirrel, a novel fuzzing framework that considers

intermediate representation (IR) to maintain SQL queries in a structural and
informative manner. To generate syntactically correct queries, we perform
type-based mutations on IR, including statement insertion, deletion and
replacement. To mitigate semantic errors, we analyze each IR to identify the
logical dependencies between arguments, and generate queries that satisfy these
dependencies. We evaluated Squirrel on four popular DBMSs: SQLite, MySQL,
PostgreSQL and MariaDB. Squirrel found 51 bugs in SQLite, 7 in MySQL and 5 in
MariaDB. 52 of the bugs are fixed with 12 CVEs assigned. In our experiment,
Squirrel achieves 2.4x-243.9x higher semantic correctness than state-of-the-art

Following prior work, we use a small decision tree to partition a dataset into
$k$ clusters. This enables us to explain each cluster assignment by a short
sequence of single-feature thresholds. While larger trees produce more accurate
clusterings, they also require more complex explanations. To allow flexibility,
we develop a new explainable $k$-means clustering algorithm, ExKMC, that takes

the leaves with one of $k$ clusters. We prove that as $k'$ increases, the
surrogate cost is non-increasing, and hence, we trade explainability for

outperforming both standard decision tree methods and other algorithms for

each chain is prepared in its own equilibrium state, generally with a bias in
chemical potentials and temperatures. We examine the heating rate (or,
alternatively, energy increase per cycle) in the nonequilibrium time-periodic
steady state established after initial transient dynamics. We find that the
heating rate vanishes identically when the driving frequency exceeds the
bandwidth of the chain. We first establish this fact for a particular type of
QPC where the heating rate can be calculated analytically. Then we verify
numerically that this nonequilibrium phase transition is present for a generic
QPC. Finally, we derive this effect perturbatively in leading order for cases
when the QPC Hamiltonian can be considered as a small perturbation. Strikingly,
we discover that for certain QPCs the current averaged over the driving cycle
also vanishes above the critical frequency, despite a persistent bias. This
shows that a driven QPC can act as a frequency-controlled quantum switch.

Majorana and gauge flux spontaneously upon cooling, leading to rich
experimental ramifications at finite temperature and an upsurge of research
interest. In this work, we employ the exponential tensor renormalization group
approach to explore the Kitaev model under various perturbations, including the
external fields, Heisenberg, and the off-diagonal couplings that are common in
the Kitaev materials. Through large-scale manybody calculations, we find a
Kitaev fractional liquid at intermediate temperature that is robust against
perturbations. The fractional liquid exhibits universal thermodynamic
behaviors, including the fractional thermal entropy, metallic specific heat,
and an intermediate-temperature Curie law of magnetic susceptibility. The
emergent universal susceptibility behavior, with a modified Curie constant, can
be ascribed to the strongly fluctuating $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes as well as the
extremely short-ranged and bond-directional spin correlations. With this
insight, we revisit the susceptibility measurements of Na$_2$IrO$_3$ and
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and find evident signatures of finite-temperature
fractionalization and ferromagnetic Kitaev couplings. Moreover, the peculiar
spin correlation in the fractional liquid corresponds to a stripy structure
factor which rotates in the extended Brillouin zone as the spin component

accompanied by a simultaneous collapse of local magnetic moments and lattice

concept of fluctuating valence in a correlated solid, we demonstrate that in

from the accepted picture and points out a remarkable dynamical coexistence
(frustration) of the high-, intermediate-, and low-spin states. In particular,
in MnO, the magnetic collapse is found to be driven by the appearance of the
intermediate-spin state (IS), competing with the low-spin (LS) state; in FeO,
we observe a conventional high-spin to low-spin (HS-LS) crossover. Most
interestingly, in CoO, we obtain a remarkable (dynamical) coexistence of the HS

that appears as a (contiguous) substring of two input strings. We consider the
dynamic variant of this problem, in which we are to maintain two dynamic
strings $S$ and $T$, each of length at most $n$, that undergo substitutions of
letters, in order to be able to return a longest common substring after each
substitution. Recently, Amir et al. [ESA 2019] presented a solution for this
problem that needs only $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2/3})$ time per update. This
brought the challenge of determining whether there exists a faster solution
with polylogarithmic update time, or (as is the case for other dynamic
problems), we should expect a polynomial (conditional) lower bound. We answer
this question by designing a significantly faster algorithm that processes each
substitution in amortized $\log^{\mathcal{O}(1)} n$ time with high probability.
Our solution relies on exploiting the local consistency of the parsing of a
collection of dynamic strings due to Gawrychowski et al. [SODA 2018], and on
maintaining two dynamic trees with labeled bicolored leaves, so that after each
update we can report a pair of nodes, one from each tree, of maximum combined
weight, which have at least one common leaf-descendant of each color. We
complement this with a lower bound of $\Omega(\log n/ \log\log n)$ for the
update time of any polynomial-size data structure that maintains the LCS of two
dynamic strings, and the same lower bound for the update time of any data
structure of size $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n)$ that maintains the LCS of a static
and a dynamic string. Both lower bounds hold even allowing amortization and
randomization.

stochastic generalized Gauss-Newton method (SGN) for training DNNs. SGN is a
second-order optimization method, with efficient iterations, that we
demonstrate to often require substantially fewer iterations than standard SGD
to converge. As the name suggests, SGN uses a Gauss-Newton approximation for
the Hessian matrix, and, in order to compute an approximate search direction,
relies on the conjugate gradient method combined with forward and reverse
automatic differentiation. Despite the success of SGD and its first-order
variants, and despite Hessian-free methods based on the Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation having been already theoretically proposed as practical methods
for training DNNs, we believe that SGN has a lot of undiscovered and yet not
fully displayed potential in big mini-batch scenarios. For this setting, we
demonstrate that SGN does not only substantially improve over SGD in terms of
the number of iterations, but also in terms of runtime. This is made possible
by an efficient, easy-to-use and flexible implementation of SGN we propose in
the Theano deep learning platform, which, unlike Tensorflow and Pytorch,
supports forward automatic differentiation. This enables researchers to further
study and improve this promising optimization technique and hopefully
reconsider stochastic second-order methods as competitive optimization
techniques for training DNNs; we also hope that the promise of SGN may lead to
forward automatic differentiation being added to Tensorflow or Pytorch. Our
results also show that in big mini-batch scenarios SGN is more robust than SGD
with respect to its hyperparameters (we never had to tune its step-size for our
benchmarks!), which eases the expensive process of hyperparameter tuning that
is instead crucial for the performance of first-order methods.

applications. Unlike single model fitting problems, the multi-model fitting has
additional challenges. The unknown number of models and the inlier noise scale
are the two most important of them, which are in general provided by the user
using ground-truth or some other auxiliary information. Mode seeking/
clustering-based approaches crucially depend on the quality of model hypotheses
generated. While preference analysis based guided sampling approaches have
shown remarkable performance, they operate in a time budget framework, and the
user provides the time as a reasonable guess. In this paper, we deviate from
the mode seeking and time budget framework. We propose a concept called Kernel
Residual Density (KRD) and apply it to various components of a multiple-model
fitting pipeline. The Kernel Residual Density act as a key differentiator
between inliers and outliers. We use KRD to guide and automatically stop the
sampling process. The sampling process stops after generating a set of
hypotheses that can explain all the data points. An explanation score is

cryptocurrency to date. Given its dramatic price spikes (and crashes) along
with the never-ending news from SEC regulations to security breaches, there
seems to be a lack of understanding about the dynamics of cryptocurrencies.
These dynamics are believed to be affected by various political, security,
financial, and regulatory events. In this paper, we present an efficient
framework for holistic analysis of cryptocurrency fluctuations by introducing
the Impact-Score metric to distinguish event-induced changes from normal
variations. We have applied our framework to 16 major worldwide events and the
Bitcoin blockchain network (defined as Bitcoin transaction and users,
blockchain data, and memory pool data) from 2016-2018. The results show that a
majority of the events are correlated with substantial network changes. We
observed roughly generalizable correlations between event types (e.g. financial
events) and sub-structures of the Bitcoin blockchain network. Subgroups of
these events have strongly consistent temporal impacts on specific facets (e.g.
activity or fees) of the Bitcoin ecosystem. Furthermore, we demonstrate the
robustness of our process by correlating a majority of spikes in
network/subnetwork change with major events.

reconstruct tomographic images. As X-ray is radioactive, it is desirable to
control the total amount of dose of X-ray for safety concerns. Therefore, we
can only select a limited number of measurement angles and assign each of them
limited amount of dose. Traditional methods such as compressed sensing usually
randomly select the angles and equally distribute the allowed dose on them. In
most CT reconstruction models, the emphasize is on designing effective image
representations, while much less emphasize is on improving the scanning
strategy. The simple scanning strategy of random angle selection and equal dose
distribution performs well in general, but they may not be ideal for each
individual subject. It is more desirable to design a personalized scanning
strategy for each subject to obtain better reconstruction result. In this
paper, we propose to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a personalized
scanning policy to select the angles and the dose at each chosen angle for each
individual subject. We first formulate the CT scanning process as an MDP, and
then use modern deep RL methods to solve it. The learned personalized scanning
strategy not only leads to better reconstruction results, but also shows strong
generalization to be combined with different reconstruction algorithms.

causal effect of policy interventions in observational studies. DID employs a
before and after comparison of the treated and control units to remove bias due

Estimates from DID, however, will be biased if the outcomes for the treated and
control units evolve differently in the absence of treatment, namely if the
parallel trends assumption is violated. We propose a general identification
strategy that leverages two groups of control units whose outcomes relative to
the treated units exhibit a negative correlation, and achieves partial
identification of the average treatment effect for the treated. The identified
set is of a union bounds form that involves the minimum and maximum operators,
which makes the canonical bootstrap generally inconsistent and naive methods
overly conservative. By utilizing the directional inconsistency of the
bootstrap distribution, we develop a novel bootstrap method to construct
uniformly valid confidence intervals for the identified set and parameter of
interest when the identified set is of a union bounds form, and we establish
the method's theoretical properties. We develop a simple falsification test and

Hamiltonians for a three-body systems consisting of identical bosons mutually
coupled by a two-body interaction of zero range. For a large part of the
presentation, infinite scattering length will be considered (the unitarity
regime). The subject has several precursors in the mathematical literature. We
proceed through an operator-theoretic construction of the self-adjoint
extensions of the minimal operator obtained by restricting the free Hamiltonian
to wave-functions that vanish in the vicinity of the coincidence hyperplanes:
all extensions thus model an interaction precisely supported at the spatial
configurations where particles come on top of each other. Among them, we select
the physically relevant ones, by implementing in the operator construction the
presence of the specific short-scale structure suggested by formal physical
arguments that are ubiquitous in the physical literature on zero-range methods.
This is done by applying at different stages the self-adjoint extension schemes
a la Kre{\u\i}n-Vi\v{s}ik-Birman and a la von Neumann. We produce a class of
canonical models for which we also analyse the structure of the negative bound
states. Bosonicity and zero range combined together make such canonical models
display the typical Thomas and Efimov spectra, i.e., sequence of energy
eigenvalues accumulating to both minus infinity and zero. We also discuss a
type of regularisation that prevents such spectral instability while retaining
an effective short-scale pattern. Beside the operator qualification, we also
present the associated energy quadratic forms. We structured our analysis so as
to clarify certain steps of the operator-theoretic construction that are
notoriously subtle for the correct identification of a domain of
self-adjointness.

dynamics takes place on a subset of phase space of reduced dimensionality and
is organized by a complex tangle of stable, neutral and unstable manifolds. Key
topological invariants of this phase space structure such as attractor
dimension, and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy so far remained elusive.
  Here we calculate the complete Lyapunov spectrum of recurrent neural
networks. We show that chaos in these networks is extensive with a
size-invariant Lyapunov spectrum and characterized by attractor dimensions much
smaller than the number of phase space dimensions. We find that near the onset
of chaos, for very intense chaos, and discrete-time dynamics, random matrix
theory provides analytical approximations to the full Lyapunov spectrum. We
show that a generalized time-reversal symmetry of the network dynamics induces
a point-symmetry of the Lyapunov spectrum reminiscent of the symplectic
structure of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Fluctuating input reduces both the
entropy rate and the attractor dimension. For trained recurrent networks, we
find that Lyapunov spectrum analysis provides a quantification of error
propagation and stability achieved. Our methods apply to systems of arbitrary
connectivity, and we describe a comprehensive set of controls for the accuracy
and convergence of Lyapunov exponents.
  Our results open a novel avenue for characterizing the complex dynamics of

introduces visual summarization of lecture video segments to enhance
navigation. A lecture video is divided into segments based on the
frame-to-frame similarity of content. The user navigates the lecture video
content by viewing a single frame visual and textual summary of each segment.
The paper presents a novel methodology to generate the visual summary of a

the segment and employing a graph-based algorithm to identify the subset of
most representative images. The results from this research are integrated into
a real-world lecture video management portal called Videopoints. To collect
ground truth for evaluation, a survey was conducted where multiple users
manually provided visual summaries for 40 lecture video segments. The users
also stated whether any images were not selected for the summary because they
were similar to other selected images. The graph based algorithm for
identifying summary images achieves 78% precision and 72% F1-measure with
frequently selected images as the ground truth, and 94% precision and 72%
F1-measure with the union of all user selected images as the ground truth. For
98% of algorithm selected visual summary images, at least one user also
selected that image for their summary or considered it similar to another image
they selected. Over 65% of automatically generated summaries were rated as good
or very good by the users on a 4-point scale from poor to very good. Overall,
the results establish that the methodology introduced in this paper produces
good quality visual summaries that are practically useful for lecture video

growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with a semi-analytical model for

of galaxies and active galactic nuclei at a wide redshift range. By tracing the
growth history of individual SMBHs, we find that the fraction of the SMBH mass
acquired during the super-Eddington accretion phases to the total SMBH mass
becomes larger for less massive black holes and at higher redshift. Even at z =
0, SMBHs with > 1e+9 Msun have acquired more than 50% of their mass by
super-Eddington accretions, which is apparently inconsistent with classical
Soltan's argument. However, the mass-weighted radiation efficiency of SMBHs
with > 1e+8 Msun obtained with our model, is about 0.08 at z = 0, which is
consistent with Soltan's argument within the observational uncertainties. We,
therefore, conclude that Soltan's argument cannot reject the possibility that
SMBHs are grown mainly by super-Eddington accretions.

systems of these hosts are complete and mostly cleaned of contaminants down to

the host-to-host scatter predicted by the model is in close agreement with the

sample of 12 well-surveyed satellite systems of MW-like hosts in the Local

investigate the radial distribution of satellites and compare with $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological simulations, including big-box cosmological simulations and high
resolution zoom in simulations of MW sized halos. We find that the observed
satellites are significantly more centrally concentrated than the simulated
systems. Several of the observed hosts, including the MW, are $\sim2\sigma$
outliers relative to the simulated hosts in being too concentrated, while none
of the observed hosts are less centrally concentrated than the simulations.
This result is robust to different ways of measuring the radial concentration.

which the parity-time-reversal (PT) symmetry is conserved. First, the density

framework, for different sets of luminosity and magnetic field. We
appropriately use magnetic opacity, instead of Kramer's opacity, wherever
required. We show that the Chandrasekhar-limit is retained, even at high
luminosity upto about 10^{-2} solar luminosity but without magnetic field, if
the temperature is set constant inside the interface. However there is an
increased mass for large-radius white dwarfs, an effect of photon diffusion.
Nevertheless, in the presence of strong magnetic fields, with central strength
of about 10^{14} G, super-Chandrasekhar white dwarfs, with masses of about 1.9
solar mass, are obtained even when the temperature inside the interface is kept
constant. Most interestingly, small-radius magnetic white dwarfs remain
super-Chandrasekhar even if their luminosity decreases to as low as about
10^{-20} solar luminosity. However, their large-radius counterparts in the same

primeval star-forming galaxies, with a minor role of high-z active galactic
nuclei. Recent observations, however, challenge this notion, indicating a
number of issues related to a galaxy-driven reionization scenario. We provide
here an updated assessment of the space density of relatively faint
(M1450~-22.5) AGNs at zspec~5.5 in order to improve the estimate of the
photo-ionization rate contribution from accreting super massive black holes.
Exploiting deep UV rest-frame ground-based spectra collected at the Very Large
Telescope on the CANDELS/GOODS-South field and deep Chandra X-ray images in the
CANDELS/GOODS-North and EGS areas, we find two relatively bright (M1450~-22.5)
AGNs at zspec~5.5. We derive an AGN space density of Phi=1.29x10^-6 cMpc^-3 at
z~5.5 and M1450~-22.5 by simply dividing their observed number by the
cosmological volume in the range 5.0<z<6.1. Our estimate does not consider
corrections for incompleteness, therefore it represents a lower limit, although
uncertainties due to cosmic variance can still be significant. This value
supports a high space density of AGNs at z>5, in contrast with previous claims
mostly based on standard color selection, possibly affected by significant
incompleteness. Our estimate for the AGN photo-ionization rate at z~5.5 is in
agreement with the observed values at similar redshifts, which are needed to

represented by the experimental threshold on the energy transfer to the nuclear

equivalent to a few ionization electrons. In these conditions, the contribution
of a Bremsstrahlung photon or a so-called Migdal electron due to the sudden
acceleration of a nucleus after a collision might be sizable. In the present
work, we use a Bayesian approach to study how these effects can be exploited in
experiments based on liquid argon detectors. In particular, taking inspiration
from the DarkSide-50 public spectra, we develop a simulated experiment to show
how the Migdal electron and the Bremsstrahlung photon allow to push the
experimental sensitivity down to masses of 0.1 GeV/c^2, extending the search
region for dark matter particles of previous results. For these masses we
estimate the effect of the Earth shielding that, for strongly interacting dark
matter, makes any detector blind. Finally, we show how the sensitivity scales

date, with a luminosity intermediate between the bulk of the population and
iPTF16fnl. Its proximity allowed a very early detection and triggering of
multiwavelength and spectroscopic follow-up well before maximum light. The
velocity dispersion of the host galaxy and fits to the TDE light curve indicate
a black hole mass $\approx 10^6$ M$_\odot$, disrupting a star of $\approx 1$
M$_\odot$. Comprehensive UV, optical and X-ray data shows that the early
optical emission is dominated by an outflow, with a luminosity evolution $L
\propto t^2$, consistent with a photosphere expanding at constant velocity
($\gtrsim 2000$ km s$^{-1}$), and a line-forming region producing initially
blueshifted H and He II profiles with $v=3000-10000$ km s$^{-1}$. The fastest
optical ejecta approach the velocity inferred from radio detections (modelled
in a forthcoming companion paper from K.~D.~Alexander et al.), thus the same
outflow may be responsible for both the fast optical rise and the radio
emission -- the first time this connection has been observed in a TDE. The
light curve rise begins $29 \pm 2$ days before maximum light, peaking when the
photosphere reaches the radius where optical photons can escape. The
photosphere then undergoes a sudden transition, first cooling at constant
radius then contracting at constant temperature. At the same time, the
blueshifts disappear from the spectrum and Bowen fluorescence lines (N III)
become prominent, implying a source of far-UV photons, while the X-ray light
curve peaks at $\approx 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Assuming that these X-rays are
from prompt accretion, the size and mass of the outflow are consistent with the
reprocessing layer needed to explain the large optical to X-ray ratio in this
and other optical TDEs, possibly favouring accretion-powered over
collision-powered outflow models.

referred to as {\it Internal Linear Combination} (ILC), has been extensively
employed in the measurement of cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies
and its secondaries along with similar application in 21cm data analysis. Here
we argue and demonstrate that ILC methods can also be applied to data from
absolutely-calibrated CMB experiments to extract average-sky signals in
addition to the conventional CMB anisotropies. The performance of the simple
ILC method is, however, limited, but can be significantly improved by adding
constraints informed by physics and existing empirical information. In recent
work, a moment description has been introduced as a technique of carrying out
high precision modeling of foregrounds in the presence of inevitable averaging
effects. We combine these two approaches to construct a heavily constrained
form of the ILC, dubbed \milc, which can be used to recover tiny monopolar
spectral distortion signals in the presence of realistic foregrounds and
instrumental noise. This is a first demonstration for measurements of the
monopolar and anisotropic spectral distortion signals using ILC and extended
moment methods. We also show that CMB anisotropy measurements can be improved,
reducing foreground biases and signal uncertainties when using the \milc. While
here we focus on CMB spectral distortions, the scope extends to the 21cm
monopole signal and $B$-mode analysis. We briefly discuss augmentations that
need further study to reach the full potential of the method.

in population mobility due to social distancing on the COVID-19 infection
growth rate. Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological
model we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19
deaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19
infections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is
a function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that
predicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population
mobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth
rate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the
mobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which
COVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model
on publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded
100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google
Mobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the
country level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be
accurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit
category of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence
interval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of
the pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction
in population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic.
Moreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a
readily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful
indicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.

risk to electric grids. When GMDs occur, they can cause geomagnetically-induced
currents (GICs), which saturate transformers, induce hot-spot heating, and
increase reactive power losses in the transmission grid. Furthermore,
uncertainty in the magnitude and orientation of the geo-electric field, and
insufficient historical data make the problem of mitigating the effects of
uncertain GMDs challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel distributionally
robust optimization (DRO) approach that models uncertain GMDs and mitigates the
effects of GICs on electric grids. This is achieved via a set of mitigation
actions (e.g., line switching, locating blocking devices, generator re-dispatch
and load shedding), prior to the GMD event, such that the worst-case
expectation of the system cost is minimized. To this end, we develop a
column-and-constraint generation algorithm that solves a sequence of
mixed-integer second-order conic programs to handle the underlying convex
support set of the uncertain GMDs. Also, we present a monolithic exact
reformulation of our DRO model when the underlying support set can be
approximated by a polytope with three extreme points. Numerical experiments on
'epri-21' system show the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and the exact
reformulation of our DRO model.

physics of the jet-medium interaction that sets the post-breakout jet
morphology has never been explored systematically. Here we use a suite of 3D
simulations to follow the evolution of hydrodynamic long and short gamma-ray
bursts (GRBs) jets after breakout to study the post-breakout structure induced
by the interaction. Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor fingers that grow
from the cocoon into the jet, mix cocoon with jet material and destabilize the
jet. The mixing gives rise to a previously unidentified region sheathing the
jet from the cocoon, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface (JCI). long GRBs
undergo strong mixing, resulting in most of the jet energy to drift into the
JCI, while in short GRBs weaker mixing is possible, leading to a comparable
amount of energy in the two components. Remarkably, the jet structure (jet-core
plus JCI) can be characterized by simple universal angular power-law
distributions, with power-law indices that depend solely on the mixing level.
This result supports the commonly used power-law angular distribution, and
disfavors Gaussian jets. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the
structure is more complex. The mixing shapes the prompt emission light curve
and implies that typical long GRB afterglows are different from those of short
GRBs. Our predictions can be used to infer jet characteristics from prompt and
afterglow observations.

$G \sim 2e^2/h$ while the bulk gap remains almost unchanged. We also study the
transition into the ordered state at finite temperature and field. We determine
the scaling of critical temperatures as a function of magnetic field, $B$, and
distance to the zero field critical point and find sublinear scaling with
magnetic field for weak and intermediate strength interactions, and $\sqrt{B}$
scaling at the coupling associated with the zero field quantum critical point.

generalizing the least squares GANs (LSGANs) by using a $k$th order absolute
error distortion measure with $k \geq 1$ (which recovers the LSGAN loss
function when $k=2$). It is shown that minimizing this generalized loss

minimizing the $k$th-order Pearson-Vajda divergence. Another novel GAN
generator loss function is next proposed in terms of R\'{e}nyi cross-entropy

this R\'{e}nyi-centric generalized loss function, which provably reduces to the
original GAN loss function as $\alpha\to1$, preserves the equilibrium point
satisfied by the original GAN based on the Jensen-R\'{e}nyi divergence, a
natural extension of the Jensen-Shannon divergence.
  Experimental results indicate that the proposed loss functions, applied to
the MNIST and CelebA datasets, under both DCGAN and StyleGAN architectures,
confer performance benefits by virtue of the extra degrees of freedom provided

experiments show improvements with regard to the quality of the generated
images as measured by the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) score and training
stability. While it was applied to GANs in this study, the proposed approach is

nowcast dengue based on several time series models, which vary in complexity

with an explicitly correlated two-body unitary operator. This Hamiltonian is
Hermitian, includes no more than two-particle interactions, and is free of

with extremely compact bases, produces explicitly correlated energies
comparable to those from much larger bases. For the chemical species studied
here, explicitly correlated energies based on an underlying 6-31G basis had
cc-pVTZ quality. The use of the very compact transcorrelated Hamiltonian

and high-dimensional parameter spaces in search of new scientific discoveries.
Materials science is no exception; the wide variety of synthesis, processing,
and environmental conditions that influence material properties gives rise to
particularly vast parameter spaces. Recent advances have led to an increase in
efficiency of materials discovery by increasingly automating the exploration
processes. Methods for autonomous experimentation have become more
sophisticated recently, allowing for multi-dimensional parameter spaces to be
explored efficiently and with minimal human intervention, thereby liberating
the scientists to focus on interpretations and big-picture decisions. Gaussian
process regression (GPR) techniques have emerged as the method of choice for
steering many classes of experiments. We have recently demonstrated the
positive impact of GPR-driven decision-making algorithms on autonomously
steering experiments at a synchrotron beamline. However, due to the complexity
of the experiments, GPR often cannot be used in its most basic form, but rather
has to be tuned to account for the special requirements of the experiments. Two
requirements seem to be of particular importance, namely inhomogeneous
measurement noise (input dependent or non-i.i.d.) and anisotropic kernel
functions, which are the two concepts that we tackle in this paper. Our
synthetic and experimental tests demonstrate the importance of both concepts
for experiments in materials science and the benefits that result from
including them in the autonomous decision-making process.

increasing attention; however, their empirical performance on benchmark tasks
(e.g. image classification) are significantly inferior to discrete-layer
models. We demonstrate an explanation for their poorer performance is the
inaccuracy of existing gradient estimation methods: the adjoint method has
numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method directly
back-propagates through ODE solvers, but suffers from a redundantly deep
computation graph when searching for the optimal stepsize. We propose the
Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: in automatic differentiation, ACA
applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode
trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes
redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive
solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive
method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE
trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest
reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods.
Finally, in an example of the three-body problem, we show NODE with ACA can
incorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy. We provide the

is typically ignored in the reduction procedure and is assumed to be zero
instead. However, such a reduced-order model may be a bad approximation to the
full-order system, if the initial condition is not zero. In the literature
there are several attempts for modified reduction methods at the price of
having no error bound or only a posteriori error bounds which are often too
expensive to evaluate. In this work we propose a new balancing procedure that
is based on a shift transformation on the state. We first derive a joint
projection reduced-order model in which the part of the system depending only
on the input and the one depending only on the initial value are reduced at
once and we prove an a priori error bound. With this result at hand, we derive
a separate projection procedure in which the two parts are reduced separately.
This gives the freedom to choose different reduction orders for the different
subsystems. Moreover, we discuss how the reduced-order models can be
constructed in practice. Since the error bounds are parameter-dependent we show
how they can be optimized efficiently. We conclude this paper by comparing our
results with the ones from the literature by a series of numerical experiments.

efficiently analyze various types of data collected by IoT devices for

overcome this challenge, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a means
for enabling edge devices to train a shared machine learning model without data
exchanges thus reducing communication overhead and preserving data privacy.
However, Google's seminal FL algorithm requires all devices to be directly
connected with a central controller, which significantly limits its application
scenarios. In this context, this paper introduces a novel FL framework, called
collaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with less
reliance on a central controller. The fundamentals of this framework are
developed and then, a number of communication techniques are proposed so as to
improve the performance of CFL. To this end, an overview of centralized
learning, Google's seminal FL, and CFL is first presented. For each type of
learning, the basic architecture as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and
usage conditions are introduced. Then, three CFL performance metrics are
presented and a suite of communication techniques ranging from network
formation, device scheduling, mobility management, and coding is introduced to
optimize the performance of CFL. For each technique, future research
opportunities are also discussed. In a nutshell, this article will showcase how
the proposed CFL framework can be effectively implemented at the edge of
large-scale wireless systems such as the Internet of Things.

designed for placing inside the commercial head coil to enhance the transmit
field homogeneity and to improve the receive signal sensitivity. Each element
of the array is a coupled-split-ring resonator (CSRR), which they are decoupled
for each other using critical overlap technique. Phantom and ex-vivo MRI

those whose metallic absorption content is limited to or dominated by the
$H$-band Mn II lines. Due to the fainter magnitudes probed by the APOGEE survey
as compared to past studies, only 9/269 stars in the sample were previously
known as HgMn types. The 260 newly-identified HgMn stars represents a more than
doubling of the known sample. At least 32% of the APOGEE sample are found to be

a near scale-free fluctuation spectrum P(k). These two processes are intimately
connected via the initiation and duration of the inflationary phase. But a
recent study based on the latest Planck release suggests that P(k) has a hard
cutoff, k_min > 0, inconsistent with this conventional picture. Here we
demonstrate quantitatively that most---perhaps all---slow-roll inflationary
models fail to accommodate this minimum cutoff. We show that the small
parameter `epsilon' must be > 0.9 throughout the inflationary period to comply
with the data, seriously violating the slow-roll approximation. Models with
such an epsilon predict extremely red spectral indices, at odds with the
measured value. We also consider extensions to the basic picture (suggested by
several earlier workers) by adding a kinetic-dominated or radiation-dominated
phase preceding the slow-roll expansion. Our approach differs from previously
published treatments principally because we require these modifications
to---not only fit the measured fluctuation spectrum, but to simultaneously
also---fix the horizon problem. We show, however, that even such measures
preclude a joint resolution of the horizon problem and the missing correlations

which are progenitors of UCDs. We numerically investigate this formation
process for a wide range of model parameters using N-body simulations. This
means that IMBH growth and feedback is neglected in this study. We find that
only massive IMBHs of $10^5~\rm M_\odot$ sink into the central regions of their
host dwarf ($\approx 10^{10}~\rm M_\odot$) to be gravitationally trapped by its
stellar nucleus within less than 1 Gyr in most dwarf models. We also find that
lighter IMBHs with $[1 - 30] \times 10^3~\rm M_\odot$ sink into the centre in
low-mass dwarfs ($\approx 10^{9}~\rm M_\odot$) due to more efficient dynamical
friction (DF). Additionally, we show that the IMBHs can form binaries in the
centre and, rarely, before they reach the centre, which may lead to the IMBHs
merging and thus emitting gravitational waves that could be detected by LISA.
Finally, we discuss the required number of IMBHs for the MBH formation in UCDs

image decomposition in two HST bands (UVIS-F606W and IR-F110W) to measure host

colors and the mass-to-light ratio. The stellar masses of our targets are
mostly dominated by a bulge component. The BH masses and stellar masses of our

quiescent bulge-dominant galaxies, with no strong evidence of evolution in the

We found a good correlation between the host fractions derived with both

different systematics in both approaches. This study paves the way for upcoming

model describes the transport of charge carriers in the electrolyte when the
oxygen partial pressure is extremely low by accounting for the spatial
variation of the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the electrolyte.
Moreover, we identify four quantities that characterize the distribution of
oxygen partial pressure in the electrolyte, which are directly related to the
degradation mechanisms in the electrolyte as well: the two oxygen partial
pressures at the interfaces of the electrodes and the electrolyte, the oxygen
partial pressure at the interface of YSZ/GDC, and the position of the abrupt
change in oxygen potential near the p-n junction that develops in YSZ when one
side of the cell is exposed to fuel (low oxygen potential, n-type conduction)
and the other side is exposed to oxidant (high oxygen potential, p-type
conduction). We give analytical estimates for all of these quantities. These
analytical expressions provide guidance on the parameters that need to be
controlled to suppress the degradation observed in the electrolyte. In
addition, the effects of operating conditions, particularly current density and
operating temperature, on degradation are discussed.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Performance of neural network models relies on the availability of large
datasets with minimal levels of uncertainty. Transfer Learning (TL) models have
been proposed to resolve the issue of small dataset size by letting the model
train on a bigger, task-related reference dataset and then fine-tune on a
smaller, task-specific dataset. In this work, we apply a transfer learning
approach to improve predictive power in noisy data systems with large variable
confidence datasets. We propose a deep neural network method called Filtered
Transfer Learning (FTL) that defines multiple tiers of data confidence as
separate tasks in a transfer learning setting. The deep neural network is
fine-tuned in a hierarchical process by iteratively removing (filtering) data
points with lower label confidence, and retraining. In this report we use FTL
for predicting the interaction of drugs and proteins. We demonstrate that using
FTL to learn stepwise, across the label confidence distribution, results in
higher performance compared to deep neural network models trained on a single
confidence range. We anticipate that this approach will enable the machine
learning community to benefit from large datasets with uncertain labels in
fields such as biology and medicine.

betters LCA and finite-time LCA (recently developed continuous-time dynamical

complicated Jacobian determinant, in ten variables, for the relativistic

specifically we calculate the determinant for $p\mapsto u = \theta

potentials is still an area of active research. In three dimensions, a number
of issues need to be addressed, including the specification of the surface as
the union of high-order patches, the incorporation of accurate quadrature rules
for integrating singular or weakly singular Green's functions on such patches,
and their coupling to the oct-tree data structures on which the FMM separates
near and far field interactions. Although the latter is straightforward for
point distributions, the near field for a patch is determined by its physical
dimensions, not the distribution of discretization points on the surface.
  Here, we present a general framework for efficiently coupling locally
corrected quadratures with FMMs, relying primarily on what are called
generalized Gaussian quadratures rules, supplemented by adaptive integration.
The approach, however, is quite general and easily applicable to other schemes,
such as Quadrature by Expansion (QBX). We also introduce a number of
accelerations to reduce the cost of quadrature generation itself, and present
several numerical examples of acoustic scattering that demonstrate the
accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency of the scheme. On a single

the most effective methods of imitating/approximating the radiation boundary
condition in Maxwell and wave equation solvers. Many PML implementations often
use a smoothly-increasing attenuation coefficient to increase the absorption
for a given layer thickness, and, at the same time, to reduce the numerical
reflection from the interface between the computation domain and the PML. In
discontinuous Galerkin time-domain (DGTD) methods, using a PML coefficient that
varies within a mesh element requires a different mass matrix to be stored for
every element and therefore significantly increases the memory footprint. In
this work, this bottleneck is addressed by applying a weight-adjusted
approximation to these mass matrices. The resulting DGTD scheme has the same
advantages as the scheme that stores individual mass matrices, namely higher
accuracy (due to reduced numerical reflection) and increased meshing

building blocks for a broad range of self-assembled materials. However, one of
the well-known drawbacks to this strategy is that these building blocks rapidly
and readily condense into a metastable colloidal gel. Using computer
simulations, we illustrate how the addition of a small fraction of purely
repulsive self-propelled colloids, a technique referred to as active doping,
can prevent the formation of this metastable gel state and drive the system
toward its thermodynamically favored crystalline target structure. The
simplicity and robust nature of this strategy offers a systematic and generic
pathway to improving the self-assembly of a large number of complex colloidal
structures. We discuss in detail the process by which this feat is accomplished
and provide quantitative metrics for exploiting it to modulate self-assembly.
We provide evidence for the generic nature of this approach by demonstrating
that it remains robust under a number of different anisotropic short-ranged
pair interactions in both two and three dimensions. In addition, we report on a
novel microphase in mixtures of passive and active colloids. For a broad range
of self-propelling velocities, it is possible to stabilize a suspension of
fairly monodisperse finite-size crystallites. Surprisingly, this microphase is
also insensitive to the underlying pair interaction between building blocks.
The active stabilization of these moderately-sized monodisperse clusters is
quite remarkable and should be of great utility in the design of hierarchical
self-assembly strategies. This work further bolsters the notion that active
forces can play a pivotal role in directing colloidal self-assembly.

enhance the Secrecy Sum Rate (SSR) for the Multiple Input Single Output (MISO)
Broadcast Channel (BC), consisting of two legitimate users and one
eavesdropper, with perfect Channel State Information (CSI) available at all
nodes. For CRS based on the three-node relay channel, the transmitter splits
and encodes the messages of legitimate users into common and private streams
based on Rate-Splitting (RS). With the goal of maximizing SSR, the proposed CRS
strategy opportunistically asks the relaying legitimate user to forward its
decoded common message. During the transmission, the eavesdropper keeps
wiretapping silently. To ensure secure transmission, the common message is used
for the dual purpose, serving both as a desired message and Artificial Noise
(AN) without consuming extra transmit power comparing to the conventional AN
design. Taking into account the total power constraint and the Physical Layer
(PHY) security, the precoders and time-slot allocation are jointly optimized by
solving the non-convex SSR maximization problem based on Sequential Convex
Approximation (SCA) algorithm. Numerical results show that the proposed CRS
secure transmission scheme outperforms existing Multi-User Linear Precoding

important signal comes from the charging of the spacecraft, less from charging
of an antenna. The present work is an extension of the work of Zaslavsky. An
analytical treatment of the physics of a hypersonic dust impact and the
mechanism for generating an electrical signal in a sensor, an antenna, is
presented. The treatment is compared with observations from STEREO and Parker
Solar Probe. A full treatment of this process by simulations seems beyond
present computer capabilities, but some parts of the treatment can must depend
on simulations but other features can be better understood through analytical
treatment. Evidence for a somewhat larger contribution from the antenna part of
the signal than in previous publications is presented. Importance of
electrostatic forces in forming the exiting plasma cloud is emphasized.
Electrostatic forces lead to a rapid expansion of the escaping cloud, so that
it expands more rapidly than escapes, and frequently surrounds one or more
antennas. This accounts for the ability of dipole antennas to detect dust
impacts. Some progress toward an understanding occasional negative charging of
an antenna is presented, together with direct evidence of such charging. Use of
laboratory measurements of charge to estimate size of spacecraft impacts are
shown to be not reliable without further calibration work.

study (45 with retinal edema and 6 healthy controls). A CNN with U-Net-like

Cross-sectional OCT and angiography (OCTA) scans were used for training and

Area-under-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-curve (AROC),

(F1 = 0.892 +/- 0.038) by including information from both OCTA and structural

retinal fluid can provide more comprehensive information than the 2D area,

deep-learning-based method can accurately segment retinal fluid volumetrically

solar chromosphere. It remains unclear how these prevalent jets originate from
the solar surface and what role they play in heating the solar atmosphere.
Using the Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory, we observed
spicules emerging within minutes of the appearance of opposite-polarity
magnetic flux around dominant-polarity magnetic field concentrations. Data from
the Solar Dynamics Observatory showed subsequent heating of the adjacent
corona. The dynamic interaction of magnetic fields (likely due to magnetic
reconnection) in the partially ionized lower solar atmosphere appears to
generate these spicules and heat the upper solar atmosphere.

  Closed Form",,"Thirty-fourth Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems
  2020",,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although optimal transport (OT) problems admit closed form solutions in a
very few notable cases, e.g. in 1D or between Gaussians, these closed forms
have proved extremely fecund for practitioners to define tools inspired from
the OT geometry. On the other hand, the numerical resolution of OT problems
using entropic regularization has given rise to many applications, but because
there are no known closed-form solutions for entropic regularized OT problems,
these approaches are mostly algorithmic, not informed by elegant closed forms.
In this paper, we propose to fill the void at the intersection between these
two schools of thought in OT by proving that the entropy-regularized optimal
transport problem between two Gaussian measures admits a closed form. Contrary
to the unregularized case, for which the explicit form is given by the
Wasserstein-Bures distance, the closed form we obtain is differentiable
everywhere, even for Gaussians with degenerate covariance matrices. We obtain
this closed form solution by solving the fixed-point equation behind Sinkhorn's
algorithm, the default method for computing entropic regularized OT.
Remarkably, this approach extends to the generalized unbalanced case -- where
Gaussian measures are scaled by positive constants. This extension leads to a
closed form expression for unbalanced Gaussians as well, and highlights the
mass transportation / destruction trade-off seen in unbalanced optimal
transport. Moreover, in both settings, we show that the optimal transportation
plans are (scaled) Gaussians and provide analytical formulas of their
parameters. These formulas constitute the first non-trivial closed forms for
entropy-regularized optimal transport, thus providing a ground truth for the
analysis of entropic OT and Sinkhorn's algorithm.

search experiments because of their superb light-emission quality. The crystal
light yield is generally high, above 10 photoelectrons per keV, and its
emission spectrum is peaked around 400 nm, which matches well to the sensitive
region of bialkali photocathode photomultiplier tubes. However, since NaI(Tl)
crystals are hygroscopic, a sophisticated method of encapsulation has to be
applied that prevents moisture from chemically attacking the crystal and
thereby degrading the emission. In addition, operation with low energy
thresholds, which is essential for a number of new phenomenon searches, is
usually limited by the crystal light yield; in these cases higher light yields
can translate into lower thresholds that improve the experimental sensitivity.
Here we describe the development of an encapsulation technique that simplifies
the overall design by attaching the photo sensors directly to the crystal so
that light losses are minimized. The light yield of a NaI(Tl) crystal
encapsulated with this technique was improved by more than 30%, and as many as
22 photoelectrons per keV have been measured. Consequently, the energy
threshold can be lowered and the energy resolution improved. Detectors with
this higher light yield are sensitive to events with sub-keV energies and well
suited for low-mass dark matter particle searches and measurements of
neutrino-nucleus coherent scattering.

recent interests for Wasserstein metrics and barycenters in machine learning.
It allows to keep the appealing geometrical properties of the unregularized
Wasserstein distance while having a significantly lower complexity thanks to
Sinkhorn's algorithm. However, entropy brings some inherent smoothing bias,
resulting for example in blurred barycenters. This side effect has prompted an
increasing temptation in the community to settle for a slower algorithm such as
log-domain stabilized Sinkhorn which breaks the parallel structure that can be
leveraged on GPUs, or even go back to unregularized OT. Here we show how this
bias is tightly linked to the reference measure that defines the entropy
regularizer and propose debiased Wasserstein barycenters that preserve the best
of both worlds: fast Sinkhorn-like iterations without entropy smoothing.
Theoretically, we prove that the entropic OT barycenter of univariate Gaussians
is a Gaussian and quantify its variance bias. This result is obtained by
extending the differentiability and convexity of entropic OT to sub-Gaussian
measures with unbounded supports. Empirically, we illustrate the reduced
blurring and the computational advantage on various applications.

traffic sign regions (instead of the whole image) in the challenging images

machines should make many local steps between such communications. While the

flow resistance and decreasing arterial compliance. The height and position of
the secondary peak were determined by a combination of the flow resistance,
arterial compliance, and blood inertance. The results suggest that the risk of
hypertension may increase with age because decreases in flow rate due to an
increase in flow resistance and a decrease in arterial compliance were more
substantial than the increase in flow rate caused by a decrease in blood
inertance. The proposed method can provide information to examine how factors,
such as aging, disease, and exercise, affect the flow rate in blood vessels.

resolve a long-standing question that many recent results have attempted to
tackle: we completely characterize the convergence behavior of EM, and show
that the EM algorithm achieves minimax optimal sample complexity under all SNR
regimes. In particular, when the SNR is sufficiently large, the EM updates
converge to the true parameter $\theta^{*}$ at the standard parametric
convergence rate $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/2})$ after $\mathcal{O}(\log(n/d))$
iterations. In the regime where the SNR is above $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$ and
below some constant, the EM iterates converge to a $\mathcal{O}({\rm SNR}^{-1}
(d/n)^{1/2})$ neighborhood of the true parameter, when the number of iterations
is of the order $\mathcal{O}({\rm SNR}^{-2} \log(n/d))$. In the low SNR regime
where the SNR is below $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$, we show that EM converges to
a $\mathcal{O}((d/n)^{1/4})$ neighborhood of the true parameters, after
$\mathcal{O}((n/d)^{1/2})$ iterations. Notably, these results are achieved
under mild conditions of either random initialization or an efficiently
computable local initialization. By providing tight convergence guarantees of
the EM algorithm in middle-to-low SNR regimes, we fill the remaining gap in the
literature, and significantly, reveal that in low SNR, EM changes rate,
matching the $n^{-1/4}$ rate of the MLE, a behavior that previous work had been

paper shows that decomposing the total problem in different dimensions affects
the strong scaling performance significantly for the GPU. Without proper
performance optimizations, it is shown that 1D domain decomposition scales
poorly on multiple GPUs due to the noncontiguous memory access. The performance
using whatever decompositions can be benefited from a series of performance
optimizations in the paper. Since the buoyancy driven cavity code is
latency-bounded on the clusters examined, a series of optimizations both
agnostic and tailored to the platforms are designed to reduce the latency cost
and improve memory throughput between hosts and devices efficiently. First, the
parallel message packing/unpacking strategy developed for noncontiguous data
movement between hosts and devices improves the overall performance by about a
factor of 2. Second, transferring different data based on the stencil sizes for
different variables further reduces the communication overhead. These two
optimizations are general enough to be beneficial to stencil computations
having ghost changes on all of the clusters tested. Third, GPUDirect is used to
improve the communication on clusters which have the hardware and software
support for direct communication between GPUs without staging CPU's memory.
Finally, overlapping the communication and computations is shown to be not
efficient on multi-GPUs if only using MPI or MPI+OpenACC. Although we believe
our implementation has revealed enough overlap, the actual running does not
utilize the overlap well due to a lack of asynchronous progression.

In this work, we remove the need for annotated datasets by proposing an
unsupervised re-identification network, thus sidestepping the labeling costs
entirely, required for training. Given unlabeled videos, our proposed method
(SimpleReID) first generates tracking labels using SORT and trains a ReID
network to predict the generated labels using crossentropy loss. We demonstrate
that SimpleReID performs substantially better than simpler alternatives, and we
recover the full performance of its supervised counterpart consistently across
diverse tracking frameworks. The observations are unusual because unsupervised
ReID is not expected to excel in crowded scenarios with occlusions, and drastic
viewpoint changes. By incorporating our unsupervised SimpleReID with
CenterTrack trained on augmented still images, we establish a new
state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets like MOT16/17 without using
tracking supervision, beating current best (CenterTrack) by 0.2-0.3 MOTA and
4.4-4.8 IDF1 scores. We further provide evidence for limited scope for
improvement in IDF1 scores beyond our unsupervised ReID in the studied
settings. Our investigation suggests reconsideration towards more
sophisticated, supervised, end-to-end trackers by showing promise in simpler
unsupervised alternatives.

the view of increasing incidences of heart related diseases worldwide. In this
study, we conduct a comprehensive study of heart sounds classification by using
various supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches on the
PhysioNet/CinC 2016 Challenge dataset. Supervised approaches, including deep
learning and machine learning methods, require large amounts of labelled data
to train the models, which are challenging to obtain in most practical
scenarios. In view of the need to reduce the labelling burden for clinical
practices, where human labelling is both expensive and time-consuming,
semi-supervised or even unsupervised approaches in restricted data setting are
desirable. A GAN based semi-supervised method is therefore proposed, which
allows the usage of unlabelled data samples to boost the learning of data
distribution. It achieves a better performance in terms of AUROC over the
supervised baseline when limited data samples exist. Furthermore, several
unsupervised methods are explored as an alternative approach by considering the
given problem as an anomaly detection scenario. In particular, the unsupervised
feature extraction using 1D CNN Autoencoder coupled with one-class SVM obtains
good performance without any data labelling. The potential of the proposed
semi-supervised and unsupervised methods may lead to a workflow tool in the
future for the creation of higher quality datasets.

introduce two approaches to estimate such a tensor factor model by using
iterative orthogonal projections of the original tensor time series. These

bandit settings, and propose algorithms that adapts to the unknown problem
complexity. In the first setting, we consider the $K$ armed mixture bandits,
where the mean reward of arm $i \in [K]$, is $\mu_i+ \langle
\alpha_{i,t},\theta^* \rangle $, with $\alpha_{i,t} \in \mathbb{R}^d$ being the
known context vector and $\mu_i \in [-1,1]$ and $\theta^*$ are unknown
parameters. We define $\|\theta^*\|$ as the problem complexity and consider a
sequence of nested hypothesis classes, each positing a different upper bound on
$\|\theta^*\|$. Exploiting this, we propose Adaptive Linear Bandit (ALB), a
novel phase based algorithm that adapts to the true problem complexity,
$\|\theta^*\|$. We show that ALB achieves regret scaling of
$O(\|\theta^*\|\sqrt{T})$, where $\|\theta^*\|$ is apriori unknown. As a
corollary, when $\theta^*=0$, ALB recovers the minimax regret for the simple
bandit algorithm without such knowledge of $\theta^*$. ALB is the first
algorithm that uses parameter norm as model section criteria for linear
bandits. Prior state of art algorithms \cite{osom} achieve a regret of
$O(L\sqrt{T})$, where $L$ is the upper bound on $\|\theta^*\|$, fed as an input
to the problem. In the second setting, we consider the standard linear bandit
problem (with possibly an infinite number of arms) where the sparsity of
$\theta^*$, denoted by $d^* \leq d$, is unknown to the algorithm. Defining
$d^*$ as the problem complexity, we show that ALB achieves $O(d^*\sqrt{T})$
regret, matching that of an oracle who knew the true sparsity level. This
methodology is then extended to the case of finitely many arms and similar
results are proven. This is the first algorithm that achieves such model
selection guarantees. We further verify our results via synthetic and real-data
experiments.

two generators to construct a test statistic, which takes the form of the
maximum of generalized covariance measures of multiple transformation

employ multiplier bootstrap to obtain the corresponding $p$-value. We show that
the constructed test statistic is doubly robust, and the resulting test both
controls type-I error and has the power approaching one asymptotically. Also
notably, we establish those theoretical guarantees under much weaker and

Pareto-Front. Prevalent multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are not purely
designed to search for multiple solution subsets, whereas, algorithms designed
for MMMOPs demonstrate degraded performance in the objective space. This
motivates the design of better algorithms for addressing MMMOPs. The present
work identifies the crowding illusion problem originating from using crowding
distance globally over the entire decision space. Subsequently, an evolutionary
framework, called graph Laplacian based Optimization using Reference vector
assisted Decomposition (LORD), is proposed, which uses decomposition in both
objective and decision space for dealing with MMMOPs. Its filtering step is
further extended to present LORD-II algorithm, which demonstrates its dynamics
on multi-modal many-objective problems. The efficacies of the frameworks are
established by comparing their performance on test instances from the CEC 2019
multi-modal multi-objective test suite and polygon problems with the
state-of-the-art algorithms for MMMOPs and other multi- and many-objective
evolutionary algorithms. The manuscript is concluded by mentioning the
limitations of the proposed frameworks and future directions to design still
better algorithms for MMMOPs. The source code is available at

Coronal loops are the basic building blocks of the solar corona,
which are related to the mass supply and heating of solar plasmas in the
corona. However, their fundamental magnetic structures are still not well
understood. Most coronal loops do not expand significantly, whereas the
diverging magnetic field would have an expansion factor of about 5-10 over one
pressure scale height. Aims. In this study, we investigate a unique coronal
loop with a roughly constant cross section, it is ultra long and quite thin. A
coronal loop model with magnetic helicity is presented to explain the small
expansion of the loop width. Methods. This coronal loop was predominantly
detectable in the 171 A channel of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA).
Then, the local magnetic field line was extrapolated by a
Potential-Field-Source-Surface model. Finally, the differential emission
measure analysis made from six AIA bandpasses was applied to obtain the thermal
properties of this loop. Results. This coronal loop has a projected length of
roughly 130 Mm, a width of about 1.5 +(-) 0.5 Mm and a lifetime of around 90
minutes. It follows an open magnetic field line. The cross section expanded
very little (i.e., 1.5-2.0) along the loop length during its whole lifetime.
This loop has a nearly constant temperature at about 0.7 +(-) 0.2 MK, whereas
its density exhibits the typical structure of a stratified atmosphere.
Conclusions. We use a thin twisted flux tube theory to construct a model for
this non-expanding loop, and find that indeed with sufficient twist a coronal
loop can attain equilibrium. However, we can not rule out other possibilities
such as footpoint heating by small-scale reconnection, elevated scale height by
a steady flow along the loop etc.

While this
has been widely exploited in motion planning methods to produce maneuvers that
obey the law, little work has been devoted to utilize these priors in
perception and motion forecasting methods. In this paper we propose to
incorporate these structured priors as a loss function. In contrast to imposing
hard constraints, this approach allows the model to handle non-compliant
maneuvers when those happen in the real world. Safe motion planning is the end
goal, and thus a probabilistic characterization of the possible future
developments of the scene is key to choose the plan with the lowest expected
cost. Towards this goal, we design a framework that leverages REINFORCE to
incorporate non-differentiable priors over sample trajectories from a
probabilistic model, thus optimizing the whole distribution. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach on real-world self-driving datasets containing
complex road topologies and multi-agent interactions. Our motion forecasts not
only exhibit better precision and map understanding, but most importantly
result in safer motion plans taken by our self-driving vehicle. We emphasize
that despite the importance of this evaluation, it has been often overlooked by
previous perception and motion forecasting works.

Here, we focus on 1) the likelihood of forming Mercury and the four terrestrial
planets in the same system (a 4-P system); 2) the orbital properties and masses
of each terrestrial planet; and 3) the timing of Earth's last giant impact and
the mass accreted by our planet thereafter. Addressing these constraints, we
performed 450 N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation based on
narrow protoplanetary disks with mass confined to 0.7-1.0 au. We identified 164
analogue systems, but only 24 systems contained Mercury analogues, and eight
systems were 4-P ones. We found that narrow disks containing a small number of
embryos with individual masses comparable to that of Mars and the giant planets
on their current orbits yielded the best prospects for satisfying those
constraints. However, serious shortcomings remain. The formation of Mercury
analogues and 4-P systems was too inefficient (5% and 2%, respectively), and
most Venus-to-Earth analogue mass ratios were incorrect. Mercury and Venus
analogues also formed too close to each other (~0.15-0.21 au) compared to
reality (0.34 au). Similarly, the mutual distances between the Venus and Earth
analogues were greater than those observed (0.34 vs. 0.28 au). Furthermore, the
Venus-Earth pair was not reproduced in orbital-mass space statistically.
Overall, our results suggest serious problems with using narrow disks to
explain the inner solar system. In particular, the formation of Mercury remains
an outstanding problem for terrestrial planet formation models.

we present new strategies to make the most efficient use of the off-chip

charge-integrating pixel detectors. In particular, we describe a novel in-pixel
compression scheme that converts from analog to digital converter units to
encoded photon counts near the photon Poisson noise level and achieves a
compression ratio of $>\!1.5\times$ independent of the dataset. In addition, we
describe a simple yet efficient zero-suppression compression scheme called
``zeromask'' (ZM) located at the ASIC's edge before streaming data off the ASIC
chip. ZM achieves average compression ratios of $>\!4\times$, $>\!7\times$, and
$>\!8\times$ for high-energy X-ray diffraction, ptychography, and X-ray photon

affine subspace in finite-dimensional space was introduced by Behling, Bello
Cruz and Santos to show the linear convergence of the block-wise

critical properties of the circumcenter mapping for linear convergence.
  Because the iteration sequence of BAM linearly converges, the BAM is
interesting in its own right. In this paper, we naturally extend the definition
of BAM from closed affine subspace to nonempty closed convex set and from
$\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to general Hilbert space. We discover that the convex set
associated with the BAM must be the fixed point set of the BAM. Hence, the
iteration sequence generated by a BAM linearly converges to the nearest fixed
point of the BAM. Connections between BAMs and other mappings generating
convergent iteration sequences are considered. Behling et al.\ proved that the
finite composition of BAMs associated with closed affine subspaces is still a
BAM in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We generalize their result from $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ to
general Hilbert space and also construct a new constant associated with the
composition of BAMs. This provides a new proof of the linear convergence of the
method of alternating projections. Moreover, compositions of BAMs associated
with general convex sets are investigated. In addition, we show that convex
combinations of BAMs associated with affine subspaces are BAMs. Last but not
least, we connect BAM with circumcenter mapping in Hilbert spaces.

properties by neutron irradiation is important for the design of future fission
and fusion power reactors. Self-ion implantation is commonly used to mimic
neutron irradiation damage, however an interesting question concerns the effect
of ion energy on the resulting damage structures. The reduction in the
thickness of the implanted layer as the implantation energy is reduced results
in the significant quandary: Does one attempt to match the primary knock-on
atom energy produced during neutron irradiation or implant at a much higher
energy, such that a thicker damage layer is produced? Here we address this
question by measuring the full strain tensor for two ion implantation energies,
2 MeV and 20 MeV in self-ion implanted tungsten, a critical material for the
first wall and divertor of fusion reactors. A comparison of 2 MeV and 20 MeV
implanted samples is shown to result in similar lattice swelling.
Multi-reflection Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (MBCDI) shows that
implantation induced strain is in fact heterogeneous at the nanoscale,
suggesting that there is a non-uniform distribution of defects, an observation
that is not fully captured by micro-beam Laue diffraction. At the surface,
MBCDI and high-resolution electron back-scattered diffraction (HR-EBSD) strain
measurements agree quite well in terms of this clustering/non-uniformity of the
strain distribution. However, MBCDI reveals that the heterogeneity at greater
depths in the sample is much larger than at the surface. This combination of
techniques provides a powerful method for detailed investigation of the
microstructural damage caused by ion bombardment, and more generally of strain
related phenomena in microvolumes that are inaccessible via any other
technique.

where each robot repetitively exchanges virtual particles (VPs) with neighbors

algorithm allows robots to achieve localization using sensor readings only,
avoiding direct communication with neighbors and keeping anonymity. Moreover,
VPE localization algorithm determines the swarm center automatically, thereby
eliminating the requirement of fixed beacons to embody the origin of
coordinates. Theoretical analysis proves that the VPE localization algorithm
can always converge to the same result regardless of initial state and has low
asymptotic time and memory complexity. Extensive localization simulations with
up to 10000 robots and experiments with 52 lowcost robots are carried out,
which verify that VPE localization algorithm is scalable, accurate and robust

further achieved in both simulations and experiments with 52 robots,
illustrating that the algorithm can be directly applied to support swarm

propose a novel Morphological Fragmental Perturbation Pyramid (MFPP) method to
solve the Explainable AI problem. In particular, we focus on the black-box
scheme, which can identify the input area that is responsible for the output of
the DNN without having to understand the internal architecture of the DNN. In
the MFPP method, we divide the input image into multi-scale fragments and
randomly mask out fragments as perturbation to generate a saliency map, which
indicates the significance of each pixel for the prediction result of the black
box model. Compared with the existing input sampling perturbation method, the
pyramid structure fragment has proved to be more effective. It can better
explore the morphological information of the input image to match its semantic
information, and does not need any value inside the DNN. We qualitatively and
quantitatively prove that MFPP meets and exceeds the performance of

corona is heated up to produce X-ray radiation much stronger than that arising
from the viscous heating within the corona. In this paper, we carry out
detailed investigations of magnetic-reconnection heating to the corona,
specifically, studying how the disc and corona are self-consistently coupled
with the magnetic field, and how the emergent spectra depend on the fundamental
parameters of AGN. It is shown that diverse spectral shapes and luminosities
over a broad bandpass from optical to X-ray can be produced from the coupled
disc and corona within a limited range of the black hole mass, accretion rate
and magnetic field strength. The relative strength of X-ray emission with
respect to optical/ultraviolet (UV) depends on the strength of the magnetic
field in the disc, which, together with accretion rate, determines the fraction
of accretion energy transported and released in the corona. This refined
disc-corona model is then applied to reproduce the broad-band spectral energy
distributions (SEDs) of a sample of 20 bright local AGNs observed
simultaneously in X-ray and optical/UV. We find that, in general, the overall
observed broad-band SEDs can be reasonably reproduced, except for rather hard
X-ray spectral shapes in some objects. The radiation pressure-dominant region,
as previously predicted for the standard accretion disc in AGN, disappears for
strong X-ray sources, revealing that AGN accretion discs are indeed commonly
stable as observed. Our study suggests the disc-corona coupling model involving

which pathogen grows in the cornea leading to inflammation and destruction of
the corneal tissues. Infectious keratitis is a medical emergency, for which a
rapid and accurate diagnosis is needed for speedy initiation of prompt and
precise treatment to halt the disease progress and to limit the extent of
corneal damage; otherwise it may develop sight-threatening and even
eye-globe-threatening condition. In this paper, we propose a sequential-level
deep learning model to effectively discriminate the distinction and subtlety of
infectious corneal disease via the classification of clinical images. In this
approach, we devise an appropriate mechanism to preserve the spatial structures
of clinical images and disentangle the informative features for clinical image
classification of infectious keratitis. In competition with 421
ophthalmologists, the performance of the proposed sequential-level deep model
achieved 80.00% diagnostic accuracy, far better than the 49.27% diagnostic
accuracy achieved by ophthalmologists over 120 test images.

specific video content. However, the lack of investigation of high frame rates
has restricted the expansion of this research field particularly in the context
of full-high-definition (FHD) and 4K ultra-high-definition video formats. This
study involves a subjective and objective quality assessment of compressed FHD
videos. First, we compress the FHD videos by employing high-efficiency video
coding, and VP9 at five quantization parameter levels for multiple frame rates,
i.e., 15fps, 30fps, and 60fps. The FHD videos are obtained from a high
frame-rate video database BVI-HFR, spanning various scenes, colors, and
motions, and are shown to be representative of the BBC broadcast content.
Second, a detailed subjective quality assessment of compressed videos for both
encoders and individual frame rates is conducted, resulting in subjective
measurements in the form of the differential mean opinion score reflecting the
quality of experience. In particular, the aim is to investigate the impact of
compression on the perceptual quality of compressed FHD videos and compare the
performance of both encoders for each frame rate. Finally, 11 state-of-the-art
objective quality assessment metrics are benchmarked using the subjective
measurements, to investigate the correlation as a statistical evaluation
between the two models in terms of correlation coefficients. A recommendation
for enhancing the quality estimation of full-reference (FR) video quality
measurements (VQMs) is presented after the extensive investigation.

solar-type stars, during which the majority of the system mass resides in an
infalling envelope of gas and dust and is not yet in the central, nascent star.
Although X-rays are a key signature of magnetic activity in more evolved
protostars and young stars, whether such magnetic activity is present at the
Class 0 stage is still debated. Aims. We aim to detect a bona fide Class 0
protostar in X-rays. Methods. We observed HOPS 383 in 2017 December in X-rays
with the Chandra X-ray Observatory ($\sim$84 ks) and in near-infrared imaging
with the Southern Astrophysical Research telescope. Results. HOPS 383 was
detected in X-rays during a powerful flare. This hard (E > 2 keV) X-ray
counterpart was spatially coincident with the northwest 4 cm component of HOPS
383, which would be the base of the radio thermal jet launched by HOPS 383. The
flare duration was $\sim$3.3 h; at the peak, the X-ray luminosity reached
$\sim$4 x 1E31 erg s --1 in the 2-8 keV energy band, a level at least an order
of magnitude larger than that of the undetected quiescent emission from HOPS
383. The X-ray flare spectrum is highly absorbed (NH $\sim$ 7 x 1E23 cm --2),
and it displays a 6.4 keV emission line with an equivalent width of $\sim$1.1
keV, arising from neutral or low-ionization iron. Conclusions. The detection of
a powerful X-ray flare from HOPS 383 constitutes direct proof that magnetic
activity can be present at the earliest formative stages of solar-type stars.

sensing paradigm utilizing sensors built into cars, they have limited sensing
scopes since car drivers only opportunistically discover new events.
Conversely, social sensing is emerging as a new sensing paradigm where
measurements about the physical world are collected from humans. In contrast to
VSNs, social sensing is more pervasive, but one of its key limitations lies in
its inconsistent reliability stemming from the data contributed by unreliable
human sensors. In this paper, we present DASC, a road Damage-Aware
Social-media-driven Car sensing framework that exploits the collective power of
social sensing and VSNs for reliable disaster response applications. However,
integrating VSNs with social sensing introduces a new set of challenges: i) How
to leverage noisy and unreliable social signals to route the vehicles to
accurate regions of interest? ii) How to tackle the inconsistent availability
(e.g., churns) caused by car drivers being rational actors? iii) How to
efficiently guide the cars to the event locations with little prior knowledge
of the road damage caused by the disaster, while also handling the dynamics of
the physical world and social media? The DASC framework addresses the above
challenges by establishing a novel hybrid social-car sensing system that
employs techniques from game theory, feedback control, and Markov Decision
Process (MDP). In particular, DASC distills signals emitted from social media
and discovers the road damages to effectively drive cars to target areas for
verifying emergency events. We implement and evaluate DASC in a reputed vehicle
simulator that can emulate real-world disaster response scenarios. The results
of a real-world application demonstrate the superiority of DASC over current
VSNs-based solutions in detection accuracy and efficiency.

such as partial volumes and variations in anatomical definitions. While in most
cases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of
interest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of
conditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to
inferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on
input images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such
distributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability
scores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is
based on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase
the expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after
the encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior
distribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.
With this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our
conditional generative model is enhanced. Performance of our model, which we
call cFlow Net, is evaluated on two medical imaging datasets demonstrating
substantial improvements in both qualitative and quantitative measures when

we put forth the stochastic graph neural network (SGNN) model: a GNN where the
distributed graph convolution module accounts for the random network changes.
Since stochasticity brings in a new learning paradigm, we conduct a statistical
analysis on the SGNN output variance to identify conditions the learned filters
should satisfy for achieving robust transference to perturbed scenarios,
ultimately revealing the explicit impact of random link losses. We further
develop a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) based learning process for the SGNN

above ~100 K, the rotation of water in its cage is overdamped and no emission
is resolved. At lower temperatures, the water rotation gains a long coherence
decay time, allowing observation of the coherent emission for 10-15 ps after
the initial excitation. We observe the real-time change of the emission pattern
after cooling to 4 K, corresponding to the conversion of a mixture of
ortho-water to para-water over the course of 10 hours.

carefully considering the correlation and differences between the two tasks.
Second, coarse nucleus proposals are generated based on the predictions of the

networks for more accurate prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that
the performance of BRP-Net is robust to the variation of post-processing

is lined with lead and thus sensitive to neutrons of energies higher than 10
MeV. For each $^3$He counter-moderator assembly, the energy dependent neutron

both the neutron energy spectrum from 10$^{-9}$ MeV to 300 MeV and the flux

  The data show that at a given depth, both the flux and the spectrum vary

substructure. This approach suggests that the isoscalar and isovector density
dependence of the SO potential can be used to test the microscopic ingredients
which are implemented in the relativistic framework: the quark substructure of
the nucleon in its ground-state and its coupling to the rich meson sector where
the $\rho$ meson plays a crucial role. This is also in line with the Vector

urgently demanded in many fields, such as health monitoring and emotion
recognition. However, most of the existing rPPG methods can only be used to get
average heart rate (HR) values due to the limitation of inaccurate pulse
signals. In this paper, a new framework based on generative adversarial
network, called PulseGAN, is introduced to generate realistic rPPG pulse
signals through denoising the chrominance signals. Considering that the cardiac
signal is quasi-periodic and has apparent time-frequency characteristics, the
error losses defined in time and spectrum domains are both employed with the
adversarial loss to enforce the model generating accurate pulse waveforms as
its reference. The proposed framework is tested on the public UBFC-RPPG
database in both within-database and cross-database configurations. The results
show that the PulseGAN framework can effectively improve the waveform quality,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of HR, the heart rate variability (HRV) and the
interbeat interval (IBI). The proposed method achieves the best performance
compared to the denoising autoencoder (DAE) and CHROM, with the mean absolute
error of AVNN (the average of all normal-to-normal intervals) improving 20.85%
and 41.19%, and the mean absolute error of SDNN (the standard deviation of all
NN intervals) improving 20.28% and 37.53%, respectively, in the cross-database

techniques.

data with appropriate uncertainty quantification. However, as the dimension of
the observations increases, posterior inference often tends to favor too many
or too few clusters. This article explains this behavior by studying the random
partition posterior in a non-standard setting with a fixed sample size and
increasing data dimensionality. We provide conditions under which the finite
sample posterior tends to either assign every observation to a different
cluster or all observations to the same cluster as the dimension grows.
Interestingly, the conditions do not depend on the choice of clustering prior,
as long as all possible partitions of observations into clusters have positive
prior probabilities, and hold irrespective of the true data-generating model.
We then propose a class of latent mixtures for Bayesian clustering (Lamb) on a
set of low-dimensional latent variables inducing a partition on the observed
data. The model is amenable to scalable posterior inference and we show that it
can avoid the pitfalls of high-dimensionality under mild assumptions. The
proposed approach is shown to have good performance in simulation studies and
an application to inferring cell types based on scRNAseq.

re-identification problems. Although state-of-the-art pseudo-label-based
methods have achieved great success, they did not make full use of all valuable
information because of the domain gap and unsatisfying clustering performance.
To solve these problems, we propose a novel self-paced contrastive learning
framework with hybrid memory. The hybrid memory dynamically generates
source-domain class-level, target-domain cluster-level and un-clustered
instance-level supervisory signals for learning feature representations.
Different from the conventional contrastive learning strategy, the proposed

clusters and un-clustered instances. Most importantly, the proposed self-paced
method gradually creates more reliable clusters to refine the hybrid memory and
learning targets, and is shown to be the key to our outstanding performance.
Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple domain adaptation tasks of
object re-ID and even boosts the performance on the source domain without any

distribution (SED) is still unclear. Since the observed SED curvature is
related to an intrinsic curvature in emitting electron energy distribution
(EED), we study this question by employing a log-parabolic EED with a curvature
parameter and peak energy to model the quasi-simultaneous broadband SEDs of
selected blazars in Fermi-LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS) using synchrotron and
inverse Compton (IC) processes. We find that log-parabolic IC model can
successfully explain the emission in all blazars in our sample. On average,
FSRQs have higher magnetic field, Doppler factor, and curvature than BL Lac
objects. The BL Lac objects show an anticorrelation between the curvature
parameter of the EED and its peak energy, which is a signature of stochastic
acceleration. FSRQs do not manifest such correlation and rather show a mild
positive relationship between these parameters. This suggests that the
evolution of spectral curvature in the BL Lac objects is dominated by a strong
stochastic acceleration component, whereas the curvature in FSRQs evolves in a
cooling dominated regime due to an additional external Compton (EC) component.
The strong cooling in FSRQs not only restricts the electron peak energy but
also adds extra curvature to the high energy tail of emitting EED. Since the
curvature decreases from FSRQs toward high peak BL Lac objects (HBLs), opposite
to peak energy, the curvature parameter can be considered a third parameter of
the blazar sequence in addition to peak frequency and luminosity.

the change of density of states. The HOMO-LUMO gaps of spin up and spin down

due to trapping/detrapping process and mobility fluctuations Dm which are the
main causes of LFN, define its variability likewise as its mean value. DN
accounts for an M-shape of normalized LFN variance versus gate bias with a
minimum at the charge neutrality point (CNP) as it was the case for normalized

naturally explains the very low radiation luminosity of GRB 170817A. We derived
the detection probability of sGRBs by Fermi-GBM and found that the expected
detection rate of sGRBs is only about 1 yr-1 within the distance of several
hundred Mpc. We explored the effect of the power-law index {\alpha} of the
merger time distribution on the observed characteristics and found that it had
little effect on the observed luminosity and viewing-angle distributions.
However, it is very interesting that, for different values of {\alpha}, the
distributions of the number of observed sGRBs are quite different, so it is
possible to determine the value of {\alpha} through observed distributions of
the number of sGRBs. We used the Bayesian method to make a quantitative
analysis and found that the value of {\alpha} may be identified when the number
of observed sGRBs with known redshifts is more than 200. Finally, we compare
our results of gamma-ray luminosity distribution with sGRBs with known
redshifts, and found that our results are consistent with the observation,
which implies that our simulation results can reproduce the observed luminosity
distribution well.

angular dependence with the transverse voltage that exactly vanishes when the

further show that when an additional mirror symmetry forces the transverse

a second-order response at both zero and twice the frequency of the applied

antisymmetric quantum contribution that originates from a Zeeman-induced Berry

that optimal operating conditions must be computed in real time. The main
bottleneck in the industrial application of DRTO is the presence of
uncertainty. Many stochastic systems present the following obstacles: 1)
plant-model mismatch, 2) process disturbances, 3) risks in violation of process
constraints. To accommodate these difficulties, we present a constrained
reinforcement learning (RL) based approach. RL naturally handles the process
uncertainty by computing an optimal feedback policy. However, no state
constraints can be introduced intuitively. To address this problem, we present
a chance-constrained RL methodology. We use chance constraints to guarantee the
probabilistic satisfaction of process constraints, which is accomplished by
introducing backoffs, such that the optimal policy and backoffs are computed
simultaneously. Backoffs are adjusted using the empirical cumulative
distribution function to guarantee the satisfaction of a joint chance
constraint. The advantage and performance of this strategy are illustrated
through a stochastic dynamic bioprocess optimization problem, to produce
sustainable high-value bioproducts.

of in-situ collapse and ex-situ accretion. The in-situ component forms early,
where gas collapse and compaction leads to the formation of massive compact
systems (blue and red ""nuggets"") seen at $z>1$. The subsequent accretion of
satellites brings in ex-situ material, growing these nuggets in size and mass
to appear as the massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) we see locally. Due to
stochasticity in the accretion process, in a few rare cases a red nugget will
evolve to the present day having undergone little ex-situ mass accretion. The
resulting massive, compact and ancient objects have been termed ""relic
galaxies"". Detailed stellar population and kinematic analyses are required to
characterise these systems. However, an additional crucial aspect lies in
determining the fraction of ex-situ mass they have accreted since their
formation. Globular cluster systems can be used to constrain this fraction,
since the oldest and most metal-poor globular clusters in massive galaxies are
primarily an accreted, ex-situ population. Models for the formation of relic
galaxies and their globular cluster systems suggest that, due to their early
compaction and limited accretion of dark-matter dominated satellites, relic
galaxies should have characteristically low dark-matter mass fractions compared
to ETGs of the same stellar mass.

of the lack of macroscopic magnetization, the AFM only couples to the spin of

eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices and the singular values of general and some
classes of structured matrices. The focus is on the main principles behind the
methods that guarantee high accuracy even in the cases that are ill-conditioned
for the conventional methods. First, it is shown that a particular structure of
the errors in a finite precision implementation of an algorithm allows for a
much better measure of sensitivity and that computation with high accuracy is
possible despite a large classical condition number. Such structured errors
incurred by finite precision computation are in some algorithms e.g. entry-wise
or column-wise small, which is much better than the usually considered errors
that are in general small only when measured in the Frobenius matrix norm.
Specially tailored perturbation theory for such structured perturbations of
Hermitian matrices guarantees much better bounds for the relative errors in the
computed eigenvalues. % Secondly, we review an unconventional approach to
accurate computation of the singular values and eigenvalues of some notoriously
ill-conditioned structured matrices, such as e.g. Cauchy, Vandermonde and
Hankel matrices. The distinctive feature of accurate algorithms is using the
intrinsic parameters that define such matrices to obtain a non-orthogonal
factorization, such as the \textsf{LDU} factorization, and then computing the
singular values of the product of thus computed factors. The state of the art
software is discussed as well.

how much. Using this information, we estimate the fatality infection ratio

infected in different countries assuming a uniform exposure to the virus in all

studied the influence of the globally applied stress state on the evolution of
damage in such a microstructure. Classical damage models allow predictions of
damage during deformation based on considerations of the material as an
isotropic continuum. Here, we investigate their validity in a dual phase
microstructure that is locally dominated by its microstructural morphological
complexity based on a statistical ensemble of thousands of individual voids
formed under different stress states. For this purpose, we combined a
calibrated material model incorporating damage formation to assess the local
stress state in samples with different notch geometries and high-resolution
electron microscopy of large areas using a deep learning-based automated
micrograph analysis to detect and classify microstructural voids according to
their source of origin. This allowed us to obtain both the continuum stress
state during deformation and statistically relevant data of individual void
formation. We found that the applied plastic strain is the major influence on
the overall number, and therefore the nucleation of new voids, while
triaxiality correlates with the median void size, supporting its proposed
influence on void growth. In contrast, coalescence of voids leading to failure
appears related to local instabilities in the form of shear band formation and
is therefore only indirectly determined by the global stress state in that it
determines the global distribution, density and size of voids.

standard sirens will potentially shed light on the tension between the local
distance ladders and Planck experiments. Therefore, thorough understanding of
the sources of systematic uncertainty for the standard siren method is crucial.
In this paper, we focus on two scenarios that will potentially dominate the
systematic uncertainty of standard sirens. First, simulations of
electromagnetic counterparts of binary neutron star mergers suggest aspherical
emissions, so the binaries available for the standard siren method can be
selected by their viewing angles. This selection effect can lead to $\gtrsim
2\%$ bias in Hubble constant measurement even with mild selection. Second, if
the binary viewing angles are constrained by the electromagnetic counterpart
observations but the bias of the constraints is not controlled under $\sim
10^{\circ}$, the resulting systematic uncertainty in Hubble constant will be
$>3\%$. In addition, we find that both of the systematics cannot be properly
removed by the viewing angle measurement from gravitational-wave observations.
Comparing to the known dominant systematic uncertainty for standard sirens, the
$\leq 2\%$ gravitational-wave calibration uncertainty, the effects from viewing
angle appear to be more significant. Therefore, the systematic uncertainty from
viewing angle might be a major challenge before the standard sirens can resolve
the tension in Hubble constant, which is currently $\sim$9%.

which are the minimum ingredients needed to describe such interactions? We
conduct experiments where migrating cell monolayers push on carbon fibers as a
model problem. Although the migrating tissue is able to bend the fiber for some
time, it eventually recoils before coming to a stop. This stop occurs when
cells have performed a fixed mechanical work on the fiber, regardless of its

($OSEE$) is key in order to explore out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body
systems. Here we argue that for integrable models the dynamics of the $OSEE$ is
related to the diffusion of the underlying quasiparticles. We derive the
logarithmic bound $1/2\ln(t)$ for the $OSEE$ of some simple, i.e., low-rank,
diagonal local operators. We numerically check that the bound is saturated in
the rule $54$ chain, which is representative of interacting integrable systems.
Remarkably, the same bound is saturated in the spin-1/2 Heisenberg $XXZ$ chain.
Away from the isotropic point and from the free-fermion point, the $OSEE$ grows
as $1/2\ln(t)$, irrespective of the chain anisotropy, suggesting universality.
Finally, we discuss the effect of integrability breaking. We show that strong
finite-time effects are present, which prevent from probing the asymptotic
behavior of the $OSEE$.

promote the discovery of efficient, cheap, and non-toxic thermoelectric
materials. Large efforts to implement machine-learning techniques coupled to
materials databases are currently being undertaken, but the adopted
computational methods can dramatically affect the outcome. With regards to
electronic transport and power factor calculations, the most widely adopted and
computationally efficient method, is the constant relaxation time approximation
(CRT). This work goes beyond the CRT and adopts the proper, full energy and
momentum dependencies of electron-phonon and ionized impurity scattering, to
compute the electronic transport and perform power factor optimization for a
group of half-Heusler alloys. Then the material parameters that determine the
optimal power factor based on this more advanced treatment are identified. This
enables the development of a set of significantly improved descriptors that can
be used in materials screening studies, and which offer deeper insights into
the underlying nature of high performance thermoelectric materials. We have
identified $n_v$$\epsilon_r$ / $D_o^2m_{cond}$ as the most useful and generic
descriptor, a combination of the number of valleys, the dielectric constant,
the conductivity effective mass, and the deformation potential for the dominant
electron-phonon process. The proposed descriptors can accelerate the discovery
of new efficient and environment friendly thermoelectric materials in a much
more accurate and reliable manner, and some predictions for very high
performance materials are presented.

quantum mechanics. According to QBism, the quantum state or the wavefunction
represents the subjective degrees of belief of the agent assigning the state.
But, although the quantum state is not part of the furniture of the world,
quantum mechanics grasps the real via the Born rule which is a consistency
condition for the probability assignments of the agent. In this paper, we
evaluate the plausibility of recent criticism of QBism . We focus on the
consequences of the subjective character of the quantum state, the issue of
realism and the problem of the evolution of the quantum state in QBism. In
particular, drawing upon Born's notion of invariance as the mark of the real,
it is argued that there is no essential difference between Einstein's program
of the ""real"" and QBists' realism. Also, it will be argued that QBism can
account for the unitary evolution of the quantum state.

stellar cluster candidate is actually a nebula. Of the four RSGs candidates,
one source has a broad H$\alpha$ emission line redshifted by $\sim z = 1$,

algorithm to capture topological information via the fuzzy RAND index. We end
with experiments on two datasets that utilise both the topological and fuzzy
nature of our algorithm: pre-trained model selection in machine learning and
lattices structures from materials science. As pre-trained models can perform
well on multiple tasks, selecting the best model is a naturally fuzzy problem;
we show that fuzzy clustering persistence diagrams allows for model selection
using the topology of decision boundaries. In materials science, we classify
transformed lattice structure datasets for the first time, whilst the
probabilistic membership values let us rank candidate lattices in a scenario

active research topic in photogrammetry and remote sensing community for
decades, serving as an essential building block for various applications such
as 3D digital city modeling, change detection, and city management. Previous
researches have extensively studied the problem of height estimation from
aerial images based on stereo or multi-view image matching. These methods
require two or more images from different perspectives to reconstruct 3D
coordinates with camera information provided. In this paper, we deal with the
ambiguous and unsolved problem of height estimation from a single aerial image.
Driven by the great success of deep learning, especially deep convolution
neural networks (CNNs), some researches have proposed to estimate height
information from a single aerial image by training a deep CNN model with
large-scale annotated datasets. These methods treat height estimation as a
regression problem and directly use an encoder-decoder network to regress the
height values. In this paper, we proposed to divide height values into
spacing-increasing intervals and transform the regression problem into an
ordinal regression problem, using an ordinal loss for network training. To
enable multi-scale feature extraction, we further incorporate an Atrous Spatial
Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to extract features from multiple dilated
convolution layers. After that, a post-processing technique is designed to
transform the predicted height map of each patch into a seamless height map.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significantly better performance of
our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

larger datasets like ImageNet, using 4-bit mantissa and 2-bit exponent is
adequate to keep the accuracy loss within $1\%$. Through the energy consumption

systems, especially the massive ones. We aim to determine if disks in the

content of the most massive exoplanets. We use Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations of embedded disks in
the Perseus star-forming region together with Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9
mm) data to provide a robust estimate of dust disk masses from the flux
densities. Using the DIANA opacity model including large grains, with a dust
opacity value of $\kappa_{\rm 9\ mm}$ = 0.28 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$, the median dust
masses of the embedded disks in Perseus are 158 M$_\oplus$ for Class 0 and 52
M$_\oplus$ for Class I from the VLA fluxes. The lower limits on the median
masses from ALMA fluxes are 47 M$_\oplus$ and 12 M$_\oplus$ for Class 0 and
Class I, respectively, obtained using the maximum dust opacity value
$\kappa_{\rm 1.3mm}$ = 2.3 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$. The dust masses of young Class 0

with dust masses inferred for Class II disks in Lupus and other regions. The
dust masses of Class 0 and I disks in Perseus derived from the VLA data are
high enough to produce the observed exoplanet systems with efficiencies
acceptable by planet formation models: the solid content in observed giant

potential anthropogenic background caused by emissions from commercial
pressurised water reactors. Various $^{37}$Ar production pathways, which result
from activation of $^{36}$Ar and of $^{40}$Ca, respectively, are identified and
their emissions quantified. In-core processes include (1) the restart of
operation and degassing of the primary cooling water after maintenance and
refueling shutdown, (2) the replacement of primary coolant water for limiting
its tritium concentrations, and (3) the leakage of $^{37}$Ar produced from
calcium impurities in UO$_{2}$ after fuel rod failures. Activation of air and
of calcium in concrete within the biological shield are major out-of-core
production pathways. Whereas emissions from in-core processes are transient, a
rather constant $^{37}$Ar source term results from its out-of-core production.
Generic atmospheric dispersion simulations indicate that already at moderate
distances from the emitter, concentrations of $^{37}$Ar caused by routine
reactor operations are far below its cosmogenic background in air. The only
exception results from an inadvertent reactor re-start without operation of the
primary cooling water degassing system for prolonged time. Such an event also
causes high emissions of $^{41}$Ar which can be used for discriminating its
$^{37}$Ar signal from an underground nuclear explosion.

the properties of reservoir neural networks. The input weight matrix, set by a
recurrent logistic mapping, forms the kernels that transform the input space to
the higher-dimensional feature space. The most effective recognition of a
handwritten digit from MNIST-10 occurs under chaotic behavior of the logistic
map. The correlation of classification accuracy with the value of the Lyapunov
exponent was obtained. An advantage of LogNNet implementation on IoT devices is
the significant savings in memory used. At the same time, LogNNet has a simple
algorithm and performance indicators comparable to those of the best
resource-efficient algorithms available at the moment. The presented network
architecture uses an array of weights with a total memory size from 1 to 29 kB
and achieves a classification accuracy of 80.3-96.3%. Memory is saved due to
the processor, which sequentially calculates the required weight coefficients
during the network operation using the analytical equation of the logistic

artificial intelligence based on constrained devices with limited memory, which
are integral blocks for creating ambient intelligence in modern IoT

rescue is delayed. Such delays force citizens to be first responders and form
small rescue teams. Rescue teams require reliable communication, particularly
in the first 72 hours, which is challenging due to damaged infrastructure and
electrical blackouts. We design a peer-to-peer communication network that meets
these challenges. We introduce the concept of participatory fairness: equal
communication opportunities for all citizens regardless of initial inequality
in phone battery charge. Our value-sensitive design approach achieves an even
battery charge distribution across phones over time and enables citizens to
communicate over 72 hours. We apply the fairness principle to communication in
an adapted standard Barabasi-Albert model of a scale-free network that
automatically (i) assigns high-battery phones as hubs, (ii) adapts the network
topology to the spatio-temporal battery charge distribution, and (iii)
self-organizes to remain robust and reliable when links fail or phones leave
the network. While the Barabasi-Albert model has become a widespread
descriptive model, we demonstrate its use as a design principle to meet values
such as fairness and systemic efficiency. Our results demonstrate that,
compared to a generic peer-to-peer mesh network, the new protocol achieves (i)
a longer network lifetime, (ii) an adaptive information flow, (iii) a fair
distribution of battery charge, and (iv) higher participation rates. Hence, our
protocol, Self-Organization for Survival ('SOS'), provides fair communication
opportunities to all citizens during a disaster through self-organization. SOS
enables participatory resilience and sustainability, empowering citizens to
communicate when they need it most.

$\gamma(G) + \Psi(G) = n$ where $\gamma(G)$ is the well-studied domination

observe statistically significant $\gamma$-ray emission from 4 of the 6 known

yields, greenhouse gas emissions and grain arsenic, cadmium and lead levels in
a split plot field experiment with organic fertilisers under organic
management. The e-AWD water regime showed no difference in yield for the
organic treatments. Yields significantly increased by 5 to 16 percent in the
combination treatments. Root biomass and root length increased in the e-AWD
treatments up to 72 and 41 percent, respectively. The e-AWD water regime
reduced seasonal methane emissions by 71 to 85 percent for organic treatments
and by 51 to 76 percent for combination treatments; this was linked to a 15 to
47 percent reduction in dissolved organic carbon. Nitrous oxide emissions
increased by 23 to 305 percent but accounted for less than 20 percent of global
warming potential. Area and yield scaled global warming potentials were reduced
by 67 to 83 percent. The e-AWD regime altered soil redox potentials, resulting
in a reduction in grain arsenic and lead concentrations of up to 66 % and 73 %
respectively. Grain cadmium levels were also reduced up to 33 % in organic
treatments.

However, the suitability and performance of existing transport protocols in MAR

neuroscience to computer science and economics. The wide variety of
implementations has resulted in two key challenges: the progenation of many
domain-specific strategies that are seldom revisited or questioned, and the
siloing of ideas within a domain due to inconsistency of complex systems
language. In this work we offer basic, domain-agnostic language in order to
advance towards a more cohesive vocabulary. We use this language to evaluate
each step of the complex systems analysis pipeline, beginning with the system
and data collected, then moving through different mathematical formalisms for
encoding the observed data (i.e. graphs, simplicial complexes, and
hypergraphs), and relevant computational methods for each formalism. At each
step we consider different types of \emph{dependencies}; these are properties
of the system that describe how the existence of one relation among the parts
of a system may influence the existence of another relation. We discuss how
dependencies may arise and how they may alter interpretation of results or the
entirety of the analysis pipeline. We close with two real-world examples using
coauthorship data and email communications data that illustrate how the system
under study, the dependencies therein, the research question, and choice of
mathematical representation influence the results. We hope this work can serve
as an opportunity of reflection for experienced complexity scientists, as well
as an introductory resource for new researchers.

starting point of various (ab initio) many-body methods dedicated to superfluid
systems. While taking the zero-pairing limit of HFB equations constitutes a
text-book problem when the system is of closed-(sub)shell character, it is
typically, although wrongly, thought to be ill-defined whenever the naive
filling of single-particle levels corresponds to an open-shell system.
  The present work demonstrates that the zero-pairing limit of an HFB state is
mathematically well-defined, independently of the closed- or open-shell
character of the system in the limit. Still, the nature of the limit state
strongly depends on the underlying shell structure and on the associated naive
filling reached in the zero-pairing limit for the particle number A of
interest. All the analytical findings are confirmed and illustrated
numerically.
  While HFB theory has been intensively scrutinized formally and numerically
over the last decades, it still uncovers unknown and somewhat unexpected
features. From this general perspective, the present analysis demonstrates that
HFB theory does not reduce to Hartree-Fock theory even when the pairing field
is driven to zero in the HFB Hamiltonian matrix.

accuracy and precision of absorption-spectroscopy measurements by isolating the
molecular absorbance signal from errors in the baseline light intensity (Io)
using cepstral analysis. Recently, cepstral analysis has been used with
traditional absorption spectrometers to create a modified form of the
time-domain molecular free-induction decay (m-FID) signal which can be analyzed
independently from Io. However, independent analysis of the molecular signature
is not possible when the baseline intensity and molecular response do not
separate well in the time domain, which is typical when using
injection-current-tuned lasers (e.g., quantum cascade lasers) and other light
sources with pronounced intensity tuning. In contrast, the method presented
here is applicable to all light sources since it determines gas properties by
least-squares fitting a simulated m-FID signal to the measured m-FID signal in
the time domain. This method is insensitive to errors in the estimated Io which
vary slowly with optical frequency and, therefore, decay rapidly in the time
domain. The benefits provided by this method are demonstrated via
scanned-wavelength direct-absorption measurements acquired with a
distributed-feedback (DFB) quantum-cascade laser (QCL). The wavelength of a DFB
QCL was scanned across CO's P(0,20) and P(1,14) absorption transitions at 1 kHz
to measure the gas temperature and concentration of CO. Measurements were
acquired in a gas cell and in an ethylene-air flame at 1 atm. The measured
spectra were processed using the new m-FID-based method and two traditional
methods which rely on inferring the baseline error within the spectral-fitting
routine. The m-FID-based method demonstrated superior accuracy in all cases and
a measurement precision that was 1.5 to 10 times smaller than that provided
using traditional methods.

looks for a regular derivation of a judgment. Relying on these results, we

baryon-photon decoupling is imprinted on the spatial distribution of galaxies
in the Universe, known as the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO). The
correlation functions and power spectrum are used as a central tool for the
studies on the BAO analysis. In this work, we analyzed the spatial distribution
of galaxies with a method from the topological data analysis (TDA), in order to
detect and examine the BAO signal in the galaxy distribution. The TDA provides
a method to treat various types of ""holes"" in point set data, by constructing
the persistent homology (PH) group from the geometric structure of data points
and handling the topological information of the dataset. We can obtain the
information on the size, position, and statistical significance of the holes in
the data. A particularly strong point of the persistent homology is that it can
classify the holes by their spatial dimension, i.e., a 0-dim separation, 1-dim
loop, 2-dim shell, etc. We first analyzed the simulation datasets with and
without the baryon physics to examine the performance of the PH method. We
found that the PH is indeed able to detect the BAO signal: simulation data with
baryon physics present a prominent signal from the BAO, while data without
baryon physics does not show this signal. Then, we applied the PH to a quasar
sample at $z <1.0$ from extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey in
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14. We discovered a characteristic hole
(a hollow shell) at a scaler $\sim150\ [{\rm Mpc}]$. This exactly corresponds
to the BAO signature imprinted in the galaxy/quasar distribution. We performed
this analysis on a small subsample of 2000 quasars. This clearly demonstrates

comprehensive theoretical description of the nuclear fission process based

simulations of fission are currently carried out within nuclear density
functional theory (DFT). In spite of being fully quantum-mechanical and rooted
in the theory of nuclear forces, DFT still depends on a dozen or so parameters
characterizing the energy functional. Calibrating these parameters on
experimental data results in uncertainties that must be quantified for
applications. This task is very challenging because of the high computational
cost of DFT calculations for fission. In this paper, we use Gaussian processes
to build emulators of DFT models in order to quantify and propagate statistical
uncertainties of theoretical predictions for a range of nuclear deformations

more countries are impacted by COVID-19 and as testing remains central to

capabilities but sensitivity concerns have limited its impact on the management
of the pandemic. Digital PCR (RT-dPCR) has been shown to be more sensitive than
RT-PCR and could help in this context.
  Methods: We implemented RT-dPCR based COVID-19 group testing on commercially
available system and assay (Naica System from Stilla Technologies) and
investigated the sensitivity of the method in real life conditions of a
university hospital in Paris, France, in May 2020. We tested the protocol in a
direct comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into
groups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16
samples and 14 groups of 32 samples.
  Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using
groups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding
to 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not initially detected by
individual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR
investigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25
true positive samples identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32

universe, and a variety of correlations between observable GRB properties have
been proposed in literature, but none of these correlations is valid for both
long GRBs and short GRBs. In this paper we report the discovery of a universal
correlation which is suitable for both long and short GRBs using three prompt
emission properties of GRBs, i.e. the isotropic peak luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$,
the peak energy of the time-integtated prompt emission spectrum $E_{\rm peak}$,
and the ""high signal"" timescale $T_{\rm 0.45}$, $L_{\rm iso} \propto E_{\rm
peak}^{1.94} T_{0.45}^{0.37}$. This universal correlation just involves
properties of GRB prompt emission and does not require any information of
afterglow phase, which can be used as a relatively unbiased redshift estimator.
Here we use this correlation to estimate the pseudo-redshifts for short Gamma
Ray Bursts and then use Lynden-Bell method to obtain a non-parametric estimate
of their luminosity function and formation rate. The luminosity function is
$\psi(L_0)\propto{L_0^{-0.63\pm{0.07}}}$ for dim SGRBs and
$\psi(L_0)\propto{L_0^{-1.96\pm{0.28}}}$ for bright SGRBs, with the break point
$6.95_{-0.76}^{+0.84}\times10^{50} erg/s$. The local formation rate of SGRBs is
about 15 events $\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ . This universal correlation may have
important implications for GRB physics, implying that the long and short GRBs

increase production to accommodate the world's growing population while
simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Adaptations to drainage
regimes are one of the most promising options for methane mitigation in rice
production. Whereas several studies have focused on mid-season drainage (MD) to
mitigate GHG emissions, early-season drainage (ED) varying in timing and
duration has not been extensively studied. However, such ED periods could
potentially be very effective since initial available Carbon levels (and
thereby the potential for methanogenesis) can be very high in paddy systems
with rice straw incorporation. This study tested the effectiveness of seven
drainage regimes varying in their timing and duration (combinations of ED and
MD) to mitigate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a 101-day
growth chamber experiment. Emissions were considerably reduced by early-season
drainage compared to both conventional continuous flooding (CF) and the MD
drainage regime. The results suggest that ED + MD drainage may have the
potential to reduce methane emissions and yield-scaled global warming potential
by 85 to 90% compared to CF and by 75 to 77% compared to MD only. A combination
of (short or long) ED drainage and one MD drainage episode was found to be the
most effective in mitigating methane emissions without negatively affecting
yield. In particular, compared with CF, the long early-season drainage
treatments LE + SM and LE + LM significantly decreased yield scaled global
warming potential by 85% and 87% respectively. This was associated with carbon
being stabilised early in the season, thereby reducing available carbon for
methanogenesis. Overall nitrous oxide emissions were small and not
significantly affected by ED.

computations of the $Z_3$-cohomology of $M_{24}$ and of the first few
differentials in the AHSS. We are specifically interested in the value of
$tmf^\bullet_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12]$ in cohomological degree $-27$. Our main
computational result is that $tmf^{-27}_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12] = 0$ when
$\omega \neq 0$. For comparison, the restriction map
$tmf^{-3}_\omega(BM_{24})[\frac12]\to tmf^{-3}(pt)[\frac12] \cong Z_3$ is
surjective for one of the two nonzero values of $\omega$.
  Our motivation comes from Mathieu Moonshine. Assuming a well-studied
conjectural relationship between $TMF$ and supersymmetric quantum field theory,
there is a canonically-defined $Co_1$-twisted-equivariant lifting
$[\bar{V}^{f\natural}]$ of the class $\{24\Delta\} \in TMF^{-24}(pt)$, where
$Co_1$ denotes Conway's largest sporadic group. We conjecture that the product
$[\bar{V}^{f\natural}] \nu$, where $\nu \in TMF^{-3}(pt)$ is the image of the
generator of $tmf^{-3}(pt) \cong Z_{24}$, does not vanish $Co_1$-equivariantly,
but that its restriction to $M_{24}$-twisted-equivariant $TMF$ does vanish.
This conjecture answers some of the questions in Mathieu Moonshine: it implies
the existence of a minimally supersymmetric quantum field theory with $M_{24}$
symmetry, whose twisted-and-twined partition functions have the same mock
modularity as in Mathieu Moonshine. Our AHSS calculation establishes this
conjecture ""perturbatively"" at odd primes.
  An appendix included mostly for entertainment purposes discusses
""$\ell$-complexes"" and their relation to $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Verlinde rings. The

redistribution of charged particles different from the well-known magnetic Hall
effect, namely; the pair potential gradient (PPG) force due to surface effects
on the pair potential and the pressure difference between the normal and
superconducting regions arising from the slope of the density of states (SDOS)
in the normal states at the Fermi level. Our present results show that in spite
of the absence of supercurrents, electric charge is induced around the surface.
Moreover, the charging effect due to the SDOS pressure dominates over that due
to the PPG force for all the realistic electron-fillings $n=0.8$, $0.9$, and
$1.15$, at all temperatures. In addition, for the filling $n=1.15$, the PPG
force and the SDOS pressure contributions have the same negative signs, which
gives a larger total surface charge i.e., both the sign and amount of the
surface charge depends greatly on the Fermi-surface curvature. We have also
calculated the local density of states (LDOS) within the augmented
quasiclassical theory. Spatially varying local particle-hole asymmetry appears

This paper introduces a novel method to combine gradients called Adasum (for

implement, almost as efficient as simply summing gradients, and is integrated
into the open-source toolkit Horovod.
  This paper first provides a formal justification for Adasum and then
empirically demonstrates Adasum is more accurate than prior gradient

Adasum works with multiple frameworks, (TensorFlow and PyTorch), scales
multiple optimizers (Momentum-SGD, Adam, and LAMB) to larger batch-sizes while
still giving good downstream accuracy. Finally, it proves that Adasum
converges.
  To summarize, Adasum scales Momentum-SGD on the MLPerf Resnet50 benchmark to
64K examples before communication (no MLPerf v0.5 entry converged with more
than 16K), the Adam optimizer to 64K examples before communication on
BERT-LARGE (prior work showed Adam stopped scaling at 16K), and the LAMB
optimizer to 128K before communication on BERT-LARGE (prior work used 64K), all
while maintaining downstream accuracy metrics. Finally, if a user does not need
to scale, we show LAMB with Adasum on BERT-LARGE converges in 30% fewer steps

method. Periodic motion of the phantom was used to investigate the
motion-robustness of the proposed sequence. The best performing sequence length
(600 flip angles) was used to image the abdomen during a free-breathing
volunteer scan. When using a series of 600 or more flip angles, the estimated
$T_1$ values in the stationary phantom showed good agreement with the reference
scan. Phantom experiments revealed that motion-related artefacts can appear in
the quantitative maps, and confirmed that a motion-robust k-space ordering is
essential in preventing these artefacts. The in vivo scan demonstrated that the
proposed sequence can produce clean parameter maps while the subject breathes
freely. Using this sequence, it is possible to generate $B_1^+$-robust
quantitative maps of proton density, $T_1$, and $B_1^+$ under free-breathing
conditions at a clinically usable resolution within 5 minutes.

candidate members with magnitudes G<18, more than half of them being red clump
stars. We construct and analyze maps of the mean proper motion and its
dispersion over the region ~30x12 degrees, which show a number of interesting
features. The intrinsic 3d density distribution (orientation, thickness) is
strongly constrained by kinematics; we find that the remnant is a prolate
structure with the major axis pointing at 45deg from the orbital velocity and
extending up to ~5 kpc, where it transitions into the stream. We perform a
large suite of N-body simulations of a disrupting Sgr galaxy as it orbits the
Milky Way over the past 2.5 Gyr, which are tailored to reproduce the observed
properties of the remnant (not the stream). The richness of available
constraints means that only a narrow range of parameters produce a final state
consistent with observations. The total mass of the remnant is ~4e8 Msun, of
which roughly a quarter resides in stars. The galaxy is significantly out of
equilibrium, and even its central density is below the limit required to
withstand tidal forces. We conclude that the Sgr galaxy will likely be
disrupted over the next Gyr.

analyzed a Bluetooth digital key system of a vehicle by using both the proposed

For Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, it has been realized using
nuclear memories or resonant excitation at cryogenic temperature. All of these
existing approaches have stringent experimental demands. In particular, they
require a high efficiency of photon collection, such as immersion optics or
all-diamond micro-optics. For some of the most relevant applications, such as
shallow implanted NV centers in a cryogenic environment, these tools are

achieves single-shot fidelity even if photon collection is poor (delivering
less than 10$^3$ clicks/second). The scheme is based on spin-dependent resonant
excitation at cryogenic temperature combined with spin-to-charge conversion,
mapping the fragile electron spin states to the stable charge states. We prove
this technique to work on shallow implanted NV centers as they are required for
sensing and scalable NV-based quantum registers.

universal desired target, is built up introducing as main criterion for the
change of status a suitable value function in the spirit of the prospect theory

solution density of the Boltzmann type kinetic equation is shown to converge
towards the solution of a Fokker--Planck type equation with variable
coefficients of diffusion and drift, characterized by the mathematical

belong to the class of Amoroso distributions with Pareto tails, which
correspond to the emergence of a \emph{social elite}. The details of the
microscopic kinetic interaction allow to clarify the meaning of the various
parameters characterizing the resulting equilibrium. Numerical results then

rank of $\Theta^*$: $r \ll \min\{d_1,d_2\}$. We also extend our algorithmic
approach to the generalized linear setting to get an algorithm which enjoys a
similar bound under regularity conditions on the link function. To get around
the computational intractability of covering based approaches, we propose an
efficient algorithm by extending the ""Explore-Subspace-Then-Refine"" algorithm

$\widetilde{O}((d_1+d_2)^{3/2}\sqrt{rT})$ regret under a mild condition on the

lower bounds for the sparse linear bandit problem strongly suggest that our
regret bounds are unimprovable. To complement our theoretical contributions, we

human speech into raw acoustic data? This paper proposes two neural network
architectures for modeling unsupervised lexical learning from raw acoustic
inputs, ciwGAN (Categorical InfoWaveGAN) and fiwGAN (Featural InfoWaveGAN),
that combine a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN;
arXiv:1705.07904) with an information theoretic extension of GAN -- InfoGAN
(arXiv:1606.03657), and propose a new latent space structure that can model
featural learning simultaneously with a higher level classification and allows
for a very low-dimension vector representation of lexical items. Lexical
learning is modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural
network to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its
acoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to
encode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of
categorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables,
the network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs
innovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically
interpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network
interpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological
representations learned by the network can be productively recombined and
directly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained
on `suit' and `dark' outputs innovative `start', even though it never saw
`start' or even a [st] sequence in the training data. We also argue that
setting latent featural codes to values well beyond training range results in
almost categorical generation of prototypical lexical items and reveals
underlying values of each latent code.

The difficulty in handling the divergence-free condition of the Stokes equation

have explicit values, by further applying the interval arithmetic and verified
computing algorithms, the computed results provide rigorous estimation for the
approximation error. As an application of the proposed error estimation, the
eigenvalue problem of the Stokes operator is considered and rigorous bounds for

an approximation problem in the space of square integrable functions on

$\theta_k\in(0,1)$, $k\ge1$. Randomizing the $\theta_k$ generates new
structures and criteria. One of them is a sufficient condition for RH that
splits into (i) showing that the indicator function can be approximated by
convolution with the fractional part, (ii) a control on the coefficients of the

a short probabilistic proof of a known consequence of Wiener's Tauberian

Neural Networks featured by striking efficiency of training. The crucial aspect
of RC is to properly instantiate the hidden recurrent layer that serves as
dynamical memory to the system. In this respect, the common recipe is to create
a pool of randomly and sparsely connected recurrent neurons. While the aspect
of sparsity in the design of RC systems has been debated in the literature, it
is nowadays understood mainly as a way to enhance the efficiency of
computation, exploiting sparse matrix operations. In this paper, we empirically
investigate the role of sparsity in RC network design under the perspective of
the richness of the developed temporal representations. We analyze both
sparsity in the recurrent connections, and in the connections from the input to
the reservoir. Our results point out that sparsity, in particular in
input-reservoir connections, has a major role in developing internal temporal
representations that have a longer short-term memory of past inputs and a
higher dimension.

quantum effects of the right handed neutrinos assuming the potential is nearly
conformal at the Ultra-Violet. The scenario, named as the ""Neutrino Option""
allows RH neutrino mass scale upto $M \lesssim$ $10^7$ GeV to be consistent
with light neutrino masses, mixing and Higgs mass. Therefore, it is not
consistent with standard hierarchical thermal leptogenesis. Parameter space for
thermal resonant leptogenesis is highly constrained in this model. We point out
that non-thermal pair production of RH neutrinos from inflaton decay
corresponds in general to a mild degree of resonance in the CP asymmetry
parameter and allows RH mass scale to be smaller more than by an order of
magnitude than the thermal strong resonance case. Within the similar parameter
space of thermal leptogenesis, RH neutrinos can also be produced from inflaton
decay along with a Dark Matter having mass $M_{\rm DM}\lesssim$ 320 MeV. The
main constraint in the latter scenario comes from the Ly$\alpha$ constraints on
Dark Matter free streaming. We show in addition, that the Neutrino Option
introduces a 'phantom window' for the RH mass scale, in which contrary to the
usual scenarios, CP asymmetry parameter for leptogenesis decreases with the
increase of the RH mass scale and minimally fine-tuned seesaw models naturally
exhibit this `phantom window'.

world conditions and limits to the availability of diagnostic tests, which
necessitate a bias in testing favoring symptomatic individuals. A thorough
understanding of sampling confidence and bias is necessary in order make
accurate conclusions. In this manuscript, we provide a stochastic model of
sampling for assessing confidence in disease metrics such as trend detection,
peak detection, and disease spread estimation. Our model simulates testing for
a disease in an epidemic with known dynamics, allowing us to use Monte-Carlo
sampling to assess metric confidence. This model can provide realistic
simulated data which can be used in the design and calibration of data analysis
and prediction methods. As an example, we use this method to show that trends
in the disease may be identified using under $10000$ biased samples each day,
and an estimate of disease spread can be made with additional $1000-2000$
unbiased samples each day. We also demonstrate that the model can be used to
assess more advanced metrics by finding the precision and recall of a strategy
for finding peaks in the dynamics.

problem (IBVP) related to reaction-diffusion equations. To avoid possible order
reduction, the IBVP is first transformed into an IBVP with homogeneous boundary
conditions (IBVPHBC) via a lifting of inhomogeneous Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed
Dirichlet-Neumann boundary conditions. The IBVPHBC is discretized in time via
the deferred correction method for the implicit midpoint rule and leads to a
time-stepping scheme of order $2p+2$ of accuracy at the stage $p=0,1,2,\cdots $
of the correction. Each semi-discretized scheme results in a nonlinear elliptic
equation for which the existence of a solution is proven using the Schaefer
fixed point theorem. The elliptic equation corresponding to the stage $p$ of
the correction is discretized by the Galerkin finite element method and gives a
full discretization of the IBVPHBC. This fully discretized scheme is
unconditionally stable with order $2p+2$ of accuracy in time. The order of
accuracy in space is equal to the degree of the finite element used when the
family of meshes considered is shape-regular while an increment of one order is
proven for quasi-uniform family of meshes. Numerical tests with a bistable
reaction-diffusion equation having a strong stiffness ratio and a linear
reaction-diffusion equation addressing order reduction are performed and
demonstrate the unconditional convergence of the method. The orders 2,4,6,8 and

solutions for the superconducting gap, all with the same spatial symmetry. The
gap function $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ for the $n$th solution changes sign $n$
times as the function of Matsubara frequency. In this paper we analyze the
linearized gap equation at a finite $T$. We show that there exist an infinite
set of pairing instability temperatures, $T_{p,n}$, and the eigenfunction
$\Delta_n (\omega_{m})$ changes sign $n$ times as a function of a Matsubara

gap equation. Like in paper I, we extend the model to the case when the
interaction in the pairing channel has an additional factor $1/N$ compared to
that in the particle-hole channel. We show that $T_{p,0}$ remains finite at
large $N$ due to special properties of fermions with Matsubara frequencies $\pm
\pi T$, but all other $T_{p,n}$ terminate at $N_{cr} = O(1)$. The gap function
vanishes at $T \to 0$ for $N > N_{cr}$ and remains finite for $N < N_{cr}$.
This is consistent with the $T =0$ analysis.

pioniums may escape the decay region before decaying into two $\pi^0$s (or to

complex systems are so expansive that despite the continual onslaught of new

define and optimise for a local quality function severability for measuring the
dynamical coherency of a set of states over time. The theoretical underpinnings
of severability lie in our local adaptation of the Simon-Ando-Fisher time-scale
separation theorem, which formalises the intuition of local wells in the Markov
landscape of a dynamical process, or the separation between a microscopic and a
macroscopic dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the practical relevance of
severability by applying it to examples drawn from power networks, image

noncrystalline chalcogens and their transitions upon certain external stimuli.
However, it is broadly admitted that there are still several unsettled issues
that call for proper rationalization. The current review presents an assessment
of Raman scattering studies of noncrystalline phases of elemental chalcogens
and their mixtures. First, a few remarks on the analysis of Raman data, related
to polarization details and spectra reduction are presented. The effect of
temperature, pressure and irradiation on the structure of chalcogens is
reviewed in detail. As only selenium can form a stable glass at ambient
conditions, the interest on sulfur and tellurium has been placed in the melt
and the amorphous phase, respectively, whereas reference is also made to the
sporadic structural studies of glassy sulfur at low temperatures. It is shown
how Raman scattering can be exploited to explore unique phenomena emerging in
the liquid state of sulfur, offering valuable information on the details of
lambda transition including various thermodynamic related properties. The
subtle nature of this transition in selenium is also discussed. Tellurium is
not only impossible to be prepared in the bulk glassy state, but also forms a
very liable to crystallization amorphous film. Therefore, the emphasis is
placed on light induced nanostructuring and effects related to photo
amorphization and photo oxidation.

the respective source geometries. This interpretation is further supported by
results from the UrQMD transport model, and establishes the following picture:
At low energies, nucleons freeze out over the total fireball volume, while
antinucleons are annihilated inside the nucleon-rich fireball and can only
freeze out on its surface. Towards higher energies, this annihilation effect
becomes irrelevant (due to the decreasing baryochemical potential) and the
system's freeze-out is driven by the mesons. Thus, the nucleon and antinucleon
freeze-out distributions become similar with increasing energy.

logical road network description which is easy to maintain and modify. The
concept aims to be non-redundant so that changes of distinct quantities do not
affect other places in the code and thus the variation of maps is
straightforward. In addition, the simple definition of junctions is a focus of
the work. Intersecting roads are defined separately, are then set in relation
and the junction is finally generated automatically. The idea is to derive the
description from a commonly used, standardized format for simulation maps in
order to generate this format from the introduced logical description.
Consequently, we developed a command-line tool that generates the standardized

known systematic errors and may therefore be hinting at new fundamental
physics. Although all of the current techniques have their own merits, further
improvement in constraining the Hubble constant requires the development of as
many independent methods as possible. In this work, we use SNe II as
standardisable candles to obtain an independent measurement of the Hubble
constant. Using 7 SNe II with host-galaxy distances measured from Cepheid
variables or the tip of the red giant branch, we derive H$_0=
75.8^{+5.2}_{-4.9}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (statistical errors only). Our value
favours that obtained from the conventional distance ladder (Cepheids + SNe Ia)
and exhibits a difference of 8.4 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ from the Planck
$+\Lambda$CDM value. Adding an estimate of the systematic errors (2.8 km
s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$) changes the $\sim 1.7\sigma$ discrepancy with Planck
$+\Lambda$CDM to $\sim 1.4\sigma$. Including the systematic errors and
performing a bootstrap simulation, we confirm that the local H$_0$ value
exceeds the value from the early Universe with a confidence level of 95%. As in

rather than optimize their own utilities, due to bounded rationality and
incomplete information. Perpetual fluctuations between decisions have been
reported as the dominant asymptotic outcome of imitative behaviors, yet little
attempt has been made to characterize them, particularly in heterogeneous
populations. We study a finite well-mixed heterogeneous population of
individuals choosing between the two strategies, cooperation and defection, and
earning based on their payoff matrices that can be unique to each individual.
At each time step, an arbitrary individual becomes active to update her
decision by imitating the highest earner in the population. We show that almost
surely the dynamics reach either an equilibrium state or a minimal positively
invariant set, a fluctuation set, in the long run. In addition to finding all
equilibria, for the first time, we characterize the fluctuation sets, provide
necessary and sufficient conditions for their existence, and approximate their
basins of attraction. We also find that exclusive populations of individuals
playing coordination or prisoner's dilemma games always equilibrate, implying
that cycles and non-convergence in imitative populations are due to individuals
playing anticoordination games. Moreover, we show that except for the two
extreme equilibria where all individuals play the same strategy, almost all
other equilibria are unstable as long as the population is heterogeneous. Our
results theoretically explain earlier reported simulation results and shed new
light on the boundedly rational nature of imitation behaviors.

the AI community, as it is often argued that the strengths and weaknesses of
these approaches are complementary. One such trend in the literature are weakly
supervised learning techniques that employ operators from fuzzy logics. In
particular, they use prior background knowledge described in such logics to
help the training of a neural network from unlabeled and noisy data. By
interpreting logical symbols using neural networks (or grounding them), this
background knowledge can be added to regular loss functions, hence making
reasoning a part of learning.
  In this paper, we investigate how implications from the fuzzy logic
literature behave in a differentiable setting. In such a setting, we analyze
the differences between the formal properties of these fuzzy implications. It
turns out that various fuzzy implications, including some of the most
well-known, are highly unsuitable for use in a differentiable learning setting.
A further finding shows a strong imbalance between gradients driven by the
antecedent and the consequent of the implication. Furthermore, we introduce a
new family of fuzzy implications (called sigmoidal implications) to tackle this
phenomenon. Finally, we empirically show that it is possible to use
Differentiable Fuzzy Logics for semi-supervised learning, and show that
sigmoidal implications outperform other choices of fuzzy implications.

proposed with the goal of \emph{empowering interoperability} in smart
factories. These standards enable the description and interaction of the main
components, systems, and processes inside of a smart factory. Due to the
growing number of frameworks and standards, there is an increasing need for
approaches that automatically analyze the landscape of I4.0 standards.
Standardization frameworks classify standards according to their functions into
layers and dimensions. However, similar standards can be classified differently
across the frameworks, producing, thus, interoperability conflicts among them.
Semantic-based approaches that rely on ontologies and knowledge graphs, have
been proposed to represent standards, known relations among them, as well as
their classification according to existing frameworks. Albeit informative, the
structured modeling of the I4.0 landscape only provides the foundations for
detecting interoperability issues. Thus, graph-based analytical methods able to
exploit knowledge encoded by these approaches, are required to uncover
alignments among standards. We study the relatedness among standards and
frameworks based on community analysis to discover knowledge that helps to cope
with interoperability conflicts between standards. We use knowledge graph
embeddings to automatically create these communities exploiting the meaning of
the existing relationships. In particular, we focus on the identification of
similar standards, i.e., communities of standards, and analyze their properties
to detect unknown relations. We empirically evaluate our approach on a
knowledge graph of I4.0 standards using the Trans$^*$ family of embedding
models for knowledge graph entities. Our results are promising and suggest that
relations among standards can be detected accurately.

HiPIMS presents severe interface mixing with a smooth surface but limited
growth due to resputtering from the surface. The results also indicate that
fewer crystal defects appear in the film for moderate energy HiPIMS. We
attribute this behavior to the repetition frequency of collision events. In
particular high energy HiPIMS suffers from high repetition of collision events
which does not allow reconstruction of the film. While in the low energy HiPIMS
there are not enough events to overcome island growth. At moderate energy,
collision events repeat in a manner that provides enough time for
reconstruction which results in a smooth surface, fewer defects and limited

task. In a national election, politicians would like to have persuasive
speakers campaign on their behalf. When a company faces adverse publicity, they
would like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence of
adversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform for
these forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: the
Debate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while the
Intensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in the
number of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has been
previously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail to
leverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities are
often semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverse
information for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction)
framework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data to
solve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities while
maintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a novel
adaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from two
modules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information between
modalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of different
modalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal reference
models. We test M2P2 on the popular IQ2US dataset designed for DOP. We also
introduce a new dataset called QPS (from Qipashuo, a popular Chinese debate TV

make in their life. The latest research on real-estate appraisal focuses on
incorporating image data in addition to structured data into the modeling
process. This research measures the prediction performance of satellite images
and structured data by using convolutional neural networks. The resulting CNN
model trained performs 7% better in MAE than the advanced baseline of a neural
network trained on structured data. Moreover, sliding-window heatmap provides
visual interpretability of satellite images, revealing that neighborhood
structures are essential in the price estimation.

direct imaging of transient structures and morphologies of materials in real
time and space, namely, ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM). Here we report the
development of a laser-free UEM offering the same capability of real-time
imaging with high spatiotemporal resolutions but without requiring expensive fs
lasers and intricate instrumental modifications. We create picosecond electron
pulses for probing dynamic events by chopping a continuous beam with a
radiofrequency (RF)-driven pulser, where the repetition rate of the electron
pulses is tunable from 100 MHz to 12 GHz. A same broadband of electromagnetic
wave is enabled for sample excitation. As a first application, we studied the
GHz electromagnetic wave propagation dynamics in an interdigitated comb
structure which is one of the basic building blocks for RF
micro-electromechanical systems. A series of pump-probe images reveals, on
nanometer space and picosecond time scales, the transient oscillating
electromagnetic field around the tines of the combs, and time-resolved
polarization, amplitude, and nonlinear local field enhancement. The success of
this study demonstrates the feasibility of the low-cost laser-free UEM in
real-space visualizing of dynamics for many research fields, especially the
electrodynamics in devices associated with information processing technology.

  Polynomials",,,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish some partial fraction identities for rational functions whose
denominators are implicit products of the cyclotomic polynomials. To achieve
this, we first develop a general algebraic approach for partial fraction
decomposition inspired by the Heaviside's cover-up method. We thus call our
method the Extended Cover-Up Method. Using our method we obtain direct formulas
for $q$-partial fractions for certain generating functions. As a direct
consequence of our formulas one can compute the Sylvester denumerants, the
Frobenius number and the Ehrhart polynomials in pseudo-polynomial time.
Further, we provide a framework for a generalization of the Fourier-Dedekind
sum and their associated Rademacher reciprocity theorem extending the results
of Carlitz, Zagier and Gessel. By performing a Fourier analysis we demonstrate
that our extended cover-up method explains in simple terms the mechanism behind
the reciprocity law.

marked/labelled points. Our main goal is to show that dual graphs of such

inner heliosphere and have been used extensively in the past to study the
(diffusive) transport of cosmic rays in the inner heliosphere. With new limits
on the Jovian source function (i.e. the particle intensity just outside the
Jovian magnetosphere), and a new set of in-situ observations at 1 AU for both
cases of good and poor magnetic connection between the source and observer, we
revisit some of these earlier simulations. We aim to find the optimal numerical
set-up that can be used to simulate the propagation of 6 MeV Jovian electrons
in the inner heliosphere. Using such a set-up, we further aim to study the
residence (propagation) times of these particles for different levels of
magnetic connection between Jupiter and an observer at Earth (1 AU). Using an
advanced Jovian electron propagation model based on the stochastic differential
equation (SDE) approach, we calculate the Jovian electron intensity for
different model parameters. A comparison with observations leads to an optimal
numerical set-up, which is then used to calculate the so-called residence
(propagation) times of these particles. Comparing to in-situ observations, we
are able to derive transport parameters that are appropriate to study the
propagation of 6 MeV Jovian electrons in the inner heliosphere. Moreover, using
these values, we show that the method of calculating the residence time applied
in former literature is not suited to being interpreted as the propagation time
of physical particles. This is due to an incorrect weighting of the probability
distribution. We propose and apply a new method, where the results from each
pseudo-particle are weighted by its resulting phase-space density (i.e. the
number of physical particles that it represents). Thereby we obtain more
reliable estimates for the propagation time.
