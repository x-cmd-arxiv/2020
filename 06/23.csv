learning problem, i.e., learning binary classifiers from a large amount of
unlabeled data and a few labeled positive examples. While current
state-of-the-art methods employ importance reweighting to design various risk
estimators, they ignored the learning capability of the model itself, which
could have provided reliable supervision. This motivates us to propose a novel
Self-PU learning framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and
self-training. Self-PU highlights three ""self""-oriented building blocks: a
self-paced training algorithm that adaptively discovers and augments confident
positive/negative examples as the training proceeds; a self-calibrated
instance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces
teacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We
demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning
benchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR-10), which compare favorably against the latest
competitors. Moreover, we study a real-world application of PU learning, i.e.,
classifying brain images of Alzheimer's Disease. Self-PU obtains significantly
improved results on the renowned Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
(ADNI) database over existing methods. The code is publicly available at:

  Computing (STOC) 2021",,,,"cs.DS cs.GT cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Min-max optimization of an objective function $f: \mathbb{R}^d \times
\mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an important model for robustness in an
adversarial setting, with applications to many areas including optimization,
economics, and deep learning. In many applications $f$ may be
nonconvex-nonconcave, and finding a global min-max point may be computationally
intractable. There is a long line of work that seeks computationally tractable
algorithms for alternatives to the min-max optimization model. However, many of
the alternative models have solution points which are only guaranteed to exist
under strong assumptions on $f$, such as convexity, monotonicity, or special
properties of the starting point. We propose an optimization model, the
$\varepsilon$-greedy adversarial equilibrium, and show that it can serve as a
computationally tractable alternative to the min-max optimization model.
Roughly, we say that a point $(x^\star, y^\star)$ is an $\varepsilon$-greedy
adversarial equilibrium if $y^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximate local
maximum for $f(x^\star,\cdot)$, and $x^\star$ is an $\varepsilon$-approximate
local minimum for a ""greedy approximation"" to the function $\max_z f(x, z)$
which can be efficiently estimated using second-order optimization algorithms.
We prove the existence of such a point for any smooth function which is bounded
and has Lipschitz Hessian. To prove existence, we introduce an algorithm that
converges from any starting point to an $\varepsilon$-greedy adversarial
equilibrium in a number of evaluations of the function $f$, the max-player's
gradient $\nabla_y f(x,y)$, and its Hessian $\nabla^2_y f(x,y)$, that is
polynomial in the dimension $d$, $1/\varepsilon$, and the bounds on $f$ and its
Lipschitz constant.

adaptive discretization of the action space, which gradually ``zooms in'' on
the more promising regions thereof. The goal is to take advantage of ``nicer''

the stochastic version of the problem is well-understood, the general version
with adversarial rewards is not. We provide the first algorithm for adaptive

bounds. In particular, we recover the worst-case optimal regret bound for the
adversarial version, and the instance-dependent regret bound for the stochastic

seller repeatedly adjusts prices for a product) enjoys these regret bounds
without any smoothness assumptions.

analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA) remain widely used as tools for:
exploratory analysis, pre-processing, data visualization and related tasks.
However, due to their rigid assumptions including crowding of high dimensional
data, they have been replaced in many settings by more flexible and still
interpretable latent feature models. The Feature allocation is usually modelled
using discrete latent variables assumed to follow either parametric
Beta-Bernoulli distribution or Bayesian nonparametric prior. In this work we
propose a simple and tractable parametric feature allocation model which can
address key limitations of current latent feature decomposition techniques. The
new framework allows for explicit control over the number of features used to
express each point and enables a more flexible set of allocation distributions
including feature allocations with different sparsity levels. This approach is
used to derive a novel adaptive Factor analysis (aFA), as well as, an adaptive
probabilistic principle component analysis (aPPCA) capable of flexible
structure discovery and dimensionality reduction in a wide case of scenarios.
We derive both standard Gibbs sampler, as well as, an expectation-maximization
inference algorithms that converge orders of magnitude faster to a reasonable
point estimate solution. The utility of the proposed aPPCA model is
demonstrated for standard PCA tasks such as feature learning, data
visualization and data whitening. We show that aPPCA and aFA can infer
interpretable high level features both when applied on raw MNIST and when
applied for interpreting autoencoder features. We also demonstrate an
application of the aPPCA to more robust blind source separation for functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).

representations for visual object categorization. However, CNNs do not
explicitly encode objects, parts, and their physical properties, which has
limited CNNs' success on tasks that require structured understanding of visual
scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the idea of Physical Scene
Graphs (PSGs), which represent scenes as hierarchical graphs, with nodes in the
hierarchy corresponding intuitively to object parts at different scales, and
edges to physical connections between parts. Bound to each node is a vector of
latent attributes that intuitively represent object properties such as surface
shape and texture. We also describe PSGNet, a network architecture that learns
to extract PSGs by reconstructing scenes through a PSG-structured bottleneck.
PSGNet augments standard CNNs by including: recurrent feedback connections to
combine low and high-level image information; graph pooling and vectorization
operations that convert spatially-uniform feature maps into object-centric
graph structures; and perceptual grouping principles to encourage the
identification of meaningful scene elements. We show that PSGNet outperforms
alternative self-supervised scene representation algorithms at scene
segmentation tasks, especially on complex real-world images, and generalizes
well to unseen object types and scene arrangements. PSGNet is also able learn
from physical motion, enhancing scene estimates even for static images. We
present a series of ablation studies illustrating the importance of each
component of the PSGNet architecture, analyses showing that learned latent
attributes capture intuitive scene properties, and illustrate the use of PSGs
for compositional scene inference.

reflectometry. Here, we theoretically describe physical mechanisms that render
such reflectometry-based readout schemes imperfect. We discuss charge qubits,
singlet-triplet spin qubits, and Majorana qubits. In our model, we account for
readout errors due to slow charge noise, and due to overdriving, when a too
strong probe is causing errors. A key result is that for charge and spin
qubits, the readout fidelity saturates at large probe strengths, whereas for
Majorana qubits, there is an optimal probe strength which provides a maximized
readout fidelity. We also point out the existence of severe readout errors
appearing in a resonance-like fashion as the pulse strength is increased, and
show that these errors are related to probe-induced multi-photon transitions.
Besides providing practical guidelines toward optimized readout, our study
might also inspire ways to use gate reflectometry for device characterization.

attraction of earth has a significant role in its dynamics. In this paper the
acceleration due to gravity g and the role of strong coupling in the context of
gravitationally stratified dusty plasma fluid have been considered. We find
that the appearance of elasticity speed up the growth of viscoelastic RT
instability by reducing the effect of viscosity at timescales shorter than the
Maxwell relaxation time ${\tau_m}$. The buoyancy driven situation with
spatially localized (in both dimensions) of low/high density regions placed in

supervised machine learning approach in combination with a recent method for
model determination, called NMFk, to determine the number of hidden features
automatically. NMFk performs a set of NMF simulations on an ensemble of
matrices, obtained by bootstrapping the initial data set, and determines which
K produces stable groups of latent features that reconstruct the initial data
set well. We then train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier network to
determine the correct number of latent features utilizing the statistics and
characteristics of the NMF solutions, obtained from NMFk. In order to train the
MLP classifier, a training set of 58,660 matrices with predetermined latent
features were factorized with NMFk. The MLP classifier in conjunction with NMFk
maintains a greater than 95% success rate when applied to a held out test set.
Additionally, when applied to two well-known benchmark data sets, the swimmer

functional theory (rt-TDDFT) have enabled the calculation of $S_e(v)$ along
nm-sized trajectories. However, it is still a challenge to obtain a meaningful
statistically averaged $S_e(v)$ that can be compared to observations. In this
work, taking advantage of the correlation between the local electronic
structure probed by the projectile and the distance from the projectile to the
atoms in the target, we devise a trajectory pre-sampling scheme to select,
geometrically, a small set of short trajectories to accelerate the convergence
of the averaged $S_e(v)$ computed via rt-TDDFT. For protons in liquid water, we
first calculate the reference probability distribution function (PDF) for the
distance from the proton to the closest oxygen atom,
$\phi_R(r_{p{\rightarrow}O})$, for a trajectory of a length similar to those
sampled experimentally. Then, short trajectories are sequentially selected so
that the accumulated PDF reproduces $\phi_R(r_{p{\rightarrow}O})$ to
increasingly high accuracy. Using these pre-sampled trajectories, we
demonstrate that the averaged $S_e(v_p)$ converges in the whole velocity range
with less than eight trajectories, while other averaging methods using randomly
and uniformly distributed trajectories require approximately ten times the
computational effort. This allows us to compare the $S_e(v_p)$ curve to

LTE), most prior work on OTFS receivers consider a two-step conversion, where
the received time-domain (TD) signal is firstly converted to a time-frequency
(TF) signal (using an OFDM demodulator) followed by post-processing of this TF
signal into a DD domain signal. In this paper, we show that the spectral
efficiency (SE) performance of a two-step conversion based receiver degrades in
very high mobility scenarios where the Doppler shift is a significant fraction
of the communication bandwidth (e.g., control and non-payload communication
(CNPC) in Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS)). We therefore consider an alternate
conversion, where the received TD signal is directly converted to the DD
domain. The resulting received DD domain signal is shown to be not the same as
that obtained in the two-step conversion considered in prior works. The
alternate conversion does not require an OFDM demodulator and is shown to have
lower complexity than the two-step conversion. Analysis and simulations reveal
that even in very high mobility scenarios, the SE achieved with the alternate
conversion is invariant of Doppler shift and is significantly higher than the
SE achieved with two-step conversion (which degrades with increasing Doppler
shift).

mutual information (PPMI) weighted co-occurrence matrices have been widely
superseded by machine-learning-based methods like word2vec and GloVe. But these
methods are usually applied using very large amounts of text data. In many
cases, however, there is not much text data available, for example for specific
domains or low-resource languages. This paper revisits PPMI by adding Dirichlet
smoothing to correct its bias towards rare words. We evaluate on standard word

by a wide range of measurement models, such as linear, logistic, 1-bit, and
other quantized models. In addition, we consider the impact of adversarial
corruptions on these measurements. Our analysis is based on a generalized Lasso
approach (Plan and Vershynin, 2016). We first provide a non-uniform recovery
guarantee, which states that under i.i.d.~Gaussian measurements, roughly
$O\left(\frac{k}{\epsilon^2}\log L\right)$ samples suffice for recovery with an
$\ell_2$-error of $\epsilon$, and that this scheme is robust to adversarial
noise. Then, we apply this result to neural network generative models, and
discuss various extensions to other models and non-i.i.d.~measurements.
Moreover, we show that our result can be extended to the uniform recovery

is satisfied by the 1-bit and censored Tobit models.

conditioning on observations of surface velocity in southwestern Greenland to
infer the posterior probability distributions for eight spatially and
temporally constant parameters governing the behavior of both the sliding law

MCMC sampling is intractable. We skirt this issue by training a neural network
as a surrogate that approximates the model at a sliver of the computational
cost. We find that surface velocity observations establish strong constraints
on model parameters relative to a prior distribution and also elucidate
correlations, while the model explains 60% of observed variance. However, we
also find that several distinct configurations of the hydrologic system and
stress regime are consistent with observations, underscoring the need for
continued data collection and model development.

three-dimensional shape, multiple overlaid textures, an abundance of
surrounding irregularities in the skull, and a virtually omnidirectional range
of the jaw's motion - all of which extend the manual annotation process to more
than an hour per patient. To address the challenge, we invent a new angle to
the 3D segmentation task: namely, we propose to segment empty spaces between
all the tissues surrounding the object - the so-called negative volume
segmentation. Our approach is an end-to-end pipeline that comprises a V-Net for
bone segmentation, a 3D volume construction by inflation of the reconstructed
bone head in all directions along the normal vector to its mesh faces.
Eventually confined within the skull bones, the inflated surface occupies the
entire ""negative"" space in the joint, effectively providing a
geometrical/topological metric of the joint's health. We validate the idea on
the CT scans in a 50-patient dataset, annotated by experts in maxillofacial
medicine, quantitatively compare the asymmetry given the left and the right
negative volumes, and automate the entire framework for clinical adoption.

  and training","22 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In naturalistic learning problems, a model's input contains a wide range of
features, some useful for the task at hand, and others not. Of the useful
features, which ones does the model use? Of the task-irrelevant features, which
ones does the model represent? Answers to these questions are important for
understanding the basis of models' decisions, as well as for building models
that learn versatile, adaptable representations useful beyond the original
training task. We study these questions using synthetic datasets in which the
task-relevance of input features can be controlled directly. We find that when
two features redundantly predict the labels, the model preferentially
represents one, and its preference reflects what was most linearly decodable
from the untrained model. Over training, task-relevant features are enhanced,
and task-irrelevant features are partially suppressed. Interestingly, in some
cases, an easier, weakly predictive feature can suppress a more strongly
predictive, but more difficult one. Additionally, models trained to recognize
both easy and hard features learn representations most similar to models that
use only the easy feature. Further, easy features lead to more consistent
representations across model runs than do hard features. Finally, models have
greater representational similarity to an untrained model than to models
trained on a different task. Our results highlight the complex processes that
determine which features a model represents.

from medical images are important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment
management for patients suffering from myocardial infarction (MI). Late
gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an
important protocol to visualize MI. However, automated segmentation of LGE CMR
is still challenging, due to the indistinguishable boundaries, heterogeneous
intensity distribution and complex enhancement patterns of pathological
myocardium from LGE CMR. Furthermore, compared with the other sequences LGE CMR
images with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which represents
another obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of
LGE CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence
Cardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019.
The challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images, including auxiliary
CMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent
cardiomyopathy. It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark
existing ones for LGE CMR segmentation and compare them objectively. In
addition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to combine the
complementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE
CMR. Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons,
among which three methods are unsupervised methods and the other six are
supervised. The results showed that the average performance of the nine methods
was comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods
was mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the
MS-CMR images, which provide important label information for the training of
deep neural networks.

[Adhikary et al. Eur. Phys. J. D, 74(68):68, 2020] that nonexistence of a
classical joint probability scheme gives rise to sufficiency conditions for
nonlocality, a nonclassical feature not restricted to quantum mechanics. The
conditions for nonclassical features of quantum mechanics are obtained by
employing pseudo probabilities, which are expectation values of the parent
pseudo projections. The crux of the paper is that the pseudo-probabilities,
which can take negative values, can be directly measured as anomalous weak
values. We expect that this opens up new avenues for testing nonclassicality
via weak measurements, and also gives deeper insight into negative pseudo
probabilities which become measurable. A quantum game, based on violation of
classical probability rule is also proposed that can be played by employing
weak measurements.

used in binary-tostochastic conversion, the inaccuracy produced by undesired
correlation between signals, and the stochastic maximum function
implementation. Compared with traditional binary logic implementations,
experimental results showed an improvement of 19.6x and 6.3x in terms of speed
performance and energy efficiency, for the FPGA implementation. We have also
realized a full VLSI implementation of the proposed SC-CNN architecture
demonstrating that our optimization achieve a 18x area reduction over previous

algorithms when using the state-of-the-art fault-tolerant quantum error
correcting codes, in particular, those for which implementing the T gate
consumes vastly more resources than the other gates in the gate set. More
specifically, we consider the group of unitaries that can be exactly
implemented by a quantum circuit consisting of the Clifford+T gate set, a
universal gate set. Our primary interest is to compute a circuit for a given
$n$-qubit unitary $U$, using the minimum possible number of T gates (called the
T-count of unitary $U$). We consider the problem COUNT-T, the optimization
version of which aims to find the T-count of $U$. In its decision version the
goal is to decide if the T-count is at most some positive integer $m$. Given an
oracle for COUNT-T, we can compute a T-count-optimal circuit in time polynomial
in the T-count and dimension of $U$. We give a provable classical algorithm
that solves COUNT-T (decision) in time
$O\left(N^{2(c-1)\lceil\frac{m}{c}\rceil}\text{poly}(m,N)\right)$ and space
$O\left(N^{2\lceil\frac{m}{c}\rceil}\text{poly}(m,N)\right)$, where $N=2^n$ and
$c\geq 2$. This gives a space-time trade-off for solving this problem with
variants of meet-in-the-middle techniques. We also introduce an asymptotically
faster multiplication method that shaves a factor of $N^{0.7457}$ off of the
overall complexity. Lastly, beyond our improvements to the rigorous algorithm,
we give a heuristic algorithm that outputs a T-count-optimal circuit and has
space and time complexity $\text{poly}(m,N)$, under some assumptions. While our
heuristic method still scales exponentially with the number of qubits (though
with a lower exponent, there is a large improvement by going from exponential
to polynomial scaling with $m$.

At the interfaces
of the junction, omni-directional total reflection takes place, named
anti-super-Klein tunneling, as this effect is not due to an energetically
forbidden region but due to pseudo-spin blocking. The anti-super-Klein
tunneling confines electrons within the junction, which thus represents a
perfect lossless electron waveguide. Calculating the current flow by applying
the Green's function method onto a tight-binding model of phosphorene, it is
observed that narrow electron beams propagate in these waveguides like light
beams in optical fibers. The perfect guiding is found for all steering angles
of the electron beam as the total reflection does not rely on the existence of
a critical angle. For low electron energies and narrow junctions, the guided
modes of the waveguide are observed. The waveguide operates without any loss
only for a specific orientation of the junction. For arbitrary orientations,
minor leakage currents are found, which however decay for low electron energies
and grazing incidence angles. It is shown that a crossroad shaped pnp junction
can be used to split and direct the current flow in phosphorene. The proposed
device, a phosphorene pnp junction as a lossless electron waveguide, may not
only find applications in nanoelectronics but also in quantum information
technology.

matrices is shown to have zeros when the system undergoes a quasistatic,
quench, or Uhlmann process. While the Loschmidt-amplitude zero of a quench
process corresponds to a dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT) accompanied
by the diverging dynamical free energy, the Loschmidt-amplitude zero of the
Uhlmann process corresponds to a topological phase transition (TQPT)
accompanied by a jump of the Uhlmann phase. Although the density matrix remains
intact in a quasistatic process, the Loschmidt amplitude can have zeros not
associated with a phase transition. We present examples of two-level and
three-level systems exhibiting finite- or infinite- temperature DQPTs and
finite-temperature TQPTs associated with the Loschmidt-amplitude zeros.
Moreover, the dynamical phase or geometrical phase of mixed states can be
extracted from the Loschmidt amplitude. Those phases may become quantized or
exhibit discontinuity at the Loschmidt-amplitude zeros. A spinor representation
of the purified states of a general two-level system is presented to offer more
insights into the change of purification in different processes. The
quasistatic process, for example, is shown to cause a rotation of the spinor.

recoil events between 1 and 7 keV. We explore the possibility to explain such
an anomaly by the MeV-scale dark matter (DM) heated by the interior of the Sun
due to the same DM-electron interaction as in the detector. The kinetic
energies of heated DM particles can reach a few keV, and can potentially
account for the excess signals detected by XENON1T. We study different form
factors of the DM-electron interactions, $F(q)\propto q^i$ with $i=0,1,2$ and
$q$ being the momentum exchange, and find that for all these cases the
inclusion of the Sun-heated DM component improves the fit to the XENON1T data.
The inferred DM-electron scattering cross section (at $q=\alpha m_e$ where
$\alpha$ is the fine structure constant and $m_e$ is electron mass) is from
$\sim 10^{-38}$~cm$^2$ (for $i=0$) to $\sim 10^{-42}$~cm$^2$ (for $i=2$). We
also derive constraints on the DM-electron cross sections for different form
factors, which are stronger than previous results with similar assumptions. We
emphasize that the Sun-heated DM scenario relies on the minimum assumption on
DM models, which serves as a general explanation of the XENON1T anomaly via
DM-electron interaction. The spectrum of the Sun-heated DM is typically soft
comparing to other boosted DM, so the small recoil events are expected to be
abundant in this scenario. More sensitive direct detection experiments with
lower thresholds can possibly distinguish this scenario with other boosted DM
models or solar axion models.

calculating exchange coupling parameters is presented on the basis of the KKR
(Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker) Green function method making use of the alloy analogy
model. Using several representative systems, it is shown that depending on the
material the effect of thermal lattice vibrations can have a significant impact
on the isotropic exchange as well as anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions (DMI). This should lead in turn to an additional contribution to
the temperature dependence of the magnetic properties of solids, which cannot
be neglected in the general case. As an example, we discuss such an influence
on the critical temperature of various magnetic phase transitions. In
particular, in the case of skyrmion hosting materials, a strong impact of
lattice vibrations on the DMI is an additional source for temperature dependent
skyrmion stability which should be taken into consideration.

(https://autoimplant.grand-challenge.org/) - the cranial implant design
challenge, which, as suggested by the organizers, can be formulated as a
volumetric shape learning task. In this task, the defective skull, the complete
skull and the cranial implant are represented as binary voxel grids. To
accomplish this task, the implant can be either reconstructed directly from the
defective skull or obtained by taking the difference between a defective skull
and a complete skull. In the latter case, a complete skull has to be
reconstructed given a defective skull, which defines a volumetric shape
completion problem. Our baseline approach for this task is based on the former
formulation, i.e., a deep neural network is trained to predict the implants
directly from the defective skulls. The approach generates high-quality
implants in two steps: First, an encoder-decoder network learns a coarse
representation of the implant from down-sampled, defective skulls; The coarse
implant is only used to generate the bounding box of the defected region in the
original high-resolution skull. Second, another encoder-decoder network is
trained to generate a fine implant from the bounded area. On the test set, the
proposed approach achieves an average dice similarity score (DSC) of 0.8555 and
Hausdorff distance (HD) of 5.1825 mm. The code is publicly available at

violate the functional constraints but aim to achieve a low regret and
cumulative violation of the constraints over a horizon of $T$ time steps.
First-order methods achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret and an
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ constraint violation, which is the best-known bound under the
Slater's condition, but do not take into account the structural information of
the problem. Furthermore, the existing algorithms and analysis are limited to
Euclidean space. In this paper, we provide an \emph{instance-dependent} bound
for online convex optimization with complex constraints obtained by a novel
online primal-dual mirror-prox algorithm. Our instance-dependent regret is
quantified by the total gradient variation $V_*(T)$ in the sequence of loss
functions. The proposed algorithm works in \emph{general} normed spaces and
simultaneously achieves an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{V_*(T)})$ regret and an
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ constraint violation, which is never worse than the best-known

Their discrete nature makes them particularly suitable for lossless compression

this claim does not hold for integer discrete flows due to the embedding of

Furthermore, we zoom in on the effect of gradient bias due to the
straight-through estimator in integer discrete flows, and demonstrate that its

been known that such counterfactual questions face measurement challenges
related to omitted-variable bias, and conceptual challenges related to the
definition of causal estimands for largely immutable characteristics. Another
concern, which has been the subject of recent debates, is post-treatment bias:
many studies of discrimination condition on apparently intermediate outcomes,
like being arrested, that themselves may be the product of discrimination,
potentially corrupting statistical estimates. There is, however, reason to be
optimistic. By carefully defining the estimand -- and by considering the
precise timing of events -- we show that a primary causal quantity of interest
in discrimination studies can be estimated under an ignorability condition that
may hold approximately in some observational settings. We illustrate these
ideas by analyzing both simulated data and the charging decisions of a

on average carries most of the deposited energy, while the nuclear recoil

excess of the keV electrons. Indirect constraints from dark matter annihilation
are avoided for light mediators of ${\mathcal O}(10~{\rm MeV})$ that have

of common practical issues such as, trial-and-error to analyze sensitivity and
hyper-parameters to prune DNNs, which plague them both. In this work, we
propose a new single-shot, fully automated pruning algorithm called Slimming
Neural networks using Adaptive Connectivity Scores (SNACS). Our proposed
approach combines a probabilistic pruning framework with constraints on the
underlying weight matrices, via a novel connectivity measure, at multiple
levels to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches while solving their
deficiencies. In \alg{}, we propose a fast hash-based estimator of Adaptive
Conditional Mutual Information (ACMI), that uses a weight-based scaling
criterion, to evaluate the connectivity between filters and prune unimportant
ones. To automatically determine the limit up to which a layer can be pruned,
we propose a set of operating constraints that jointly define the upper pruning
percentage limits across all the layers in a deep network. Finally, we define a
novel sensitivity criterion for filters that measures the strength of their
contributions to the succeeding layer and highlights critical filters that need
to be completely protected from pruning. Through our experimental validation we
show that SNACS is faster by over 17x the nearest comparable method and is the

behavior, which highlights the importance of understanding the temperature
dependence of the heat capacity and thermal conductivity when modeling and
predicting device electrothermal response. Due to the complicated
microstructure near the interface between CVD diamond and electronics, it is
difficult to measure both properties simultaneously. In this work, we use time
domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) to simultaneously measure the in plane thermal

The results show that the in plane thermal conductivity varied slightly with an

while the specific heat capacity has a strong temperature dependence over the

trying to forward messages to a single receiver using some physical medium. In
this paper we consider scenarios in which this medium consists of just a single
classical or quantum particle. In the quantum case, the particle can be
prepared in a superposition state thereby allowing for a richer family of
encoding strategies. To make the comparison between quantum and classical
channels precise, we introduce an operational framework in which all possible
encoding strategies consume no more than a single particle. We apply this
framework to an N-port interferometer experiment in which each party controls a
path the particle can traverse. When used for the purpose of communication,
this setup embodies a multiple access channel (MAC) built with a single
particle.
  We provide a full characterization of the N-party classical MACs that can be
built from a single particle, and we show that every non-classical particle can
generate a MAC outside the classical set. To further distinguish the
capabilities of a single classical and quantum particle, we relax the locality
constraint and allow for joint encodings by subsets of 1<K<= N parties. This
generates a richer family of classical MACs whose polytope dimension we
compute. We identify a ""generalized fingerprinting inequality"" as a valid facet
for this polytope, and we verify that a quantum particle distributed among N
separated parties can violate this inequality even when K=N-1. Connections are
drawn between the single-particle framework and multi-level coherence theory.
We show that every pure state with K-level coherence can be detected in a
semi-device independent manner, with the only assumption being conservation of
particle number.

mixing them. Moving the thought experiment into the quantum realm, we reveal
new and surprising behaviour: the ignorant observer can extract work from
mixing different gases, even if the gases cannot be directly distinguished.
Moreover, in the macroscopic limit, the quantum case diverges from the
classical ideal gas: as much work can be extracted as if the gases were fully

reconstructs the flow fields using a linear combination of orthonormal basis
functions, obtained through proper orthogonal decomposition (POD), hence named
FCN-POD. Both models are trained using data from two direct numerical
simulations (DNS) at friction Reynolds numbers $Re_{\tau} = 180$ and $550$.
Thanks to their ability to predict the nonlinear interactions in the flow, both
models show a better prediction performance than the extended proper orthogonal

output fields. The performance of the various models is compared based on
predictions of the instantaneous fluctuation fields, turbulence statistics and
power-spectral densities. The FCN exhibits the best predictions closer to the
wall, whereas the FCN-POD model provides better predictions at larger

learning for the FCN model, using the weights from $Re_{\tau}=180$ to

interpretation and its wide applications. With RS images becoming more
accessible than ever before, there is an increasing demand for the automatic
interpretation of these images. In this context, the benchmark datasets serve
as essential prerequisites for developing and testing intelligent
interpretation algorithms. After reviewing existing benchmark datasets in the
research community of RS image interpretation, this article discusses the
problem of how to efficiently prepare a suitable benchmark dataset for RS image
interpretation. Specifically, we first analyze the current challenges of
developing intelligent algorithms for RS image interpretation with bibliometric
investigations. We then present the general guidances on creating benchmark
datasets in efficient manners. Following the presented guidances, we also
provide an example on building RS image dataset, i.e., Million-AID, a new
large-scale benchmark dataset containing a million instances for RS image scene
classification. Several challenges and perspectives in RS image annotation are
finally discussed to facilitate the research in benchmark dataset construction.
We do hope this paper will provide the RS community an overall perspective on
constructing large-scale and practical image datasets for further research,
especially data-driven ones.

Multiple cores accreting gas at runaway rates gravitationally perturb one
another onto crossing orbits such that the average merger rate equals the gas

scales with the total planet mass as $M_{\rm core} \propto M^{1/5}$ - heavier

others may merge multiple times, as merger trees grow chaotically. We show that

its old, metal-poor stellar population. We identify three RR Lyrae stars that
are plausibly associated with the tails, in addition to four previously known
in the cluster. From these RR Lyrae stars, we find that the mean distance to
the cluster and tails is $23.6 \pm 0.2$ kpc and estimate the total (initial)
luminosity of the cluster to be $L_V=5.1^{+9.7}_{-3.4}\times 10^3 L_\odot$,

radial velocity measurements of the cluster, we find that Palomar 13 is on a
highly eccentric orbit ($e\sim 0.8$) with a pericenter of ~9 kpc and an
apocenter of ~69 kpc, and a recent pericentric passage of the cluster ~75 Myr
ago. We note a prominent linear structure in the interstellar dust map that
runs parallel to the candidate tidal features, but conclude that reddening due
to dust is unlikely to account for the structure that we observe. If confirmed,
the Palomar 13 stellar stream would be one of very few streams with a known

the floating bands of elementary band representation -- $A@12a$ -- originating
from the excess electrons centered at the vacancies (${\it i.e.}$, the $12a$

correspondence for the spinless six-fold excitation, resulting in trivial
surface 'Fermi arcs' but nontrivial hinge arcs. All energetically-gapped

insulating phase, which is protected by a combined symmetry ${\mathcal
T}{\widetilde S_{4z}}$ and characterized by a quantized fractional corner

in the hinge spectra of the $\widetilde S_{4z}$-symmetric rod structure. The
state with a single six-fold excitation, stabilized by both nonsymmorphic
crystalline symmetries and time-reversal symmetry, is located at the phase
boundary and can be driven into various topologically distinct phases by
explicit breaking of symmetries, making these electrides promising platforms

the underlying structure is point-like or smooth. This debate, often framed in
terms of a millisecond pulsar or annihilating dark matter (DM) origin for the

problem using Bayesian graph convolutional neural networks. In simulated data,
our neural network (NN) is able to reconstruct the flux of inner Galaxy
emission components to on average $\sim$0.5%, comparable to the non-Poissonian
template fit (NPTF). When applied to the actual $\textit{Fermi}$-LAT data, we
find that the NN estimates for the flux fractions from the background templates
are consistent with the NPTF; however, the GCE is almost entirely attributed to
smooth emission. While suggestive, we do not claim a definitive resolution for
the GCE, as the NN tends to underestimate the flux of point-sources peaked near
the 1$\sigma$ detection threshold. Yet the technique displays robustness to a
number of systematics, including reconstructing injected DM, diffuse
mismodeling, and unmodeled north-south asymmetries. So while the NN is hinting
at a smooth origin for the GCE at present, with further refinements we argue
that Bayesian Deep Learning is well placed to resolve this DM mystery.

map-based non-Gaussian statistics with the angular power spectrum, namely;
peak/minimum counts and Minkowski functionals. We further analyze the impact of
tomography and systematic effects originating from galaxy intrinsic alignments,
multiplicative shear bias and photometric redshift systematics. We forecast the
performance of the statistics for a stage-3-like weak lensing survey and
restrict ourselves to scales $\geq$ 10 arcmin. We find, that in our setup, the
considered non-Gaussian statistics provide tighter constraints than the angular
power spectrum. The peak counts show the greatest potential, increasing the
Figure-of-Merit (FoM) in the $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}} - \sigma_8$ plane by a factor
of about 4. A combined analysis using all non-Gaussian statistics in addition
to the power spectrum increases the FoM by a factor of 5 and reduces the error
on $S_8$ by $\approx$ 25\%. We find that the importance of tomography is
diminished when combining non-Gaussian statistics with the angular power
spectrum. The non-Gaussian statistics indeed profit less from tomography and
the minimum counts and Minkowski functionals add some robustness against galaxy
intrinsic alignment in a non-tomographic setting. We further find that a
combination of the angular power spectrum and the non-Gaussian statistics
allows us to apply conservative scale cuts in the analysis, thus helping to
minimize the impact of baryonic and relativistic effects, while conserving the
cosmological constraining power. We make the code that was used to conduct this

The nature of this spheroidal population, whether a small classical bulge, the
innermost stellar halo or a population of disk stars with large initial
velocity dispersion, remains unclear. This structure is also a promising
candidate to host some of the oldest stars in the Galaxy. Here we address the
topic of the inner stellar spheroid age, using spectroscopic and photometric
metallicities for a sample of 935 RR Lyrae stars that are constituents of this
component. By means of stellar population synthesis, we derive an
age-metallicity relation for RR Lyrae populations. We infer, for the RR Lyrae
stars in the bulge spheroid, an extremely ancient age of $13.41 \pm 0.54$ Gyr
and conclude they were among the first stars to form in what is now the Milky
Way galaxy. Our age estimate for the central spheroid shows remarkable
agreement with the age profile that has been inferred for the Milky Way stellar
halo, suggesting a connection between the two structures. However, we find mild
evidence for a transition in the halo properties at $r_{\rm GC} \sim 5$~kpc. We
also investigate formation scenarios for metal-rich RR Lyrae stars, such as
binarity and helium variations, and whether they can provide alternative
explanations for the properties of our sample. We conclude that, within our
framework, the only viable alternative is to have younger, slightly
helium-rich, RR Lyrae stars, a hypothesis that would open intriguing questions
for the formation of the inner stellar spheroid.

for the probabilistic error cancellation method can be formalized. We provide a
general methodology for evaluating the optimal cost by connecting it to a
resource-theoretic quantifier defined with respect to the noisy operations that
devices can implement. We employ our methods to estimate the optimal cost in
mitigating a general class of noise, where we obtain an achievable cost that
has a generic advantage over previous evaluations, as well as a fundamental
lower bound applicable to a broad class of noisy implementable operations. We
improve our bounds for several noise models, where we give the exact optimal
costs for the depolarizing and dephasing noise, precisely characterizing the
overhead cost while offering an operational meaning to the resource measure in
terms of error mitigation. Our result particularly implies that the heuristic

as a consequence of magnetic reconnection, and from the scale universality of
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), it can be expected that anemone jets exist even in
the solar photosphere. However, it is not necessarily apparent that jets can be
generated as a result of magnetic reconnection in the photosphere, where the
magnetic energy is not dominant. Furthermore, MHD waves generated from the
photospheric jets could contribute to chromospheric heating and spicule
formation; however, this hypothesis has not yet been thoroughly investigated.
In this study, we perform 3D MHD simulation including gravity with the solar
photospheric parameter to investigate anemone jets in the solar photosphere. In
the simulation, jet-like structures were induced by magnetic reconnection in
the solar photosphere. We determined that these jet-like structures were caused
by slow shocks formed by the reconnection and were propagated approximately in
the direction of the background magnetic field. We also suggested that MHD
waves from the jet-like structures could influence local atmospheric heating
and spicule formation.

intrinsic mass $\rm M_{\rm tot} = 3 \times 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$ are
characterized by smaller uncertainties than heavy ones ($\rm M_{\rm tot} = 10^7

at $z=1$, MBHBs with $\rm M_{\rm tot} = 3 \times 10^5 \, \rm M_\odot$ can be
localized with a median precision of $\simeq 10^2 \, \rm deg^2 (\simeq 1 \, \rm

0.04 -- 20 $\rm deg^2$ (0.3 -- 3 $\times 10^3 \, \rm deg^2$) for light (heavy)

considers a wider range of systematic effects than in previous work, including
adiabatic contraction and stellar anisotropy, to robustly constrain the

a mild preference for a nonzero cross section compared with cold collisionless
dark matter. Our groups result, $\sigma/m=0.5\pm0.2~\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$,
places the first constraint on self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) at an

is $\sigma/m=0.19\pm0.09~\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$, with an upper limit of
$\sigma / m < 0.35~\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ (95% CL). Thus, our results
disfavor a velocity-independent cross section of order
$1~\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$ or larger needed to address small scale structure
problems in galaxies, but are consistent with a velocity-dependent cross
section that decreases with increasing scattering velocity. Comparing the cross
sections with and without the effect of adiabatic contraction, we find that
adiabatic contraction produces slightly larger values for our data sample, but
they are consistent at the $1\sigma$ level. Finally, to validate our approach,
we apply our Jeans analysis to a sample of mock data generated from
SIDM-plus-baryons simulations with $\sigma/m = 1~\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}$.
This is the first test of the Jeans model at the level of stellar and lensing

most common method of constraining their properties is searching the spectra of
the most metal-poor stars for the chemical elements created in the first stars
and their supernova. In this approach, modelled supernova yields are compared
to the observed abundance patterns in extremely metal-poor stars. The method
typically only uses the abundance ratios, i.e., the yields are diluted to the
observed level. Following the usual assumption of spherical symmetry we compute
a simple lower limit of the mass a supernova can mix with and find that it is
consistent with all published simulations of early chemical enrichment in the
interstellar medium. For three different cases, we demonstrate that this
dilution limit can change the conclusions from the abundance fitting. There is
a large discrepancy between the dilution found in simulations of SN explosions
in minihaloes and the dilution assumed in many abundance fits. Limiting the
dilution can significantly alter the likelihood of which supernovae are
possible progenitors of observed CEMP-no stars. In particular, some of the
faint, very low-yield SNe, which have been suggested as models for the
abundance pattern of SMSS0313-6708, cannot explain the measured metal
abundances, as their predicted metal yields are too small by two orders of
magnitude. Altogether, the new dilution model presented here emphasizes the

coalescence of such SMBHBs is $\langle t_{\rm evol} \rangle > 6\times
10^4\,$yr, assuming that their orbital evolution in the PTA frequency band is
driven by emission of gravitational waves. If some fraction of SMBHBs do not
reside in spectroscopically detected active galaxies, and their incidence in
active and inactive galaxies is similar, then the merger timescale could be
$\sim 10$ times longer, $\langle t_{\rm evol} \rangle > 6\times 10^5\,$yr.
These limits are consistent with the range of timescales predicted by
theoretical models and imply that all the SMBHB candidates in our spectroscopic

facilitated by the PTAs, in providing an independent statistical test of the

thermal particles, the magnetic and non-thermal particle energy in the knot
regions are tightly constrained. The most plausible condition is an energy
equipartition between them, $\eta_B\sim\eta_e\sim0.1$. Such weak magnetic

LIR and CO(5-4) or CO(7-6) for main-sequence galaxies and starbursts,
corroborating the hypothesis that these transitions can be used as SFR tracers.
We find the CO excitation to steadily increase as a function of the star
formation efficiency, the mean intensity of the radiation field warming the
dust, the surface density of SFR, and, less distinctly, with the distance from
the main sequence. This adds to the tentative evidence for higher excitation of
the CO+[CI] SLED of starbursts relative to that for main-sequence objects,
where the dust opacities play a minor role in shaping the high-J CO transitions
in our sample. However, the distinction between the average SLED of upper
main-sequence and starburst galaxies is blurred, driven by a wide variety of
intrinsic shapes. LVG radiative transfer modeling demonstrates the existence of
a highly excited component that elevates the CO SLED of high-redshift
main-sequence and starbursting galaxies above the typical values observed in
the disk of the Milky Way. This excited component is dense and it encloses ~50%
of the total molecular gas mass in main-sequence objects. We interpret the
observed trends involving the CO excitation as mainly driven by a combination
of large SFRs and compact sizes, naturally connected with enhanced dense
molecular gas fractions and higher dust and gas temperatures, due to increasing
UV radiation fields, cosmic ray rates, and dust/gas coupling. [Abridged]

Such characteristics have been reported in the literature, for example, in

but they are hard to detect. In a partially ionized plasma, a magnetic field
works directly on the ionized medium but not on the neutral medium, which gives
rise to a velocity drift between them: ambipolar diffusion. This process is
suggested to be important in the process of star formation, but has never been
directly observed. We introduce a method that could be used to detect ambipolar
diffusion and the magnetic field that gives rise to it, where we exploit the
velocity drift between the charged and neutral medium. By using a
representative classical model of the collision dynamics, we show that
molecular ions partially align themselves when a velocity drift is present
between the molecular ion and its main collision partner H2. We demonstrate
that ambipolar diffusion potently aligns molecular ions in regions denser than
their critical density, which subsequently leads to partially polarized
emission from these species. We include a model for HCO+ and show that
collisional polarization could be detectable for the ambipolar drifts predicted
by numerical simulations of the inner protostellar disk regions. The
polarization vectors are aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field direction

embrace the wide diversity identified for low-mass protostellar envelope and

these species provide constraints on gas-phase C/N/O ratios, D- and
$^{15}$N-fractionation, source temperature and UV exposure, as well as the
overall S-chemistry. We find substantial evidence of chemical differentiation
among our source sample, some of which can be traced back to Class I physical
parameters, such as the disk-to-envelope mass ratio (proxy for Class I
evolutionary stage), the source luminosity, and the UV-field strength. Overall,
these first results allow us to start investigating the astrochemistry of Class
I objects, however, interferometric observations are needed to differentiate

which agree well with microscopic dynamics but suffer from significant
stiffness that prevents simulation on fine spatial grids, we develop a new
numerical method based on the macroscopic partial differential equation,
leveraging its formal structure as the gradient flow of the total variation
energy, with respect to a weighted $H^{-1}$ norm. This gradient flow structure
relates to several metric space gradient flows of recent interest, including
2-Wasserstein flows and their generalizations to nonlinear mobilities. We
develop a novel semi-implicit time discretization of the gradient flow,
inspired by the classical minimizing movements scheme (known as the JKO scheme
in the 2-Wasserstein case). We then use a primal dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)
method to compute each element of the semi-implicit scheme. In one dimension,
we prove convergence of the PDHG method to the semi-implicit scheme, under
general integrability assumptions on the mobility and its reciprocal. Finally,
by taking finite difference approximations of our PDHG method, we arrive at a
fully discrete numerical algorithm, with iterations that converge at a rate
independent of the spatial discretization: in particular, the convergence
properties do not deteriorate as we refine our spatial grid. We close with
several numerical examples illustrating the properties of our method, including
facet formation at local maxima, pinning at local minima, and convergence as
the spatial and temporal discretizations are refined.

The magnetic field felt by particles injected in an isolated plasmoid increases
linearly with time, which leads to particle energization as a result of
magnetic moment conservation. For particles injected with a power-law
distribution function, this energization process acts in such a way that the
shape of the injected power law is conserved, while producing an additional
non-thermal tail $f(E)\propto E^{-3}$ at higher energies followed by an
exponential cutoff. The cutoff energy, which increases with time as $E_{\rm

RNAs(lncRNAs) showed abnormal expression of lncRNAs in many complex diseases.
Accurately identifying lncRNA-disease association is essential in understanding
lncRNA functionality and disease mechanism. There are many machine learning
techniques involved in the prediction of lncRNA-disease association which use
different biological interaction networks and associated features. Feature
learning from the network structured data is one of the limiting factors of
machine learning-based methods. Graph neural network based techniques solve
this limitation by unsupervised feature learning. Deep belief networks (DBN)
are recently used in biological network analysis to learn the latent
representations of network features.
  Method: In this paper, we propose a DBN based lncRNA-disease association
prediction model (DBNLDA) from lncRNA, disease and miRNA interactions. The
architecture contains three major modules-network construction, DBN based
feature learning and neural network-based prediction. First, we constructed
three heterogeneous networks such as lncRNA-miRNA similarity (LMS),
disease-miRNA similarity (DMS) and lncRNA-disease association (LDA) network.
From the node embedding matrices of similarity networks, lncRNA-disease
representations were learned separately by two DBN based subnetworks. The joint
representation of lncRNA-disease was learned by a third DBN from outputs of the
two subnetworks mentioned. This joint feature representation was used to
predict the association score by an ANN classifier.
  Result: The proposed method obtained AUC of 0.96 and AUPR of 0.967 when
tested against standard dataset used by the state-of-the-art methods. Analysis
on breast, lung and stomach cancer cases also affirmed the effectiveness of
DBNLDA in predicting significant lncRNA-disease associations.

18. The historical UV and IR light-curves from OGLE and Swift/UVOT showed that
after a long period of steady brightness, it experienced a significant
brightening beginning around 2019 March. This IR/UV rise is likely the
signature of the formation of a circumstellar disc, confirmed by the presence
of strong a H{\alpha} line in SALT spectroscopy, that was not previously
present. Periodicity analysis of the OGLE data reveals a plausible 426 day
binary period, and in the X-ray a pulsation period of 146.6s period is
detected. The onset of X-ray emission from Swift J004516.6-734703 is likely the
signature of a Type-I outburst from the first periastron passage of the neutron
star companion through the newly formed circumstellar disc. We note that the
formation of the circumstellar disc began at the predicted time of the previous

we focus on weak lensing systematics. The fact that the LSST observing strategy
involves hundreds of visits to the same sky area provides new opportunities for
systematics mitigation. We explore these opportunities by testing how different
dithering strategies (pointing offsets and rotational angle of the camera in
different exposures) affect additive weak lensing shear systematics on a
baseline operational simulation, using the $\rho-$statistics formalism. Some
dithering strategies improve systematics control at the end of the survey by a
factor of up to $\sim 3-4$ better than others. We find that a random
translational dithering strategy, applied with random rotational dithering at
every filter change, is the most effective of those strategies tested in this
work at averaging down systematics. Adopting this dithering algorithm, we
explore the effect of varying the area of the survey footprint, exposure time,
number of exposures in a visit, and exposure to the Galactic plane. We find
that any change that increases the average number of exposures (in filters
relevant to weak lensing) reduces the additive shear systematics. Some ways to
achieve this increase may not be favorable for the weak lensing statistical
constraining power or for other probes, and we explore the relative trade-offs

scheduling strategy based on fractional programming and the Hungarian
algorithm. The beamforming strategy allows us to iteratively maximize the
chosen objective function in a fashion similar to block coordinate ascent.
Furthermore, based on the crucial insight that, in the downlink, the
interference pattern remains fixed for a given set of beamforming weights, we
use the Hungarian algorithm as an efficient approach to optimally schedule
users for the given set of beamforming weights. Specifically, this approach
allows us to select the best subset of users (amongst the larger set of all
available users). Our simulation results show that, in terms of average
sum-log-utility, as well as sum-rate, the proposed scheme substantially
outperforms both the state-of-the-art multicell weighted minimum mean-squared

among adversaries. In fact, one of the largest DDoS attacks ever recorded,
reaching a peak of 1.3Tbps against GitHub, was a memcached-based DRDoS attack.
More recently, a record-breaking 2.3Tbps attack against Amazon AWS was due to a
CLDAP-based DRDoS attack. Although reflective attacks have been known for
years, DRDoS attacks are unfortunately still popular and largely unmitigated.
In this paper, we study in-the-wild DRDoS attacks observed from a large
Internet exchange point (IXP) and provide a number of security-relevant
measurements and insights.
  To enable this study, we first developed IXmon, an open-source DRDoS
detection system specifically designed for deployment at large IXP-like network
connectivity providers and peering hubs. We deployed IXmon at Southern
Crossroads (SoX), an IXP-like hub that provides both peering and upstream
Internet connectivity services to more than 20 research and education (R&E)

detected more than 900 DRDoS attacks towards 31 different victim ASes. An
analysis of the real-world DRDoS attacks detected by our system shows that most
DRDoS attacks are short lived, lasting only a few minutes, but that
large-volume, long-lasting, and highly-distributed attacks against R&E networks
are not uncommon. We then use the results of our analysis to discuss possible
attack mitigation approaches that can be deployed at the IXP level, before the

from Brownian-like dynamics to collective coherent motion. Swirling of swimming
bacteria is a spectacular example. This study demonstrates that a nematic
liquid crystal environment patterned as a spiral vortex controls
individual-to-collective transition in bacterial swirls and defines whether
they expand or shrink. In dilute dispersions, the bacteria swim along open
spiral trajectories, following the pre-imposed molecular orientation. The
trajectories are nonpolar. As their concentration exceeds some threshold, the
bacteria condense into unipolar circular swirls resembling stable limit cycles.
This collective circular motion is controlled by the spiral angle that defines
the splay-to-bend ratio of the background director. Vortices with dominating
splay shrink the swirls towards the center, while vortices with dominating bend
expand them to the periphery. 45o spiraling vortices with splay-bend parity
produce the most stable swirls. All the dynamic scenarios are explained by
hydrodynamic interactions of bacteria mediated by the patterned passive nematic
environment and by the coupling between the concentration and orientation. The
acquired knowledge of how to control individual and collective motion of
microswimmers by a nematic environment can help in the development of
microscopic mechanical systems.

the advances in virtualization have led the pathway for these workloads to be
deployed in virtualized clusters. However, HPC cluster administrators/providers
still face challenges in terms of resource elasticity and virtual machine (VM)
provisioning at large-scale, due to the lack of coordination between a
traditional HPC scheduler and the VM hypervisor (resource management layer).
This lack of interaction leads to low cluster utilization and job completion
throughput. Furthermore, the VM provisioning delays directly impact the overall
performance of jobs in the cluster. Hence, there is a need for effectively
provisioning virtualized HPC clusters, which can best-utilize the physical
hardware with minimal provisioning overheads.
  Towards this, we propose Multiverse, a VM provisioning framework, which can
dynamically spawn VMs for incoming jobs in a virtualized HPC cluster, by
integrating the HPC scheduler along with VM resource manager. We have
implemented this framework on the Slurm} scheduler along with the vSphere VM
resource manager. In order to reduce the VM provisioning overheads, we use
instant cloning which shares both the disk and memory with the parent VM, when
compared to full VM cloning which has to boot-up a new VM from scratch.
Measurements with real-world HPC workloads demonstrate that, instant cloning is
2.5x faster than full cloning in terms of VM provisioning time. Further, it
improves resource utilization by up to 40%, and cluster throughput by up to
1.5x, when compared to full clone for bursty job arrival scenarios.

spanning tree (MaxwIST) problem asks for a spanning tree of $G$ that maximizes
the total weight of internal nodes. This problem is NP-hard and APX-hard, with
the currently best known approximation factor $1/2$ (Chen et al., Algorithmica
2019). For the case of claw-free graphs, Chen et al. present an involved
approximation algorithm with approximation factor $7/12$. They asked whether it
is possible to improve these ratios, in particular for claw-free graphs and
cubic graphs.
  We improve the approximation factors for the MaxwIST problem in cubic graphs
and claw-free graphs. For cubic graphs we present an algorithm that computes a
spanning tree whose total weight of internal vertices is at least
$\frac{3}{4}-\frac{3}{n}$ times the total weight of all vertices, where $n$ is
the number of vertices of $G$. This ratio is almost tight for large values of
$n$. For claw-free graphs of degree at least three, we present an algorithm
that computes a spanning tree whose total internal weight is at least
$\frac{3}{5}-\frac{1}{n}$ times the total vertex weight. The degree constraint
is necessary as this ratio may not be achievable if we allow vertices of degree
less than three.
  With the above ratios, we immediately obtain better approximation algorithms
with factors $\frac{3}{4}-\epsilon$ and $\frac{3}{5}-\epsilon$ for the MaxwIST
problem in cubic graphs and claw-free graphs of degree at least three, for any
$\epsilon>0$. In addition to improving the approximation factors, the new
algorithms are relatively short compared to that of Chen et al.. The new
algorithms are fairly simple, and employ a variant of the depth-first search
algorithm that selects a relatively-large-weight vertex in every branching
step. Moreover, the new algorithms take linear time while previous algorithms
for similar problem instances are super-linear.

setting benchmarks for spin relaxation times for hole quantum dots.
Furthermore, we investigate the qubit addressability and sensitivity to
electric fields by measuring the resonance frequency dependence of each qubit
on gate voltages. We are able to tune the resonance frequency over a large
range for both the single and multi-hole qubit. Simultaneously, we find that
the resonance frequencies are only weakly dependent on neighbouring gates, and
in particular the five-hole qubit resonance frequency is more than twenty times

exhibited unusually low central gas entropy compared to the full sample. In the
central 0.3 kpc of NGC 4261, the ratio of cooling time to freefall time
($t_{\rm{cool}}/t_{\rm ff}$) is less than $10$, indicating that cold clouds may
be precipitating out of the hot ambient medium and providing fuel for accretion
in the central region. NGC 4261 also hosts the most powerful radio source in
the original sample. Because NGC 4261 may represent an important phase during
which powerful feedback from a central active galactic nucleus (AGN) is fueled
by multiphase condensation in the central kpc, we searched the Chandra archive
for analogs to NGC 4261. We present entropy profiles of those galaxies as well
as profiles of $t_{\rm{cool}}/t_{\rm ff}$. We find that one of them, IC 4296,

We compare the properties of NGC 4261 and IC 4296 to hydrodynamic simulations
of AGN feedback fueled by precipitation. Over the course of those simulations,
the single phase galaxy has an entropy gradient that remains similar to the

primordial. Their typical values are over one billion times higher than any
value predicted for the early Universe. Explaining this immense growth and
incorporating it in galaxy evolution theories is one of the long-standing
challenges in astrophysics. So far, the most successful theory for the
sustained growth of the galactic magnetic field is the alpha-omega dynamo. This
theory predicts a characteristic dipolar or quadrupolar morphology for the
galactic magnetic field, which has been observed in external galaxies. However,
so far, there has been no direct demonstration of a mean-field dynamo operating
in direct, multi-physics simulations of spiral galaxies. We do so in this work.
We employ numerical models of isolated, star-forming spiral galaxies that
include a magnetized gaseous disk, a dark matter halo, stars, and stellar
feedback. Naturally, the resulting magnetic field has a complex morphology that
includes a strong random component. Using a smoothing of the magnetic field on
small scales, we are able to separate the mean from the turbulent component and
analyze them individually. We find that a mean-field dynamo naturally occurs as
a result of the dynamical evolution of the galaxy and amplifies the magnetic
field by an order of magnitude over half a Gyr. Despite the highly dynamical
nature of these models, the morphology of the mean component of the field is
identical to analytical predictions. This result underlines the importance of
the mean-field dynamo in galactic evolution. Moreover, by demonstrating the
natural growth of the magnetic field in a complex galactic environment, it
brings us a step closer to understanding the cosmic origin of magnetic fields.

disadvantages, we propose combining graph neural networks with actor-critic
reinforcement learning. As graph neural networks apply the same network to
every vehicle and aggregate incoming edge information, they are invariant to
the number and order of vehicles. This makes them ideal candidates to be used
as networks in semantic environments -- environments consisting of objects
lists. Graph neural networks exhibit some other advantages that make them
favorable to be used in semantic environments. The relational information is
explicitly given and does not have to be inferred. Moreover, graph neural
networks propagate information through the network and can gather higher-degree

show that graph neural networks are capable of handling scenarios with a
varying number and order of vehicles during training and application.

concerning geodesics in i.i.d. first-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our
primary interest is in the empirical measures of edge-weights observed along
geodesics from $0$ to $n\xi$, where $\xi$ is a fixed unit vector. For various
dense families of edge-weight distributions, we prove that these empirical
measures converge weakly to a deterministic limit as $n\to\infty$, answering a
question of Hoffman. These families include arbitrarily small
$L^\infty$-perturbations of any given distribution, almost every finitely
supported distribution, uncountable collections of continuous distributions,
and certain discrete distributions whose atoms can have any prescribed sequence
of probabilities. Moreover, the constructions are explicit enough to guarantee
examples possessing certain features, for instance: both continuous and
discrete distributions whose support is all of $[0,\infty)$, and distributions
given by a density function that is $k$-times differentiable. All results also
hold for $\xi$-directed infinite geodesics. In comparison, we show that if
$\mathbb{Z}^d$ is replaced by the infinite $d$-ary tree, then any distribution
for the weights admits a unique limiting empirical measure along geodesics. In
both the lattice and tree cases, our methodology is driven by a new variational
formula for the time constant, which requires no assumptions on the edge-weight
distribution. Incidentally, this variational approach also allows us to obtain
new convergence results for geodesic lengths, which have been unimproved in the
subcritical regime since the seminal 1965 manuscript of Hammersley and Welsh.

quite under-abundant in CO. Further CO depletion may actually hinder their
production by limiting the gas-phase carbon supply. The embedded sources show
several chemical differences compared to the Class II stage, which seem to
arise from shielding of radiation by the envelope (impacting C2H formation and
HC15N fractionation) and sublimation of ices from infalling material (impacting

operational strategies that achieve application-specific cost-benefit tradeoffs
while catering to the specific domain characteristics of machine learning (ML)
models, such as accuracy, robustness, or fairness. We present a trace-driven
simulation-based experimentation and analytics environment that allows
researchers and engineers to devise and evaluate such operational strategies
for large-scale AI workflow systems. Analytics data from a production-grade AI
platform developed at IBM are used to build a comprehensive simulation model.
Our simulation model describes the interaction between pipelines and system
infrastructure, and how pipeline tasks affect different ML model metrics. We
implement the model in a standalone, stochastic, discrete event simulator, and
provide a toolkit for running experiments. Synthetic traces are made available
for ad-hoc exploration as well as statistical analysis of experiments to test
and examine pipeline scheduling, cluster resource allocation, and similar
operational mechanisms.

distributional similarity among similar individuals. In response to improving
fairness in machine learning, recent papers have investigated fairness in
clustering algorithms and have focused on the paradigm of statistical
parity/group fairness. These efforts attempt to minimize bias against some
protected groups in the population. However, to the best of our knowledge, the
alternative viewpoint of individual fairness, introduced by Dwork et al. (ITCS
2012) in the context of classification, has not been considered for clustering
so far. Similar to Dwork et al., we adopt the individual fairness notion which
mandates that similar individuals should be treated similarly for clustering
problems. We use the notion of $f$-divergence as a measure of statistical
similarity that significantly generalizes the ones used by Dwork et al. We
introduce a framework for assigning individuals, embedded in a metric space, to
probability distributions over a bounded number of cluster centers. The
objective is to ensure (a) low cost of clustering in expectation and (b)
individuals that are close to each other in a given fairness space are mapped
to statistically similar distributions.
  We provide an algorithm for clustering with $p$-norm objective ($k$-center,
$k$-means are special cases) and individual fairness constraints with provable
approximation guarantee. We extend this framework to include both group
fairness and individual fairness inside the protected groups. Finally, we
observe conditions under which individual fairness implies group fairness. We
present extensive experimental evidence that justifies the effectiveness of our
approach.

random true precision matrix, each with a possibly different support. We assume
that the union of the supports of all the true precision matrices (i.e., the
true support union) is small in size. We propose to pool all the samples from
different tasks, and \emph{improperly} estimate a single precision matrix by
minimizing the $\ell_1$-regularized log-determinant Bregman divergence. We show
that with high probability, the support of the \emph{improperly} estimated
single precision matrix is equal to the true support union, provided a
sufficient number of samples per task $n \in O((\log N)/K)$, for
$N$-dimensional vectors and $K$ tasks. That is, one requires less samples per
task when more tasks are available. We prove a matching information-theoretic
lower bound for the necessary number of samples, which is $n \in \Omega((\log

prove that the minimization of the $\ell_1$-regularized log-determinant Bregman
divergence with the additional constraint that the support is a subset of the
estimated support union could reduce the sufficient sample complexity of
successful support recovery to $O(\log(|S_{\text{off}}|))$ where
$|S_{\text{off}}|$ is the number of off-diagonal elements in the support union

analysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics and we identify the dominant
fluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of
three different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times,
characterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at
intermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing
number of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third
regime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is
exclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures
are stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant
variations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the
pore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid
transport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced
capillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary
fingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the
absence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a
macroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects

networks, which efficiently support the multiplication of two dense
$\sqrt{m}\times \sqrt{m}$ matrices, where $m$ is a given hardware parameter. In
this paper, we show that TCUs can speed up similarity search problems as well.
We propose algorithms for the Johnson-Lindenstrauss dimensionality reduction
and for similarity join that, by leveraging TCUs, achieve a $\sqrt{m}$ speedup
up with respect to traditional approaches.

time-reversal and mirror symmetry, resulting in a promising platform for
devices design. However, in reality, the design of topological devices is
hindered by a sensitivity against disorder and temperature. We study the
topological properties of Na$_3$Bi in the presence of intrinsic defects,
investigating the robustness of the edge states and the resulting transport
properties. We apply a recursive Green's function technique enabling the study
of disordered systems with lengths comparable to experimentally synthesized
materials, in the order of micrometers. We combine our findings to propose a
topological insulator device, where intrinsic defects are used to filter the
response of trivial bulk states. This results in a stable conductance
throughout a large range of electronic temperatures, and controllable by a
perpendicular electric field. Our proposal is general, enabling the design of
various dual topological insulators devices.

gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO's and Virgo's
third observing run on August 14, 2019 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a
signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was
localized to 18.5 deg$^2$ at a distance of $241^{+41}_{-45}$ Mpc; no
electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most
unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves,
$0.112^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$, and its secondary component is either the lightest
black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double
compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is
tightly constrained to $\leq 0.07$. Tests of general relativity reveal no
measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole
emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of
1-23 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the new class of binary coalescence sources that
GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass
ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are
unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass
ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges
all current models for the formation and mass distribution of compact-object
binaries.

study the effect of spatio-temporal noise on traveling waves, stationary
patterns and oscillations that are invariant under the action of a
finite-dimensional set of continuous isometries (such as translation or
rotation). This formalism can accommodate patterns, waves and oscillations in
reaction-diffusion systems and neural field equations. To do this, we define
the phase by precisely projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto the
manifold of isometries. Two differing types of stochastic phase dynamics are
defined: (i) a variational phase, obtained by insisting that the difference
between the projection and the original solution is orthogonal to the
non-decaying eigenmodes, and (ii) an isochronal phase, defined as the limiting
point on manifold obtained by taking $t\to\infty$ in the absence of noise. We
outline precise stochastic differential equations for both types of phase. The
variational phase SDE is then used to show that the probability of the system
leaving the attracting basin of the manifold after an exponentially long period
of time (in $\epsilon^{-2}$, the magnitude of the noise) is exponentially
unlikely. In the case that the manifold is periodic (such as for spiral waves,
spatially-distributed oscillations, or neural-field phenomena on a compact
domain), the isochronal phase SDE is used to determine asymptotic limits for
the average occupation times of the phase as it wanders in the basin of
attraction of the manifold over very long times. In particular, we find that
frequently the correlation structure of the noise biases the wandering in a
particular direction, such that the noise induces a slow oscillation that would
not be present in the absence of noise.

begin by looking at state stabilization of a single qubit using dissipation via
coupling to a lossy object. We look at the limiting factors in this approach to
error correction, and how we address those by numerically optimizing the
parametric coupling strength with the lossy object having an effective
time-varying dissipation rate---we call this a pulse-reset cycle. We then
translate this approach to more efficient state stabilization to an abstracted
three-qubit flip code, and end by looking at the Very Small Logical Qubit
(VSLQ). By using these techniques, we can further increase logical state
lifetimes for different architectures. We show significant advantages in using
a pulse-reset cycle over numerically optimized, fixed parameter spaces.

to stop working on a task, switch to another, and return eventually to the
first one, as needed or as scheduled. Multitasking, however, comes at a
cognitive cost: frequent context-switches can lead to distraction, sub-standard
work, and even greater stress. Aims: This paper reports a replication
experiment where we gathered data on a group of developers from a software
development company from industry on a large collection of projects stored in
GitLab repositories. Method: We reused the developed models and methods from
the original study for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers'
context-switching behavior, and we study how context-switching affects their
productivity. We applied semi-structured interviews, replacing the original
survey, to some of the developers to understand the reasons for and perceptions
of multitasking. Results: We found out that industry developers multitask as
much as OSS developers focusing more (on fewer projects), and working more
repetitively from one day to the next is associated with higher productivity,
but there is no effect for higher multitasking. Some commons reasons make them
multitask: dependencies, personal interests, and social relationships.
Conclusions: Short context change, less than three minutes, did not impact
results from industry developers; however, more than that, it brings a feeling
of left the previous tasks behind. So, it is proportional to how much context
is switched: as bigger the context and bigger the interruption, it is worst to
come back.

extending a {\em{passive program learner}} to a {\em{sampling program learner}}
that is able to sample candidate programs from the set of all consistent
programs to enable estimation of information gain. It also uses clustering of
inputs based on features in the inputs and the corresponding outputs to sample
a small set of candidate significant inputs. Our active learner is able to
tradeoff false negatives for false positives and converge in a small number of
iterations on a real-world dataset of %around 800 string transformation tasks.

returns have been extensively studied in finance, and provide one example in
which the data atoms consist of serially dependent probability distributions.
Motivated by such data, we propose an autoregressive model for density time
series by exploiting the tangent space structure on the space of distributions
that is induced by the Wasserstein metric. The densities themselves are not
assumed to have any specific parametric form, leading to flexible forecasting
of future unobserved densities. The main estimation targets in the order-$p$
Wasserstein autoregressive model are Wasserstein autocorrelations and the
vector-valued autoregressive parameter. We propose suitable estimators and
establish their asymptotic normality, which is verified in a simulation study.
The new order-$p$ Wasserstein autoregressive model leads to a prediction
algorithm, which includes a data driven order selection procedure. Its
performance is compared to existing prediction procedures via application to
four financial return data sets, where a variety of metrics are used to
quantify forecasting accuracy. For most metrics, the proposed model outperforms
existing methods in two of the data sets, while the best empirical performance
in the other two data sets is attained by existing methods based on functional
transformations of the densities.

present in a wireless communication environment, such as a backscatter tag, it
is possible to leverage the incoming radiation from the source as a
reference-wave to synthesize the desired wavefront across the reflecting
surface, radiating a field of interest. In this geometry, the phase grating,
which is synthesized using an array of sub-wavelength unit cells, is calculated
by interacting the incident reference-wave and the desired wavefront, similar
to a hologram. When illuminated by the reference-wave, the reflected wavefront
from the calculated phase grating is guaranteed to constructively add in the
direction of the desired radiation (beam-steering in the far-field) and also
focus at the intended depth (beam-focusing in the radiative near-field).
Leveraging a dynamic modulation mechanism in the context of an intelligent
reflective surface (IRS) illuminated by a backscatter tag, later, we present
that one can selectively focus and defocus at an arbitrarily positioned
receiver within the 3D field of view of the reflecting surface. This enables
the control of the amplitude of the radiated electric field at the receiver
location, paving the way for a spatial modulation mechanism by means of
reconfiguring the reflecting surface in a backscattered wireless communication
environment. In addition to the phase modification approach on a unit cell
level to reconfigure the aperture radiated wavefronts, we finally present a
time varying IRS concept making use of a time-delay based approach relying on a
delay adjustment between the reflection coefficients of the IRS' unit cell

scenarios with droop control inverters, non-exporting inverters, and
coordinated inverter control (CIC). The network operation and the interaction
between various inverter control methods are studied by simulating inverter
operation on two low-voltage networks. Considering 30% PV penetration as the
base case, we demonstrate that coordinated inverters can mitigate overvoltages
and voltage fluctuations caused by the tripping of passive inverters in 85% of
PV location cases when at least as many coordinated as passive inverters are
deployed on the 114-node test feeder. However, this rate reduced to 37% with
the IEEE 906-node network demonstrating that the deployment of coordinated
inverter control may not be able to reverse passive inverter-related voltage
disturbances when the build-up of passive inverters has reached a certain
threshold.
  The aggregated PV output from coordinated inverters can be also used to
provide grid support services. When the low-voltage networks operate close to
the upper voltage limits, the change in the power output from coordinated
inverters following a regulation request may be partially offset by passive
inverters. Considering an equal number of passive and coordinated inverters,
this paper shows that for each unit of the down-regulation request delivered by
coordinated inverters, passive inverter output may increase by up to 0.2 units
and decrease by up to 0.45 units during coordinated inverter up-regulation.

Alternatively, tensor cores can be programmed directly using CUDA APIs or

  Automatic kernel generation is particularly crucial when it is beneficial to
generate efficient code for an entire computation graph by fusing several
operations into a single device function instead of invoking a separate kernel

consider the quantum polar code construction using the same channel combining
and splitting procedure as in [1], but with a fixed two-qubit Clifford unitary.
For the family of Pauli channels, we show that polarization happens in
multi-levels, where synthesized quantum virtual channels tend to become
completely noisy, half-noisy, or noiseless. Further, we present a quantum polar
code exploiting the multilevel nature of polarization, and provide an efficient
decoding for this code. We show that half-noisy channels can be frozen by
fixing their inputs in either the amplitude or the phase basis, which allows
reducing the number of preshared EPR pairs compared to the construction in [1].
We provide an upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs, which is an
equality in the case of the quantum erasure channel. To improve the speed of
polarization, we propose an alternative construction, which again polarizes in
multi-levels, and the previous upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs
also holds. For a quantum erasure channel, we confirm by numerical analysis
that the multilevel polarization happens relatively faster for the alternative
construction.

mathematical characterization of human perception, used in the very definition
of adversarial attacks that are imperceptible to human eyes. Most current
attacks and defenses try to avoid this issue by considering restrictive
adversarial threat models such as those bounded by $L_2$ or $L_\infty$
distance, spatial perturbations, etc. However, models that are robust against
any of these restrictive threat models are still fragile against other threat
models. To resolve this issue, we propose adversarial training against the set
of all imperceptible adversarial examples, approximated using deep neural
networks. We call this threat model the neural perceptual threat model (NPTM);
it includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance (a
neural network-based approximation of the true perceptual distance) to natural
images. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the neural
perceptual distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of
adversarial examples, validating our threat model.
  Under the NPTM, we develop novel perceptual adversarial attacks and defenses.
Because the NPTM is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training
(PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of
adversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against five
diverse adversarial attacks. We find that PAT achieves state-of-the-art
robustness against the union of these five attacks, more than doubling the
accuracy over the next best model, without training against any of them. That
is, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in
sensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and
to the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial training defense
with this property.

networks (i.e., how they evolve as new edges are established) in terms of the
eigenvalue decomposition of the adjacency matrices. It assumes that, while
eigenvectors remain constant, eigenvalues evolve in a predictable manner over
time. This paper extends the original formulation of the model twofold.
  First, it presents a method to compute an approximation of the spectral
evolution of eigenvalues based on the Rayleigh quotient.
  Second, it proposes an algorithm to estimate the evolution of eigenvalues by
extrapolating only a fraction of their approximated values.
  The proposed model is used to characterize mention networks of users who
posted tweets that include the most popular political hashtags in Colombia from
August 2017 to August 2018 (the period which concludes the disarmament of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia). To evaluate the extent to which the
spectral evolution model resembles these networks, link prediction methods
based on learning algorithms (i.e., extrapolation and regression) and graph
kernels are implemented. Experimental results show that the learning algorithms
deployed on the approximated trajectories outperform the usual kernel and
extrapolation methods at predicting the formation of new edges.

effects. The same data for the total $e^+e^- \rightarrow \text{hadrons}$ cross
section, $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$, are used as input into dispersion relations to
estimate the hadronic vacuum polarization contributions, $a_{\mu}^{\rm

coupling at the $Z$-pole, $\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2)$, which enters
natural relations and global EW fits. The EW fit prediction of
$\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2) = 0.02722(41)$ agrees well with
$\Delta\alpha_{\rm had}^{(5)}(M_{Z}^2) = 0.02761(11)$ obtained from the
dispersion relation approach, but exhibits a smaller central value suggestive
of a larger discrepancy $\Delta a_{\mu}=a_{\mu}^{\rm exp} - a_{\mu}^{\rm SM}$
than currently expected. Postulating that the $\Delta a_{\mu}$ difference may
be due to missing $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$ contributions, implications for $M_W$,
$\sin^2 \! \theta^{\rm lep}_{\rm eff}$ and $M_H$ obtained from global EW fits
are investigated. Shifts in $\sigma_{\rm had}(s)$ needed to bridge $\Delta
a_{\mu}$ are found to be excluded above $\sqrt{s} \gtrsim 0.7$ GeV at the
95\%CL. Moreover, prospects for $\Delta a_{\mu}$ originating below that energy
are deemed improbable given the required increases in the cross section. Such
hypothetical changes to the hadronic data are also found to affect other
related observables, such as the electron anomaly, $a_e^{\rm SM}$, the ratio
$R_{e/\mu} = (m_\mu/m_e)^2 (a_{e}^{\rm had,\,LO\,VP}/a_{\mu}^{\rm

although the consequences of these are currently less constraining.

control approaches against voltage instability. With increased uncertainties
and rapidly changing operational conditions in power systems, existing methods
have outstanding issues in terms of either speed, adaptiveness, or scalability.
Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was regarded and adopted as a promising
approach for fast and adaptive grid stability control in recent years. However,
existing DRL algorithms show two outstanding issues when being applied to power
system control problems: 1) computational inefficiency that requires extensive
training and tuning time; and 2) poor scalability making it difficult to scale
to high dimensional control problems. To overcome these issues, an accelerated
DRL algorithm named PARS was developed and tailored for power system voltage
stability control via load shedding. PARS features high scalability and is easy
to tune with only five main hyperparameters. The method was tested on both the
IEEE 39-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems, and the latter is by far the largest
scale for such a study. Test results show that, compared to other methods
including model-predictive control (MPC) and proximal policy optimization(PPO)
methods, PARS shows better computational efficiency (faster convergence), more
robustness in learning, excellent scalability and generalization capability.

strategy to resolve this issue is to learn these parameters from data. While
mathematically appealing this strategy leads to a nested optimization problem

exact solutions of the lower-level problem, which is practically infeasible. In
this work we propose to solve these problems using inexact derivative-free
optimization algorithms which never require exact lower-level problem
solutions, but instead assume access to approximate solutions with controllable
accuracy, which is achievable in practice. We prove global convergence and a
worstcase complexity bound for our approach. We test our proposed framework on

tungsten nanotips under extreme conditions corresponding to a Keldysh parameter
$\gamma_K\approx10^{-4}$. Local peak THz fields up to 40~GV/m are achieved at
the apex of an illuminated nanotip, causing sub-cycle cold-field electron
emission and acceleration in the quasi-static field. By simultaneous
measurement of the electron bunch charge and energy distribution, we perform a
quantitative test of quasi-static Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling theory under field
conditions that completely suppress the tunnel barrier. Very high bunch charges
of $\sim10^6$ electrons/pulse are observed, reaching maximum energies of
3.5~keV after acceleration in the local field. The energy distribution and
emission current show good agreement with Fowler-Nordheim theory even in this
extreme field regime. Extending this model to the single-shot regime under
these conditions predicts peak electron distributions with a spectral purity of
$10^{-4}$. THz field-induced reshaping and sharpening of the nanotip is
observed, reducing the tip radius from 120~nm to 35~nm over roughly $10^9$ THz
shots. These results indicate THz-driven nanotips in the extreme field limit
are promising electron sources for ultrafast electron diffraction and
microscopy.

on a square lattice. Here, we consider the effect of nearest-neighbor
attractive interactions on the growing self-avoiding walk, and examine the

trapping length for weakly self-attractive walks. While it has been
controversial whether growing self-avoiding walks have the same asymptotic

this paper, we propose ContraGAN that considers relations between multiple
image embeddings in the same batch (data-to-data relations) as well as the

discriminator of ContraGAN discriminates the authenticity of given samples and
minimizes a contrastive objective to learn the relations between training

deceive the authenticity and have a low contrastive loss. The experimental
results show that ContraGAN outperforms state-of-the-art-models by 7.3% and
7.7% on Tiny ImageNet and ImageNet datasets, respectively. Besides, we

learns dynamics with higher accuracy and fewer samples than a variety of deep

using models which are often dynamic. Two central features of these dynamic
systems are parameters and unmodeled dynamics. This paper addresses the use of
a spectral lines-based approach for estimating parameters of the dynamic model
of an autonomous system. Existing literature has treated all unmodeled
components of the dynamic system as sub-Gaussian noise and proposed parameter
estimation using Gaussian noise-based exogenous signals. In contrast, we allow
the unmodeled part to have deterministic unmodeled dynamics, which are almost
always present in physical systems, in addition to sub-Gaussian noise. In
addition, we propose a deterministic construction of the exogenous signal in
order to carry out parameter estimation. We introduce a new tool kit which
employs the theory of spectral lines, retains the stochastic setting, and leads
to non-asymptotic bounds on the parameter estimation error. Unlike the existing
stochastic approach, these bounds are tunable through an optimal choice of the
spectrum of the exogenous signal leading to accurate parameter estimation. We
also show that this estimation is robust to unmodeled dynamics, a property that
is not assured by the existing approach. Finally, we show that under ideal
conditions with no unmodeled dynamics, the proposed approach can ensure a
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, matching existing literature. Experiments are
provided to support all theoretical derivations, which show that the spectral
lines-based approach outperforms the Gaussian noise-based method when unmodeled
dynamics are present, in terms of both parameter estimation error and Regret
obtained using the parameter estimates with a Linear Quadratic Regulator in
feedback.

alleviating the overestimation problem in DRL, where multi-step experiences are

expose the tradeoff between overestimation and underestimation that underlies

cardiac diseases thanks to its ability to present cardiovascular features in
excellent contrast. As compared to computed tomography (CT), MRI, however,
requires a long scan time, which inevitably induces motion artifacts and causes
patients' discomfort. Thus, there has been a strong clinical motivation to
develop techniques to reduce both the scan time and motion artifacts. Given its
successful applications in other medical imaging tasks such as MRI
super-resolution and CT metal artifact reduction, deep learning is a promising
approach for cardiac MRI motion artifact reduction. In this paper, we propose a
recurrent neural network to simultaneously extract both spatial and temporal
features from under-sampled, motion-blurred cine cardiac images for improved
image quality. The experimental results demonstrate substantially improved
image quality on two clinical test datasets. Also, our method enables
data-driven frame interpolation at an enhanced temporal resolution. Compared

ground-truth sources. Reliance on this synthetic training data is problematic
because good performance depends upon the degree of match between the training
data and real-world audio, especially in terms of the acoustic conditions and
distribution of sources. The acoustic properties can be challenging to
accurately simulate, and the distribution of sound types may be hard to
replicate. In this paper, we propose a completely unsupervised method, mixture
invariant training (MixIT), that requires only single-channel acoustic
mixtures. In MixIT, training examples are constructed by mixing together
existing mixtures, and the model separates them into a variable number of
latent sources, such that the separated sources can be remixed to approximate
the original mixtures. We show that MixIT can achieve competitive performance
compared to supervised methods on speech separation. Using MixIT in a
semi-supervised learning setting enables unsupervised domain adaptation and
learning from large amounts of real world data without ground-truth source

separation performance by incorporating reverberant mixtures, train a speech

fixed-length chromosomes may not be a good fit for optimizing deep learning
hyperparameters, because deep learning models have variable number of

the hyperparameters of a CNN to improve its performance. Experimental results
show that our algorithm can find good CNN hyperparameters efficiently. It is
clear from our experiments that if more time is spent on optimizing the

assessment are usually time-consuming. Therefore, in this work, a
semi-supervised deep learning method that detects slices with artifacts during

Results show that compared with supervised learning, the proposed method can
improve model accuracy by about 6\% and outperform other state-of-the-art

linear raw-RGB image state (i.e., raw sensor data) or (ii) a highly-processed
nonlinear image state (e.g., sRGB). There are many computer vision tasks that
work best with a linear image state, such as image deblurring and image
dehazing. Unfortunately, the vast majority of images are saved in the nonlinear
image state. Because of this, a number of methods have been proposed to
""unprocess"" nonlinear images back to a raw-RGB state. However, existing
unprocessing methods have a drawback because raw-RGB images are
sensor-specific. As a result, it is necessary to know which camera produced the
sRGB output and use a method or network tailored for that sensor to properly
unprocess it. This paper addresses this limitation by exploiting another camera
image state that is not available as an output, but it is available inside the
camera pipeline. In particular, cameras apply a colorimetric conversion step to
convert the raw-RGB image to a device-independent space based on the CIE XYZ
color space before they apply the nonlinear photo-finishing. Leveraging this
canonical image state, we propose a deep learning framework, CIE XYZ Net, that
can unprocess a nonlinear image back to the canonical CIE XYZ image. This image
can then be processed by any low-level computer vision operator and re-rendered
back to the nonlinear image. We demonstrate the usefulness of the CIE XYZ Net
on several low-level vision tasks and show significant gains that can be

resolution spectral data, the mass ratio of the binary components is found to

9\%$) and have a temperature difference about $T_2 - T_1 = -280\pm 20$ K. The
system is demonstrated to be W-subtype, which may be a common feature of K-type
contact binaries. The masses of the binary components were estimated to be
$M_1\sim 0.51$ M$_{sun}$ and $M_2\sim 0.90$ M$_{sun}$. The values are in good
agreement with that deduced from the parallax data of Gaia. The results suggest
that the primary component lacks luminosity compared with the zero main
sequence. The H$\alpha$ spectral line of the primary component is found to be
peculiar. Combining newly determined minimum light times with those collected
from literature, the orbital period of IL Cnc is studied. It is found that the

  Prediction with Navigation Data",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Traffic forecasting has recently attracted increasing interest due to the
popularity of online navigation services, ridesharing and smart city projects.
Owing to the non-stationary nature of road traffic, forecasting accuracy is
fundamentally limited by the lack of contextual information. To address this
issue, we propose the Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(H-STGCN), which is able to ""deduce"" future travel time by exploiting the data
of upcoming traffic volume. Specifically, we propose an algorithm to acquire
the upcoming traffic volume from an online navigation engine. Taking advantage
of the piecewise-linear flow-density relationship, a novel transformer
structure converts the upcoming volume into its equivalent in travel time. We
combine this signal with the commonly-utilized travel-time signal, and then
apply graph convolution to capture the spatial dependency. Particularly, we
construct a compound adjacency matrix which reflects the innate traffic
proximity. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets. The results
show that H-STGCN remarkably outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various
metrics, especially for the prediction of non-recurring congestion.

(e.g., walk, run, climb). Despite this, far more mechanistic understanding of
terrestrial locomotion has been on how to generate and stabilize around
near-steady-state movement in a single mode. We still know little about how
locomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain.
Consequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not
traverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex
3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that
an energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We
discovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled
through complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a
potential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins
separated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from
oscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one
basin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards
lower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of
near-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for
multi-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from
first principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of
multi-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help
understand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale
interactions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical
environment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large,
intractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor
transitions through the real world.

this paper, we present a new magneto-mechanical metamaterial that allows great

architecture of this new metamaterial employs an asymmetric joint design using
hard-magnetic soft active materials that permits two distinct actuation modes
(bending and folding) under opposite-direction magnetic fields. The subsequent
application of mechanical forces leads to the deformation mode branching where
the metamaterial architecture transforms into two distinctly different shapes,
which exhibit very different deformations and enable great tunability in
properties such as mechanical stiffness and acoustic bandgaps. Furthermore,
this metamaterial design can be incorporated with magnetic shape memory
polymers with global stiffness tunability, which further enables the global
shift of the acoustic behaviors. The combination of magnetic and mechanical
actuations, as well as shape memory effects, imbue unmatched tunable properties
to a new paradigm of metamaterials.

optimal configurations of $m$ small stationary circular absorbing traps that
minimize the average MFPT in near-disk and elliptical domains. For a general
class of near-disk domains, we illustrate through several specific examples how
simple, but yet highly accurate, numerical methods can be used to implement the

Neumann Green's function and its regular part for the ellipse, a numerical
approach based on our asymptotic theory is used to investigate how the spatial
distribution of the optimal trap locations changes as the aspect ratio of an
ellipse of fixed area is varied. The results from the hybrid theory for the
ellipse are compared with full PDE numerical results computed from the closest

optimal trap pattern for $m=2,\ldots,5$ identical traps is collinear along the
semi-major axis of the ellipse. For such essentially 1-D patterns, a

$\alpha_{0}$ and $-\alpha_{0}$. Recent experiments create cat states in a
microwave cavity field using superconducting circuits. As with degenerate
parametric oscillation (DPO) in an adiabatic and highly nonlinear limit, the
states are formed in a signal cavity mode via a two-photon dissipative process
induced by the down conversion of a pump field to generate pairs of signal
photons. The damping of the signal and the presence of thermal fluctuations
rapidly decoheres the state, and the effect on the dynamics is to either
destroy the possibility of a cat state, or else to sharply reduce the lifetime
and size of the cat-states that can be formed. In this paper, we study the
effect on both the DPO and microwave systems of a squeezed reservoir coupled to
the cavity. While the threshold nonlinearity is not altered, we show that the
use of squeezed states significantly lengthens the lifetime of the cat states.
This improves the feasibility of generating cat states of large amplitude and
with a greater degree of quantum macroscopic coherence, which is necessary for
many quantum technology applications. Using current experimental parameters for
the microwave set-up, which requires a modified Hamiltonian, we further
demonstrate how squeezed states enhance the quality of the cat states that
could be formed in this regime. Squeezing also combats the significant
decoherence due to thermal noise, which is relevant for microwave fields at
finite temperature. By modeling a thermal squeezed reservoir, we show that the
thermal decoherence of the dynamical cat states can be inhibited by a careful
control of the squeezing of the reservoir. To signify the quality of the cat
state, we consider different signatures including fringes and negativity, and
the $C_{l_{1}}$ measure of quantum coherence.

galaxies, including hydro-dynamic models from the EAGLE simulation. Our
correction is most effective for regularly-rotating systems, yet the kinematic
parameters of all galaxies -- fast, slow and irregularly rotating systems --
are recovered successfully. We find that $\lambda_R$ is more easily corrected

limited labeled instances, rendering a long-tail node class distribution.
Existing node classification algorithms are unequipped to handle the
\textit{few-shot} node classes. As a remedy, few-shot learning has attracted a
surge of attention in the research community. Yet, few-shot node classification
remains a challenging problem as we need to address the following questions:
(i) How to extract meta-knowledge from an attributed network for few-shot node
classification? (ii) How to identify the informativeness of each labeled
instance for building a robust and effective model? To answer these questions,
in this paper, we propose a graph meta-learning framework -- Graph Prototypical

tasks to mimic the real test environment, GPN is able to perform
\textit{meta-learning} on an attributed network and derive a highly

use of a ``soft'' (i.e. not infinitely sharp) halo boundary, and differences in
the one halo term contributions to $\xi_{\rm hm}$ and $\xi_{\rm mm}$. These
features naturally lead us to a redefinition of the halo boundary that lies at
the ``by eye'' transition radius from the one--halo to the two--halo term in
the halo--mass correlation function. When adopting our proposed definition, our
model succeeds in describing the halo--mass correlation function with $\approx
2\%$ residuals over the radial range $0.1\ h^{-1}{\rm Mpc} < r < 80\ h^{-1}{\rm
Mpc}$, and for halo masses in the range $10^{13}\ h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot} < M <

splashback radius by a roughly constant multiplicative factor. Taking the
87-percentile as reference we find $r_{\rm t}/R_{\rm sp} \approx 1.3$.
Surprisingly, our proposed definition results in halo abundances that are well
described by the Press-Schechter mass function with $\delta_{\rm sc}=1.449\pm
0.004$. The clustering bias parameter is offset from the standard

evidence strongly suggest that many globular clusters host a black hole (BH)
population in their centers. This stands in contrast to the prior long-standing
belief that a BH subcluster would evaporate after undergoing core collapse and
decoupling from the cluster. In this work, we propose that the inhomogeneous
Brownian motion generated by fluctuations of the stellar gravitational field
may act as a mechanism adding a stabilizing pressure to a BH population. We
argue that the diffusion equation for Brownian motion in an inhomogeneous
medium with spatially varying diffusion coefficient and temperature, which was
first discovered by Van Kampen, also applies to self-gravitating systems.
Applying the stationary phase space probability distribution to a single BH
immersed in a Plummer globular cluster, we infer that it may wander as far as
$\sim 0.05,\,0.1,\,0.5{\rm pc}$ for a mass of $m_{\rm b} \sim
10^3,\,10^2,\,10{\rm M}_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the
fluctuations of a fixed stellar mean gravitational field are sufficient to
stabilize a BH population above the Spitzer instability threshold.
Nevertheless, we identify an instability whose onset depends on the Spitzer
parameter, $S = (M_{\rm b}/M_\star) (m_{\rm b}/m_\star)^{3/2} ,$ and parameter
$B = \rho_{\rm b}(0) (4\pi r_c^3/M_b)(m_\star/m_{\rm b})^{3/2} $, where
$\rho_{\rm b}(0)$ is the Brownian population central density. For a Plummer
sphere, the instability occurs at $(B,S) = (140,0.25)$. For $B > 140,$ we get
very cuspy BH subcluster profiles that are unstable with regard to the support
of fluctuations alone. For $S > 0.25,$ there is no evidence of any stationary
states for the BH population based on the inhomogeneous diffusion equation.

suppresses Km by approximately 30%, and the suppression can be further enhanced
to approximately 50% with the infrared opacifier. The magnitude of suppression
was found to sensitively depend on the length of terminal chain. The magnitude
is also related to the number of reactive silanol groups in the chemical
structure, where the surface modification with fluorocarbon gives the largest
suppression. The surface hydrophobization merits thermal insulation through
significant suppression of the TBC, presumably by reducing the water molecules
that otherwise would serve as heat conduction channels at the interface. On the
other hand, when the chain length is long, the suppression is counteracted by
the enhanced phonon transmission through the silane coupling molecules that
grows with the chain length. This is supported by the analytical model and
present simulation results, leading to predict the optimal chemical structure
for better thermal insulation.

curing, mitigating, or controlling it. However, when it comes to controlling,
there are still few studies focused on under-reporting estimates. It is
believed that under-reporting is a relevant factor in determining the actual
mortality rate and, if not considered, can cause significant misinformation.
Therefore, the objective of this work is to estimate the under-reporting of
cases and deaths of COVID-19 in Brazilian states using data from the Infogripe
on notification of Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The methodology
is based on the concepts of inertia and the use of event detection techniques
to study the time series of hospitalized SARI cases. The estimate of real cases
of the disease, called novelty, is calculated by comparing the difference in
SARI cases in 2020 (after COVID-19) with the total expected cases in recent
years (2016 to 2019) derived from a seasonal exponential moving average. The
results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and
that there are no general patterns for states in the same region in Brazil.

  In this work, we prove that hypergraph symmetries in the adjacency matrix

quantum speedups.
  In contrast, in the adjacency list model for bounded-degree graphs (where
graph symmetry is manifested differently), we exhibit a property testing

validate the same model leading to a non-generalization of radiomic results. In
this study, the image biomarker standardization initiative (IBSI) established
phantom and benchmark values were used to compare the variation of the radiomic
features while using 6 publicly available software programs and 1 in-house
radiomics pipeline. All IBSI-standardized features (11 classes, 173 in total)
were extracted. The relative differences between the extracted feature values
from the different software and the IBSI benchmark values were calculated to
measure the inter-software agreement. To better understand the variations,
features are further grouped into 3 categories according to their properties:
1) morphology, 2) statistic/histogram and 3)texture features. While a good
agreement was observed for a majority of radiomics features across the various
programs, relatively poor agreement was observed for morphology features.
Significant differences were also found in programs that use different gray
level discretization approaches. Since these programs do not include all IBSI
features, the level of quantitative assessment for each category was analyzed
using Venn and the UpSet diagrams and also quantified using two ad hoc metrics.
Morphology features earns lowest scores for both metrics, indicating that
morphological features are not consistently evaluated among software programs.
We conclude that radiomic features calculated using different software programs
may not be identical and reliable. Further studies are needed to standardize
the workflow of radiomic feature extraction.

a logistic regression model, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, and a

using the real-world NGSIM dataset. To properly label the trajectory data, this
study proposes a new time-window labeling scheme by adding a time gap between
positive and negative samples. Two approaches are also proposed to address the
unstable prediction issue, where the aggressive approach propagates each
positive prediction for certain seconds, while the conservative approach adopts
a roll-window average to smooth the prediction. Evaluation results show that

classifier-induced discrepancies. Nevertheless, a common feature space cannot
always be learned via this direct feature alignment especially when a large
domain gap exists. To solve this problem, we introduce a Gaussian-guided latent
alignment approach to align the latent feature distributions of the two domains

distributions over the samples from the two domains will be constructed on a
common feature space, i.e., the space of the prior, which promotes better
feature alignment. To effectively align the target latent distribution with

automatically synthesize a large-scale person re-identification dataset
following a set-up similar to real surveillance but with virtual environments,
and then use the synthesized person images to train a generalizable person

number of random UV texture maps and use them to create different 3D clothing
models. Then, an automatic code is developed to randomly generate various
different 3D characters with diverse clothes, races and attributes. Next, we
simulate a number of different virtual environments using Unity3D, with
customized camera networks similar to real surveillance systems, and import
multiple 3D characters at the same time, with various movements and
interactions along different paths through the camera networks. As a result, we
obtain a virtual dataset, called RandPerson, with 1,801,816 person images of
8,000 identities. By training person re-identification models on these

scattering of spin half moments when present at weak superconducting regions

improving the generalization of deep neural networks, they should be used with
caution for safety-critical applications, such as clinical risk prediction.
This is because even if they achieve improved task-average performance, they
may still yield degraded performance on individual tasks, which may be critical
(e.g., prediction of mortality risk). Existing asymmetric multi-task learning
methods tackle this negative transfer problem by performing knowledge transfer
from tasks with low loss to tasks with high loss. However, using loss as a
measure of reliability is risky since it could be a result of overfitting. In
the case of time-series prediction tasks, knowledge learned for one task (e.g.,
predicting the sepsis onset) at a specific timestep may be useful for learning
another task (e.g., prediction of mortality) at a later timestep, but lack of
loss at each timestep makes it difficult to measure the reliability at each
timestep. To capture such dynamically changing asymmetric relationships between
tasks in time-series data, we propose a novel temporal asymmetric multi-task
learning model that performs knowledge transfer from certain tasks/timesteps to
relevant uncertain tasks, based on feature-level uncertainty. We validate our
model on multiple clinical risk prediction tasks against various deep learning
models for time-series prediction, which our model significantly outperforms,
without any sign of negative transfer. Further qualitative analysis of learned
knowledge graphs by clinicians shows that they are helpful in analyzing the
predictions of the model. Our final code is available at

for high-dimensional regression models. However, simulations indicate that for
generalized linear models (GLMs), de-biased lasso inadequately removes biases
and yields unreliable confidence intervals. This motivates us to scrutinize the
application of de-biased lasso in high-dimensional GLMs. When $p >n$, we detect
that a key sparsity condition on the inverse information matrix generally does
not hold in a GLM setting, which likely explains the subpar performance of
de-biased lasso. Even in a less challenging ""large $n$, diverging $p$""
scenario, we find that de-biased lasso and the maximum likelihood method often
yield confidence intervals with unsatisfactory coverage probabilities. In this
scenario, we examine an alternative approach for further bias correction by
directly inverting the Hessian matrix without imposing the matrix sparsity
assumption. We establish the asymptotic distributions of any linear
combinations of the resulting estimates, which lay the theoretical groundwork
for drawing inference. Simulations show that this refined de-biased estimator
performs well in removing biases and yields an honest confidence interval
coverage. We illustrate the method by analyzing a prospective hospital-based
Boston Lung Cancer Study, a large scale epidemiology cohort investigating the
joint effects of genetic variants on lung cancer risk.

for visual tasks, depends in crucial ways on the receptive field of neurons.
The receptive field itself depends on the interplay between several
architectural aspects, including sparsity, pooling, and activation functions.
In recent literature there are several ad hoc proposals trying to make
receptive fields more flexible and adaptive to data. For instance, different
parameterizations of convolutional and pooling layers have been proposed to
increase their adaptivity. In this paper, we propose the novel theoretical
framework of density-embedded layers, generalizing the transformation
represented by a neuron. Specifically, the affine transformation applied on the
input is replaced by a scalar product of the input, suitably represented as a
piecewise constant function, with a density function associated with the
neuron. This density is shown to describe directly the receptive field of the
neuron. Crucially, by suitably representing such a density as a linear
combination of a parametric family of functions, we can efficiently train the
densities by means of any automatic differentiation system, making it adaptable
to the problem at hand, and computationally efficient to evaluate. This
framework captures and generalizes recent methods, allowing a fine tuning of
the receptive field. In the paper, we define some novel layers and we
experimentally validate them on the classic MNIST dataset.

assets due to their critical roles in all aspects of applications. With the
trend of privatization deployment of DNN models, the data leakage of the DNN
models is becoming increasingly serious and widespread. All existing
model-extraction attacks can only leak parts of targeted DNN models with low
accuracy or high overhead. In this paper, we first identify a new attack
surface -- unencrypted PCIe traffic, to leak DNN models. Based on this new
attack surface, we propose a novel model-extraction attack, namely Hermes
Attack, which is the first attack to fully steal the whole victim DNN model.
The stolen DNN models have the same hyper-parameters, parameters, and
semantically identical architecture as the original ones. It is challenging due
to the closed-source CUDA runtime, driver, and GPU internals, as well as the
undocumented data structures and the loss of some critical semantics in the
PCIe traffic. Additionally, there are millions of PCIe packets with numerous
noises and chaos orders. Our Hermes Attack addresses these issues by huge
reverse engineering efforts and reliable semantic reconstruction, as well as
skillful packet selection and order correction. We implement a prototype of the
Hermes Attack, and evaluate two sequential DNN models (i.e., MINIST and VGG)
and one consequential DNN model (i.e., ResNet) on three NVIDIA GPU platforms,
i.e., NVIDIA Geforce GT 730, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 Ti, and NVIDIA Geforce RTX
2080 Ti. The evaluation results indicate that our scheme is able to efficiently
and completely reconstruct ALL of them with making inferences on any one image.
Evaluated with Cifar10 test dataset that contains 10,000 images, the experiment
results show that the stolen models have the same inference accuracy as the
original ones (i.e., lossless inference accuracy).

underwater, we propose statistical models for the generation, size, and
horizontal distribution of each air bubble. Second, we mathematically derive
the obstruction caused by the shadow of each bubble as it passes over the beam
area. We then compute the combined obstruction of all generated air bubbles to
determine the total obstructed power, which is a random variable due to the
randomness of bubble behavior. Next, we find the first and second moments of
the total obstructed power to model the statistical distribution of the
obstructed received power by using the method of moments, which shows that the
Weibull distribution suitably matches the simulation data. We also estimate the
shape and scale parameters by using two derived moments. Furthermore, we also
construct a statistical model of the received power with complete blockage in
the presence of air bubbles and we derive the distribution of the composite
channel model combining the proposed bubble-obstruction model with a
Gamma-Gamma turbulence model. Finally, we obtain and verify the analytic forms

enough in terms of attack success rate nor efficient enough in terms of query
complexity under the widely used $L_\infty$ norm threat model. In this paper,
we present the Ray Searching attack (RayS), which greatly improves the
hard-label attack effectiveness as well as efficiency. Unlike previous works,
we reformulate the continuous problem of finding the closest decision boundary
into a discrete problem that does not require any zeroth-order gradient
estimation. In the meantime, all unnecessary searches are eliminated via a fast
check step. This significantly reduces the number of queries needed for our
hard-label attack. Moreover, interestingly, we found that the proposed RayS
attack can also be used as a sanity check for possible ""falsely robust"" models.
On several recently proposed defenses that claim to achieve the
state-of-the-art robust accuracy, our attack method demonstrates that the
current white-box/black-box attacks could still give a false sense of security
and the robust accuracy drop between the most popular PGD attack and RayS

beamline for soft-X-ray resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) located at
Taiwan Photon Source. This beamline adopts an optical design that uses an
active grating monochromator (AGM) and an active grating spectrometer (AGS) to
implement the energy compensation principle of grating dispersion. Active
gratings are utilized to diminish defocus, coma and higher-order aberrations as
well as to decrease the slope errors caused by thermal deformation and optical
polishing. The AGS is mounted on a rotatable granite platform to enable
momentum-resolved RIXS measurements with scattering angle over a wide range.
Several high-precision instruments developed in house for this beamline are
briefly described. The best energy resolution obtained from this AGM-AGS
beamline was 12.4 meV at 530 eV, achieving a resolving power 42,000, while the
bandwidth of the incident soft X-rays was kept at 0.5 eV. To demonstrate the
scientific impacts of high-resolution RIXS, we present an example of
momentum-resolved RIXS measurements on a high-temperature superconducting
cuprate, La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$. The measurements reveal the A$_{1g}$ apical
oxygen phonons in superconducting cuprates, opening a new opportunity to
investigate the coupling between these phonons and charge density waves.

achieving optimal performances on the target dataset while with poor
generalization for other datasets or focus on handling the cross-domain
generalization by suppressing the domain sensitive features which results in a
significant sacrifice on the performance. To tackle these problems, we propose
PCW-Net, a Pyramid Combination and Warping cost volume-based network to achieve
good performance on both cross-domain generalization and stereo matching
accuracy on various benchmarks. In particular, our PCW-Net is designed for two
purposes. First, we construct combination volumes on the upper levels of the
pyramid and develop a cost volume fusion module to integrate them for initial
disparity estimation. Multi-scale receptive fields can be covered by fusing
multi-scale combination volumes, thus, domain-invariant features can be
extracted. Second, we construct the warping volume at the last level of the
pyramid for disparity refinement. The proposed warping volume can narrow down
the residue searching range from the initial disparity searching range to a
fine-grained one, which can dramatically alleviate the difficulty of the
network to find the correct residue in an unconstrained residue searching
space. When training on synthetic datasets and generalizing to unseen real
datasets, our method shows strong cross-domain generalization and outperforms
existing state-of-the-arts with a large margin. After fine-tuning on the real
datasets, our method ranks first on KITTI 2012, second on KITTI 2015, and first
on the Argoverse among all published methods as of 7, March 2022. The code will

survey with Hubble (CLASH) survey (K-CLASH) to search for evidence of quenching
in massive galaxy clusters at redshifts $0.3<z<0.6$. We first construct
mass-matched samples of exclusively star-forming cluster and field galaxies,
then investigate the spatial extent of their H$\alpha$ emission and study their
interstellar medium conditions using emission line ratios. The average ratio of
H$\alpha$ half-light radius to optical half-light radius
($r_{\rm{e},\rm{H}\alpha}/r_{\rm{e},R_c}$) for all galaxies is $1.14\pm0.06$,
showing that star formation is taking place throughout stellar discs at these
redshifts. However, on average, cluster galaxies have a smaller
$r_{\rm{e},\rm{H}\alpha}/r_{\rm{e},R_c}$ ratio than field galaxies: $\langle
r_{\rm{e},\rm{H}\alpha}/r_{\rm{e},R_c}\rangle = 0.96\pm0.09$ compared to
$1.22\pm0.08$ (smaller at a 98\% credibility level). These values are
uncorrected for the wavelength difference between H$\alpha$ emission and
$R_c$-band stellar light, but implementing such a correction only reinforces
our results. We also show that whilst the cluster and field samples follow
indistinguishable mass-metallicity (MZ) relations, the residuals around the MZ
relation of cluster members correlate with cluster-centric distance; galaxies
residing closer to the cluster centre tend to have enhanced metallicities
(significant at the 2.6$\sigma$ level). Finally, in contrast to previous
studies, we find no significant differences in electron number density between
the cluster and field galaxies. We use simple chemical evolution models to
conclude that the effects of disc strangulation and ram-pressure stripping can
quantitatively explain our observations.

ordering of fluid layer around the nanoparticle (nanolayer) and thermal
resistance at the interface of solid-fluid in the enhancement of thermal
conductivity of Al2O3 - CO2 nanofluid. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations have been used to study the thermal interfacial resistance by
transient non-equilibrium heat technique and nanolayer formed between Al2O3
nanoparticle (np) and surrounded CO2 molecules in the gaseous and supercritical
phase. The nanoparticle diameter (dNP) is varied between 2 and 5 nm to
investigate the size effect on thermal interfacial resistance (TIR) and thermal
conductivity of nanofluid and the results indicate that the TIR for larger
diameters is relatively high in both the phases. The study of the effect of
surface wettability and temperature on TIR reveals that the resistance
decreases with increase in interaction strength and temperature, but is
entirely independent at higher temperatures, in both gaseous and supercritical
nanofluid. A density distribution study of the nanolayer and the monolayer
around the nanoparticle revealed that the latter is more ordered in smaller
diameter with less thermal resistance. However, nanolayer study reveals that
the nanoparticle with bigger diameters are more suitable for the
cooling/heating purpose, as the system with larger diameters has higher thermal

determining the effective thermal conductivity of the nanofluid, while the
influence of TIR appears negligible compared to the nanolayer.

incorporating machine learning models in real-world decision-making systems
where the confidence of decisions are equally important as the decisions
themselves. In recent years, there is a surge of research on neural network
calibration and the majority of the works can be categorized into post-hoc
calibration methods, defined as methods that learn an additional function to
calibrate an already trained base network. In this work, we intend to
understand the post-hoc calibration methods from a theoretical point of view.
Especially, it is known that minimizing Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) will lead
to a calibrated network on the training set if the global optimum is attained
(Bishop, 1994). Nevertheless, it is not clear learning an additional function
in a post-hoc manner would lead to calibration in the theoretical sense. To
this end, we prove that even though the base network ($f$) does not lead to the
global optimum of NLL, by adding additional layers ($g$) and minimizing NLL by
optimizing the parameters of $g$ one can obtain a calibrated network $g \circ
f$. This not only provides a less stringent condition to obtain a calibrated
network but also provides a theoretical justification of post-hoc calibration
methods. Our experiments on various image classification benchmarks confirm the
theory.

  Clustering","Accepted by ECML-PKDD 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Few-shot classification tends to struggle when it needs to adapt to diverse
domains. Due to the non-overlapping label space between domains, the
performance of conventional domain adaptation is limited. Previous work tackles
the problem in a transductive manner, by assuming access to the full set of
test data, which is too restrictive for many real-world applications. In this
paper, we set out to tackle this issue by introducing a inductive framework,
DaFeC, to improve Domain adaptation performance for Few-shot classification via
Clustering. We first build a representation extractor to derive features for
unlabeled data from the target domain (no test data is necessary) and then
group them with a cluster miner. The generated pseudo-labeled data and the
labeled source-domain data are used as supervision to update the parameters of
the few-shot classifier. In order to derive high-quality pseudo labels, we
propose a Clustering Promotion Mechanism, to learn better features for the
target domain via Similarity Entropy Minimization and Adversarial Distribution
Alignment, which are combined with a Cosine Annealing Strategy. Experiments are
performed on the FewRel 2.0 dataset. Our approach outperforms previous work
with absolute gains (in classification accuracy) of 4.95%, 9.55%, 3.99% and
11.62%, respectively, under four few-shot settings.

have to shuffle partial matching results during the distributed multiway join.
The partial matching results may be much larger than the data graph itself. To
overcome the drawback, we develop the Batch-BENU framework (B-BENU) for
distributed subgraph enumeration. B-BENU executes a group of local search tasks
in parallel. Each task enumerates subgraphs around a vertex in the data graph,
guided by a backtracking-based execution plan. B-BENU does not shuffle any
partial matching result. Instead, it stores the data graph in a distributed
database. Each task queries adjacency sets of the data graph on demand. To
support dynamic data graphs, we propose the concept of incremental pattern
graphs and turn continuous subgraph enumeration into enumerating incremental
pattern graphs at each time step. We develop the Streaming-BENU framework
(S-BENU) to enumerate their matches efficiently. We implement B-BENU and S-BENU
with the local database cache and the task splitting techniques. The extensive
experiments show that B-BENU and S-BENU can scale to big data graphs and
complex pattern graphs. They outperform the state-of-the-art methods by up to

$(p-1)/t$, where $t$ is the smallest prime divisor of $(p-1)/2$ if $p$ is not a

emission spectra is presented. The aim of the modelling framework is to provide
a tool able to link observations to physical models of exoplanet atmospheres.
Methods: The modelling philosophy chosen in this paper is to use physical and
chemical models to constrain certain parameters while keeping free the parts
where our physical understanding is still more limited. This approach, in
between full physical modelling and full parameterisation, allows us to use the
processes we understand well and parameterise those less understood. A Bayesian
retrieval framework is implemented and applied to the transit spectra of a set
of 10 hot Jupiters. The code contains chemistry and cloud formation and has the
option for self consistent temperature structure computations. Results: The
code presented is fast and flexible enough to be used for retrieval and for
target list simulations for e.g. JWST or the ESA Ariel missions. We present
results for the retrieval of elemental abundance ratios using the physical
retrieval framework and compare this to results obtained using a parameterised
retrieval setup. Conclusions: We conclude that for most of the targets
considered the current dataset is not constraining enough to reliably pin down
the elemental abundance ratios. We find no significant correlations between
different physical parameters. We confirm that planets in our sample with a
strong slope in the optical transmission spectrum are the planets where we find
cloud formation to be most active. Finally, we conclude that with ARCiS we have
a computationally efficient tool to analyse exoplanet observations in the
context of physical and chemical models.

which is underlying the observed data, changes over time; as a consequence
machine learning models may become inaccurate and need adjustment. While there
do exist methods to detect concept drift or to adjust models in the presence of
observed drift, the question of explaining drift has hardly been considered so
far. This problem is of importance, since it enables an inspection of the most
prominent features where drift manifests itself; hence it enables human
understanding of the necessity of change and it increases acceptance of
life-long learning models. In this paper we present a novel technology, which
characterizes concept drift in terms of the characteristic change of spatial
features represented by typical examples based on counterfactual explanations.
We establish a formal definition of this problem, derive an efficient
algorithmic solution based on counterfactual explanations, and demonstrate its

spectrum reflecting from a disk close to the innermost stable circular orbit.
We studied that model as well as a number of other single-Comptonization models
(yielding similarly low inner radii), but found they violate a number of basic
physical constraints, e.g., their compactness is much above the maximum allowed
by pair equilibrium. We also studied the contemporaneous 0.55--6 keV spectrum
from the Swift/XRT and found it well fitted by an absorbed power law and a disk
blackbody with the innermost temperature of 0.1 keV. The normalization of the
disk blackbody corresponds to an inner radius of $\gtrsim$20 gravitational
radii and its temperature, to irradiation of the truncated disk by a hot inner
flow. We have also developed a Comptonization/reflection model including the
disk irradiation and intrinsic dissipation, but found that it does not yield
any satisfactory fits. On the other hand, we found that the $\leq$10 keV band
from RXTE is much better fitted by a reflection from a disk with the inner
radius $\gtrsim$100 gravitational radii, which model then underpredicts the
spectrum at $>$10 keV by $<$10%. We argue that the most plausible explanation
of the above results is inhomogeneity of the source, with the local spectra
hardening with the decreasing radius. Our results support the presence of a

score-based sparse targeted and untargeted attacks in the black-box setting.
Sparse-RS does not rely on substitute models and achieves state-of-the-art
success rate and query efficiency for multiple sparse attack models:
$l_0$-bounded perturbations, adversarial patches, and adversarial frames. The
$l_0$-version of untargeted Sparse-RS outperforms all black-box and even all
white-box attacks for different models on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet.
Moreover, our untargeted Sparse-RS achieves very high success rates even for
the challenging settings of $20\times20$ adversarial patches and $2$-pixel wide
adversarial frames for $224\times224$ images. Finally, we show that Sparse-RS
can be applied to generate targeted universal adversarial patches where it
significantly outperforms the existing approaches. The code of our framework is
available at https://github.com/fra31/sparse-rs.

emanating from our Sun, is an important component of space weather research.
The ambient solar wind flows in interplanetary space determine how solar storms
evolve through the heliosphere before reaching Earth, and especially during
solar minimum are themselves a driver of activity in the Earth's magnetic
field. Accurately forecasting the ambient solar wind flow is therefore
imperative to space weather awareness. Here we present a machine learning
approach in which solutions from magnetic models of the solar corona are used
to output the solar wind conditions near the Earth. The results are compared to
observations and existing models in a comprehensive validation analysis, and
the new model outperforms existing models in almost all measures. In addition,
this approach offers a new perspective to discuss the role of different input
data to ambient solar wind modeling, and what this tells us about the
underlying physical processes. The final model discussed here represents an
extremely fast, well-validated and open-source approach to the forecasting of
ambient solar wind at Earth.

regarding compute time, so a faster, analytic solution to the plane-cube

an analytic solution for all intersection cases and compare it to the one
previous solution from Scardovelli and Zaleski (Ruben Scardovelli and Stephane

micro-optimize to reduce arithmetic operations and branching. We then extend
our comparison regarding compute time and accuracy to include two different
iterative solutions as well. We find that the best choice depends on the
employed hardware platform: on the CPU, Newton-Raphson is fastest with
vectorization while analytic solutions perform better without. The reason for
this is that vectorization instruction sets do not include trigonometric

our optimized version of the analytic SZ solution. We finally provide details

Ruddlesden-Popper-type crystal structure are extraordinarily dependent on
temperature and chemical substitution. By introducing Al$^{3+}$ atoms ($x$)
randomly at the Ni-sites, the average oxidation state for the two
non-equivalent Ni-cations is tuned and adopt values below the average of +2.67
in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. La$_4$Ni$_{3-x}$Al$_x$O$_{10}$ is a solid solution for
$x=0.00$ to 1.00, and are prepared by the citric acid method. The samples adopt
a slightly distorted monoclinic structure (P21/a), evidenced by peak broadening
of the (117) reflection. We report on a remarkable effect on the electronic
properties induced by tiny amounts of homogeneously distributed Al-cations,
with clear correspondence between resistivity, magnetization, diffraction, and
DFT data. DFT shows that electronically there is no significant difference
between the non-equivalent Ni atoms and no tendency towards any
Ni$^{3+}$/Ni$^{2+}$ charge ordering. The electron doping via Al-substitution
has a profound effect on electric and magnetic properties. The resistivity
changes from metallic to semiconducting with increasing band-gap at higher
Al-levels, consistent with results from DFT. The metal-to-metal transition
reported for La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, which is often interpreted as a charge
density wave, is maintained until $x = 0.15$ Al-level. However, the temperature
characteristics of the resistivity change already at very low Al-levels (below
0.03). A coupling of the metal-to-metal transition to the lattice is evidenced
by an anomaly in the unit cell dimensions. No long-range magnetic order is
detected by powder neutron diffraction. The introduction of the non-magnetic
Al$^{3+}$ changes the Ni$^{3+}$/Ni$^{2+}$ ratio and is likely to block
double-exchange pathways by means of -Ni-O-Al-O-Ni- fragments into the network
of corner shared octahedra with the emergence of possible short-range order in
ferromagnetic like islands.

PRIPEL takes a fundamentally different angle and ensures privacy on the level
of individual cases instead of the complete log. This way, contextual

parameters are combined with evolutionary tracks to derive reliable and
accurate period-age, and the first theoretical period-age-color relations in
the Gaia bands for a solar chemical abundance pattern ($Z$=$0.02$, $Y$=$0.28$).
The adopted theoretical framework takes into account possible variations in the
mass-luminosity relation for the core helium-burning stage as due to changes in
the core convective overshooting and/or mass loss efficiency, as well as the
impact on the instability strip boundaries due to different assumptions for
superadiabatic convection efficiency. The inferred period-age and
period-age-color relations are applied to a selected sample of both fundamental
and first overtone Gaia Cepheids, and individual ages for the various adopted
theoretical scenarios are derived. The retrieved age distributions confirm that
a variation in the efficiency of superadiabatic convection in the pulsational
model computations has a negligible effect, whereas a brighter Mass-Luminosity
relation, as produced by mild overshooting, rotation or mass loss, implies
significantly older age predictions. Moreover, older Cepheids are found at
larger Galactocentric distances, while first overtone Cepheids are found to be
systematically older than the fundamental ones. The comparison with independent
age distribution analysis in literature supports the predictive capability of

2-3 keV band as reference, photons at all energies show a hard lag, increasing
with the distance from the reference band. The behaviour below 2 keV has never
been observed before, due to the higher energy bandpass of previous timing
instruments. The energy spectrum can be fitted with a standard model for this
state, consisting of a thin disc component and a harder power law, plus an
emission line between 6 and 7 keV. We discuss the results, concentrating on the
phase lags, and show that they can be interpreted within a Comptonization
model.

real-world data is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present the
non-parametric Spatially Constrained Local Prior (SCLP) for scene parsing on
realistic data. For a given query image, the non-parametric SCLP is learnt by
first retrieving a subset of most similar training images to the query image
and then collecting prior information about object co-occurrence statistics
between spatial image blocks and between adjacent superpixels from the
retrieved subset. The SCLP is powerful in capturing both long- and short-range
context about inter-object correlations in the query image and can be
effectively integrated with traditional visual features to refine the
classification results. Our experiments on the SIFT Flow and PASCAL-Context
benchmark datasets show that the non-parametric SCLP used in conjunction with
superpixel-level visual features achieves one of the top performance compared
with state-of-the-art approaches.

the vertices of $\Pbp$ (vertices with pure infinite bifurcations). We also give
some procedures to construct invariant ideals from previous known invariant
ideals. One of these procedures involves topology, so we introduce the $\tops$
topology and relate it to annihilators in the algebraic counterpart of the
work. To be more explicit: if $H$ is a hereditary saturated subset of vertices
providing an invariant ideal, its exterior $\ext(H)$ in the $\tops$ topology of
$E^0$ generates a new invariant ideal. The other constructor of invariant
ideals is more categorical in nature. Some hereditary sets can be seen as
functors from graphs to sets (for instance $\Pl$, etc). Thus a second method
emerges from the possibility of applying the induced functor to the quotient
graph. The easiest example is the known socle chain $\soc^{(1)}(\

We generalize this idea to any hereditary and saturated invariant functor.

the sightlines are dominated by warm or cold clouds. We found that CN is
detected in all cold (CH/CH$^+ >1$) clouds, but is frequently absent in warm
clouds. We inspected the WISE ($3-22\, \mu$m) observed emission morphology

applied the interstellar Ca II distance scale, and compared these two distance
estimates with GAIA parallaxes. These distance estimates scatter by 40%. By
comparing spectral type-luminosity distances with those of GAIA, we detected a
hidden dust component that amounts to a few mag of extinction for eight

the observation that this property can vary for different parts of the data

  Most popular methods for estimating the local intrinsic dimensionality are

we introduce an orthogonal concept, which does not use any distances: we use
the distribution of angles between neighbor points. We derive the theoretical
distribution of angles and use this to construct an estimator for intrinsic
dimensionality.
  Experimentally, we verify that this measure behaves similarly, but
complementarily, to existing measures of intrinsic dimensionality. By

influenced much subsequent research and commercial products. The key
contribution of BIRCH is the Clustering Feature tree (CF-Tree), which is a
compressed representation of the input data. As new data arrives, the tree is
eventually rebuilt to increase the compression. Afterward, the leaves of the
tree are used for clustering. Because of the data compression, this method is
very scalable. The idea has been adopted for example for k-means, data stream,
and density-based clustering.
  Clustering features used by BIRCH are simple summary statistics that can
easily be updated with new data: the number of points, the linear sums, and the
sum of squared values. Unfortunately, how the sum of squares is then used in
BIRCH is prone to catastrophic cancellation.
  We introduce a replacement cluster feature that does not have this numeric
problem, that is not much more expensive to maintain, and which makes many
computations simpler and hence more efficient. These cluster features can also
easily be used in other work derived from BIRCH, such as algorithms for
streaming data. In the experiments, we demonstrate the numerical problem and

the uncertainties on inflationary parameters such as $A_s$ and $n_s$ by about a

estimate certain properties of large data. For example, a CountMin sketch
approximates the frequencies at which elements occur in a data stream, and a
batched counter counts events in batches. This paper focuses on the correctness
of concurrent implementations of such objects. Specifically, we consider
quantitative objects, whose return values are from a totally ordered domain,
with an emphasis on $(e,d)$-bounded objects that estimate a quantity with an
error of at most $e$ with probability at least $1 - d$.
  The de facto correctness criterion for concurrent objects is linearizability.
Under linearizability, when a read overlaps an update, it must return the
object's value either before the update or after it. Consider, for example, a
single batched increment operation that counts three new events, bumping a
batched counter's value from $7$ to $10$. In a linearizable implementation of
the counter, an overlapping read must return one of these. We observe, however,
that in typical use cases, any intermediate value would also be acceptable. To
capture this degree of freedom, we propose Intermediate Value Linearizability
(IVL), a new correctness criterion that relaxes linearizability to allow
returning intermediate values, for instance $8$ in the example above. Roughly
speaking, IVL allows reads to return any value that is bounded between two
return values that are legal under linearizability. A key feature of IVL is
that concurrent IVL implementations of $(e,d)$-bounded objects remain
$(e,d)$-bounded. To illustrate the power of this result, we give a
straightforward and efficient concurrent implementation of an $(e, d)$-bounded
CountMin sketch, which is IVL (albeit not linearizable). Finally, we show that
IVL allows for inherently cheaper implementations than linearizable ones.

interaction between flagellated microswimmers. Various factors, including
inertia, sheet elasticity, and fluid viscoelasticity, have been suggested to
facilitate the synchronization of two sheets; however, the importance of
different contributions to this process still remains unclear. We perform a
systematic investigation of competing effects of inertia, sheet elasticity, and
fluid viscoelasticity on the synchronization of two sheets. Characteristic time
$\tau^\mathrm{s}$ for the synchronization caused by inertial effects is
inversely proportional to sheet Reynolds number $\mathrm{Re}$, such that
$\tau^\mathrm{s} \omega \propto \mathrm{Re}^{-1}$ with $\omega$ being the wave
frequency. Synchronization toward stable in-phase or opposite-phase
configuration of two sheets is determined by the competition of inertial
effects, sheet elasticity, fluid compressibility and viscoelasticity.
Interestingly, fluid viscoelasticity results in strong synchronization forces
for large beating amplitudes and Deborah numbers $\mathrm{De} > 1$, which
dominates over other factors and favors the in-phase configuration. Therefore,
our results show that fluid viscoelasticity can dramatically enhance
synchronization of microswimmers. Our investigation deciphers the importance of
different competing effects for the synchronization of two actuated sheets,
leading to a better understanding of interactions between microswimmers and
their collective behavior.

When a (near-)resonant planetary system resides in the dynamical neighbourhood
of a stable periodic orbit, its long-term stability, and thus survival, can be
guaranteed. We use the intrinsic property of the periodic orbits, namely their
linear horizontal and vertical stability, to validate or further constrain the
orbital elements of detected two-planet systems. We computed the families of
periodic orbits in the general three-body problem for several two-planet Kepler
and K2 systems. The dynamical neighbourhood of the systems is unveiled with
maps of dynamical stability. Additional validations or constraints on the
orbital elements of K2-21, K2-24, Kepler-9, and (non-coplanar) Kepler-108
near-resonant systems were achieved. While a mean-motion resonance locking
protects the long-term evolution of the systems K2-21 and K2-24, such a
resonant evolution is not possible for the Kepler-9 system, whose stability is
maintained through an apsidal anti-alignment. For the Kepler-108 system, we
find that the stability of its mutually inclined planets could be justified
either solely by a mean-motion resonance, or in tandem with an inclination-type
resonance. Going forward, dynamical analyses based on periodic orbits could
yield better constrained orbital elements of near-resonant extrasolar systems
when performed in parallel to the fitting of the observational data.

biorthogonal quantum mechanics to define a biorthogonal polarization, which
functions as a real-space invariant signaling the presence of boundary states.
Here, we generalize the concept of the biorthogonal polarization beyond the
previous results to systems with any number of boundary modes, and show that it
is invariant under basis transformations as well as local unitary
transformations. Additionally, we propose a generalization of a
perviously-developed method with which to find all the bulk states of system

pairwise interactions, captured by dyadic links, and provide limited insight
into higher-order structure, in which a group of several components represents
the basic interaction unit. Such multi-component interactions can only be
grasped through simplicial complexes, which have recently found applications in
social and biological contexts, as well as in engineering and brain science.
What, then, are the generative models recovering the patterns observed in
real-world simplicial complexes? Here we introduce, study, and characterize a
model to grow simplicial complexes of order two, i.e. nodes, links and
triangles, that yields a highly flexible range of empirically relevant
simplicial network ensembles. Specifically, through a combination of
preferential and/or non preferential attachment mechanisms, the model
constructs networks with a scale-free degree distribution and an either bounded
or scale-free generalized degree distribution - the latter accounting for the
number of triads surrounding each link. Allowing to analytically control the
scaling exponents we arrive at a highly general scheme by which to construct
ensembles of synthetic complexes displaying desired statistical properties.

from compact coalescing binaries (CBC) with high significance is the reduction
of the false-alarm rate of the matched-filter statistic. The data from GW
detectors contain transient noise artifacts, or glitches, which adversely
affect the performance of search algorithms by producing false alarms. Glitches
with large amplitudes can produce triggers in the SNR time-series in spite of
their small overlap with the templates. This contributes to false alarms.
Historically, the traditional $\chi^2$ test has proved quite useful in
distinguishing triggers arising from CBC signals and those caused by glitches.
In a recent paper, a large class of unified $\chi^2$ discriminators was
formulated, along with a procedure to construct an optimal $\chi^2$
discriminator, especially, when the glitches can be modeled. A large variety of
glitches that often occur in GW detector data can be modeled as sine-Gaussians,
with quality factor and central frequency, ($Q,f_0$), as parameters. We use
Singular Value Decomposition to identify the most significant degrees of
freedom in order to reduce the computational cost of our $\chi^2$. Finally, we
construct a $\chi^2$ statistic that optimally discriminates between
sine-Gaussian glitches and CBC signals. We also use
Receiver-Operating-Characteristics to quantify the improvement in search
sensitivity when it employs the optimal $\chi^2$ compared to the traditional
$\chi^2$. The improvement in detection probability is by a few to several
percentage points, near a false-alarm probability of a few times $10^{-3}$, and
holds for binary black holes (BBHs) with component masses from several to a
hundred solar masses. Moreover, the glitches that are best discriminated

engineering to create synergies between the physics and electrical engineering

The focus is on spin-wave majority gates as they are the most prominently

computing systems, considering essential aspects such as gate interconnection,
logic level restoration, input-output consistency, and fan-out achievement. We

challenges to realize such systems are discussed. The benchmark indicates that
hybrid spin-wave--CMOS systems promise ultralow-power operation and may
ultimately outperform conventional CMOS circuits in terms of the

dissociation rates, and the Franz-Keldysh effect for excitons in phosphorene in
various dielectric surroundings. All three effects show a pronounced dependence
on the direction of the in-plane electric field, with the dissociation rates in
particular decreasing by several orders of magnitude upon rotating the electric
field from the armchair to the zigzag axis. To better understand the numerical
dissociation rates, we derive an analytical approximation to the anisotropic
rates induced by weak electric fields, thereby generalizing the previously
obtained result for isotropic two-dimensional semiconductors. This
approximation is shown to be valid in the weak-field limit by comparing it to
the exact rates. The anisotropy is also apparent in the large difference
between armchair and zigzag components of the exciton polarizability tensor,
which we compute for the five lowest lying states. As expected, we also find
much more pronounced Stark shifts in either the armchair or zigzag direction,
depending on the symmetry of the state in question. Finally, an isotropic
interaction potential is shown to be an excellent approximation to a more
accurate anisotropic interaction derived from the Poisson equation, confirming
that the anisotropy of phosphorene is largely due to the direction dependence
of the effective masses.

organs. These tissues are not static, but dynamically change over time. Even if
the overall structure remains the same there is a turnover of cells within the
tissue. This dynamic homeostasis is maintained by numerous governing mechanisms
which are finely tuned in such a way that the tissue remains in a homeostatic
state, even across large timescales. Some of these governing mechanisms include
cell motion, and cell fate selection through inter cellular signalling.
However, it is not yet clear how to link these two processes, or how they may
affect one another across the tissue. In this paper, we present a
multicellular, multiscale model, which brings together the two phenomena of
cell motility, and inter cellular signalling, to describe cell fate selection
on a dynamic tissue. We find that the affinity for cellular signalling to occur
greatly influences a cells ability to differentiate. We also find that our
results support claims that cell differentiation is a finely tuned process
within dynamic tissues at homeostasis, with excessive cell turnover rates
leading to unhealthy (undifferentiated and unpatterned) tissues.

Hartree-Fock plus BCS method (SHF + BCS) with the SkP interaction. For
comparison, we study two other types of isovector effective pairing
interactions. One is also extracted from pairing gaps of infinite nuclear
matter by the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) method but for free spectrum (P2).
The other is obtained by fitting the empirical OEM (P3). An isoscalar effective
pairing interaction (P4) is also adopted which is determined by fitting the
empirical OEM. We find that interaction P1 can better describe the OEM
staggering of Ni, Zr and Sn isotopes by $14.3 \%, 41 \%, 30.4 \%$ compared with
interaction P2, in terms of root mean square deviations to the empirical OEM,
respectively. On the other hand, the performance of P1 and P2 is comparable for
Ca isotopes. For Ca and Ni isotopes, P1 behaves similarly as P3, but for Zr
isotopes P1 is better than P3 by $\sim 34 \%$. Among the four pairing
interactions studied, P4 performs the worst. Therefore, one may conclude that
for neutron pairings in finite nuclei, the isovector pairings are preferred
than the isoscalar one. It is quite interesting to note that the pairing
interaction P1 extracted from nuclear matter calculations can describe pairing
gaps of finite nuclei as well as or even better than the interaction P3
directly fitted to finite nuclei.

but remains actively debated. From the vast literature that addressed this
topic for decades under various points of view (e.g., developmental psychology,
experimental design, artificial intelligence), intrinsic motivation emerged as
a concept that can practically be transferred to artificial agents. Especially,
in the recent field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents implement such
a concept (mainly using a novelty argument) in the shape of an exploration
bonus, added to the task reward, that encourages visiting the whole
environment. This approach is supported by the large amount of theory on RL for
which convergence to optimality assumes exhaustive exploration. Yet, Human
Beings and mammals do not exhaustively explore the world and their motivation
is not only based on novelty but also on various other factors (e.g.,
curiosity, fun, style, pleasure, safety, competition, etc.). They optimize for
life-long learning and train to learn transferable skills in playgrounds
without obvious goals. They also apply innate or learned priors to save time
and stay safe. For these reasons, we propose to learn an exploration bonus from
demonstrations that could transfer these motivations to an artificial agent
with little assumptions about their rationale. Using an inverse RL approach, we
show that complex exploration behaviors, reflecting different motivations, can
be learnt and efficiently used by RL agents to solve tasks for which exhaustive
exploration is prohibitive.

center-of-mass system and hadrons are assumed to be emitted in the direction of
outgoing partons in that frame and then their four-momenta are transformed to
the overall center-of-mass system using relevant Lorentz transformations and
appropriate distributions are constructed. For heavy hadron production the
energy-momentum condition is imposed. In many cases our procedure disagrees
with the commonly used rule that rapidity of produced hadron is the same as
rapidity of the parent parton. We illustrate the newly proposed scheme for
production of $D$ mesons, $\Lambda_c$ baryon and $\eta_c$ quarkonium in
leading-order approach to parton production. The transverse momentum, rapidity
and Feynman-$x_F$ distributions are shown. We consider $c \to D$ and $g \to D$
as well as $c \to \eta_c$ and $g \to \eta_c$ hadronization processes. The
resulting rapidity distributions are much narrower than those obtained in the
traditional approach with parton-hadron rapidity equivalence. This has
consequences both for mid- and forward rapidities and could have consequences
for high-energy neutrino production in the Earth's atmosphere. We discuss also
$c \to \Lambda_c^+$ and $b \to \Lambda_c^+$ fragmentation and find that the
second mechanism could be partly responsible for the enhanced production of
$\Lambda_c^{\pm}$ observed recently by the ALICE collaboration.

developed in 1901 and has been a strong contender in this role since, but in
the end is an unsupervised method. It offers no guarantee that the features
that are selected have good predictive power because it does not know what is
being predicted. To this end, Peng et al. developed the minimum
redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) method in 2005. It uses the mutual
information not only between predictors but also includes the mutual
information with the response in its calculation. Estimating mutual information
and entropy tend to be expensive and problematic endeavors, which leads to
excessive processing times even for dataset that is approximately 750 by 750 in
a Leave-One-Subject-Out jackknife situation. To remedy this, we use a method
from 2012 called Distance Correlation Sure Independence Screening (DC-SIS)

this has been done by interpolating between one-group cross-sections that have
been pre-computed from nuclear reactor simulations for a grid of input
parameters, using fits such as Cubic Spline. We propose the use of Gaussian
Processes (GP) to create surrogate models, which not only provide nuclide
compositions, but also the gradient and estimates of their prediction
uncertainty. The former is useful for applications such as forward and inverse
optimization problems, the latter for uncertainty quantification applications.
For this purpose, we compare GP-based surrogate model performance with Cubic-
Spline-based interpolators based on infinite lattice simulations of a CANDU 6

that GP-based models perform significantly better in predicting spent fuel

computational runtime. Furthermore, we show that the predicted nuclide
uncertainties are reasonably accurate. While in the studied two-dimensional

based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This
endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across
the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical,
age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR,
which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to
infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the
pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the
number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to
predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and
infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train
a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model
parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the
solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep
learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show
great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find
an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around
0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the
number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future.

thin films with varying pump fluence, temperature, and film thickness. Upon
photoexcitation the THz photoconductivity (PC) of 5 nm PtTe2 film shows abrupt

subpicosecond time scale, followed by a prolonged recovery process that lasted
hundreds of picoseconds (ps). This unusual THz PC response observed in the 5 nm

unexpected negative THz PC as the small polaron formation due to the strong
electron-Eg-mode phonon coupling, which is further substantiated by pump
fluence- and temperature-dependent measurements as well as the Raman
spectroscopy. Moreover, our investigations give a subpicosecond time scale of
sequential carrier cooling and polaron formation. The present study provides

to \emph{delens} the secondary B-mode component induced by weak gravitational
lensing. Focusing on the latter of these efforts, in this work we briefly
review the basic aspects of lensing, and exhaustively compare the performance
of current delensing methodologies and implementations within the Born

are that, for next-generation experiments, delensing efficiency will still be
limited by the quality of the data itself rather than by the limitations of
current delensing methodologies, and that template delensing within the
antilensing approximation will be the optimal (balancing accuracy and
computational cost) technique to employ. We then evaluate the delensing
capabilities of future experiments (like the Simons Observatory, the CMB
Stage-IV, or the LiteBIRD and PICO satellites) by applying that methodology
onto numerical simulations of the typical CMB and lensing potential
reconstructions that they are expected to produce, and quantify how internal
and external delensing will help them to improve their sensitivity to detect
the PGWB. We also consider the benefits that a joint analysis of their data
would provide.

there is a coordinator and k players, where the coordinator holds a threshold N

increased by one. The job of the coordinator is to capture the exact moment

final states in the mass range above 2 TeV is presented. This is the first
search for non-resonant signals in dilepton final states at the LHC to use a
background estimate from the data. The data, corresponding to an integrated
luminosity of 139 fb$^{-1}$, were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in
proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV
during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. The benchmark signal signature is a
two-quark and two-lepton contact interaction, which would enhance the dilepton
event rate at the TeV mass scale. To model the contribution from background
processes a functional form is fit to the dilepton invariant-mass spectra in
data in a mass region below the region of interest. It is then extrapolated to
a high-mass signal region to obtain the expected background there. No
significant deviation from the expected background is observed in the data.
Upper limits at 95 % CL on the number of events and the visible cross-section
times branching fraction for processes involving new physics are provided.
Observed (expected) 95 % CL lower limits on the contact interaction energy
scale reach 35.8 (37.6) TeV.

Boltzmann scheme with multiple relaxation times when the time step is
proportional to the space step and tends to zero. We do this by a combination
of theory and numerical experiment. The classical formal analysis when all the
relaxation parameters are fixed and the time step tends to zero shows that the
numerical solution converges to solutions of the heat equation, with a
constraint connecting the diffusivity, the space step and the coefficient of
relaxation of the momentum. If the diffusivity is fixed and the space step
tends to zero, the relaxation parameter for the momentum is very small, causing
a discrepency between the previous analysis and the numerical results. We
propose a new analysis of the method for this specific situation of evanescent
relaxation, based on the dispersion equation of the lattice Boltzmann scheme. A
new asymptotic partial differential equation, the damped acoustic system, is
emergent as a result of this formal analysis. Complementary numerical
experiments establish the convergence of the scalar D2Q9 lattice Boltzmann

2$\sigma$ upper limit on the integral flux above 100 MeV has been estimated. We
reproduce the non-thermal broadband spectral energy distribution of AR Scorpii
using an emission model having two synchrotron components due to the
relativistic electrons in very high magnetic fields. The first component
(Synchrotron-1) broadly describes the emissions at radio to high energy X-rays
through the synchrotron radiation originating from a spherical region of radius
$\sim$ 1.8$\times$10$^{10}$ cm and a magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 10$^3$
Gauss. The second component (Synchrotron-2) which reproduces the X-ray emission
at lower energies and predicts the $\gamma$-ray emission, originates from
another spherical region with radius $\sim$ 1.4$\times$10$^{10}$ cm and a
magnetic field strength of $\sim$ 10$^6$ Gauss. The relativistic electron
populations in both the emission regions are described by a smooth broken power
law energy distribution. The $\gamma$-ray emission predicted by the
Synchrotron-2 model is below the broadband sensitivity of the \emph{Fermi}-LAT

at constructing conservative fluxes within the space of multiscale basis

apply a systematic online enrichment procedure. The increase in pressure
accuracy due to the online construction is inherited by the conservative flux
fields and the desired saturation solutions from the coupled transport
equation. Despite the fact that the coefficient of the pressure equation is
dependent on the saturation which may vary in time, we may construct an
approximation space using the initial coefficient where no further basis
updates follow. Numerical results corresponding to four different types of

elucidate the electrohydrodynamics EHD of a dielectric liquid droplet impact on
superhydrophobic SH and hydrophilic surfaces. A wide range of Weber numbers We
and electro-capillary numbers Cae is covered to explore the various regimes of
droplet impact EHD. We show that for a fixed We 60, droplet rebound on SH
surface is suppressed with increase of electric field intensity. At high Cae,
instead of the usual uniform radial contraction, the droplets retract faster in
orthogonal direction to the electric field and spread along the direction of
the electric field. This prevents the accumulation of sufficient kinetic energy
to achieve the droplet rebound phenomena. For certain values of We and
Ohnesorge number Oh, droplets exhibit somersault like motion during rebound.
Subsequently we propose a semi analytical model to explain the field induced
rebound phenomenon on SH surfaces. Above a critical Cae 4.0, EHD instability
causes fingering pattern via evolution of spire at the rim. Further, the
spreading EHD on both hydrophilic and SH surfaces are discussed. On both
wettability surfaces and for a fixed We, the spreading factor shows an
increasing trend with increase in Cae. We have formulated an analytical model
based on energy conservation to predict the maximum spreading diameter. The
model predictions hold reasonably good agreement with the experimental
observations. Finally, a phase map was developed to explain the post impact
droplet dynamics on SH surfaces for a wide range of We and Cae.

disappears at the critical concentration: x=0.5. In this x range, the present
study reveals that no prominent feature is ascribed to the quantum critical
fluctuations in specific heat. Instead, ac magnetic susceptibility exhibits a
broad peak due to spontaneous spin freezing, and the peak temperature depends
significantly on the frequency of the applied ac magnetic field. Furthermore,
specific heat is enhanced within a wide temperature range, whereas specific
heat shows no salient anomaly associated with spin freezing. These features are
characteristics of the formation of cluster-glass; in particular, the observed
frequency variations in ac magnetic susceptibility are well described by the
Vogel-Fulcher law. We compare the features concerning the suppression of the
ferromagnetic order in this doped compound with those in isostructural Ca- and
La-doped SrRuO3, and suggest that a local correlated disorder effect and the
very small coherence of itinerant Ru 4d electrons are responsible for the

generally believed to be governed by Hall drift which leads to what is known as
a Hall cascade. Here we show that helical and fractionally helical magnetic
fields undergo strong inverse cascading like in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), but
the magnetic energy decays more slowly with time $t$: $\propto t^{-2/5}$
instead of $\propto t^{-2/3}$ in MHD. Even for a nonhelical magnetic field
there is a certain degree of inverse cascading for sufficiently strong magnetic
fields. The inertial range scaling with wavenumber $k$ is compatible with
earlier findings for the forced Hall cascade, i.e., proportional to $k^{-7/3}$,
but in the decaying cases, the subinertial range spectrum steepens to a novel
$k^5$ slope instead of the $k^4$ slope in MHD. The energy of the large-scale
magnetic field can increase quadratically in time through inverse cascading.
For helical fields, the energy dissipation is found to be inversely
proportional to the large-scale magnetic field and proportional to the fifth
power of the root-mean square (rms) magnetic field. For neutron star conditions
with an rms magnetic field of a few times $10^{14}\,$G, the large-scale
magnetic field might only be $10^{11}\,$G, while still producing magnetic
dissipation of $10^{33}\,$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$ for thousands of years, which could
manifest itself through X-ray emission. Finally, it is shown that the
conclusions from local unstratified models agree rather well with those from
stratified models with boundaries.

space where the Kepler Space Telescope is sensitive to the TTVs exomoons might
produce, though the moons themselves would be too small to detect
photometrically via their own transits. The Earth's Moon, for example, produces
TTVs of 2.6 minutes amplitude by causing our planet to move around their mutual
centre of mass. This is more than Kepler's short-cadence interval of 1 minute
and so nominally detectable (if transit timings can be measured with comparable
accuracy), even though the Moon's transit signature is only 7% that of Earth's,
well below Kepler's nominal photometric threshold. Here we examine several
Kepler systems, exploring the hypothesis that an exomoon could be detected
solely from the TTVs it induces on its host planet. We compare this with the
alternate hypothesis that the TTVs are caused by an non-transiting planet in
the system. We examine 13 Kepler systems and find 8 where both hypotheses
explain the observed TTVs equally well. Though no definitive exomoon detection
can be claimed on this basis, the observations are nevertheless completely
consistent with a dynamically stable moon small enough to fall below Kepler's
photometric threshold for transit detection, and these systems warrant further
observation and analysis.

segment the left atrial (LA) cavity and quantify LA scars. The framework
incorporates the continuous spatial information of the target by introducing a
spatially encoded (SE) loss based on the distance transform map. Compared to
conventional binary label based loss, the proposed SE loss can reduce noisy
patches in the resulting segmentation, which is commonly seen for deep
learning-based methods. To fully utilize the inherent spatial relationship
between LA and LA scars, we further propose a shape attention (SA) mechanism
through an explicit surface projection to build an end-to-end-trainable model.
Specifically, the SA scheme is embedded into a two-task network to perform the
joint LA segmentation and scar quantification. Moreover, the proposed method
can alleviate the severe class-imbalance problem when detecting small and
discrete targets like scars. We evaluated the proposed framework on 60 LGE MRI
data from the MICCAI2018 LA challenge. For LA segmentation, the proposed method
reduced the mean Hausdorff distance from 36.4 mm to 20.0 mm compared to the 3D
basic U-Net using the binary cross-entropy loss. For scar quantification, the
method was compared with the results or algorithms reported in the literature
and demonstrated better performance.

point in this study is the use of a special program to renormalize the bare
parameters of the Lagrangian. The counterterm used in the renormalization
program, which was obtained systematically position-dependent, is consistent
with the boundary condition imposed on the quantum field. To regularize and
remove infinities in the calculation process of the Casimir energy, the Box
Subtraction Scheme as a regularization technique was used. In this scheme, two
similar configurations are usually introduced, and the vacuum energies of these
two configurations in proper limits are subtracted from each other. The final
answer for the problem is finite and consistent with the expected physical
basis. We also compared the new result of this paper to the previously reported

  Adaptation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In the unsupervised open set domain adaptation (UOSDA), the target domain
contains unknown classes that are not observed in the source domain.
Researchers in this area aim to train a classifier to accurately: 1) recognize
unknown target data (data with unknown classes) and, 2) classify other target
data. To achieve this aim, a previous study has proven an upper bound of the
target-domain risk, and the open set difference, as an important term in the
upper bound, is used to measure the risk on unknown target data. By minimizing
the upper bound, a shallow classifier can be trained to achieve the aim.
However, if the classifier is very flexible (e.g., deep neural networks
(DNNs)), the open set difference will converge to a negative value when
minimizing the upper bound, which causes an issue where most target data are
recognized as unknown data. To address this issue, we propose a new upper bound
of target-domain risk for UOSDA, which includes four terms: source-domain risk,
$\epsilon$-open set difference ($\Delta_\epsilon$), a distributional
discrepancy between domains, and a constant. Compared to the open set
difference, $\Delta_\epsilon$ is more robust against the issue when it is being
minimized, and thus we are able to use very flexible classifiers (i.e., DNNs).
Then, we propose a new principle-guided deep UOSDA method that trains DNNs via
minimizing the new upper bound. Specifically, source-domain risk and
$\Delta_\epsilon$ are minimized by gradient descent, and the distributional
discrepancy is minimized via a novel open-set conditional adversarial training
strategy. Finally, compared to existing shallow and deep UOSDA methods, our
method shows the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets,
including digit recognition (MNIST, SVHN, USPS), object recognition (Office-31,
Office-Home), and face recognition (PIE).

applying, mainly non-linear, transformations to the biometric template. The

[BTAS'19], exploited the similarity preservation trait of CB and proposed a
similarity-based attack with high successful attack rate. The similarity-based
attack utilizes preimage that are generated from the protected biometric
template for impersonation and perform cross matching. In this paper, we
propose a constrained optimization similarity-based attack (CSA), which is
improved upon Dong's genetic algorithm enabled similarity-based attack (GASA).
The CSA applies algorithm-specific equality or inequality relations as
constraints, to optimize preimage generation. We interpret the effectiveness of
CSA from the supervised learning perspective. We identify such constraints then
conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate CSA against CB with LFW face
dataset. The results suggest that CSA is effective to breach IoM hashing and
BioHashing security, and outperforms GASA significantly. Inferring from the
above results, we further remark that, other than IoM and BioHashing, CSA is
critical to other CB schemes as far as the constraints can be formulated.
Furthermore, we reveal the correlation of hash code size and the attack

find that, similarly to the case of incoherent bit- and phase-flips, a
trade-off between resilience against coherent $X$- and $Z$-rotations can be
made via the connectivity of the graph. However, our results indicate that,
unlike in the incoherent case, the error-correction thresholds for the various
graphs do not approach a universal bound. We also study the distribution of
final states after error correction. We show that graphs fall into three
distinct classes, each resulting in qualitatively distinct final-state
distributions. In particular, we show that a graph class exists where the
logical-level noise exhibits a decoherence threshold slightly above the
error-correction threshold. In these classes, therefore, the logical level
noise above the error-correction threshold can retain significant amount of
coherence even for large-distance codes. To perform our analysis, we develop a

electrometer for probing the charge density of its environment. Under the
influence of a perpendicular magnetic field, the charge carrier density of the
channel region next to the quantum dot oscillates due to the formation of
Landau levels. This is experimentally observed as oscillations in the
gate-voltage positions of the Coulomb resonances of the nearby quantum dot.
From the frequency of the oscillations, we extract the charge carrier density
in the channel and from the amplitude the shift of the quantum dot potential.
We compare these experimental results with an electrostatic simulation of the
device and find good agreement.

data-dependent randomized predictor, for which upper bounds can be derived via
a PAC-Bayes analysis, leading to PAC-Bayes bounds.
  Specifically, we present a basic PAC-Bayes inequality for stochastic kernels,
from which one may derive extensions of various known PAC-Bayes bounds as well
as novel bounds. We clarify the role of the requirements of fixed 'data-free'
priors, bounded losses, and i.i.d. data. We highlight that those requirements
were used to upper-bound an exponential moment term, while the basic PAC-Bayes
theorem remains valid without those restrictions. We present three bounds that
illustrate the use of data-dependent priors, including one for the unbounded

benefits from a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework, thus can provide different

domain discrimination component and domain relevance attention encourage the
model to learn transferable domain general structures. In the fine stage, the
model is guided to concentrate on domain related details. Experiments on a

domain adaptation strategies. Additionally, we show that our model can well
exploit limited target data to capture the difference between the source and

journeys to minimise travel time, potentially increasing overall system
efficiency. On busy highways, however, congestion events can cause large,
short-term spikes in travel time. These spikes make direct forecasting of
travel time using standard time series models difficult on the timescales of
hours to days that are relevant to forward planning. The problem is that some
such spikes are caused by unpredictable incidents and should be filtered out,
whereas others are caused by recurrent peaks in demand and should be factored
into estimates. Here we present the Wavelet Augmented Regression Profiling
(WARP) method for long-term estimation of typical travel times. WARP linearly
decomposes historical time series of travel times into two components:
background and spikes. It then further separates the spikes into contributions
from recurrent and residual congestion. This is achieved using a combination of
wavelet transforms, spectral filtering and locally weighted regression. The
background and recurrent congestion contributions are then used to estimate
typical travel times with horizon of one week in an accurate and
computationally inexpensive manner. We train and test WARP on the M6 and M11
motorways in the United Kingdom using 12 weeks of link level travel time data
obtained from the UK's National Traffic Information Service (NTIS). In
out-of-sample validation tests, WARP compares favourably to estimates produced
by a simple segmentation method and to the estimates published by NTIS.

  Recent work proposed to use a complex linear combination of coefficients

  This allows to incorporate information from previous and optionally future

introduced if $\mathbf{M}$ is graded. If $\mathbf{M}$ is also finitely
generated, it is shown that this series is a rational function. Moreover, if
this function is written in reduced form rather precise information about the
irreducible factors of the denominator is obtained. This is key for
applications. It follows that the Krull dimension of the modules $\mathbf{M}_n$
grows eventually linearly in $n$, whereas the multiplicity of $\mathbf{M}_n$
grows eventually exponentially in $n$. Moreover, for any fixed degree $j$, the
vector space dimensions of the degree $j$ components of $\mathbf{M}_n$ grow
eventually polynomially in $n$. As a consequence, any graded Betti number of
$\mathbf{M}_n$ in a fixed homological degree and a fixed internal degree grows
eventually polynomially in $n$. Furthermore, evidence is obtained to support a

single policy network, conditioned on agent-specific information. This paper
aims at i) formally understanding equilibria reached by such agents, and ii)
matching emergent phenomena of such equilibria to real-world targets. Parameter
sharing with decentralized execution has been introduced as an efficient way to
train multiple agents using a single policy network. However, the nature of
resulting equilibria reached by such agents has not been yet studied: we
introduce the novel concept of Shared equilibrium as a symmetric pure Nash
equilibrium of a certain Functional Form Game (FFG) and prove convergence to
the latter for a certain class of games using self-play. In addition, it is
important that such equilibria satisfy certain constraints so that MAS are
calibrated to real world data for practical use: we solve this problem by
introducing a novel dual-Reinforcement Learning based approach that fits
emergent behaviors of agents in a Shared equilibrium to externally-specified
targets, and apply our methods to a n-player market example. We do so by
calibrating parameters governing distributions of agent types rather than
individual agents, which allows both behavior differentiation among agents and
coherent scaling of the shared policy network to multiple agents.

high-quality confidence estimates of deep neural network predictions. Recent
work has shown that widely used scaling methods underestimate their calibration
error, while alternative Histogram Binning (HB) methods often fail to preserve
classification accuracy. When classes have small prior probabilities, HB also
faces the issue of severe sample-inefficiency after the conversion into K
one-vs-rest class-wise calibration problems. The goal of this paper is to
resolve the identified issues of HB in order to provide calibrated confidence
estimates using only a small holdout calibration dataset for bin optimization
while preserving multi-class ranking accuracy. From an information-theoretic
perspective, we derive the I-Max concept for binning, which maximizes the
mutual information between labels and quantized logits. This concept mitigates
potential loss in ranking performance due to lossy quantization, and by
disentangling the optimization of bin edges and representatives allows
simultaneous improvement of ranking and calibration performance. To improve the
sample efficiency and estimates from a small calibration set, we propose a
shared class-wise (sCW) calibration strategy, sharing one calibrator among
similar classes (e.g., with similar class priors) so that the training sets of
their class-wise calibration problems can be merged to train the single
calibrator. The combination of sCW and I-Max binning outperforms the state of
the art calibration methods on various evaluation metrics across different
benchmark datasets and models, using a small calibration set (e.g., 1k samples
for ImageNet).

understand how quickly the epidemic was spreading. When an increase/decrease
was communicated, especially a large one, it was not easy to understand if it

are susceptible to Side Channel Attack. Unlike conventional SCAs that are aimed
to leak private keys from cryptographic implementations, SCARE can reveal the
sensitive IP implemented within the memory. Therefore, the adversary does not
need to perform invasive Reverse Engineering to unlock the functionality. We
demonstrate SCARE by taking recent IMC architectures such as DCIM and MAGIC as
test cases. Simulation results indicate that AND, OR, and NOR gates (building
blocks of complex functions) yield distinct power and timing signatures based
on the number of inputs making them vulnerable to SCA. Although process
variations can obfuscate the signatures due to significant overlap, we show
that the adversary can use statistical modeling and analysis to identify the
structure of the implemented function. SCARE can find the implemented IP by
testing a limited number of patterns. For example, the proposed technique
reduces the number of patterns by 64% compared to a brute force attack for a+bc
function. Additionally, analysis shows improvement in SCAREs detection model
due to adversarial change in supply voltage for both DCIM and MAGIC. We also
propose countermeasures such as redundant inputs and expansion of literals.
Redundant inputs can mask the IP with 25% area and 20% power overhead. However,
functions can be found by greater RE effort. Expansion of literals incurs 36%
power overhead. However, it imposes brute force search by the adversary for

normalisation of spectra. Methods: We developed RASSINE, a Python code for
normalising merged 1D spectra through the concepts of convex hulls. The code
uses six parameters that can be easily fine-tuned. The code also provides a
complete user-friendly interactive interface, including graphical feedback,
that helps the user to choose the parameters as easily as possible. To
facilitate the normalisation even further, RASSINE can provide a first guess
for the parameters that are derived directly from the merged 1D spectrum based
on previously performed calibrations. Results: For HARPS spectra of the Sun
that were obtained with the HELIOS solar telescope, a continuum accuracy of
0.20% on line depth can be reached after normalisation with RASSINE. This is
three times better than with the commonly used method of polynomial fitting.
For HARPS spectra of $\alpha$ Cen B, a continuum accuracy of 2.0% is reached.
This rather poor accuracy is mainly due to molecular band absorption and the
high density of spectral lines in the bluest part of the merged 1D spectrum.
When wavelengths shorter than 4500 \AA are excluded, the continuum accuracy
improves by up to 1.2%. The line-depth precision on individual spectrum
normalisation is estimated to be 0.15%, which can be reduced to the
photon-noise limit (0.10%) when a time series of spectra is given as input for
RASSINE. Conclusions: With a continuum accuracy higher than the polynomial
fitting method and a line-depth precision compatible with photon noise, RASSINE
is a tool that can find applications in numerous cases, for example stellar
parameter determination, transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres, or
activity-sensitive line detection.

we develop two different degenerate perturbative methods to solve the
degeneracy-related problems. Moreover, we study the one-dimensional repulsively
interacting Bose gas under harmonic confinement, with special attention to the
asymptotic behavior of the momentum distribution, which is a universal $k^{-4}$
decay characterized by the Tan's contact. The latter constitutes a direct
signature of the short-range correlations in such an interacting system and
provides valuable insights about the role of the interparticle interactions. We
investigate the system constituted of $N$ interacting particles in the strongly
interacting limit. In such a regime, the strong interparticle interaction makes
the bosons behave similarly to the ideal Fermi gas. Because of the difficulty
in analytically solving the system for $N$ particles at finite interaction, the
Tonks-Girardeau regime provides a favorable scenario to probe the contact.
Therefore, we are able to provide an analytical formula for the Tan's contact.
Furthermore, we analyze the scaling properties of the Tan's contact in terms of
$N$ in the high-temperature regime as well as in the strongly interacting
regime. Finally, we compare our analytical calculations of the Tan's contact to
quantum Monte Carlo simulations and discuss some fundamental differences
between the canonical and the grand-canonical ensembles.

populations (MPs) in Globular Clusters (GCs) by using diagrams that are based
on colours and magnitudes that are mostly sensitive to stars with different
metallicities or different abundances of helium, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen.
In particular, the pseudo two-colour diagram called chromosome map (ChM),
allowed the identification and the characterization of MPs in about 70 GCs by
using appropriate filters of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) that are
sensitive to the stellar content of He, C, N, O and Fe. We use here
high-precision HST photometry from F275W, F280N, F343N, F373N, and F814W images
of Omega Centauri to investigate its MPs. We introduce a new ChM whose abscissa
and ordinate are mostly sensitive to stellar populations with different
magnesium and nitrogen, respectively, in monometallic GCs. This ChM is
effective in disentangling the MPs based on their Mg chemical abundances,
allowing us to explore, for the first time, possible relations between the
production of these elemental species for large samples of stars in GCs. By
comparing the colours of the distinct stellar populations with the colours
obtained from appropriate synthetic spectra we provide 'photometric-like'
estimates of the chemical composition of each population. Our results show
that, in addition to first generation (1G) stars, the metal-poor population of
Omega Centauri hosts four groups of second-generation stars with different
[N/Fe], namely, 2GA--D. 2GA stars share nearly the same [Mg/Fe] as the 1G,
whereas 2GB, 2GC and 2GD stars are Mg depleted by ~0.15, ~0.25 and ~0.45 dex,
respectively. We provide evidence that the metal-intermediate populations host
stars with depleted [Mg/Fe].

hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning

In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables

two-sided power (TSP) distribution. TSP-based warping functions are

segmentation functions exactly. Our formulation includes the important class of
segmented generalized linear models as a special case, which makes it highly

gravity. I begin by showing that the classical null energy condition (NEC) can
arise as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics applied to local
holographic screens. This is accomplished by essentially reversing the steps of
Hawking's area theorem, leading to the Ricci convergence condition as an input,
from which an application of Einstein's equations yields the NEC -- even in the
presence of 1-loop quantum corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy
formula. Then, by attributing thermodynamics to the stretched horizon of future
lightcones -- a timelike hypersurface generated by a collection of radially
accelerating observers with constant and uniform proper acceleration -- I
derive Einstein's equations from the Clausius relation $T\Delta
S_{\text{rev}}=Q$, where $\Delta S_{\text{rev}}$ is the reversible entropy
change. Based on this derivation I uncover a local first law of gravity,
$\Delta E=T\Delta S-W$, connecting gravitational entropy $S$ to matter energy
$E$ and work $W$. I then provide an entanglement interpretation of stretched
lightcone thermodynamics by extending the entanglement equilibrium proposal.
Using the $\text{AdS}_{3}/\text{CFT}_{2}$ correspondence, I then provide a
microscopic explanation of the `thermodynamic volume' in extended black hole
thermodynamics and reveal the super-entropicity of $\text{AdS}_{3}$ black holes

$\text{CFT}_{2}$ states. Finally, I conclude by providing a recent

validity to statistical inference. With targeted prediction, the goal is to
optimize predictions for specific decision tasks of interest, which we

interpret and slow to compute. Instead, we design a class of parametrized

computational costs and are hard to deploy to low-end devices. Knowledge
distillation, which aims at training a smaller student network by transferring
knowledge from a larger teacher model, is one of the promising solutions for
model miniaturization. In this paper, we investigate each module of a typical
detector in depth, and propose a general distillation framework that adaptively
transfers knowledge from teacher to student according to the task specific
priors. The intuition is that simply distilling all information from teacher to
student is not advisable, instead we should only borrow priors from the teacher
model where the student cannot perform well. Towards this goal, we propose a
region proposal sharing mechanism to interflow region responses between the
teacher and student models. Based on this, we adaptively transfer knowledge at
three levels, \emph{i.e.}, feature backbone, classification head, and bounding
box regression head, according to which model performs more reasonably.
Furthermore, considering that it would introduce optimization dilemma when
minimizing distillation loss and detection loss simultaneously, we propose a
distillation decay strategy to help improve model generalization via gradually
reducing the distillation penalty. Experiments on widely used detection
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, using
Faster R-CNN with FPN as an instantiation, we achieve an accuracy of $39.0\%$

processes with unknown transition kernels, where the goal is to optimize the
total reward under the risk measure of exponential utility. We propose two
provably efficient model-free algorithms, Risk-Sensitive Value Iteration (RSVI)
and Risk-Sensitive Q-learning (RSQ). These algorithms implement a form of
risk-sensitive optimism in the face of uncertainty, which adapts to both
risk-seeking and risk-averse modes of exploration. We prove that RSVI attains
an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot \sqrt{H^{3} S^{2}AT} \big)$
regret, while RSQ attains an $\tilde{O}\big(\lambda(|\beta| H^2) \cdot
\sqrt{H^{4} SAT} \big)$ regret, where $\lambda(u) = (e^{3u}-1)/u$ for $u>0$. In
the above, $\beta$ is the risk parameter of the exponential utility function,
$S$ the number of states, $A$ the number of actions, $T$ the total number of
timesteps, and $H$ the episode length. On the flip side, we establish a regret
lower bound showing that the exponential dependence on $|\beta|$ and $H$ is
unavoidable for any algorithm with an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret (even when
the risk objective is on the same scale as the original reward), thus
certifying the near-optimality of the proposed algorithms. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating risk awareness into reinforcement learning
necessitates an exponential cost in $|\beta|$ and $H$, which quantifies the
fundamental tradeoff between risk sensitivity (related to aleatoric
uncertainty) and sample efficiency (related to epistemic uncertainty). To the

DNA and each DNA has its own countably many set of neighboring DNAs. The
Hamiltonian of this set of DNAs is a model with two spin values considered as
DNA base pairs. We describe translation invariant Gibbs measures (TIGM) of the
model on the Cayley tree of order two and use them to study thermodynamic
properties of the model of DNAs. We show that there is a critical temperature
$T_{\rm c}$ such that (i) if temperature $T\geq T_{\rm c}$ then there exists
unique TIGM; (ii) if $T<T_{\rm c}$ then there are three TIGMs. Each TIGM gives
a phase of the set of DNAs. In case of very high and very low temperatures we

  COVID-19 CT Image Segmentation","11 pages",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious virus spreading
all around the world. Deep learning has been adopted as an effective technique
to aid COVID-19 detection and segmentation from computed tomography (CT)
images. The major challenge lies in the inadequate public COVID-19 datasets.
Recently, transfer learning has become a widely used technique that leverages
the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different
but related problem. However, it remains unclear whether various non-COVID19
lung lesions could contribute to segmenting COVID-19 infection areas and how to
better conduct this transfer procedure. This paper provides a way to understand
the transferability of non-COVID19 lung lesions. Based on a publicly available
COVID-19 CT dataset and three public non-COVID19 datasets, we evaluate four
transfer learning methods using 3D U-Net as a standard encoder-decoder method.
The results reveal the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID19 lung
lesions, and learning from multiple lung lesion datasets can extract more
general features, leading to accurate and robust pre-trained models. We further
show the capability of the encoder to learn feature representations of lung
lesions, which improves segmentation accuracy and facilitates training
convergence. In addition, our proposed Hybrid-encoder learning method
incorporates transferred lung lesion features from non-COVID19 datasets
effectively and achieves significant improvement. These findings promote new
insights into transfer learning for COVID-19 CT image segmentation, which can
also be further generalized to other medical tasks.

hygro-mechanical response of sheets of paper in applications like digital
printing. A two-dimensional microstructural model of a fibrous network is
therefore developed to upscale the hygro-expansion of individual fibres,
through their interaction, to the resulting overall expansion of the network.
The fibres are modelled with rectangular shapes and are assumed to be perfectly
bonded where they overlap. For realistic networks the number of bonds is large
and the network is geometrically so complex that discretizing it by
conventional, geometry-conforming, finite elements is cumbersome. The
combination of a level-set and XFEM formalism enables the use of regular,
structured grids in order to model the complex microstructural geometry. In
this approach, the fibres are described implicitly by a level-set function. In
order to represent the fibre boundaries in the fibrous network, an XFEM
discretization is used together with a Heaviside enrichment function. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully captures the
hygro-expansive properties of the network with fewer degrees of freedom
compared to classical FEM, preserving desired accuracy.

recently-published parametric solutions to the Navier-Lam\'{e} equation. Formal
application of the standing-wave boundary conditions generates three

developed and applied to underwater robots. This article focuses on using the
pressure sensor arrays based on ALLS-measured hydrodynamic pressure variations
(HPVs) for estimating the relative state between two adjacent robotic fish with
leader-follower formation. The relative states include the relative oscillating
frequency, amplitude, and offset of the upstream robotic fish to the downstream
robotic fish, the relative vertical distance, the relative yaw angle, the
relative pitch angle, and the relative roll angle between the two adjacent
robotic fish. Regression model between the ALLS-measured and the mentioned
relative states is investigated, and regression model-based relative state
estimation is conducted. Specifically, two criteria are proposed firstly to
investigate not only the sensitivity of each pressure sensor to the variations
of relative state but also the insufficiency and redundancy of the pressure
sensors. And thus the pressure sensors used for regression analysis are
determined. Then four typical regression methods, including random forest
algorithm, support vector regression, back propagation neural network, and
multiple linear regression method are used for establishing regression models
between the ALLS-measured HPVs and the relative states. Then regression effects
of the four methods are compared and discussed. Finally, random forest-based
method, which has the best regression effect, is used to estimate relative yaw
angle and oscillating amplitude using the ALLS-measured HPVs and exhibits
excellent estimation performance. This work contributes to local relative

close and delicate relationship between a country's public health and economic
health. Macroeconomic models that use preexisting epidemic models to calculate
the impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for
policymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We
develop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herd
immunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect
externalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control
problem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either
naturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of
lockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages
20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via
optimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the
level of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns
once herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown
significantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases
in mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission
rate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased
infection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown
efficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and
high-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses.
Overall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd
immunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can
reduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing
high-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.

estimate the cluster duration and make assumptions about their evolution over

whole Chinese territory) and temporal scale of the dataset (66 years), we were
able to capture whether certain clusters gather in specific locations and

the eastern regions in China are much more subjected to flash floods compared

predominantly occur between July and October, a period coinciding with the wet

associated duration drastically decreases in the recent period. This may
indicate a change towards triggering mechanisms which are typical of
short-duration extreme rainfall events. Finally, being flash floods directly

order to build a useful disease diagnosis prediction system, advancement in
both data representation and development of machine learning architectures are
imperative. First, with respect to data collection and representation, we face
severe problems due to multitude of formats and lack of coherency prevalent in

Trump's victory. In the aftermath of the 2016 US elections, the world started
to realize the gravity of widespread deception in social media. Following
Trump's exploit, we witnessed to the emergence of a strident dissonance between
the multitude of efforts for detecting and removing bots, and the increasing
effects that these malicious actors seem to have on our societies. This paradox
opens a burning question: What strategies should we enforce in order to stop
this social bot pandemic? In these times, during the run-up to the 2020 US
elections, the question appears as more crucial than ever. What stroke social,
political and economic analysts after 2016, deception and automation, has been
however a matter of study for computer scientists since at least 2010. In this
work, we briefly survey the first decade of research in social bot detection.
Via a longitudinal analysis, we discuss the main trends of research in the
fight against bots, the major results that were achieved, and the factors that
make this never-ending battle so challenging. Capitalizing on lessons learned
from our extensive analysis, we suggest possible innovations that could give us
the upper hand against deception and manipulation. Studying a decade of
endeavours at social bot detection can also inform strategies for detecting and
mitigating the effects of other, more recent, forms of online deception, such
as strategic information operations and political trolls.

understanding of the actions that can be performed on them, as well as their
properties. When considering concrete motor actions, this knowledge has been
called the object affordance. Can this notion be generalized to any type of
interaction that one can have with an object? In this paper we introduce a
method to represent objects in a space where each dimension corresponds to a
broad mode of interaction, based on verb selectional preferences in text
corpora. This object embedding makes it possible to predict human judgments of
verb applicability to objects better than a variety of alternative approaches.
Furthermore, we show that the dimensions in this space can be used to predict
categorical and functional dimensions in a state-of-the-art mental
representation of objects, derived solely from human judgements of object
similarity. These results suggest that interaction knowledge accounts for a
large part of mental representations of objects.

temperature on the onset of boiling, bubble nucleation and growth, and the
possible formation of an insulating vapour film by means of large-scale MD
simulations. In the numerical experiments, we control the system pressure by
imposing a constant force on a moving piston. The simulations reveal that the
presence of a nanostructure triggers the bubble formation, determines the
nucleation site and facilitates the energy transfer from the hot substrate to
the water. The surface chemistry, on the other hand, governs the shape of the
formed bubble. A hydrophilic surface chemistry accelerates the bubble
nucleation, however, decelerates the bubble expansion, thus postponing the
formation of the film of vapour. Therefore, a hydrophilic surface provides
better energy transfer from the hot wall to the water. By analysing the system
energy, we show that irrespective of wall topology and chemistry, there is a
wall temperature for which the amount of transferred energy is maximum.

  Surfaces",,,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Cassie-Baxter state droplet has many local energy minima on the textured
surface, while the amount of the energy barrier between them can be affected by
the gravity. When the droplet cannot find any local energy minimum point on the
surface, the droplet starts to slide. Based on the Laplace pressure equation,
the shape of a two-dimensional Cassie-Baxter droplet on a textured surface is
predicted. Then the stability of the droplet is examined by considering the
interference between the liquid and the surface microstructure as well as
analyzing the free energy change upon the de-pinning. Afterward, the
theoretical analysis is validated against the line-tension based front tracking
method simulation (LTM), that seamlessly captures the attachment and detachment
between the liquid and the substrate. We answer to the open debates on the
sliding research field: (i) Whether the sliding initiates with the front end
slip or the rear end slip, and (ii) whether the advancing and receding contact
angles measured on the horizontal surface are comparable with the front and
rear contact angle of the droplet at the onset of sliding. Additionally, a new
droplet translation mechanism promoted by cycle of condensation and evaporation
is suggested.
