Published in ICML 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We make three contributions toward better understanding policy gradient
methods in the tabular setting. First, we show that with the true gradient,
policy gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate,
with constants depending on the problem and initialization. This result
significantly expands the recent asymptotic convergence results. The analysis
relies on two findings: that the softmax policy gradient satisfies a
\L{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum probability of an optimal action
during optimization can be bounded in terms of its initial value. Second, we
analyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show that it enjoys a
significantly faster linear convergence rate $O(e^{-c \cdot t})$ toward softmax
optimal policy $(c > 0)$. This result resolves an open question in the recent
literature. Finally, combining the above two results and additional new
$\Omega(1/t)$ lower bound results, we explain how entropy regularization
improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective
of convergence rate. The separation of rates is further explained using the
notion of non-uniform \L{}ojasiewicz degree. These results provide a
theoretical understanding of the impact of entropy and corroborate existing
empirical studies.

extensive on-site experiments with several mobile devices including mobile

Using only a single WiFi router, our structure achieves an average localization

the other reported algorithms by approximately $\mathrm{50\%}$ under the same

gradient-based optimization is a longstanding pursuit in the theory of deep
learning. A widespread hope is that a characterization based on minimization of

factorization (matrix completion via linear neural networks). It is an open
question whether norms can explain the implicit regularization in matrix
factorization. The current paper resolves this open question in the negative,
by proving that there exist natural matrix factorization problems on which the
implicit regularization drives all norms (and quasi-norms) towards infinity.
Our results suggest that, rather than perceiving the implicit regularization
via norms, a potentially more useful interpretation is minimization of rank. We
demonstrate empirically that this interpretation extends to a certain class of
non-linear neural networks, and hypothesize that it may be key to explaining

Fresh-register automata extend register automata with the capability to
generate fresh symbols in order to model computational scenarios involving name
creation. This paper investigates the complexity of the bisimilarity problem
for classes of register and fresh-register automata. We examine all main
disciplines that have appeared in the literature: general register assignments;
assignments where duplicate register values are disallowed; and assignments
without duplicates in which registers cannot be empty. In the general case, we
show that the problem is EXPTIME-complete.
  However, the absence of duplicate values in registers enables us to identify
inherent symmetries inside the associated bisimulation relations, which can be
used to establish a polynomial bound on the depth of Attacker-winning
strategies. Furthermore, they enable a highly succinct representation of the
corresponding bisimulations. By exploiting results from group theory and
computational group theory, we can then show solvability in PSPACE and NP
respectively for the latter two register disciplines. In each case, we find
that freshness does not affect the complexity class of the problem.
  The results allow us to close a complexity gap for language equivalence of
deterministic register automata. We show that deterministic language
inequivalence for the no-duplicates fragment is NP-complete, which disproves an
old conjecture of Sakamoto.

induced by femtosecond pulses at very high intensities. This XUV emission has
both a reduced divergence and spectral width as compared to high-order harmonic
generation (HHG). It is not emitted at a moderate intensity of the driving
pulses where only high-order harmonics are generated. At high driving
intensities, the additional XUV comb appears near all harmonic orders and even
exceeds the HHG signal on the axis. The peaks are observed in several gases and
their frequencies do not depend on the driving intensity or gas pressure. We
analyze the divergence, spectral width and spectral shift of this XUV emission.
We show that these specific features are well explained by high-order
parametric generation (HPG) involving multiphoton absorption and combined
emission of an idler THz radiation and an XUV beam with remarkably smooth
spatial and spectral characteristics.

system can depart from the initial state in the course of quantum evolution.
Most known quantum speed limits, including the celebrated Mandelstam-Tamm and
Margolus-Levitin ones, are general bounds applicable to arbitrary initial
states. However, when applied to mixed states of many-body systems, they, as a
rule, dramatically overestimate the speed of quantum evolution and fail to
provide meaningful bounds in the thermodynamic limit. Here we derive a quantum
speed limit for a closed system initially prepared in a thermal state and
evolving under a time-dependent Hamiltonian. This quantum speed limit exploits
the structure of the thermal state and, in particular, explicitly depends on
the temperature. In a broad class of many-body setups it proves to be
drastically stronger than general quantum speed limits.

the outlier-robust setting, where a small constant fraction of the data is
adversarially corrupted. We resolve the polynomial learnability of this problem
when the components are pairwise separated in total variation distance.
Specifically, we provide an algorithm that, for any constant number of
components $k$, runs in polynomial time and learns the components of an
$\epsilon$-corrupted $k$-mixture within information theoretically near-optimal
error of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon)$, under the assumption that the overlap between
any pair of components $P_i, P_j$ (i.e., the quantity $1-TV(P_i, P_j)$) is
bounded by $\mathrm{poly}(\epsilon)$.
  Our separation condition is the qualitatively weakest assumption under which
accurate clustering of the samples is possible. In particular, it allows for
components with arbitrary covariances and for components with identical means,
as long as their covariances differ sufficiently. Ours is the first polynomial
time algorithm for this problem, even for $k=2$.
  Our algorithm follows the Sum-of-Squares based proofs to algorithms approach.
Our main technical contribution is a new robust identifiability proof of
clusters from a Gaussian mixture, which can be captured by the constant-degree
Sum of Squares proof system. The key ingredients of this proof are a novel use
of SoS-certifiable anti-concentration and a new characterization of pairs of
Gaussians with small (dimension-independent) overlap in terms of their

While this model formulation is less commonly used than its continuous
counterpart, it more accurately models the reality of most control systems in
practice, making the safety guarantees more impactful. In this context, we
prove robust set invariance with respect to zero-order hold controllers as well
as state uncertainty, without the need to explicitly compute any control
invariant sets. It is then shown that this formulation can be exploited to
address input delays in this system, with the result being CBF constraints that
are affine in the input. The results are demonstrated in a high-fidelity

camera are a linear transform from the color matching functions of the human
visual system, the camera is colorimetric. Previous work proposed to solve for
a filter which, when placed in front of a camera, results in sensitivities that
best satisfy the Luther condition. By construction, the prior art solves for a
filter for a given set of human visual sensitivities, e.g. the XYZ color
matching functions or the cone response functions. However, depending on the
target spectral sensitivity set, a different optimal filter is found.
  This paper begins with the observation that the cone fundamentals, XYZ color
matching functions or any linear combination thereof span the same
3-dimensional subspace. Thus, we set out to solve for a filter that makes the
vector space spanned by the filtered camera sensitivities as similar as
possible to the space spanned by human vision sensors. We argue that the
Vora-Value is a suitable way to measure subspace similarity and we develop an
optimization method for finding a filter that maximizes the Vora-Value measure.
  Experiments demonstrate that our new optimization leads to filtered camera
sensitivities which have a significantly higher Vora-Value compared with
antecedent methods.

occur through error-correction where an individual's estimates of the period
and phase of the beat time are iteratively adjusted to align with an external

two-dimensional map where convergence to a fixed point corresponds to
synchronizing to the beat. In this paper, we show how a neural system, called a
beat generator, learns to adapt its oscillatory behaviour through
error-correction to synchronize to an external periodic signal. We construct a
two-dimensional event-based map which iteratively adjusts an internal parameter
of the beat generator to speed up or slow down its oscillatory behaviour to
bring it into synchrony with the periodic stimulus. The map is novel in that
the order of events defining the map are not a priori known. Instead, the type
of error-correction adjustment made at each iterate of the map is determined by
a sequence of expected events. The map possesses a rich repertoire of dynamics,
including periodic solutions and chaotic orbits.

finite-blocklength achievability bounds for low-density parity-check (LDPC)
codes over the point-to-point channel (PPC) and multiple access channel (MAC).
The error-exponent analysis applies Gallager's error exponent to bound
achievable symmetrical and asymmetrical rates in the MAC. The dispersion-style
analysis begins with a generalization of the random coding union (RCU) bound
from random code ensembles with i.i.d. codewords to random code ensembles in
which codewords may be statistically dependent; this generalization is useful
since the codewords of random linear codes such as random LDPC codes are
dependent. Application of the RCU bound yields improved finite-blocklength
error bounds and asymptotic achievability results for i.i.d. random codes and
new finite-blocklength error bounds and achievability results for LDPC codes.
For discrete, memoryless channels, these results show that LDPC codes achieve
first- and second-order performance that is optimal for the PPC and identical
to the best-prior results for the MAC.

  Reasoning Meets Machine Learning Workshop, NeurIPS 2019",,,,"cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We address the problem of learning a distributed representation of entities
in a relational database using a low-dimensional embedding. Low-dimensional
embeddings aim to encapsulate a concise vector representation for an underlying
dataset with minimum loss of information. Embeddings across entities in a
relational database have been less explored due to the intricate data relations
and representation complexity involved. Relational databases are an
inter-weaved collection of relations that not only model relationships between
entities but also record complex domain-specific quantitative and temporal
attributes of data defining complex relationships among entities. Recent
methods for learning an embedding constitute of a naive approach to consider
complete denormalization of the database by materializing the full join of all
tables and representing as a knowledge graph. This popular approach has certain
limitations as it fails to capture the inter-row relationships and additional
semantics encoded in the relational databases. In this paper we demonstrate; a
better methodology for learning representations by exploiting the underlying
semantics of columns in a table while using the relation joins and the latent
inter-row relationships. Empirical results over a real-world database with
evaluations on similarity join and table completion tasks support our
proposition.

show that, if $\partial \Omega$ has $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity then
$\mathcal{H}^{d-2+\alpha}(\partial E\cap \partial\Omega)>0$. This shows that a
sufficient condition to ensure that $\mathcal{H}^{d-1}(\partial E\cap \partial

Hausdorff bounds can be inferred in dependence of the regularity of $\partial

contribution to this correlation function is the six-point Virasoro identity

identity and its descendants. We call this the star channel. One particular
term in the star channel identity block is the stress tensor $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$
(global) block, for which we derive an explicit expression. In the holographic
context, this object corresponds to a direct measure of nonlinear effects in
pure gravity. We calculate additional terms in the star channel identity block
that contribute at the same order at large $c$ as the global block using the
novel theory of reparametrizations, which extends the shadow operator formalism
in a natural way. We investigate these blocks' relevance to quantum chaos in
the form of six-point scrambling in an out-of time ordered correlator.
Interestingly, the global block does not contribute to the scrambling mode of
this correlator, implying that, to leading order, six-point scrambling is
insensitive to the three-point graviton coupling in the bulk dual. Finally, we
compare our findings with a different OPE channel, called the comb channel, and
find the same result for the chaos exponent in this decomposition.

the PSD cone, meaning that $\min_{\mathbf{B} \succeq 0} \|\mathbf{A} -
\mathbf{B}\|_F^2 > \epsilon n^2$, where $\mathbf{B} \succeq 0$ denotes that
$\mathbf{B}$ is PSD. Our main algorithmic contribution is a non-adaptive tester
which distinguishes between these cases using only $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^4)$

this related problem, we give a $\tilde{O}(1/\epsilon^2)$ query tester, which
we show is optimal up to $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factors. Our testers randomly
sample a collection of principal submatrices and check whether these
submatrices are PSD. Consequentially, our algorithms achieve one-sided error:
whenever they output that $\mathbf{A}$ is not PSD, they return a certificate
that $\mathbf{A}$ has negative eigenvalues.
  We complement our upper bound for PSD testing with Euclidean norm distance by
giving a $\tilde{\Omega}(1/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for any non-adaptive

lower bounds for a number of spectral testing problems. As an example of the
applicability of our construction, we obtain a new
$\tilde{\Omega}(1/\epsilon^4)$ sampling lower bound for testing the
Schatten-$1$ norm with a $\epsilon n^{1.5}$ gap, extending a result of Balcan,
Li, Woodruff, and Zhang [SODA'19]. In addition, it yields new sampling lower
bounds for estimating the Ky-Fan Norm, and the cost of the best rank-$k$

  algorithm solves the left recursion and error recovery problems","Submitted to ACM",,,,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A recursive descent parser is built from a set of mutually-recursive
functions, where each function directly implements one of the nonterminals of a
grammar. A packrat parser uses memoization to reduce the time complexity for
recursive descent parsing from exponential to linear in the length of the
input. Recursive descent parsers are extremely simple to write, but suffer from
two significant problems: (i) left-recursive grammars cause the parser to get
stuck in infinite recursion, and (ii) it can be difficult or impossible to
optimally recover the parse state and continue parsing after a syntax error.
Both problems are solved by the pika parser, a novel reformulation of packrat
parsing as a dynamic programming algorithm, which requires parsing the input in
reverse: bottom-up and right to left, rather than top-down and left to right.
This reversed parsing order enables pika parsers to handle grammars that use
either direct or indirect left recursion to achieve left associativity,
simplifying grammar writing, and also enables optimal recovery from syntax
errors, which is a crucial property for IDEs and compilers. Pika parsing
maintains the linear-time performance characteristics of packrat parsing as a
function of input length. The pika parser was benchmarked against the
widely-used Parboiled2 and ANTLR4 parsing libraries. The pika parser performed
significantly better than the other parsers for an expression grammar, although
for a complex grammar implementing the Java language specification, a large
constant performance impact was incurred per input character. Therefore, if
performance is important, pika parsing is best applied to simple to
moderate-sized grammars, or to very large inputs, if other parsing alternatives
do not scale linearly in the length of the input. Several new insights into
precedence, associativity, and left recursion are presented.

fluid pressure. Recently, another approach to study incompressible fluid flow
was suggested. It consists in using a general pressure equation (GPE) derived
from compressible Navier-Stokes equation. In this paper, GPE is considered and
compared with the Chorin's artificial compressibility method (ACM) and the
Entropically damped artificial compressibility (EDAC) method. The three methods
are discretized in a staggered grid system with second order centered schemes
in space and a third order Runge-Kutta scheme in time. Three test cases are
realized: two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex flow, the traveling wave and the
doubly periodic shear layers. It is demonstrated that GPE is accurate and
efficient to capture the correct behavior for unsteady incompressible flows.
The numerical results obtained by GPE are in excellent agreement with those
obtained by ACM, EDAC and a classical finite volume method with a Poisson
equation. Furthermore, GPE convergence is better than ACM convergence. The
proposed general pressure equation (GPE) allows to solve general, time-accurate
, incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Finally, the parametric study realized in
terms of Mach and Prandtl numbers shows that the velocity divergence can be
limited by an arbitrary maximum and that acoustic waves can be damped.

cases, we apply, for a short initial time interval, monochromatic forcing at a
certain wave number so that the correlation length is finite, but much smaller
than the typical length scale of turbulence. In particular, we investigate the
decay of nonhelical and helical hydromagnetic turbulence. We show that, in the
presence of a homogeneous magnetic field, the decay of helical and nonhelical
small-scale fields can occur rapidly. This is a special property of a system
with a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field, which is sometimes considered as a
local approximation to a slowly varying background field. It can never change
and acts as an imposed magnetic field. This is in a sharp contrast to the case
of a statistically homogeneous magnetic field, where we recover familiar decay
properties: a much slower decay of magnetic energy and a faster growth of the
correlation length, especially in the case with magnetic felicity. The result
suggests that a homogeneous magnetic field, if generated during inflation,

a given $M_{\rm core}$, they exhibit a small variation in luminosity (0.02 dex)
and $T_{\rm eff}$ ($\sim 400\,\mathrm{K}$) over a wide range of $M_{\rm env}$
($\sim 2 - 20\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). This means that it is not possible to
derive red supergiant masses from luminosities and $T_{\rm eff}$ alone. We
derive the following relationship between $M_{\rm core}$ and the total
luminosity of a red supergiant during core He burning: $\log M_{\rm core}
\simeq 0.44 \log L/L_{\odot} - 1.38$. At $M_{\rm core}$/$M_{\rm total} \approx
0.2$, our models exhibit a bi-stability and jump from a RSG to a BSG structure.
Our models with $M_{\rm core}/M_{\rm total} > 0.8$, which correspond to
stripped stars produced by mass loss or binary interaction, show that $T_{\rm
eff}$ has a strong dependence on $M_{\rm env}$, $M_{\rm core}$ and the core
composition. We find the mass of one of these stripped stars in a binary
system, HD 45166, to be less than its dynamical mass. When a large
observational sample of stripped stars becomes available, our results can be
used to constrain their masses and the physics of binary interaction.

various challenges for filtering specific areas of data for use in interactive

this paper we propose using Hilbert Curves simultaneously for spatial indexing
and as a polygonal ROI representation. This is achieved by using a series of
Hilbert Curves[2] creating an efficient and inherently spatially-indexed
machine-usable form. The distinctive property of Hilbert curves that enables
both mask and polygon delimitation of ROIs is that the elements of the vector

quantum and classical many-body systems, to galaxy formation or neural
dynamics. Two characteristic phenomena are length scales that exceed the
characteristic interaction length and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Recent
advances in integrated photonics indicate that the study of emergent phenomena
is possible in complex coupled nonlinear optical systems. Here we demonstrate
that out-of-equilibrium driving of a strongly coupled (""dimer"") pair of
photonic integrated Kerr microresonators, which at the ""single-particle"" (i.e.
individual resonator) level generate well understood dissipative Kerr solitons,
exhibit emergent nonlinear phenomena. By exploring the dimer phase diagram, we
find unexpected and therefore unpredicted regimes of soliton hopping,
spontaneous symmetry breaking, and periodically emerging (in)commensurate
dispersive waves. These phenomena are not included in the single-particle
description and related to the parametric frequency conversion between
hybridized supermodes. Moreover, by controlling supermode hybridization
electrically, we achieve wide tunability of spectral interference patterns
between dimer solitons and dispersive waves. Our findings provide the first
critical step towards the study of emergent nonlinear phenomena in soliton
networks and multimode lattices.

description of the major kinematic features of galaxies over a wide range of
morphological types. We present Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson relations
showing that the galaxy stellar mass scales with both V and $\sigma$ for both
components of all galaxy types. We find a tight Faber-Jackson relation even for
the disk component. We show that the bulge and disk components are
kinematically distinct: (1) the two components show scaling relations with
similar slopes, but different intercepts; (2) the spin parameter $\lambda_R$
indicates bulges are pressure-dominated systems and disks are supported by
rotation; (3) the bulge and disk components have, respectively, low and high

same-flavour, different-flavour leptons and leptons-quarks, most of which
cannot be realized in any other foreseeable experiment. The lepton densities in
the proton are extremely small, so that their contribution to Standard Model
processes is generally shadowed by processes initiated by coloured partons. We
will show, however, that there are cases where these processes can be relevant,
giving rise to rare Standard Model signatures and to new production channels,
that can enlarge the discovery potential of New Physics at the LHC and future

was located in an incomplete region of sky in the DES Y2Q1 data set and was
flagged due to potential blue horizontal branch member stars. The best fit

between the spin vector of a halo and the orbital angular momentum vector of
its neighbor) provides an important clue to how galactic angular momenta
develop. In particular, we identify virial-radius-wise contact halo pairs with
mass ratios from 1/3 to 3 in a set of cosmological $N$-body simulations, and
divide them into merger and flyby subsamples according to their total
(kinetic+potential) energy. In the spin$-$orbit angle distribution, we find a
significant SOA in that $75.0\pm0.6$ % of merging neighbors and $58.7\pm0.6$ %
of flybying neighbors are on the prograde orbit. The overall SOA of our sample
is mainly driven by fast-rotating halos, corroborating that a well-aligned
interaction spins a halo faster. More interestingly, we find for the first time
a strong number excess of nearly perpendicular but still prograde interactions
($\sim75^{\circ}$) in the spin$-$orbit angle distribution for both the merger
and flyby cases. Such prograde-polar interactions predominate for slow-rotating
halos, testifying that misaligned interactions reduce the halos' spin. The
frequency of the prograde-polar interactions correlates with the halo mass, yet
anticorrelates with the large-scale density. This instantly invokes the
spin-flip phenomenon that is conditional on the mass and environment. The
prograde-polar interaction will soon flip the spin of a slow-rotator to align
with its neighbor's orbital angular momentum. Finally, we propose a scenario
that connects the SOA to the ambient large-scale structure based on the
spin-flip argument.

holographic models with broken translations. We verify numerically that, in
holographic systems with momentum dissipation, the viscosity to entropy bound
might be violated but the shear diffusion constant remains bounded by below.
This confirms the idea that $\eta/s$ loses its privileged role in
non-relativistic systems and that, in order to find more universal bounds, one
should rather look at diffusion constants. We strengthen this idea by showing
that, in presence of spontaneously broken translations, the Goldstone diffusion
constant satisfies a universal lower bound in terms of the Planckian relaxation
time and the butterfly velocity. Additionally, all the diffusive processes in
the model satisfy an upper bound, imposed by causality, which is given in terms
of the thermalization time -- the imaginary part of the first non-hydrodynamic
mode in the spectrum -- and the speed of longitudinal sound. Finally, we
discuss the existence of a bound on the speed of sound in holographic conformal
solids and we show that the conformal value acts as a lower (and not upper)
bound on the speed of longitudinal phonons. Nevertheless, we show that the
stiffness $\partial p/\partial \epsilon$ is still bounded by above by its
conformal value. This suggests that the bounds conjectured in the past have to
be considered on the stiffness of the system, related to its equation of state,

Using a novel
approach, we derive the galaxy power spectrum taking into account all the

survey geometry that relativistic effects yield no divergent terms
(proportional to $k^{-4}P_m(k)$ or $k^{-2}P_m(k)$ on all scales) that would
mimic the signal of primordial non-Gaussianity. This cancellation of such
divergent terms is indeed expected from the equivalence principle, meaning that
any perturbation acting as a uniform gravity on the scale of the experiment
cannot be measured. We find that the unphysical infrared divergence obtained in
previous calculations occurred only due to not considering all general
relativistic contributions consistently. Despite the absence of divergent
terms, general relativistic effects represented by non-divergent terms alter
the galaxy power spectrum at large scales (smaller than the horizon scale). In
our numerical computation of the full galaxy power spectrum, we show the
deviations from the standard redshift-space power spectrum due to these
non-divergent corrections. We conclude that, as relativistic effects
significantly alter the galaxy power spectrum at $k\lesssim k_{eq}$, they need
to be taken into account in the analysis of large-scale data.

and magnitudes and colours are obtained from the Pan-STARRS1 Data Release 2

local linear regression in a 5-dimensional magnitude and colour space. Our
method achieves an average bias of $\overline{\Delta z_{\rm norm}}=-2.01 \times

outlier rate of $P_o=4.32\%$ when cross-validating on the training set. Even

comprehensive theoretical study of the interplay between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound

of an Anderson model with broken spin degeneracy and nonequilibrium Green's
function techniques that allows us to describe the electronic transport through
a magnetic impurity coupled to superconducting leads for arbitrary junction
transparency. Using this combination we are able to elucidate the different
tunneling processes that give a significant contribution to the subgap
transport. In particular, we predict the occurrence of a large variety of
Andreev reflections mediated by Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states that clearly
differ from the standard Andreev processes in non-magnetic systems. Moreover,
we provide concrete guidelines on how to experimentally identify the subgap
features originating from these tunneling events. Overall, our work provides
new insight into the role of the spin degree of freedom in Andreev transport
physics.

could protect a compactification against decay to nothing seem to be absent in
string compactifications once supersymmetry is broken. The topological
obstruction lies in a bordism group and, surprisingly, it can disappear even
for a SUSY-compatible spin structure. As a proof of principle, we construct an
explicit bubble of nothing for a $T^3$ with completely periodic
(SUSY-compatible) spin structure in an Einstein dilaton Gauss-Bonnet theory,
which arises in the low-energy limit of certain heterotic and type II flux
compactifications. Without the topological protection, supersymmetric
compactifications are purely stabilized by a Coleman-deLuccia mechanism, which
relies on a certain local energy condition. This is violated in our example by
the nonsupersymmetric GB term. In the presence of fluxes this energy condition
gets modified and its violation might be related to the Weak Gravity
Conjecture. We expect that our techniques can be used to construct a plethora
of new bubbles of nothing in any setup where the low-energy bordism group
vanishes, including type II compactifications on $CY_3$, AdS flux
compactifications on 5-manifolds, and M-theory on 7-manifolds. This lends
further evidence to the conjecture that any non-supersymmetric vacuum of
quantum gravity is ultimately unstable.

compare the ensemble timing results to NG12.5 by examining the timing

produce encouragingly similar results to those from NG12.5. In certain cases,

scintillating, wideband timing techniques prove to be beneficial, leading to
more precise timing model parameters by 10-15%. The high-precision, multi-band

the narrowband analysis in NG12.5, the TOA volume is reduced by a factor of 33,

establish correctness of CFL-reachability over graphs with inverse edges
(inverse edges are necessary for the handling of mutable heap data). Our
approach combines CFL-reachability with reference immutability to avoid the
addition of certain infeasible inverse edges and we demonstrate empirically
that avoiding those edges results in precision improvement. Our formal account
of correctness extends to this case as well. Third, we present a type-based

the free eccentricity $e_{\rm free}$ at the epicyclic frequency $\kappa_0$,
forced eccentricity $e_{\rm forced}$ at the mean motion $n_0$, and oscillations
at higher frequencies forced by the non-axisymmetric components of the binary's

a number of contexts in strong-coupling QED. We show that the approach proposed
recently in Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019) rests on an incorrect mathematical
assertion and so does not resolve gauge non-invariance. It produces new
two-level models that are not equivalent in different gauges. The new
Coulomb-gauge model is inaccurate for the regimes considered in Nature Physics
15, 803 (2019), for which the multipolar-gauge quantum Rabi model is accurate.
The models analysed in Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019) do not result from the
argument provided in the main text, but instead from truncation within the
multipolar-gauge followed by the application of a truncated phase-invariance
principle. More generally, this principle can be applied following truncation
in any gauge and it yields an equivalence class of truncated models within the
gauge chosen. Equivalence classes belonging to different gauges are not
equivalent and the truncated phase-invariance principle does not provide an
argument to prefer a particular class. In general, the optimal class depends on
the physical situation, including the observables, the parameter regime, and
the number of field modes being considered. We also emphasise that
gauge-ambiguities are not synonymous with gauge non-invariance due to
approximations. Independent of material truncation subsystem predictions can be
vastly different depending on the theoretical definitions of the subsystems,
which are controlled by the gauge choice. This constitutes an example of
vector-space relativity that in no way contradicts gauge-invariance. However,
within ultrastrong-coupling regimes this relativity can no longer be ignored.

avoiding the usual higher order correction terms, making the expression easier
to work with and more natural. Our approximations apply to all controlled

the existence of topological order in open systems and their phase transitions

formulation can be easily deployed in molecular dynamics simulation codes. We
illustrate the method by applying it to the estimation of the hydration free
energy in water droplets of compounds of varying size and complexity. In each

and the integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs), such as
photo-voltaic panels and energy storage devices, have gained substantial
momentum, especially at the grid edge. Transformation in the technological
aspects of the grid could directly conflict with existing distribution utility
retail tariff structures. We propose a smart meter data-driven rate model to
recover distribution network-related charges, where the implementation of these
grid-edge technologies is aligned with the interest of the various stakeholders
in the electricity ecosystem. The model envisions a shift from charging
end-users based on their KWh volumetric consumption, towards charging them a
""grid access fee"" that approximates the impact of end-users' time-varying
demand on their local distribution network. The proposed rate incorporates two
cost metrics affecting distribution utilities (DUs), namely 'magnitude' and
'variability' of customer demand. The proposed rate can be applied to prosumers
and conventional consumers without DERs.

increased user-traffic demands in the next generation wireless technologies.
Traditionally, the system relies on channel state information (CSI) of the
users for optimizing the resource allocation, which becomes costly for
fast-varying channel conditions. Considering that future wireless technologies
will be based on dense network deployment, where the mobile terminals are in
line-of-sight of the transmitters, the position information of terminals
provides an alternative to estimate the channel condition. In this work, we
propose a coordinates-based resource allocation scheme using supervised machine
learning techniques, and investigate how efficiently this scheme performs in
comparison to the traditional approach under various propagation conditions. We
consider a simplistic system set up as a first step, where a single transmitter
serves a single mobile user. The performance results show that the
coordinates-based resource allocation scheme achieves a performance very close
to the CSI-based scheme, even when the available coordinates of terminals are
erroneous. The proposed scheme performs consistently well with realistic-system
simulation, requiring only 4 s of training time, and the appropriate resource
allocation is predicted in less than 90 microseconds with a learnt model of

with subadditive valuations in a fair and efficient manner. Envy-Freeness up to

indivisible goods. Although the existence of EFX is not known beyond the simple
case of two agents with subadditive valuations, some good approximations of EFX
are known to exist, namely $\tfrac{1}{2}$-EFX allocation and EFX allocations
with bounded charity.
  Nash welfare (the geometric mean of agents' valuations) is one of the most
commonly used measures of efficiency. In case of additive valuations, an
allocation that maximizes Nash welfare also satisfies fairness properties like
Envy-Free up to one good (EF1). Although there is substantial work on
approximating Nash welfare when agents have additive valuations, very little is
known when agents have subadditive valuations. In this paper, we design a
polynomial-time algorithm that outputs an allocation that satisfies either of
the two approximations of EFX as well as achieves an $\mathcal{O}(n)$

best-known approximation of $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ and $\mathcal{O}(m)$ to
Nash welfare when agents have submodular and subadditive valuations,

compact object binary merger, GW190412, as the first asymmetric binary black
hole (BBH) merger with mass ratio $q\approx0.25$. Other than the mass ratio,
this BBH has shown to have a positive effective spin of around $\chi_{\rm
eff}\approx0.28$. Assuming a field formation channel, associating this
effective spin to either the primary or the secondary BH each has its
implications: If the spin of the BBH comes form the primary BH, it has
consequences for the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the formation
of the BH. If, on the other hand, the spin is due to the secondary BH through
tidal spin-up processes, one has to note that (i) such processes have very
short delay-times, and (ii) subsequently, their local merger rate is determined
by local star formation rate at assumed formation metallicity of the BBH. We
show that the predicted merger rate density from this channel is $\lesssim
0.3~\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ and in tension with the rather high local merger rate
of such systems which we estimate from this single event to be $\sim
1.7^{+2.5}_{-1.4}~\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}$ (90\% confidence interval, and assuming
50 days of observing time). Large natal kicks ($v\gtrsim 500\,{\rm km/s}$)
would be required to get such BBHs with an in-plane spin component to account
for the marginal detection of precession in GW190412. However, this would only
exacerbate the tension as the estimated local merger rate would be further
decreased. Similarly, the formation of such systems through the dynamical
assembly is exceedingly rare, leaving this system a dilemma hard to account for
with the currently accepted paradigms of BBH formation.

the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as
an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong
lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a
short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long
period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to
normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal
scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is
released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures

Earth's biosphere, yet at levels much lower than what thermodynamics would
allow for. I propose here that photosynthesis is nevertheless thermodynamically
limited, but this limit acts indirectly on the material exchange of water and
carbon dioxide. I substantiate this interpretation using global
observation-based datasets of radiation, photosynthesis, precipitation and
evaporation. I first calculate the conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in
terrestrial ecosystems and its climatological variation, with a median
efficiency of 0.78% (n = 13445). The rates tightly correlate with evaporation
(r2 = 0.89), which demonstrates the importance of the coupling of
photosynthesis to material exchange. I then infer evaporation from the maximum
material exchange between the surface and the atmosphere that is
thermodynamically possible using datasets of solar radiation and precipitation.
This inferred rate closely correlates with the observation-based evaporation
dataset (r2 = 0.85). When this rate is converted back into photosynthetic
activity, the resulting patterns correlate highly with the observation-based
dataset (r2 = 0.56). This supports the interpretation that it is not energy
directly that limits terrestrial photosynthesis, but rather the material
exchange that is driven by sunlight. This interpretation can explain the very
low, observed conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems
as well as its spatial variations. More generally, this implies that one needs
to take the necessary material flows and exchanges associated with life into
account to understand the thermodynamics of life. This, ultimately, requires a
perspective that links the activity of the biosphere to the thermodynamic
constraints of transport processes in the Earth system.

halo mass which can host ionizing sources, $M_{\rm min}$, (2) the number of
ionizing photons escaping into the IGM per baryon within the halo, $N_{\rm
ion}$ and (3) the mean free path of the ionizing photons within the IGM,
$R_{\rm mfp}$. We predict the accuracy with which these parameters can be

upcoming SKA-Low. Unlike several earlier works, we account for the
non-Gaussianity of the inherent EoR 21-cm signal. Considering cosmic variance
only and assuming that foregrounds are completely removed, we find that
non-Gaussianity increases the volume of the $1 \sigma$ error ellipsoid of the

orientation is also different. The ratio of the volume of error ellipsoids is
$1.65$ and $2.67$ for observation times of $1024$ and $10000$ hours

0.5-13%. This variation is likely due to both pathogen and host factors. Host
factors may include genetic differences in the immune response genes as well as
variation in HLA and KIR allotypes. To better understand what impact these
genetic variants in immune response genes may have in the differences observed
in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2, a quantitative analysis of a dynamical
systems model that considers both, the magnitude of viral growth, and the
subsequent innate and adaptive response required to achieve control of

posited that the spectrum of symptomatic to severely symptomatic presentations
of COVID19 represents the balance between innate and adaptive immune responses.
In asymptomatic patients, prompt and adequate adaptive immune response quells
infection, whereas in those with severe symptoms a slower inadequate adaptive
response leads to a runaway cytokine cascade fueled by ongoing viral
replication. Polymorphisms in the various components of the innate and adaptive
immune response may cause altered immune response kinetics that would result in
variable severity of illness. Understanding how this genetic variation may

their implication on axion physics. We outline the specific challenges posed by
lattice topology, the different proposals for handling them, the observable
effects of topology on the QCD spectrum and its interrelation with chiral and
axial symmetries. We review the transition to the Quark Gluon Plasma, the fate
of topology at the transition, and the approach to the high temperature limit.
We discuss the extrapolations needed to reach the regime of cosmological
relevance, and the resulting constraints on the QCD axion.

which complex macroscopic behaviour--whether electromagnetic, thermal, or
mechanical--arises from modular substructure. Simulation and optimization of
these materials are computationally challenging, as rich substructures
necessitate high-fidelity finite element meshes to solve the governing PDEs. To
address this, we leverage parametric modular structure to learn component-level
surrogates, enabling cheaper high-fidelity simulation. We use a neural network
to model the stored potential energy in a component given boundary conditions.
This yields a structured prediction task: macroscopic behavior is determined by
the minimizer of the system's total potential energy, which can be approximated
by composing these surrogate models. Composable energy surrogates thus permit
simulation in the reduced basis of component boundaries. Costly ground-truth
simulation of the full structure is avoided, as training data are generated by
performing finite element analysis with individual components. Using dataset
aggregation to choose training boundary conditions allows us to learn energy
surrogates which produce accurate macroscopic behavior when composed,
accelerating simulation of parametric meta-materials.

calculation of a) tomographic weak lensing band-power spectra, and b)
coefficients of summary data massively compressed with the MOPED algorithm. In
the former case cosmological parameter inference is accelerated by a factor of
$\sim 10$-$30$ compared to explicit calls to the Boltzmann solver CLASS when
applied to KiDS-450 weak lensing data. Much larger gains will come with future
data, where with MOPED compression, the speed up can be up to a factor of $\sim
10^3$ when the common Limber approximation is used. Furthermore, the GP opens
up the possibility of dropping the Limber approximation, without which the
theoretical calculations may be unfeasibly slow. A potential advantage of GPs
is that an error on the emulated function can be computed and this uncertainty
incorporated into the likelihood. If speed is of the essence, then the mean of
the Gaussian Process can be used and the uncertainty ignored. We compute the
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the emulator likelihood and the CLASS
likelihood, and on the basis of this and from analysing the uncertainties on
the parameters, we find that in this case, the inclusion of the GP uncertainty
does not justify the extra computational expense in the test application. For
future weak lensing surveys such as Euclid and Legacy Survey of Space and
Telescope (LSST), the number of summary statistics will be large, up to $\sim
10^{4}$. The speed of MOPED is determined by the number of parameters, not the
number of summary data, so the gains are very large. In the non-Limber case,
the speed-up can be a factor of $\sim 10^5$, provided that a fast way to
compute the theoretical MOPED coefficients is available. The GP presented here
provides such a fast mechanism and enables MOPED to be employed.

availability of face masks on 11 May, when the lockdown was partially lifted,

operating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018,
Twitter released data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave
of research. However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of
these trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed
their Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address
this gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls.
We first perform a descriptive analysis, and then focus in on the trolls'
operation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.
  Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag
campaigns (where hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political
sentiments of such campaigns were praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing
Ukraine (26%), and criticizing the United States and Obama (9%). Further,
trolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets or
containing a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of
tweeting suggesting that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that
trolls' information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of
tweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were
likely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about
49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for
the crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as
news. Interestingly, trolls promoted inconsistent alternative theories for the
crash.

topological insulator requires the bulk band gap to vanish. In the case of
noncentrosymmetric materials, these phases are separated by a gapless Weyl
semimetal phase. However, at finite temperature, the gap is affected by atomic
motion, through electron-phonon interaction, and by thermal expansion of the
lattice. As a consequence, the phase space of topologically nontrivial phases
is affected by temperature. In this paper, the pressure and temperature
dependence of the indirect band gap of BiTeI is investigated from first
principles. We evaluate the contribution from both electron-phonon interaction
and thermal expansion, and show that their combined effect drives the
topological phase transition towards higher pressures with increasing
temperature. Notably, we find that the sensitivity of both band extrema to
pressure and topology for electron-phonon interaction differs significantly
according to their leading orbital character. Our results indicate that the
Weyl semimetal phase width is increased by temperature, having almost doubled
by 100 K when compared to the static lattice results. Our findings thus provide
a guideline for experimental detection of the nontrivial phases of BiTeI and
illustrate how the phase space of the Weyl semimetal phase in

a permutation test, which compares the observed data with randomly permuted

half-life and the decay energy. Initially restricted to $\alpha$ decay of

This motivates investigating to what extent such generalizations are possible.
We also examine whether there exists a universal Geiger-Nuttall Law that can
simultaneously describe all decay modes and nuclei including heavy clusters. We
show that the validity of Geiger-Nuttall Law and its generalizations hinges on
the assumption that half-life can be approximated linearly as a function of the
square root of the ratio of the decay energy to the Coulomb barrier height.
Systematic calculation of the ratio across the nuclear chart for 12 decay modes
reveals that it varies over its whole range between 0 and 1. Consequently, no
linear approximation can unify all the nuclei and decay modes under a single
set of coefficients, and thus no universal Geiger-Nuttall Law is possible in
contrast to previous claims. In cluster decay, the ratio varies within 0.6-1
where non-linearity becomes significant such that no generalized Geiger-Nuttall
description of heavy clusters is possible. In the ongoing attempts of
unification, it might be necessary to go beyond the Geiger-Nuttall Law and
incorporate additional terms proportional to the decay energy and/or its square

effect in $s$-wave superconductors where increasing the concentration of
impurities rapidly destroys superconductivity. For small Kondo temperature
$T_K$ the destruction of superconductivity is preceded by the reentrant
superconductivity at finite temperature range $T_{c2} < T < T_{c1}$, while the
normal phase reappears at $T<T_{c2} \sim T_K$. Here we explore the
superconducting phase in a periodic system modeled as the Anderson lattice with
additional attractive on-site (Hubbard) interaction $g$ acting on the
conduction band electrons. We solve the equations using dynamical mean field
theory which incorporates Kondo physics, while the pairing interaction is
treated on the static mean-field level. For large coupling $g$ we find
reentrant superconductivity which resembles the case with diluted impurities.
However, we find evidence that reentrant superconductivity is here not a
consequence of many-body correlations leading to the Kondo effect, but it
rather stems from a competition between the single-particle hybridization and
superconducting pairing. An insight into the spectral functions with in-gap
structures is obtained from an approximate noninteracting dual model whose

these approaches have limitations such as requiring rich semantic information,
category labels, and fixed order of items. Thus, they fail to effectively
determine compatibility when such information is not available. In this work,
we adopt a Relation Network (RN) to develop new compatibility learning models,
Fashion RN and FashionRN-VSE, that addresses the limitations of existing
approaches. FashionRN learns the compatibility of an entire outfit, with an
arbitrary number of items, in an arbitrary order. We evaluated our model using
a large dataset of 49,740 outfits that we collected from Polyvore website.
Quantitatively, our experimental results demonstrate state of the art
performance compared with alternative methods in the literature in both
compatibility prediction and fill-in-the-blank test. Qualitatively, we also
show that the item embedding learned by FashionRN indicate the compatibility
among fashion items.

problem for embedded systems due to a number of emerging trends in hardware,

understanding of embedded security it will be difficult for future engineers to
provide assurance for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Operational Technology
(OT) in wide ranging applications, from home automation and autonomous
transportation to medical devices and factory floors. Common to such
applications are cyberphysical risks and consequences stemming from a lack of
embedded security. The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a one-day
visioning workshop to explore these issues. The workshop focused on five major
application areas of embedded systems, namely (1) medical/wearable devices, (2)
autonomous systems (drones, vehicles, robots), (3) smart homes, (4) industry
and supply chain, and (5) critical infrastructure. This report synthesizes the
results of that workshop and develops a list of strategic goals for research
and education over the next 5-10 years.
  Embedded security in connected devices presents challenges that require a
broad look at the overall systems design, including human and societal
dimensions as well as technical. Particular issues related to embedded security
are a subset of the overall security of the application areas, which must also
balance other design criteria such as cost, power, reliability, usability and
function. Recent trends are converging to make the security of embedded systems
an increasingly important and difficult objective, requiring new
trans-disciplinary approaches to solve problems on a 5-10 year horizon.

  Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2020",,,,"cs.RO cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces Action Image, a new grasp proposal representation that
allows learning an end-to-end deep-grasping policy. Our model achieves $84\%$
grasp success on $172$ real world objects while being trained only in
simulation on $48$ objects with just naive domain randomization. Similar to
computer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the
idea that object features are invariant to translation in image space.
Therefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper
relationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context,
but is independent of the surrounding environment. Action Image represents a
grasp proposal as an image and uses a deep convolutional network to infer grasp
quality. We show that by using an Action Image representation, trained networks
are able to extract local, salient features of grasping tasks that generalize
across different objects and environments. We show that this representation
works on a variety of inputs, including color images (RGB), depth images (D),
and combined color-depth (RGB-D). Our experimental results demonstrate that
networks utilizing an Action Image representation exhibit strong domain
transfer between training on simulated data and inference on real-world sensor
streams. Finally, our experiments show that a network trained with Action Image
improves grasp success ($84\%$ vs. $53\%$) over a baseline model with the same

RSA recursion implements an alternating maximization for optimizing a tradeoff

dynamics of RSA recursion and disconfirm the conjecture that expected utility
is guaranteed to improve with recursion depth. Second, we show that RSA can be

negligible effect in the outer regions of the heliosphere. Recent works have
shown that the solar magnetic field may play a crucial role in collimating the
plasma in the heliosheath. Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations
of the heliotail indicated a latitudinal structure varying with energy in the
energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes. At energies ~1 keV, the ENA fluxes show an
enhancement at low latitudes and a deficit of ENAs near the poles. At energies
>2.7 keV, ENA fluxes had a deficit within low latitudes, and lobes of higher
ENA flux near the poles. This ENA structure was initially interpreted to be a
result of the latitudinal profile of the solar wind during solar minimum. We
extend the work of Kornbleuth et al. (2018) by using solar minimum-like
conditions and the recently developed SHIELD model. The SHIELD model couples
the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma solution with a kinetic description of
neutral hydrogen. We show that while the latitudinal profile of the solar wind
during solar minimum contributes to the lobes in ENA maps, the collimation by
the solar magnetic field is important in creating and shaping the two high
latitude lobes of enhanced ENA flux observed by IBEX. This is the first work to
explore the effect of the changing solar magnetic field strength on ENA maps.
Our findings suggest that IBEX is providing the first observational evidence of
the collimation of the heliosheath plasma by the solar magnetic field.

incremental adoption by the industry. We have implemented Ads.chain and made
the code publicly available. We assess the performance of Ads.chain through a
thorough analysis in a lab environment that emulates a real ad delivery process
at real-life throughputs. The obtained results show that Ads.chain can be
implemented with limited impact on the hardware resources and marginal delay
increments at the publishers lower than 0.20 milliseconds per ad space on
webpages and 2.6 milliseconds at the programmatic advertising platforms. These
results confirm that Ads.chain's impact on the user experience and the overall

has begun to see increased attention. Of particular interest in many
environments is debloating commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) software, which is
most commonly made available to end users as stripped binaries (i.e., neither
source code nor symbol-table/debugging information is available). Toward this
end, we created a system, called GenXGen[MC], that specializes stripped
binaries.
  Many aspects of the debloating problem can be addressed via techniques from
the literature on partial evaluation. However, applying such techniques to
real-world programs, particularly stripped binaries, involves non-trivial
state-management manipulations that have never been addressed in a completely
satisfactory manner in previous systems. In particular, a partial evaluator
needs to be able to (i) save and restore arbitrary program states, and (ii)
determine whether a program state is equal to one that arose earlier. Moreover,
to specialize stripped binaries, the system must also be able to handle program
states consisting of memory that is undifferentiated beyond the standard coarse
division into regions for the stack, the heap, and global data.
  This paper presents a new approach to state management in a program
specializer. The technique has been incorporated into GenXGen[MC], a novel tool
for producing machine-code generating extensions. Our experiments show that our
solution to issue (i) significantly decreases the space required to represent
program states, and our solution to issue (ii) drastically improves the time
for producing a specialized program (as much as 13,000x speedup).

is universal when nodes are given unique features. The analysis relies on the
introduced measure of communication capacity. Capacity measures how much
information the nodes of a network can exchange during the forward pass and
depends on the depth, message-size, global state, and width of the

the number of nodes so that a network can distinguish trees and quadratically
for general connected graphs. The derived bounds concern both worst- and
average-case behavior and apply to networks with/without unique features and
adaptive architecture -- they are also up to two orders of magnitude tighter

magnetizations between adjacent layers carry spin-triplet supercurrent under
certain conditions. The signature of the spin-triplet supercurrent is a
relatively slow decay of the maximum supercurrent as a function of the
thickness of the middle ferromagnetic layer. In this work we focus on junctions
where the middle magnetic layer is a [Co/Pd]$_N$ multilayer with perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA), while the outer two layers have in-plane anisotropy.
We compare junctions where the middle PMA layer is or is not configured as a
synthetic antiferromagnet (PMA-SAF). We find that the supercurrent decays much
more rapidly with increasing the number $N$ of [Co/Pd] bilayers in the PMA-SAF
junctions compared to the PMA junctions. Similar behavior is observed in
junctions containing [Co/Ni]$_N$ PMA multilayers. We model that behavior by
assuming that each Co/Pd or Co/Ni interface acts as a partial spin filter, so
that the spin-triplet supercurrent in the PMA junctions becomes more strongly
spin-polarized as $N$ increases while the supercurrent in the PMA-SAF junctions
is suppressed with increasing $N$. We also address a question raised in a
previous work regarding how much spin-singlet supercurrent is transmitted
through our nominally spin-triplet junctions. We do that by comparing
spin-triplet junctions with similar junctions where the order of the magnetic
layers has been shuffled. The results of this work are expected to be helpful

artificial sosiety model, where each agent has daily cycle and go office and
back home, every day. At the same time, infection spreads along SIR model. We
show both slow infection and short commuting can be realized with some
structures and vice versa. The most effective factor for such features is
modularity of society. In highly modular society, agents live around the
destined office, but agents commute long way to their office and can be
infected fast, in not modular society. The first infection point is one more
factor for the features. If the first infection takes place around the office,
infection spreads slower. On the contrary, if the first one takes place far
away from the office, infection can be fast. We show a design principle, high
modularity and sparsely distributed offices, for good society and discuss on
possible solutions in real society, where we live in.

high throughput and low latency connectivity between the UAV and a remote
command center. However, maintaining reliable aerial communication in the
mmWave bands is challenging due to the need to support high speed beam tracking
and overcome blockage. This paper provides a simulation study aimed at
assessing the feasibility of public safety UAV connectivity through a 5G link
at 28 GHz. Real flight motion traces are captured during maneuvers similar to
those expected in public safety settings. The motions traces are then
incorporated into a detailed mmWave network simulator that models the channel,
blockage, beamforming and full 3GPP protocol stack. We show that 5G mmWave
communications can deliver throughput up to 1 Gbps with consistent sub ms
latency when the base station is located near the mission area, enabling remote
offloading of the UAV control and perception algorithms.

introduced and an optimal strategy for finding the $\rho$-th moment of guessing
cost is provided for a random variable taking values on a finite set whereby
each choice is associated with a positive finite cost value. Moreover, we drive
asymptotically tight upper and lower bounds on the moments of guessing cost.
Similar to previous studies on the standard guesswork, established bounds on
the moments of guessing cost quantify the accumulated cost of guesses required
for correctly identifying the unknown choice and are expressed in terms of the
R\'enyi's entropy. Moreover, new random variables are introduced to establish
connections between the guessing cost and the standard guesswork. After
establishing this implicit connection, further improved bounds are conjectured

guessing cost using optimal strategy by considering a sequence of independent
random variables with different cost distributions. Finally, with slight
modifications to the original problem, these results are shown to be useful for
bounding the overall repair bandwidth for distributed data storage systems

algorithm for solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs). The algorithm
decomposes the time domain into a set of overlapping subdomains, and solves all
subproblems defined over subdomains in parallel. The convergence is attained by
updating primal-dual information at the boundaries of overlapping subdomains.
We show that the algorithm exhibits local linear convergence, and that the
convergence rate improves exponentially with the overlap size. We also
establish global convergence results for a general quadratic programming, which
enables the application of the Schwarz scheme inside second-order optimization
algorithms (e.g., sequential quadratic programming). The theoretical foundation
of our convergence analysis is a sensitivity result of nonlinear OCPs, which we
call ""exponential decay of sensitivity"" (EDS). Intuitively, EDS states that the
impact of perturbations at domain boundaries (i.e. initial and terminal time)
on the solution decays exponentially as one moves into the domain. Here, we
expand a previous analysis available in the literature by showing that EDS
holds for both primal and dual solutions of nonlinear OCPs, under uniform
second-order sufficient condition, controllability condition, and boundedness
condition. We conduct experiments with a quadrotor motion planning problem and
a PDE control problem to validate our theory; and show that the approach is

trap driven at 1.6~GHz in a room-temperature ultra-high vacuum setup. Cold
electrons are introduced into the trap by ionization of atomic calcium via
Rydberg states and stay confined by microwave and static electric fields for
several tens of milliseconds. A fraction of these electrons remain trapped
longer and show no measurable loss for measurement times up to a second.
Electronic excitation of the motion reveals secular frequencies which can be
tuned over a range of several tens to hundreds of MHz. Operating a similar
electron Paul trap in a cryogenic environment may provide a platform for
all-electric quantum computing with trapped electron spin qubits.

Using the lens of quantum mechanics, we challenge this accepted fact of

critical step that estimates and tracks weak frequency components in noisy
signals. It is often challenging for the prior art of frequency tracking to
i)achieve a high accuracy under noisy conditions, ii)detect and track multiple
frequency components efficiently, or iii)strike a good trade-off of the
processing delay versus the resilience and the accuracy of tracking. To address
these issues, we propose Adaptive Multi-Trace Carving (AMTC), a unified
approach for detecting and tracking one or more subtle frequency components
under very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and in near real time.
AMTC takes as input a time-frequency representation of the system's
preprocessing results (such as the spectrogram), and identifies frequency
components through iterative dynamic programming and adaptive trace
compensation. The proposed algorithm considers relatively high energy traces
sustaining over a certain duration as an indicator of the presence of
frequency/oscillation components of interest and track their time-varying
trend. Extensive experiments using both synthetic data and real-world forensic
data of power signatures and physiological monitoring reveal that the proposed
method outperforms representative prior art under low SNR conditions, and can
be implemented in near real-time settings. The proposed AMTC algorithm can
empower the development of new information forensic technologies that harness
very small signals.

the development of lower noise and more reliable nanoelectronics and quantum

grows and changes during the oxidation simulation. Dynamic processes such as
the evolution of a charge gradient across the oxide, the formation of holes in
the oxide layer, and changes between amorphous and semi-crystalline phases are
observed. Our results are widely in agreement with previous work including
reported oxide densities, self-limiting of the oxidation, and increased
crystallinity as the simulation temperature is raised. The encapsulation of the
oxide with metal evaporation is also studied atom by atom. Low density regions
at the metal-oxide interfaces are a common feature in the final junction

interleaved fashion. The TSP solution (cyclic tour) is typically changed in a
deterministic way, while changes to the KP solution typically involve a random
search, effectively resulting in a quasi-meandering exploration of the TTP
solution space. Once a plateau is reached, the iterative search of the TTP
solution space is restarted by using a new initial TSP tour. We propose to make
the search more efficient through an adaptive surrogate model (based on a
customised form of Support Vector Regression) that learns the characteristics
of initial TSP tours that lead to good TTP solutions. The model is used to
filter out non-promising initial TSP tours, in effect reducing the amount of

considerable number of non-promising initial tours, at the cost of omitting

field and the mutual influence of the electric field and the liquid-crystal
director field on each other. The criteria show that formulas for the
instability thresholds of electric-field Freedericksz transitions cannot in all
cases be obtained from those for the analogous magnetic-field transitions by
simply replacing the magnetic parameters by the corresponding electric
parameters, contrary to claims in standard references. This finding is
consistent with [Arakelyan, Karayan, Chilingaryan, Sov. Phys. Dokl., 29 (1984)
202-204]. A simple analytical test is provided to determine when an
electric-field-induced instability can differ qualitatively from the analogous
magnetic field-induced instability. For the systems we study, it is found that
taking into account the full coupling between the electric field and the
director field can either elevate or leave unchanged an instability threshold
(never lower it), compared to the threshold provided by the magnetic-field
analogy. The physical mechanism that underlies the effect of elevating an
instability threshold is the added free energy associated with a first-order
change in the ground-state electric field caused by a perturbation of the
ground-state director field. Examples are given that involve classical
Freedericksz transitions and also periodic instabilities. The inclusion of
flexoelectric terms in the theory is studied, and it is found that these terms
are not capable of altering the instability thresholds of any of the classical
Freedericksz transitions, consistent with known results for splay transitions.

decompose multiple spectral information from the images. In this work, we
propose a novel multi-channel wavelet-based filtering method for GANs, to cope
with this problem. When embedding a wavelet deconvolution layer in the

deconvolution to learn a filtering with multiple channels, which can
efficiently homogenize the generated noise via an averaging operation, so as to
generate high-fidelity samples. We conducted benchmark experiments on the

We examine the evolution of the polariton number in the cavities starting from
a state with either one or two polaritons in one of the cavities. For the case
of a single polariton without disorder in the laser intensity, we calculate the
wavefunction of the polariton and find that it disperses away from the initial
cavity with time. The addition of disorder results in minimal suppression of
the dispersal of the wavefunction. In the case of two polaritons with an
on-site repulsion to hopping strength ratio of 20, we find that the polaritons
form a repulsively bound state or dimer. Without disorder the dimer
wavefunction disperses similarly to the single polariton wavefunction but over
a longer time period. The addition of sufficiently strong disorder results in
localization of the polariton dimer. The localization length is found to be
described by a power law with exponent -1.31. We also find that we can localise
the dimer at any given time by switching on the disorder.

oscillators are collectively locked in frequency and phase through mutual

appears due to the activation from thermal fluctuations. By performing
molecular dynamic simulations, we demonstrate the self-synchronization of
thermal phonons in a platform supporting doped silicon resonators. We find that
thermal phonons are spontaneously converging to the same frequency and phase.
In addition, the dependencies to intrinsic frequency difference and coupling
strength agree well with the Kuramoto model predictions. More interestingly, we
find that a balance between energy dissipation resulting from phonon-phonon
scattering and potential energy between oscillators is required to maintain
synchronization. Finally, a wavelet transform approach corroborates the

the experimental LLPS data on the wildtype, a charge-scrambled, an FtoA, and an
RtoK mutant of Ddx4 IDR. In contrast, interactions based on contact statistics
among folded globular protein structures reproduce the overall experimental
trend, including that the RtoK mutant has a much diminished LLPS propensity.
Consistency between simulation and LLPS experiment was also found for RtoK
mutants of P-granule protein LAF-1, underscoring that, to a degree, the
important LLPS-driving $\pi$-related interactions are embodied in classical
statistical potentials. Further elucidation will be necessary, however,
especially of phenylalanine's role in condensate assembly because experiments

are significantly weaker than those posited by common statistical potentials.
Protein-protein electrostatic interactions are modulated by relative
permittivity, which depends on protein concentration. Analytical theory
suggests that this dependence entails enhanced inter-protein interactions in
the condensed phase but more favorable protein-solvent interactions in the
dilute phase. The opposing trends lead to a modest overall impact on LLPS.

As a result, the critical low-level domain-dependent knowledge could be
explored appropriately. As far as we know, this is the first work to explore
the domain-wise convolutional channel activation for deep DA networks.
Moreover, to effectively align high-level feature distributions across two
domains, we further deploy domain conditioned feature correction blocks after
task-specific layers, which will explicitly correct the domain discrepancy.

low-dose computed tomography (LDCT). Popular ways to increase the network
capacity include adding more layers or repeating a modularized clone model in a
sequence. In such sequential architectures, the noisy input image and end
output image are commonly used only once in the training model, which however
limits the overall learning performance. In this paper, we propose a
parallel-clone neural network method that utilizes a modularized network model
and exploits the benefit of parallel input, parallel-output loss, and
clone-toclone feature transfer. The proposed model keeps a similar or less
number of unknown network weights as compared to conventional models but can
accelerate the learning process significantly. The method was evaluated using
the Mayo LDCT dataset and compared with existing deep learning models. The
results show that the use of parallel input, parallel-output loss, and
clone-to-clone feature transfer all can contribute to an accelerated
convergence of deep learning and lead to improved image quality in testing. The
parallel-clone network has been demonstrated promising for LDCT image
denoising.

Thompson Sampling~(TS) to maximize the total rewards and use virtual queue

\emph{TS with beta priors and Bernoulli likelihoods for CSMAB-F~(TSCSF-B)}.
Further, we prove TSCSF-B can satisfy the fairness constraints, and the
time-averaged regret is upper bounded by $\frac{N}{2\eta} +
O\left(\frac{\sqrt{mNT\ln T}}{T}\right)$, where $N$ is the total number of
arms, $m$ is the maximum number of arms that can be pulled simultaneously in
each round~(the cardinality constraint) and $\eta$ is the parameter trading off
fairness for rewards. By relaxing the fairness constraints (i.e., let $\eta

bound of TS algorithms for combinatorial sleeping multi-armed semi-bandit

dissimilarity between two text documents by computing the cost of moving all
words of a source/query document to the most similar words of a target document
optimally. Computing WMD between two documents is costly because it requires
solving an optimization problem that costs \(O(V^3log(V))\) where \(V\) is the
number of unique words in the document. Fortunately, the WMD can be framed as
the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) (also known as the Optimal Transportation
Distance) for which it has been shown that the algorithmic complexity can be
reduced to \(O(V^2)\) by adding an entropy penalty to the optimization problem

document against multiple target documents at once (e.g., finding whether a
given tweet is similar to any other tweets happened in a day). In this paper,
we present a shared-memory parallel Sinkhorn-Knopp Algorithm to compute the WMD

To scale out to achieve faster training speed, two update algorithms are mainly
applied in the distributed training process, i.e. the Synchronous SGD algorithm
(SSGD) and Asynchronous SGD algorithm (ASGD). SSGD obtains good convergence
point while the training speed is slowed down by the synchronous barrier. ASGD
has faster training speed but the convergence point is lower when compared to
SSGD. To sufficiently utilize the advantages of SSGD and ASGD, we propose a
novel technology named One-step Delay SGD (OD-SGD) to combine their strengths
in the training process. Therefore, we can achieve similar convergence point
and training speed as SSGD and ASGD separately. To the best of our knowledge,
we make the first attempt to combine the features of SSGD and ASGD to improve
distributed training performance. Each iteration of OD-SGD contains a global
update in the parameter server node and local updates in the worker nodes, the
local update is introduced to update and compensate the delayed local weights.
We evaluate our proposed algorithm on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets.
Experimental results show that OD-SGD can obtain similar or even slightly
better accuracy than SSGD, while its training speed is much faster, which even

We show that the volumetric rate of Galactic-FRB like events is consistent with
the faint end of the cosmological FRB rate, and hence they most likely belong
to the same class of transients. The Galactic FRB had an accompanying X-ray
burst but many X-ray bursts from the same object had no radio counterpart.
Their relative rates suggest that for every FRB there are roughly 10^2 to 10^3
X-ray bursts. The radio lightcurve of the galactic FRB had two spikes separated
by 30 ms in the 400-800 MHz frequency band. This is an important clue and
highly constraining of the class of models where the radio emission is produced
outside the light-cylinder of the magnetar. We suggest that magnetic
disturbances close to the magnetar surface propagate to a distance of a few
tens of neutron star radii where they damp and produce radio emission. The
coincident hard X-ray spikes associated with the two FRB pulses seen in this

this scenario. This model provides a unified picture for faint bursts like the

Interestingly, unlike the disorder effects on a topological trivial system that

first-order topologicalinsulators (3DFOTIs), DMs and AIs. At a weak disorder
when the on-site random potential of strength $W$ is below a low critical value
$W_{c1}$ at which the gap of surface states closes while the bulk sates are
still gapped, the system is a disordered 3DSOTI characterized by a constant
density of states and a quantized integer conductance of $e^2/h$ through its
chiral hinge states. The gap of the bulk states closes at a higher critical
disorder $W_{c2}$, and the system is a disordered 3DFOTI in a lower
intermediate disorder between $W_{c1}$ and $W_{c2}$ in which electron
conduction is through the topological surface states. The system becomes a DM

metal-to-insulator transition at $W_{c3}$ and becomes the conventional AI for

around Haumea is thought to affect the dynamics of the ring; however, the
process of ring formation has not been elucidated. In this study, we analyze in
some detail a potential ring formation scenario for Haumea. We first calculated
the gravitational field around the triaxial ellipsoid and estimated the
distance at which an object revolving around Haumea can exist stably using
simulation that incorporated the time-varying gravitational field. The results
of this simulation showed that the trajectory of the object became unstable
just inside its current ring position. Next, we analytically derived the Roche
radius for a rigid body revolving around a triaxial ellipsoid and showed that
the Roche radius could be near the current ring position. Furthermore, as a
parameter study, we performed N-body simulations using the coefficient of
rubble pile restitution as a variable. Results demonstrated that, according to
numerous parameters, the position of the Roche radius was near the current
position of Haumea's ring. Based on these findings, we can assume that there is
a high possibility that the ring formed in the region between the boundary of
the unstable region of the orbit and the Roche radius. The scenario presented
in this study could help explain the process by which Haumea's ring formed.

Quantum uncertainty and complementarity between momentum and position find
their epistemic origin from the trade-off between the mean squared errors of
simultaneous estimations of momentum field and mean position, with the Gaussian

demonstrate that our recognition network can not only recognize the text in the

a large scale, multiple fonts based data set for printed Urdu text
recognition;(ii) we have designed, trained and evaluated a CNN based model for

adjusting the magnitude of reflecting coefficients, the IRS can sustain its
operations by harvesting energy from the AP's signal beamforming. Considering
channel estimation errors, we model both the AP-IRS channel and the
AP-IRS-receiver as a cascaded channel by norm-based uncertainty sets. This
allows us to formulate a robust optimization problem to minimize the AP's
transmit power, subject to the user's worst-case data rate requirement and the
IRS's worst-case power budget constraint. Instead of using the alternating
optimization method, we firstly propose a heuristic scheme to decompose the
IRS's {phase shift} optimization and the AP's active beamforming. Based on
semidefinite relaxations of the worst-case constraints, we further devise an
iterative algorithm to optimize the AP's transmit beamforming and the magnitude
of the IRS's reflecting coefficients efficiently by solving a set of
semidefinite programs. Simulation results reveal that the AP requires a higher
transmit power to deal with the channel uncertainty. Moreover, the negative
effect of channel uncertainty can be alleviated by using a larger-size IRS.

choosing a dynamic strategy of making contacts, given the trade-off of gaining
utility but also risking infection from additional contacts. We compute and
compare the mean-field equilibrium (MFE) strategy, which assumes each
individual acting selfishly to maximize its own utility, to the socially

that the optimal decision of the infected is always to make more contacts than
the level at which it would be socially optimal, which reinforces the important
role of public policy to reduce contacts of the infected (e.g. quarantining,
sick paid leave). Additionally, we include cost to incentivize people to change
strategies, when computing the socially optimal strategies. We find that with
this cost, policies reducing contacts of the infected should be further
enforced after the peak of the epidemic has passed. Lastly, we compute the

Horizon NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (rhNEAT). Unlike traditional
Rolling Horizon Evolution, where an evolutionary algorithm is in charge of
evolving a sequence of actions, rhNEAT evolves weights and connections of a
neural network in real-time, planning several steps ahead before returning an
action to execute in the game. Different versions of the algorithm are explored
in a collection of 20 GVGAI games, and compared with other SFP methods and
state of the art results. Although results are overall not better than other
SFP methods, the nature of rhNEAT to adapt to changing game features has
allowed to establish new state of the art records in games that other methods
have traditionally struggled with. The algorithm proposed here is general and
introduces a new way of representing information within rolling horizon
evolution techniques.

reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted interference alignment
strategy to simultaneous mitigate the co-channel interference and cope with
rank-deficient channels, thereby improving the feasibility of interference
alignment conditions and in turn increasing the achievable DoFs. The key
enabler is a general low-rank optimization approach that maximizes the
achievable DoFs by jointly designing the phase-shift and transceiver matrices.
To address the unique challenges of the coupled optimization variables, we
develop a block-structured Riemannian pursuit method by solving fixed-rank and
unit modulus constrained least square subproblems along with rank increase.
Finally, to reduce the computational complexity and achieve good DoF
performance, we develop unified Riemannian conjugate gradient algorithms to
alternately optimize the fixed-rank transceiver matrix and the unit modulus
constrained phase shifter by exploiting the non-compact Stiefel manifold and
the complex circle manifold, respectively. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of deploying an RIS and the superiority of the proposed
block-structured Riemannian pursuit method in terms of the achievable DoFs and
the achievable sum rate.

known to follow a power-law, we investigated the power-law hypothesis in BS by
comparing it with alternative functions focusing on flattish periods and
developed a new method for detecting BS as an application of statistical model
in dogs. Young-adult 6 beagles and senior 6 beagles were anesthetized with
sevoflurane 2.0%-5.0% and three of 64 sec EEG (256 Hz) from Fpz-T4 via scalp
electrodes were recorded. Three thresholds for peak-to-peak voltage were set:
mean value of peak-to-peak voltage at sevoflurane 2.0% in each dog (AS2%),
3mcrV, and 5mcrV. The subthreshold periods were discriminated as $\tau$ events.
We fitted the empirical probability distribution of $\tau$ by a power-law
distribution and an exponential distribution. These two distributions were
compared by the normalized log-likelihood ratio test to see which distribution
was better fit. At sevoflurane 2.0%-3.0%, by any threshold, the exponential
distribution became better fit in all dogs. The power-law distribution became
better fit only when BS expressed on EEG. No strict threshold was required for
detection of onset of BS. We showed a transition from exponential behavior to
power-law behavior on the right tail of $\tau$ distributions in response to the
appearance of suppression waves with increasing anesthetic. This will be a
robust tool for BS detection.

the earliest phase of star formation. The evolution of these COMs from the
youngest Class 0/I protostellar phases toward the more evolved Class II phase
is still not fully understood. Since planet formation seems to start early, and
mature disks are too cold for characteristic COM emission lines, studying the
inventory of COMs on solar system scales in the Class 0/I stage is relevant.
ALMA Band 3 (3 mm) and Band 6 (1 mm) observations are obtained of seven Class 0
protostars in the Perseus and Serpens star-forming regions. By modeling the
inner protostellar region using 'LTE' models, the excitation temperature and
column densities are determined for several O-bearing COMs. B1-c, B1-bS, and
Serpens S68N show COM emission, i.e, three out of the seven sources. No clear
correlation seems to exist between the occurrence of COMs and source
luminosity. The abundances of several COMs with respect to CH3OH are remarkably
similar for the three COM-rich sources, and to IRAS 16293-2422B and HH 212. For
other COMs the abundances differ by up to an order of magnitude, indicating
that local source conditions are case determining. B1-c hosts a cold
($T_{ex}\approx60$ K), more extended component of COM emission with a column
density of typically a few % of the warm/hot ($T_{ex}\sim 200$ K), central
component. A D/H ratio of 1-3 % is derived based on the CH2DOH/CH3OH ratio
suggesting a temperature of $\sim$15~K during the formation of methanol. This
ratio is consistent with other low-mass protostars. Future mid-infrared
facilities such as JWST/MIRI will be essential to directly observe COM ices.
Combining this with a larger sample of COM-rich sources with ALMA will allow
for directly linking ice and gas-phase abundances in order to constrain the
routes that produce and maintain chemical complexity during the star formation
process.

classically. These have been used to demonstrate quantum supremacy: the
execution of a computational task on a quantum computer that is infeasible for
any classical computer. The task underlying the assertion of quantum supremacy
by Arute et al. (Nature, 574, 505--510 (2019)) was initially estimated to
require Summit, the world's most powerful supercomputer today, approximately
10,000 years. The same task was performed on the Sycamore quantum processor in
only 200 seconds.
  In this work, we present a tensor network-based classical simulation
algorithm. Using a Summit-comparable cluster, we estimate that our simulator
can perform this task in less than 20 days. On moderately-sized instances, we
reduce the runtime from years to minutes, running several times faster than
Sycamore itself. These estimates are based on explicit simulations of parallel
subtasks, and leave no room for hidden costs. The simulator's key ingredient is
identifying and optimizing the ""stem"" of the computation: a sequence of
pairwise tensor contractions that dominates the computational cost. This
orders-of-magnitude reduction in classical simulation time, together with
proposals for further significant improvements, indicates that achieving
quantum supremacy may require a period of continuing quantum hardware
developments without an unequivocal first demonstration.

and magnetic properties of condensed matter systems. For two-dimensional (2D)
systems, stray field measurements can even allow full determination of the
source quantity. For instance, a 2D map of the stray magnetic field can be
uniquely transformed into the 2D current density that gave rise to the field
and, under some conditions, into the equivalent 2D magnetisation. However,
implementing these transformations typically requires truncation of the initial
data and involves singularities that may introduce errors, artefacts, and
amplify noise. Here we investigate the possibility of mitigating these issues
through vector measurements. For each scenario (current reconstruction and
magnetisation reconstruction) the different possible reconstruction pathways
are analysed and their performances compared. In particular, we find that the
simultaneous measurement of both in-plane components ($B_x$ and $B_y$) enables
near-ideal reconstruction of the current density, without singularity or
truncation artefacts, which constitutes a significant improvement over
reconstruction based on a single component (e.g. $B_z$). On the other hand, for
magnetisation reconstruction, a single measurement of the out-of-plane field
($B_z$) is generally the best choice, regardless of the magnetisation
direction. We verify these findings experimentally using nitrogen-vacancy
magnetometry in the case of a 2D current density and a 2D magnet with
perpendicular magnetisation.

with PLA-aware attack strategies, an attacker can maximize the probability of
successfully impersonating the legitimate devices. In this paper, we provide
worst-case detection performance bounds under such strategies for a distributed
PLA scheme that is based on the channel-state information (CSI) observed at
multiple distributed remote radio-heads. This distributed setup exploits the
multiple-channel diversity for enhanced detection performance and mimics
distributed antenna architectures considered for 4G and 5G radio access

single-antenna attacker adopts optimal transmit power and phase; and (ii) an
optimal spatial position attack. Interestingly, our results show that the
attacker can achieve close-to-optimal success probability with only statistical
CSI, which significantly strengthens the relevance of our results for practical
scenarios. Furthermore, our results show that, by distributing antennas to
multiple radio-heads, the worst-case missed detection probability can be
reduced by 4 orders of magnitude without increasing the total number of
antennas, illustrating the superiority of distributed PLA over a co-located

three thousand years. Silica glass is resistant to heating and exposure to many
chemicals, and it is transparent in a wide wavelength range. Due to these
qualities, silica glass is used for a variety of applications that shape our
modern life, such as optical fibers in medicine and telecommunications.
However, its chemical stability and brittleness impede the structuring of
silica glass, especially on the small scale. Techniques for three-dimensional
(3D) printing of silica glass, such as stereolithography and direct ink
writing, have recently been demonstrated, but the achievable minimum feature
size is several tens of micrometers. While submicrometric silica-glass
structures have many interesting applications, for example in micro-optics,
they are currently manufactured using lithography techniques, which severely
limits the 3D shapes that can be realized. Here, we show 3D printing of
optically transparent silica-glass structures with submicrometric features. We
achieve this by cross-linking hydrogen silsesquioxane to silica glass using
nonlinear absorption of laser light followed by the dissolution of the
unexposed material. We print a functional microtoroid resonator with
out-of-plane fiber couplers to demonstrate the new possibilities for designing
and building silica-glass microdevices in 3D.

Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) in Darmstadt is to explore the
QCD phase diagram at high net baryon densities likely to exist in the core of
neutron stars. The CBM detector system is designed to perform
multi-differential measurements of hadrons and leptons in central gold-gold
collisions at beam energies between 2 and 11 A GeV with unprecedented precision
and statistics. In order to reduce the systematic errors of the lepton
measurements, which generally suffer from a large combinatorial background,
both electrons and muons will be measured with the same acceptance. Up to now,
no di-muon measurements have been performed in heavy-ion collisions at beam
energies below 158A GeV. The main device for electron identification, a Ring
Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector, can be replaced by a setup comprising hadron
absorbers and tracking detectors for muon measurements. In order to obtain a
complete picture of the reaction, it is important to measure simultaneously
leptons and hadrons. This requirement is fulfilled for the RICH, which has a
low material budget, and only little affects the trajectories of hadrons on
their way to the Time-of-Flight (TOF) detector. In contrast, the simultaneous
measurement of muons and hadrons within the same experimental acceptance poses
a substantial challenge. This article reviews the simulated performance of the
CBM experiment for muon identification, together with the possibility of
simultaneous hadron measurements.

  correspondences and fixed points","19 pages",,,,"econ.TH cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion of fault tolerant Nash equilibria has been introduced as a way of
studying the robustness of Nash equilibria. Under this notion, a fixed number
of players are allowed to exhibit faulty behavior in which they may deviate
arbitrarily from an equilibrium strategy. A Nash equilibrium in a game with $N$
players is said to be $\alpha$-tolerant if no non-faulty user wants to deviate
from an equilibrium strategy as long as $N-\alpha-1$ other players are playing
the equilibrium strategies, i.e., it is robust to deviations from rationality
by $\alpha$ faulty players. In prior work, $\alpha$-tolerance has been largely
viewed as a property of a given Nash equilibria. Here, instead we consider
following Nash's approach for showing the existence of equilibria, namely,
through the use of best response correspondences and fixed-point arguments. In
this manner, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence an
$\alpha$-tolerant equilibrium. This involves first defining an
$\alpha$-tolerant best response correspondence. Given a strategy profile of
non-faulty agents, this correspondence contains strategies for a non-faulty
player that are a best response given any strategy profile of the faulty
players. We prove that if this correspondence is non-empty, then it is
upper-hemi-continuous. This enables us to apply Kakutani's fixed-point theorem
and argue that if this correspondence is non-empty for every strategy profile
of the non-faulty players then there exists an $\alpha$-tolerant equilibrium.
However, we also illustrate by examples, that in many games this best response
correspondence will be empty for some strategy profiles even though
$\alpha$-tolerant equilibira still exist.

doubly-connected superconducting electrodes forming the junction generates a
persistent current whose associated magnetic field affects the both the static
and dynamics properties of the junctions. More specifically, the field trapped
in the hole of one electrode combined with a d.c. bias current induces a
viscous flow of dense trains of Josephson vortices which manifests itself
through the sequential appearance of displaced linear slopes, Fiske step
staircases and Eck steps in the junction's current-voltage characteristic.
Furthermore, a field shift is observed in the first lobe of the magnetic
diffraction pattern. The effects of the persistent current can be mitigated or
even canceled by an external magnetic field perpendicular to the junction
plane. The radial field associated with the persistent current can be
accurately modeled with the classical phenomenological sine-Gordon model for
extended one-dimensional Josephson junctions. Extensive numerical simulations
were carried out to disclose the basic flux-flow mechanism responsible for the

geometrical parameters. It was found that the imprint of the field cooling is
enhanced in confocal annular junctions which are the natural generalization of

not been fully investigated in the multivariate statistics framework. The
characteristics of IFs are small magnitudes and short durations, and
consequently traditional multivariate statistical methods using only a single
observation are no longer effective. Thus in this paper, moving average T^2
control charts (MA-TCCs) with multiple window lengths, which simultaneously
employ a bank of MA-TCCs with different window lengths, are proposed to address
the IF detection problem. Methods to reduce false/missing alarms and infer the
IFs' appearing and disappearing time instances are presented. In order to
analyze the detection capability for IFs, definitions of guaranteed
detectability are introduced, which is an extension and generalization of the
original fault detectability concept focused on permanent faults (PFs). Then,
necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for the detectability of IFs,
which may appear and disappear several times with different magnitudes and
durations. Based on these conditions, some optimal properties of two important
window lengths are further discussed. In this way, a theoretical framework for
the analysis of IFs' detectability is established as well as extended
discussions on how the theoretical results can be adapted to real-world
applications. Finally, simulation studies on a numerical example and the
continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process are carried out to show the
effectiveness of the developed methods.

  Testing and Analysis (ISSTA), 2020",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Software testing is sometimes plagued with intermittently failing tests and
finding the root causes of such failing tests is often difficult. This problem
has been widely studied at the unit testing level for open source software, but
there has been far less investigation at the system test level, particularly
the testing of industrial embedded systems. This paper describes our
investigation of the root causes of intermittently failing tests in the
embedded systems domain, with the goal of better understanding, explaining and
categorizing the underlying faults. The subject of our investigation is a
currently-running industrial embedded system, along with the system level
testing that was performed. We devised and used a novel metric for classifying
test cases as intermittent. From more than a half million test verdicts, we
identified intermittently and consistently failing tests, and identified their
root causes using multiple sources. We found that about 1-3% of all test cases
were intermittently failing. From analysis of the case study results and
related work, we identified nine factors associated with test case
intermittence. We found that a fix for a consistently failing test typically
removed a larger number of failures detected by other tests than a fix for an
intermittent test. We also found that more effort was usually needed to
identify fixes for intermittent tests than for consistent tests. An overlap
between root causes leading to intermittent and consistent tests was
identified. Many root causes of intermittence are the same in industrial
embedded systems and open source software. However, when comparing unit testing
to system level testing, especially for embedded systems, we observed that the
test environment itself is often the cause of intermittence.

shortest distance (APSD) problems as enumeration problems (on unweighted and
integer weighted graphs), meaning that the elements $(u, v, d(u, v))$ -- where
$u$ and $v$ are vertices with shortest distance $d(u, v)$ -- are produced and
listed one by one without repetition. The performance is measured in the RAM
model of computation with respect to preprocessing time and delay, i.e., the
maximum time that elapses between two consecutive outputs. This point of view
reveals that specific types of output (e.g., excluding the non-reachable pairs
$(u, v, \infty)$, or excluding the self-distances $(u, u, 0)$) and the order of
enumeration (e.g., sorted by distance, sorted row-wise with respect to the
distance matrix) have a huge impact on the complexity of APSD while they appear
to have no effect on SSSD.
  In particular, we show for APSD that enumeration without output restrictions
is possible with delay in the order of the average degree. Excluding
non-reachable pairs, or requesting the output to be sorted by distance,
increases this delay to the order of the maximum degree. Further, for weighted
graphs, a delay in the order of the average degree is also not possible without
preprocessing or considering self-distances as output. In contrast, for SSSD we
find that a delay in the order of the maximum degree without preprocessing is
attainable and unavoidable for any of these requirements.

been well established within the multivariate statistical process monitoring
(MSPM) framework since the 1990s. However, its theoretical basis is still
limited to smoothing independent data, and the optimality of its equally or
exponentially weighted scheme remains unproven. This paper aims to weaken the
independence assumption in the existing MA method, and then extend it to a
broader area of dealing with autocorrelated weakly stationary processes. With
the discovery of the non-optimality of the equally and exponentially weighted
schemes used for fault detection when data have autocorrelation, the essence
that they do not effectively utilize the correlation information of samples is
revealed, giving birth to an optimally weighted moving average (OWMA) theory.
The OWMA method is combined with the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic to form an
OWMA $T^2$ control chart (OWMA-TCC), in order to detect a more challenging type
of fault, i.e., intermittent fault (IF). Different from the MA scheme that puts
an equal weight on samples within a time window, OWMA-TCC uses correlation
(autocorrelation and cross-correlation) information to find an optimal weight
vector (OWV) for the purpose of IF detection (IFD). In order to achieve a best
IFD performance, the concept of IF detectability is defined and corresponding
detectability conditions are provided, which further serve as selection
criteria of the OWV. Then, the OWV is given in the form of a solution to
nonlinear equations, whose existence is proven with the aid of the Brouwer
fixed-point theory. Moreover, symmetrical structure of the OWV is revealed, and
the optimality of the MA scheme for any IF directions when data exhibit no
autocorrelation is proven.

with the processing of massive datasets. Therefore, an automated deep neural
network approaches appear as a method of choice to automatically assess

  In the current study, a compact 3D convolutional neural network (CNN),
referred to as RegQCNET, is introduced to quantitatively predict the amplitude
of an affine registration mismatch between a registered image and a reference
template. This quantitative estimation of registration error is expressed using
metric unit system. Therefore, a meaningful task-specific threshold can be
manually or automatically defined in order to distinguish usable and non-usable
images.
  The robustness of the proposed RegQCNET is first analyzed on lifespan brain
images undergoing various simulated spatial transformations and intensity
variations between training and testing. Secondly, the potential of RegQCNET to
classify images as usable or non-usable is evaluated using both manual and
automatic thresholds. During our experiments, automatic thresholds are
estimated using several computer-assisted classification models through
cross-validation. To this end we used expert's visual quality control estimated

  Efficiency in Multigroup Multicast Systems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This paper studies the joint design of user grouping, scheduling (or
admission control) and precoding to optimize energy efficiency (EE) for
multigroup multicast scenarios in single-cell multiuser MISO downlink channels.
Noticing that the existing definition of EE fails to account for group sizes, a
new metric called multicast energy efficiency (MEE) is proposed. In this
context, the joint design is considered for the maximization of MEE, EE, and
scheduled users. Firstly, with the help of binary variables (associated with
grouping and scheduling) the joint design problem is formulated as a
mixed-Boolean fractional programming problem such that it facilitates the joint
update of grouping, scheduling and precoding variables. Further, several novel
optimization formulations are proposed to reveal the hidden difference of
convex/ concave structure in the objective and associated constraints.
Thereafter, we propose a convex-concave procedure framework based iterative
algorithm for each optimization criteria where grouping, scheduling, and
precoding variables are updated jointly in each iteration. Finally, we compare
the performance of the three design criteria concerning three performance
metrics namely MEE, EE, and scheduled users through Monte-Carlo simulations.
These simulations establish the need for MEE and the improvement from the
system optimization.

the overall traction and braking performance of Electric Multiple Units (EMUs).
However, they are difficult to detect and isolate due to their small magnitude
and short duration. This paper presents a new index called variable-to-minimum
difference (VMD) and a new technique called weighted moving average (WMA).
Their combination, i.e., the WMA-VMD index, is used to detect and isolate WIOs
in real time. Different from the existing moving average (MA) technique that
puts an equal weight on samples within a time window, WMA uses correlation
information to find an optimal weight vector (OWV), so as to better improve the
index's robustness and sensitivity. The uniqueness of the OWV for the WMA-VMD
index is proven, and the properties of the OWV are revealed. The OWV possesses
a symmetrical structure, and the equally weighted scheme is optimal when data
are independent. This explains the rationale of existing MA-based methods. WIO
detectability and isolability conditions of the WMA-VMD index are provided,
leading to an analysis of the properties of two nonlinear, discontinuous
operators, $\min$ and $\textrm{VMD}_i$. Experimental studies are conducted
based on practical running data and a hardware-in-the-loop platform of an EMU
to show that the developed methods are effective.

non-equilibrium quasiparticles in the superconducting part. One promising
approach towards their evacuation is the use of normal-metal quasiparticle
traps, where normal metal is brought into good metallic contact with the
superconductor. A voltage biased normal-metal--insulator--superconductor
junction equipped with such a trap is used to investigate on the trapping
performance and the part played by the superconducting proximity effect
therein. This involves an appropriate one-dimensional model of the junction and
the numerical solution of Usadel equations describing the non-equilibrium state
of the superconductor. The functionality of the trap is determined by the
density of states (DOS) at the tunnel barrier. Herein, the proximity effect
leads to two antagonistic characteristics affecting the trapping performance:
the beneficial reduction of the DOS at an energy $|E| = \Delta_{\text{BCS}}$
versus the contraction of the spectral energy gap causing quasiparticle
poisoning. For both effects the trap position is decisive, which needs to be
taken into account for optimizing the trapping performance. In addition, the
conversion between dissipative normal and supercurrent inside the
superconducting part with its impact on the quasiparticle density is studied.

coordinate space, in a first part we review the solution of the conformal
constraints of three- and four-point functions in momentum space in dimensions
$d\geq 2$, in the form of conformal Ward identities (CWI's). We center our
discussion on the analysis of correlators containing stress-energy tensors
$(T)$, conserved currents $(J)$, and scalar operators $(O)$. For scalar
four-point functions, we briefly discuss our method for determining the dual
conformal solutions of such equations, identified only by the CWI's, and
related to the conformal Yangian symmetry, introduced by us in previous work.
In correlation functions with $T$ tensors, evaluated around a flat spacetime,
the conformal anomaly is characterized by the (non-local) exchange of massless
poles in specific form factors, a signature that has been investigated both in
free field theory and non-perturbatively, by solving the conformal constraints.
We discuss the anomaly effective action, and illustrate the derivation of the
CWI's directly from its path integral definition and its Weyl symmetry, which
is alternative to the standard operatorial approach used in conformal field
theories in flat space. For two- and three-point functions, we elaborate on the
matching of these types of correlators to free-field theories. Perturbative
realizations of CFTs at one-loop provide the simplest expressions of the
general solutions identified by the CWI's, for generic operators $T$, $J$, and
scalars of specific scaling dimensions, by an appropriate choice of their field
content. In a technical appendix we offer details on the reconstruction of the
$TTO$ and $TTT$ correlators in the approach of Bzowski, McFadden and Skenderis,
and specifically on the secondary Ward identities of the method, in order to
establish a complete match with the perturbative description.

COVID-19 with temporary immunity on finite spatial and non-spatial network
models. In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a
scale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a
temporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary
immunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again.
When the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model
three different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the
epidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on
maximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a
finite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of
the pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of ""herd immunity"".
For each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which
this happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to
flatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as
decrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic.
However, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price
for the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the
maximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first
peak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly,
interventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach
equilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that
network-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not
captured by the continuous compartmental models.

Parallelism enables fast builds by running independent tasks simultaneously,
while incrementality saves time and computing resources by processing the build
operations that were affected by a particular code change. Writing build
definitions that lead to error-free incremental and parallel builds is a
challenging task. This is mainly because developers are often unable to predict
the effects of build operations on the file system and how different build
operations interact with each other. Faulty build scripts may seriously degrade
the reliability of automated builds, as they cause build failures, and
non-deterministic and incorrect build results.
  To reason about arbitrary build executions, we present buildfs, a
generally-applicable model that takes into account the specification (as
declared in build scripts) and the actual behavior (low-level file system
operation) of build operations. We then formally define different types of
faults related to incremental and parallel builds in terms of the conditions
under which a file system operation violates the specification of a build
operation. Our testing approach, which relies on the proposed model, analyzes
the execution of single full build, translates it into buildfs, and uncovers
faults by checking for corresponding violations.
  We evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our approach
by examining hundreds of Make and Gradle projects. Notably, our method is the
first to handle Java-oriented build systems. The results indicate that our
approach is (1) able to uncover several important issues (245 issues found in
45 open-source projects have been confirmed and fixed by the upstream
developers), and (2) orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art tool
for Make builds.

the subject of recent researches in the physics literature. We investigate how
network structures coevolve with the individual state under the framework of

state consensus or local structural adjustment of individuals by evaluating the
homogeneity among them. Specifically, the similarity threshold significantly
affects the evolution of the network with different initial conditions, and
thus there emerges obvious community structure and polarization. More
importantly, there exists a critical point of phase transition, at which the
network may evolve into a significant community structure and state-consistent

real-time and power constraints. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) presently
achieve record-breaking accuracies in all image understanding benchmarks, but
have a very high computational complexity. Embedded CNNs thus call for small
and efficient, yet very powerful computing platforms. This master thesis
explores the potential of FPGA-based CNN acceleration and demonstrates a fully
functional proof-of-concept CNN implementation on a Zynq System-on-Chip. The
ZynqNet Embedded CNN is designed for image classification on ImageNet and
consists of ZynqNet CNN, an optimized and customized CNN topology, and the
ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator, an FPGA-based architecture for its evaluation.
ZynqNet CNN is a highly efficient CNN topology. Detailed analysis and
optimization of prior topologies using the custom-designed Netscope CNN
Analyzer have enabled a CNN with 84.5% top-5 accuracy at a computational
complexity of only 530 million multiplyaccumulate operations. The topology is
highly regular and consists exclusively of convolutional layers, ReLU
nonlinearities and one global pooling layer. The CNN fits ideally onto the FPGA
accelerator. The ZynqNet FPGA Accelerator allows an efficient evaluation of
ZynqNet CNN. It accelerates the full network based on a nested-loop algorithm
which minimizes the number of arithmetic operations and memory accesses. The
FPGA accelerator has been synthesized using High-Level Synthesis for the Xilinx
Zynq XC-7Z045, and reaches a clock frequency of 200MHz with a device
utilization of 80% to 90 %.

determined by the low momentum expansion of scattering amplitudes, with the
scattering length capturing the leading order. We compute the main contribution
to the scattering length between two spin-zero particles in strongly coupled

duals, we find that the scattering lengths have strikingly similar functional

We typically find no strong variability associated with the target during each
individual night of observing, but see significant changes in mean brightness -
by as much as $0.10$ magnitudes - over the 2 months of the campaign. This
strong variation is apparent on a timescale of at least 2 days. We detect no
clear periodic signature, which suggests we may be observing the T1 brown dwarf
almost pole-on, and the days-long variability in mean brightness is caused by
changes in the large-scale structure of the cloud coverage. Dynamic clouds will
very likely produce lightning, and complementary high cadence \textit{V}-band
and H\textit{$\alpha$} images were acquired to search for the emission
signatures associated with stochastic ""strikes."" We report no positive
detections for the target in either of these passbands.

the spectrum as listed in the PDG tables are often two states. The story began
with the $\Lambda(1405)$, when in 2001, using unitarized chiral perturbation
theory, it was observed that there are two poles in the complex plane, one
close to the $\bar{K}p$ and the other close to the $\pi\Sigma$ threshold. This
was later understood combining the SU(3) limit and group-theoretical arguments.
Different unitarization approaches that all lead to the two-pole structure have
been considered in the mean time, showing some spread in the pole positions.
This fact is now part of the PDG book, though it is not yet listed in the
summary tables. Here, I will discuss the open ends and critically review
approaches that can not deal with this issue. In the meson sector some excited
charm mesons are good candidates for such a two-pole structure. Next, I
consider in detail the $D_0^*(2300)$, that is another candidate for this
scenario. Combining lattice QCD with chiral unitary approaches in the finite
volume, the precise data of the Hadron Spectrum Collaboration for
coupled-channel $D\pi$, $D\eta$, $D_s\bar{K}$ scattering in the isospin $I=1/2$
channel indeed reveal its two-pole structure. Further states in the heavy meson
sector with $I=1/2$ exhibiting this phenomenon are predicted, especially in the
beauty meson sector. I also discuss the relation of these two-pole structures
and the possible molecular nature of the states under consideration.

incorporating a central star illuminating a disk with an inner edge shaped by
dust sublimation at $0.210\pm0.005\,$au, assuming a viewing geometry adopted
from millimeter interferometry ($65^{\circ}$ inclined with a disk major axis

that expected of Silicate grains with a maximum size of $0.36-0.40\,\mu$m

As a solution, we propose an end-to-end learning of imputation and disease

where each graph represents an independent population model based on a key
clinical meta-feature like age, sex, or cognitive function. Graph signal
aggregation from local patient neighborhoods, combined with multigraph signal
fusion via self-attention, has a regularizing effect on both matrix

impute class relevant features as well as perform accurate classification on
two publicly available medical datasets. We empirically show the superiority of
our proposed approach in terms of classification and imputation performance
when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. MGMC enables disease prediction
in multimodal and incomplete medical datasets. These findings could serve as

at its base, the flow rate remains constant throughout the discharge. However,
it has been recently shown that, if the discharge is forced by an overweight,
the flow rate increases at the final stages of the discharge, in striking
contrast to viscous fluids [Madrid et al. Europhys. Lett. (2018)]. {Although
the general mechanism that drives this increase in the flow rate has been
discussed, there exist yet a number of open questions regarding this
phenomenon. One such questions is to what extent is the internal velocity
profile affected, beyond the trivial overall increase consistent with the
increasing flow rate.} We study via Discrete Element Method simulations the
internal velocity profiles during forced silo discharges and compare them with
those of free discharges. The changes in velocity profiles are somewhat subtle.
Interestingly, during free discharges, while the velocity profiles are steady
at the silo base and above a height equivalent to one silo diameter, there
exists a transition region where the profile evolves in time, despite the
constant flow rate. In contrast, forced discharges present steady profiles at
all heights of the granular column during the initial constant flow phase,
followed by an overall increase of the velocities when the acceleration phase
develops.

of data to contemporary spectroscopic databases, which have traditionally
relied on experimental observations and semi-empirical models. It is now a
common procedure to extend calculated line lists to include ro-vibrational
transitions between all bound states of the ground electronic state up to the
dissociation limit. Advanced ab initio methods are utilized to calculate the
potential energy and dipole moment surfaces (PESs and DMSs), and semi-empirical
PESs are then obtained by combining ab initio and experimental data. The
objective is to reach high accuracy in the calculated transition intensities
for all parts of spectrum, i.e. to increase the predictive power of the model.
We show that in order to perform this task, one needs, in addition to the
standard improvements of the PES and DMS in the spectroscopically accessible
regions, to extend the ab initio calculations of the PES towards the
united-atom limit along the stretching coordinates. The argument is based on
the correlation between the intensities of high-overtone transitions and the
repulsive potential wall that has previously been theoretically established for
diatomic molecules and is empirically extended here to linear and nonlinear
triatomic molecules. We generate partial line lists for water and ozone, and
together with an already available line list for carbon dioxide, we derive the
normal intensity distribution, which is a direct consequence of this
correlation. The normal distribution is not an instrument to compute highly
accurate intensities, rather it is a means to analyze the intensities computed
by the traditional methods.

tuneable outer weights, which are usually trained by regularised linear least
squares regression. Remarkably, ESNs still enjoy the universal approximation
property despite the training procedure being entirely linear. In this paper,
we prove that an ESN trained on a sequence of observations from an ergodic
dynamical system (with invariant measure $\mu$) using Tikhonov least squares

the $L^2(\mu)$ norm. In the special case that the targets are future

it impossible for these languages to benefit from any existing text-based

proposed which translates speech descriptions to photo-realistic images without
using any text information, thus allowing unwritten languages to potentially
benefit from this technology. The proposed S2IG framework, named S2IGAN,
consists of a speech embedding network (SEN) and a relation-supervised
densely-stacked generative model (RDG). SEN learns the speech embedding with
the supervision of the corresponding visual information. Conditioned on the
speech embedding produced by SEN, the proposed RDG synthesizes images that are
semantically consistent with the corresponding speech descriptions. Extensive
experiments on two public benchmark datasets CUB and Oxford-102 demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed S2IGAN on synthesizing high-quality and
semantically-consistent images from the speech signal, yielding a good
performance and a solid baseline for the S2IG task.

non-wetting solid substrates are preferred as they enhance drop dynamical
behavior. Accordingly, our coalescence studies here are restricted to drops
with contact angle 90{\deg} $\le \theta_{0} \le$ 180{\deg}. Binary sessile drop
coalescence is the focus, with volume of fluid simulations employed as the
primary tool. The simulations, which incorporate a Kistler dynamic contact
angle model, are first validated against three different experimental substrate
systems and then used to study the influence of solid wettability on sweeping
by modifying $\theta_{0}$. With increasing $\theta_{0}$ up to 150{\deg}, wetted
and projected swept areas both increase as drop center of mass heightens. For
$\theta_{0} \ge$ 150{\deg}, coalescence-induced drop jumping occurs owing to
the decreasing wettability of the substrate and a focusing of liquid momentum
due to the symmetry-breaking solid. In this regime, projected swept area
continues to increase with $\theta_0$ while wetted swept area reaches a maximum
and then decreases. The sweeping results are interpreted using the mechanical
energy balance from hydrodynamic theory and also compared to free drop
coalescence.

time-reversibility of classical microscopic laws, we identify three types of
the Landauer's erasure principle depending on the relation between the two
final environments: the one linked to a logical input 1 and the other to the
logical input 0. The strong type (which is the original Landauer's formulation)
requires the final environments to be in thermal equilibrium. The intermediate
type giving the entropy change of $k_B \ln 2$ occurs when the two final
environments are identical macroscopic states. Finally, the weak Landauer's
principle, providing information erasure with no entropy change, when the two
final environments are macroscopically different. Even though the above results
are formally valid for classical erasure gates, a discussion on their natural
extension to quantum scenarios is presented. This paper strongly suggests that
the original Landauer's principle (based on the assumption of thermalized
environments) is fully reasonable for microelectronics, but it becomes less
reasonable for future few-atoms devices working at THz frequencies. Thus, the
weak and intermediate Landauer's principles, where the erasure of information

high spectral and energy efficiency for future wireless networks by
reconfiguring the wireless signal propagation via passive reflection. To reap
the potential gains of IRS, channel state information (CSI) is essential,
whereas channel estimation errors are inevitable in practice due to limited
channel training resources. In this paper, in order to optimize the performance
of IRS-aided multiuser systems with imperfect CSI, we propose to jointly design
the active transmit precoding at the access point (AP) and passive reflection
coefficients of IRS, each consisting of not only the conventional phase shift
and also the newly exploited amplitude variation. First, the achievable rate of
each user is derived assuming a practical IRS channel estimation method, which
shows that the interference due to CSI errors is intricately related to the AP
transmit precoders, the channel training power and the IRS reflection
coefficients during both channel training and data transmission. Then, for the
single-user case, by combining the benefits of the penalty method, Dinkelbach
method and block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) method, a new
penalized Dinkelbach-BSUM algorithm is proposed to optimize the IRS reflection
coefficients for maximizing the achievable data transmission rate subjected to
CSI errors; while for the multiuser case, a new penalty dual decomposition
(PDD)-based algorithm is proposed to maximize the users' weighted sum-rate.
Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. In particular, useful insights are
drawn to characterize the effect of IRS reflection amplitude control
(with/without the conventional phase shift) on the system performance under
imperfect CSI.

still keep nonzero value even going far above the critical temperature; ii) the
introduced anomaly-related flavor-breaking effect acts as a catalyzer toward
the chiral restoration, and reduces the amount of flavor breaking in the up,
down and strange quark condensates; iii) a dramatic deformation for the meson

remains poorly understood. Here we investigate a simple biochemical model with
nonlinear feedback and multicellular communication to determine if criticality
provides a functional benefit in terms of the ability to gain information about
a stochastic chemical signal. We find that when signal fluctuations are slow,
the mutual information between the signal and the intracellular readout is
maximized at criticality, because the benefit of high signal susceptibility
outweighs the detriment of high readout noise. When cells communicate,
criticality gives rise to long-range correlations in readout molecule number
among cells. Consequently, we find that communication increases the information
between a given cell's readout and the spatial average of the signal across the
population. Finally, we find that both with and without communication, the
sensory benefits of criticality compete with critical slowing down, such that
the information rate, as opposed to the information itself, is minimized at the

represented as the sum of all poles, both bound and resonant poles, in the
complex plane of a variable in which the Green's function and the T-matrix are
single-valued functions. The symmetries of poles, which arise from the
unitarity of the S-matrix, naturally impose the sum to obey the proper
threshold behaviors. The imaginary part of Green's function and the T-matrix
are directly related to observables such as scattering cross sections or
invariant or missing mass distributions of hadron resonances. Thus we can
determine their pole positions and residues by fitting their imaginary part to
observables. We also test the new method by regarding the imaginary part of the
$T$-matrix calculated exactly in a model theory as virtual experimental data.
As a model theory, we take double-channel meson-baryon scatterings in the
chiral unitary model with channels, $\overline{K}N (I=0)$, and $\pi\Sigma
(I=0)$. By fitting the imaginary part of the $T$-matrix calculated in the model
theory by that of the uniformized pole-sum, we obtain the pole positions and

Third, we compare them on the basis of a common unsupervised task to

the prediction of physical properties for a material of interest. The approach
enables excellent predictions of phonon modes (to within 0.1-0.2 THz) for

falsity of other sentences. Paradoxes like the Liar and Yablo's can be analyzed
with that tool to find graph-theoretic patterns. In this paper we present the
F-systems model abstracting from all the features of the language in which the
represented sentences are expressed. All that is assumed is the existence of
sentences and the binary relation '... affirms the falsity of ...' among them.
The possible existence of non-referential sentences is also considered. To
model the sets of all the sentences that can jointly be valued as true we
introduce the notion of conglomerate, the existence of which guarantees the
absence of paradox. Conglomerates also enable to characterize referential
contradictions, i.e. sentences that can only be false under a classical
valuation due to the interactions with other sentences in the model. A Kripke's
style fixed point characterization of groundedness is offered and fixed points
which are complete (meaning that every sentence is deemed either true or false)
and consistent (meaning that no sentence is deemed true and false) are put in
correspondence with conglomerates. Furthermore, argumentation frameworks are
special cases of F-systems. We show the relation between local conglomerates
and admissible sets of arguments and argue about the usefulness of the concept
for argumentation theory.

controlled CO-CO2 gas mixtures corresponding to the range two log units below
to two log units above the fayalite-magnetite-quartz buffer. The source of
chromium was either natural chromite or synthetic Cr2O3, the latter reacting
with the basaltic liquids to form a magnesiochromite. The highest
concentrations of Cr in haplobasaltic melts are found in equilibrium with
magnesiochromite, depending on redox conditions. In detail, at low fO2, liquids
have high Cr contents, but the variation of log [Cr, ppm] is not a linear
function of log fO2. Using our new data and data from the literature a model
for Cr concentrations at chromite/magnesiochromite saturation in silicate melts
has been developed based upon a thermodynamic formalism. Our model may be used
to assess the effect of melt composition on chromite and magnesiochromite
solubility in silicate melts during peridotite melting and assimilation. At
moderate and high oxygen fugacities, concentration levels of Cr at chromite
saturation are higher for ultramafic than for felsic rocks. Our data imply that
assimilation of magnesiochromite-bearing serpentinite lithosphere could result
in high Cr contents in mafic melts, triggering massive crystallization of

limited due to safety concerns. Rigorous testing of these controllers is
challenging, particularly when they operate in probabilistic environments due
to, for example, hardware faults or noisy sensors. We propose MOSAIC, an
algorithm for measuring the safety of deep reinforcement learning agents in
stochastic settings. Our approach is based on the iterative construction of a
formal abstraction of a controller's execution in an environment, and leverages
probabilistic model checking of Markov decision processes to produce
probabilistic guarantees on safe behaviour over a finite time horizon. It
produces bounds on the probability of safe operation of the controller for
different initial configurations and identifies regions where correct behaviour
can be guaranteed. We implement and evaluate our approach on agents trained for

reconstruction tasks. Simplicial learning is an adaptation of dictionary
learning, where subspaces become clipped and acquire arbitrary offsets, taking
the form of simplices. Such adaptation is achieved through additional
constraints on sparse codes. Furthermore, an evolutionary approach can be
chosen to determine the number and the dimensionality of simplices composing
the simplicial, in which most generative and compact simplicials are favored.
This paper proposes an evolutionary simplicial learning method as a generative
and compact sparse framework for classification. The proposed approach is first
applied on a one-class classification task and it appears as the most reliable
method within the considered benchmark. Most surprising results are observed
when evolutionary simplicial learning is considered within a multi-class
classification task. Since sparse representations are generative in nature,
they bear a fundamental problem of not being capable of distinguishing two
classes lying on the same subspace. This claim is validated through synthetic
experiments and superiority of simplicial learning even as a generative-only
approach is demonstrated. Simplicial learning loses its superiority over
discriminative methods in high-dimensional cases but can further be modified
with discriminative elements to achieve state-of-the-art performance in
classification tasks.

needed to improve the significance of the detection. If this transit were due
to an Earth-like rocky planet it would have been detected in the RV data, but
it is not. The TESS data cover seven individual transits, one of which is
consistent with zero depth. The insolation of the putative planet is $990 {\rm

attributed to a CDE with a mass below the RV detection threshold. We searched

thresholds of $< 100$ ppm, which we quantify for each. The DMPP-1 planetary

equal atomic ratios which present an innovative pathway for de novo alloy
engineering. While there exist extensive studies to ascertain the important
structural aspects governing their mechanical behaviors, elucidating the
underlying deformation mechanisms still remains a challenge. Using atomistic
simulations, we probe the particle rearrangements in a yielding, model HEA
system to understand the structural origin of its plasticity. We find the
plastic deformation is initiated by irreversible topological fluctuations which
tend to spatially localize in regions termed as soft spots which consist of
particles actively participating in slow vibrational motions, an observation
strikingly reminiscent of nonlinear glassy rheology. Due to the varying local
elastic moduli resulting from the loss of compositional periodicity, these
plastic responses exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity and are found to be
inversely correlated with the distribution of local electronegativity. Further
mechanical loading promotes the cooperativity among these local plastic events
and triggers the formation of dislocation loops. As in strained crystalline
solids, different dislocation loops can further merge together and propagate as
the main carrier of large-scale plastic deformation. However, the energy
barriers located at the spatial regions with higher local electronegativity
severely hinders the motion of dislocations. By delineating the transient
mechanical response in terms of atomic configuration, our computational
findings shed new light on understanding the nature of plasticity of
single-phase HEA.

ACE is to train a deep classification model (neural chord estimator) in a
supervised manner by using only annotated music signals. In this discriminative
approach, prior knowledge about chord label sequences (model output) has
scarcely been taken into account. In contrast, we propose a unified generative
and discriminative approach in the framework of amortized variational
inference. More specifically, we formulate a deep generative model that
represents the generative process of chroma vectors (observed variables) from
discrete labels and continuous features (latent variables), which are assumed
to follow a Markov model favoring self-transitions and a standard Gaussian
distribution, respectively. Given chroma vectors as observed data, the
posterior distributions of the latent labels and features are computed
approximately by using deep classification and recognition models,
respectively. These three models form a variational autoencoder and can be
trained jointly in a semi-supervised manner. The experimental results show that
the regularization of the classification model based on the Markov prior of
chord labels and the generative model of chroma vectors improved the
performance of ACE even under the supervised condition. The semi-supervised
learning using additional non-annotated data can further improve the
performance.

constraints (TPC and IPCs) is considered. A closed-form solution for its
optimal transmit covariance matrix is obtained in the general case (up to dual
variables). A number of more explicit closed-form solutions are obtained in
some special cases, including full-rank and rank-1 (beamforming) solutions,
which differ significantly from the well-known water-filling solutions (e.g.
signaling on the channel eigenmodes is not optimal anymore and the capacity can
be zero for non-zero transmit power). A whitening filter is shown to be an
important part of optimal precoding under interference constraints. Capacity
scaling with transmit power is studied: its qualitative behaviour is determined
by a natural linear-algebraic structure induced by MIMO channels of multiple
users. A simple rank condition is given to characterize the cases where
spectrum sharing is possible. An interplay between the TPC and IPCs is
investigated, including the transition from power-limited to
interference-limited regimes. A number of unusual properties of an optimal
covariance matrix under IPCs are pointed out and a bound on its rank is
established. Partial null forming known in the adaptive antenna array
literature is shown to be optimal from the information-theoretic perspective as
well in some cases.

environments can be challenging because of noise and variation in illumination
and the surrounding habitat. In this paper, we propose a two-step deep learning
approach for the detection and classification of temperate fishes without
pre-filtering. The first step is to detect each single fish in an image,
independent of species and sex. For this purpose, we employ the You Only Look
Once (YOLO) object detection technique. In the second step, we adopt a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
architecture for classifying each fish in the image without pre-filtering. We
apply transfer learning to overcome the limited training samples of temperate
fishes and to improve the accuracy of the classification. This is done by
training the object detection model with ImageNet and the fish classifier via a
public dataset (Fish4Knowledge), whereupon both the object detection and
classifier are updated with temperate fishes of interest. The weights obtained
from pre-training are applied to post-training as a priori. Our solution
achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy of 99.27\% on the pre-training. The
percentage values for accuracy on the post-training are good; 83.68\% and
87.74\% with and without image augmentation, respectively, indicating that the
solution is viable with a more extensive dataset.

features to release the fusion energy in inertial confinement fusion: in
particle accelerators HIBs are generated with a high driver efficiency of ~
30-40%, and the HIB ions deposit their energy inside of materials. Therefore, a
requirement for the fusion target energy gain is relatively low, that would be
~50-70 to operate a HIF fusion reactor with the standard energy output of 1GW
of electricity. The HIF reactor operation frequency would be ~10~15 Hz or so.
Several-MJ HIBs illuminate a fusion fuel target, and the fuel target is
imploded to about a thousand times of the solid density. Then the DT fuel is
ignited and burned. The HIB ion deposition range would be ~0.5-1 mm or so
depending on the material. Therefore, a relatively large density-scale length
appears in the fuel target material. The large density-gradient-scale length
helps to reduce the Rayleigh-Taylor (R-T) growth rate. The key merits in HIF

winning alternative. Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,
e.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which
voting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of
voting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on
axioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may
intentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for
their own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that
their top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their
second-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no
coalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said
to satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak
Strategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for
strategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain
intuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting
rules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule. In
my thesis, I generalize their result, by proving that rank-order voting and

focus is on triples that produce white dwarfs (WDs), where Roche lobe overflow
of an evolving tertiary triggers accretion onto the inner binary via a
circumbinary disk (CBD) driving it toward a mass ratio of unity. We present a
combination of analytic- and population synthesis-based calculations performed
using the \texttt{SeBa} code to constrain the expected frequency of such
systems, given a realistic initial population of MS triples, and provide the
predicted distributions of orbital periods. We identify the parameter space for
triples that can accommodate a CBD, to inform future numerical simulations of
suitable initial conditions. We find that $\lesssim$ 10\% of all MS triples
should be able to accommodate a CBD around the inner binary, and compute lower
limits for the production rates. This scenario broadly predicts mergers of near
equal-mass binaries, producing blue stragglers (BSs), Type Ia supernovae, gamma
ray bursts and gravitational wave-induced mergers, along with the presence of
an outer WD tertiary companion. We compare our predicted distributions to a
sample of field BS binaries, and argue that our proposed mechanism explains the
observed range of orbital periods. Finally, the mechanism considered here could
produce hypervelocity MS stars, WDs and even millisecond pulsars with masses
close to the Chandrasekhar mass limit, and be used to constrain the maximum
remnant masses at the time of any supernova explosion.

For this we take the help of recent seminal works on this topic that captured
the situation of farmers' within certain types of value chains. Then, we
isolate the segment which interacts with farmers and deep-dive into data to
understand the role played by public interventions in determining farmers'
income from agriculture. NSSO 70th round on Situation Assessment Survey of

countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the
outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and
whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public
discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different
lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and
informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper
develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown
policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,
and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific
policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --
the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,
Recovered) model as a prior mean function with ""country-and-policy-specific""
parameters that capture fatality curves under ""counterfactual"" policies within
each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and
learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and
its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of
SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and
gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors)
-- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational
inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with
other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide
scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting
their impact on COVID-19 fatalities.

weighted sum of the Laplacian eigenfunctions enabling efficient design space
exploration with the weights as a small set of design variables. We further
improve computational efficiency by using the property that the Laplacian
eigenfunctions form a spectrum and may be ordered from lower to higher
frequencies. This approach allows greater localized control of the material
distribution as the sliding window moves through higher frequencies. The
approach also reduces the number of optimization variables per iteration, thus
the design optimization process speeds up independent of the domain resolution
without sacrificing analysis quality. Our method is most beneficial when the
gradients may not be computed easily (i.e., optimization problems coupled with
external black-box analysis) thereby enabling optimization of otherwise
intractable design problems. The sliding basis framework is independent of any

  Response",,,,,"q-bio.QM cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transfer learning has been shown to be effective in many applications in
which training data for the target problem are limited but data for a related
(source) problem are abundant. In this paper, we apply transfer learning to the
prediction of anti-cancer drug response. Previous transfer learning studies for
drug response prediction focused on building models that predict the response
of tumor cells to a specific drug treatment. We target the more challenging
task of building general prediction models that can make predictions for both
new tumor cells and new drugs. We apply the classic transfer learning framework
that trains a prediction model on the source dataset and refines it on the
target dataset, and extends the framework through ensemble. The ensemble
transfer learning pipeline is implemented using LightGBM and two deep neural
network (DNN) models with different architectures. Uniquely, we investigate its
power for three application settings including drug repurposing, precision
oncology, and new drug development, through different data partition schemes in
cross-validation. We test the proposed ensemble transfer learning on benchmark
in vitro drug screening datasets, taking one dataset as the source domain and
another dataset as the target domain. The analysis results demonstrate the
benefit of applying ensemble transfer learning for predicting anti-cancer drug
response in all three applications with both LightGBM and DNN models. Compared
between the different prediction models, a DNN model with two subnetworks for
the inputs of tumor features and drug features separately outperforms LightGBM
and the other DNN model that concatenates tumor features and drug features for
input in the drug repurposing and precision oncology applications. In the more
challenging application of new drug development, LightGBM performs better than
the other two DNN models.

tensor completion due to its ability of capturing the intrinsic structure
within high-order tensors. A recently proposed TR rank minimization method is
based on the convex relaxation by penalizing the weighted sum of nuclear norm
of TR unfolding matrices. However, this method treats each singular value
equally and neglects their physical meanings, which usually leads to suboptimal
solutions in practice. In this paper, we propose to use the logdet-based
function as a nonconvex smooth relaxation of the TR rank for tensor completion,
which can more accurately approximate the TR rank and better promote the
low-rankness of the solution. To solve the proposed nonconvex model
efficiently, we develop an alternating direction method of multipliers
algorithm and theoretically prove that, under some mild assumptions, our
algorithm converges to a stationary point. Extensive experiments on color
images, multispectral images, and color videos demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms several state-of-the-art competitors in both visual and
quantitative comparison. Key words: nonconvex optimization, tensor ring rank,
logdet function, tensor completion, alternating direction method of

deployed in many domains to allow people to have a natural interaction while
trying to solve a specific problem. Given their widespread use, it is important
to provide their users with methods and tools to increase users awareness of
various properties of the chatbots, including non-functional properties that
users may consider important in order to trust a specific chatbot. For example,
users may want to use chatbots that are not biased, that do not use abusive
language, that do not leak information to other users, and that respond in a
style which is appropriate for the user's cognitive level.
  In this paper, we address the setting where a chatbot cannot be modified, its
training data cannot be accessed, and yet a neutral party wants to assess and
communicate its trustworthiness to a user, tailored to the user's priorities
over the various trust issues. Such a rating can help users choose among
alternative chatbots, developers test their systems, business leaders price
their offering, and regulators set policies. We envision a personalized rating
methodology for chatbots that relies on separate rating modules for each issue,
and users' detected priority orderings among the relevant trust issues, to
generate an aggregate personalized rating for the trustworthiness of a chatbot.
The method is independent of the specific trust issues and is parametric to the
aggregation procedure, thereby allowing for seamless generalization. We
illustrate its general use, integrate it with a live chatbot, and evaluate it
on four dialog datasets and representative user profiles, validated with user
surveys.

phenomena including earthquakes, viral pandemics, financial transactions,

usefulness of these stochastic process models within a host of economic sectors

complexity of likelihood evaluations grows quadratically in the number of
observations for both the temporal and spatiotemporal Hawkes processes. We show
that, with care, one may parallelize these calculations using both central and
graphics processing unit implementations to achieve over 100-fold speedups over
single-core processing. Using a simple adaptive Metropolis-Hastings scheme, we
apply our high-performance computing framework to a Bayesian analysis of big
gunshot data generated in Washington D.C. between the years of 2006 and 2019,
thereby extending a past analysis of the same data from under 10,000 to over

  Stimulation (EMS) Lure and Ensemble Network Algorithm to Maximize Catch and
  Release Survivability","This was a high school hackathon project that although interesting,
  lacks sufficient rigor and data as a research paper",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With 200-700 million anglers in the world, sportfishing is nearly five times
more common than commercial trawling. Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of jobs
are linked to the sportfishing industry, which generates billions of dollars
for water-side communities and fisheries conservatories alike. However, the
sheer popularity of recreational fishing poses threats to aquatic biodiversity
that are hard to regulate. For example, as much as 25% of overfished
populations can be traced to anglers. This alarming statistic is explained by
the average catch and release mortality rate of 43%, which primarily results
from hook-related injuries and careless out-of-water handling. The
provisional-patented design proposed in this paper addresses both these
problems separately First, a novel, electrical muscle stimulation based fishing
lure is proposed as a harmless and low cost alternative to sharp hooks. Early
prototypes show a constant electrical current of 90 mA applied through a 200g
European perch's jaw can support a reeling tension of 2N - safely within the
necessary ranges. Second, a fish-eye camera bob is designed to wirelessly relay
underwater footage to a smartphone app, where an ensemble convolutional neural
network automatically classifies the fish's species, estimates its length, and
cross references with local and state fishing regulations (ie. minimum size,
maximum bag limit, and catch season). This capability reduces overfishing by
helping anglers avoid accidentally violating guidelines and eliminates the need
to reel the fish in and expose it to negligent handling. IN conjunction, this
cheap, lightweight, yet high-tech invention is a paradigm shift in preserving a
world favorite pastime; while at the same time making recreational fishing more
sustainable.
