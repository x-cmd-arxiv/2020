oriented $(d-1)$-manifolds and as morphisms diffeomorphism classes of

compute the classifying space of $hBord_d$ for $d = 1$, exhibiting it as a
circle bundle over $\mathbb{CP}^\infty_{-1}$.
  As part of our proof we construct a quotient $Bord_1^{red}$ of the cobordism

space $\Omega^{\infty-2}\mathbb{CP}^\infty_{-1}$ and moreover that, if one
equips these bordisms with a map to a simply connected space $X$, the resulting
$Bord_1^{red}(X)$ can be thought of as a cobordism model for the topological
cyclic homology $TC(\mathbb{S}[\Omega X])$.

$B(hBord_1^{red}) \to Q(\Sigma^2 \mathbb{CP}^\infty_+)$ in this model and use

review of a recent proposal for an alternative perturbative scheme: solutions
are built by means of a convenient choice of homotopy-contraction operator and
subjected to asymptotically anti-de Sitter boundary conditions by
perturbatively adjusting a gauge function and integration constants. At linear
level the latter are fibre elements that encode, via unfolded equations,
propagating massless fields of any spin. Therefore, linearized solution spaces,
distinguished by their spacetime properties (regularity and boundary
conditions), have parallels in the fibre. The traditional separation of
different branches of linearized solutions via their spacetime features is
reviewed, and their dual fibre characterization, as well as the arrangement of
the corresponding fibre elements into AdS irreps, is illustrated. This
construction is first reviewed for regular and singular solutions in compact
basis, thereby capturing massless particles and static higher-spin black holes,
and then extended to solutions in conformal basis, capturing bulk-to-boundary
propagators and certain singular solutions with vanishing scaling dimension,
related to boundary Green's functions. The non-unitary transformation between
the two bases is recalled at the level of their fibre representatives.

making stories compelling. While there is a vast theoretical literature on
suspense, it is computationally not well understood. We compare two ways for
modelling suspense: surprise, a backward-looking measure of how unexpected the
current state is given the story so far; and uncertainty reduction, a
forward-looking measure of how unexpected the continuation of the story is.
Both can be computed either directly over story representations or over their
probability distributions. We propose a hierarchical language model that
encodes stories and computes surprise and uncertainty reduction. Evaluating
against short stories annotated with human suspense judgements, we find that
uncertainty reduction over representations is the best predictor, resulting in
near-human accuracy. We also show that uncertainty reduction can be used to
predict suspenseful events in movie synopses.

moderate extensile activity leads to droplet rotation, cholesteric active

extensile force dipole activity stabilises complex defect configurations whose

quasistatic compression varies with their bond angle $\theta_0$. All systems

\pm 1/10)\phi_E(\theta_0)$. For $\phi < \phi_E(\theta_0)$, systems are in a
""gas"" phase wherein all chains remain free to translate and reorient. For
$\phi_E(\theta_0) \leq \phi \leq \phi_J(\theta_0)$, systems are in a
liquid-like phase wherein chains are entangled. In this phase, chains'
rigid-body-like motion is blocked, yet they can still locally relax via
dihedral rotations, and hence energy and pressure remain extremely small. The
ability of dihedral relaxation mechanisms to accommodate further compression
becomes exhausted, and systems rigidify, at $\phi_J(\theta_0)$. At and slightly
above $\phi_J$, the bulk moduli increase linearly with the pressure $P$ rather
than jumping discontinuously, indicating these systems solidify via rigidity
percolation. The character of the energy and pressure increases above

jamming is bending-dominated and is similar to that observed in systems
composed of straight fibers. Small-$\alpha_{\rm eff}$ (large-$\theta_0$)

distributions based on historical data. The method consists of raising the
likelihood to a discounting factor in order to control the amount of
information borrowed from the historical data. It is customary to perform a
sensitivity analysis reporting results for a range of values of the discounting
factor. However, one often wishes to assign it a prior distribution and
estimate it jointly with the parameters, which in turn necessitates the
computation of a normalising constant. In this paper we are concerned with how
to recycle computations from a sensitivity analysis in order to approximately
sample from joint posterior of the parameters and the discounting factor. We
first show a few important properties of the normalising constant and then use
these results to motivate a bisection-type algorithm for computing it on a
fixed budget of evaluations. We give a large array of illustrations and discuss
cases where the normalising constant is known in closed-form and where it is
not. We show that the proposed method produces approximate posteriors that are
very close to the exact distributions when those are available and also
produces posteriors that cover the data-generating parameters with higher
probability in the intractable case. Our results show that proper inclusion the
normalising constant is crucial to the correct quantification of uncertainty
and that the proposed method is an accurate and easy to implement technique to
include this normalisation, being applicable to a large class of models.

by-product of a secular spin-orbit resonance assuming that the planet
originated closer to the Sun. In this position, Uranus's spin precession
frequency is fast enough to resonate with another planet located beyond Saturn.
Using numerical integration, we show that resonance capture is possible in a
variety of past solar system configurations, but that the timescale required to
tilt the planet to 90$^{\circ}$ is of the order $\sim\!10^{8}$ yr -- a timespan
that is uncomfortably long. A resonance kick could tilt the planet to a
significant 40$^{\circ}$ in $\sim\!10^{7}$ yr only if conditions were ideal. We
also revisit the collisional hypothesis for the origin of Uranus's large
obliquity. We consider multiple impacts with a new collisional code that builds
up a planet by summing the angular momentum imparted from impactors. Because
gas accretion imparts an unknown but likely large part of the planet's spin
angular momentum, we compare different collisional models for tilted, untilted,
spinning, and nonspinning planets. We find that a 1 $M_{\oplus}$ strike is
sufficient to explain the planet's current spin state, but that two
$0.5\,M_{\oplus}$ collisions produce better likelihoods. Finally, we
investigate hybrid models and show that resonances must produce a tilt of at
least $\sim\!40^{\circ}$ for any noticeable improvements to the collision
model. Because it is difficult for spin-orbit resonances to drive Uranus's
obliquity to 98$^{\circ}$ even under these ideal conditions, giant impacts seem
inescapable.

interest in optimizing the performance of thermoelectric and phononic devices.
The insertion of inclusions of nanometer size in a semiconductor is an
effective means of achieving such control; it has been proposed that the
thermal conductivity of silicon could be reduced to 1 W/m/K using this approach
and that a minimum in the heat conductivity would be reached for some optimal
size of the inclusions. Yet the practical verification of this design rule has
been limited. In this work, we address this question by studying the thermal
properties of silicon metalattices that consist of a periodic distribution of
spherical inclusions with radii from 7 to 30 nm, embedded into silicon.
Experimental measurements confirm that the thermal conductivity of silicon
metalattices is as low as 1 W/m/K for silica inclusions, and that this value
can be further reduced to 0.16 W/m/K for silicon metalattices with empty pores.
A detailed model of ballistic phonon transport suggests that this thermal
conductivity is close to the lowest achievable by tuning the radius and spacing
of the periodic inhomogeneities. This study is a significant step in
elucidating the scaling laws that dictate ballistic heat transport at the
nanoscale in silicon and other semiconductors.

condition of the weak gravity conjecture. As concrete examples, we consider
$U(1)^{k}$ gauge theories with a discrete symmetry associated with cyclic
permutations between the gauge groups, and identify anomaly-free $U(1)$ gauge
symmetries and the corresponding gauge couplings. Owing to this discrete
symmetry, we can systematically study the models and we find that the models
would be examples of the weak coupling conjecture. It is conjectured that a
certain class of chiral gauge theories with too many $U(1)$ symmetries may be

the scalar weak gravity conjecture in a concrete model. These constraints may

vector canonical correlation analysis and study what kind of information is
induced from each source. By inferring typological features and language
phylogenies, we observe that our representations embed typology and strengthen
correlations with language relationships. We then take advantage of our
multi-view language vector space for multilingual machine translation, where we
achieve competitive overall translation accuracy in tasks that require
information about language similarities, such as language clustering and
ranking candidates for multilingual transfer. With our method, which is also
released as a tool, we can easily project and assess new languages without
expensive retraining of massive multilingual or ranking models, which are major

unveil a high-order dynamical bulk-surface correspondence that the quantum

topological phase of the post-quench Hamiltonian. This high-order dynamical
bulk-surface correspondence provides new and optimal dynamical schemes with
fundamental advantages to simulate and detect topological states, in which
through the highest-order BISs that are of zero dimension, the detection of
topological phase relies on only minimal measurements. We experimentally build

non-determinism. The most common concurrency bugs are data races, which are
accesses to a shared resource that can be executed concurrently. Dynamic
data-race prediction is the most standard technique for detecting data races:
given an observed, data-race-free trace $t$, the task is to determine whether
$t$ can be reordered to a trace $t^*$ that exposes a data-race. Although the
problem has received significant practical attention for over three decades,
its complexity has remained elusive. In this work, we address this lacuna,
identifying sources of intractability and conditions under which the problem is
efficiently solvable. Given a trace $t$ of size $n$ over $k$ threads, our main
results are as follows.
  First, we establish a general $O(k\cdot n^{2\cdot (k-1)})$ upper-bound, as
well as an $O(n^k)$ upper-bound when certain parameters of $t$ are constant. In
addition, we show that the problem is NP-hard and even W[1]-hard parameterized
by $k$, and thus unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable. Second, we study the
problem over acyclic communication topologies, such as server-clients
hierarchies. We establish an $O(k^2\cdot d\cdot n^2\cdot \log n)$ upper-bound,
where $d$ is the number of shared variables accessed in $t$. In addition, we
show that even for traces with $k=2$ threads, the problem has no
$O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ algorithm under Orthogonal Vectors. Since any trace with 2
threads defines an acyclic topology, our upper-bound for this case is optimal
wrt polynomial improvements for up to moderate values of $k$ and $d$. Finally,
we study a distance-bounded version of the problem, where the task is to expose
a data race by a witness trace that is similar to $t$. We develop an algorithm
that works in $O(n)$ time when certain parameters of $t$ are constant.

optimization problem. It requires the consideration of various attributes like
human preferences and thinking, which constrain achieving the optimal value of
the problem objectives. The value of the objectives may be maximized or
minimized, depending on the situation. Numerous times, the values of these
problem parameters are in linguistic form, as human beings naturally understand
and express themselves using words. These problems are therefore termed as
linguistic optimization problems (LOPs), and are of two types, namely single
objective linguistic optimization problems (SOLOPs) and multi-objective
linguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs). In these LOPs, the value of the
objective function(s) may not be known at all points of the decision space, and
therefore, the objective function(s) as well as problem constraints are linked
by the if-then rules. Tsukamoto inference method has been used to solve these
LOPs; however, it suffers from drawbacks. As, the use of linguistic information
inevitably calls for the utilization of computing with words (CWW), and
therefore, 2-tuple linguistic model based solution methodologies were proposed
for LOPs. However, we found that 2-tuple linguistic model based solution
methodologies represent the semantics of the linguistic information using a
combination of type-1 fuzzy sets and ordinal term sets. As, the semantics of
linguistic information are best modeled using the interval type-2 fuzzy sets,
hence we propose solution methodologies for LOPs based on CWW approach of
perceptual computing, in this paper. The perceptual computing based solution
methodologies use a novel design of CWW engine, called the perceptual reasoning
(PR). PR in the current form is suitable for solving SOLOPs and, hence, we have
also extended it to the MOLOPs.

regular testing of every individual expensive. The costs are a challenge for
all countries and particularly for developing countries. Cost reductions can be
achieved by combining samples and testing them in groups. We propose an
algorithm for grouping subsamples, prior to testing, based on the geometry of a
hypercube. At low prevalence, this testing procedure uniquely identifies
infected individuals in a small number of tests. We discuss the optimal group
size and explain why, given the highly infectious nature of the disease,
parallel searches are preferred. We report proof of concept experiments in
which a positive sample was detected even when diluted a hundred-fold with
negative samples. Using these methods, the costs of mass testing could be
reduced by a factor of ten to a hundred or more. If infected individuals are
quickly and effectively quarantined, the prevalence will fall and so will the
costs of regularly testing everyone. Such a strategy provides a possible
pathway to the longterm elimination of SARS-CoV-2. Field trials of our approach
are now under way in Rwanda and initial data from these are reported here.

their relevant flares are weak (B2.1, B7.9 and B2.3) and short-lived (13, 9 and
14 minutes). The main eruption directions of E1 and E2 are along
$\sim$45$^\circ$ north of their radial directions, while E3 primarily
propagated along the radial direction. In the EUV channels, the early speeds of
the first two CMEs have apparent speeds of $\sim$320 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$380

results suggest that the observed Type II radio bursts in the eruptions E1 and
E2 are likely triggered by their associated CMEs and the direction of eruption
and the ambient plasma and magnetic environments may take an important place in
producing Type II radio burst or shock as well.

practice, their success is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive theory to
explain it. The information bottleneck (IB) theory recently emerged as a bold
information-theoretic paradigm for analyzing DL systems. Adopting mutual
information as the figure of merit, it suggests that the best representation
$T$ should be maximally informative about $Y$ while minimizing the mutual
information with $X$. In this tutorial we survey the information-theoretic
origins of this abstract principle, and its recent impact on DL. For the
latter, we cover implications of the IB problem on DL theory, as well as
practical algorithms inspired by it. Our goal is to provide a unified and
cohesive description. A clear view of current knowledge is particularly
important for further leveraging IB and other information-theoretic ideas to
study DL models.

of the recent fundamental developments in artificial intelligence. Deep
learning is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent,
bio-inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units
operating in parallel. Deep learning has been successfully applied in areas
such as object/pattern recognition, speech and natural language processing,
self-driving vehicles, intelligent self-diagnostics tools, autonomous robots,
knowledgeable personal assistants, and monitoring. These successes have been
mostly supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data,
continuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The
approaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest
improvements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raise the
question of whether the described progress will be slowed or halted due to
hardware limitations. This paper reviews the case for a novel beyond CMOS
hardware technology, memristors, as a potential solution for the implementation
of power-efficient in-memory computing, deep learning accelerators, and spiking
neural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non-von-Neumann computing
architectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference
algorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing
directions for further progress in artificial intelligence, we briefly discuss
an example based reservoir computing. We conclude the review by speculating on
the big picture view of future neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing
systems.

are increasingly used with machine learning methods to predict biologically

advanced the prediction prowess, current graph neural network (GNN) methods are
optimized for prediction on the basis of direct similarity between interacting
nodes. In biological networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not
directly interact has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a
variety of interaction networks. Here, we present SkipGNN, a graph neural
network approach for the prediction of molecular interactions. SkipGNN predicts
molecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct
interactions but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip
similarity. In contrast to existing GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages from
two-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in the interaction network and
non-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful information for
prediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we construct a modified
version of the original network, called the skip graph. We then develop an
iterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN using both the skip graph and the
original graph. Experiments on four interaction networks, including drug-drug,
drug-target, protein-protein, and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN
achieves superior and robust performance, outperforming existing methods by up
to 28.8\% of area under the precision recall curve (PR-AUC). Furthermore, we
show that unlike popular GNNs, SkipGNN learns biologically meaningful
embeddings and performs especially well on noisy, incomplete interaction

applications may suffer from the omission of explanatory variables, measurement

aim of this paper is to theoretically understand the empirical success of the
Deep IV. Specifically, we consider a two-stage estimator using deep neural
networks in the linear instrumental variables model. By imposing a latent
structural assumption on the reduced form equation between endogenous variables
and instrumental variables, the first-stage estimator can automatically capture
this latent structure and converge to the optimal instruments at the minimax
optimal rate, which is free of the dimension of instrumental variables and thus
mitigates the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, in comparison with
classical methods, due to the faster convergence rate of the first-stage
estimator, the second-stage estimator has {a smaller (second order) estimation
error} and requires a weaker condition on the smoothness of the optimal
instruments. Given that the depth and width of the employed deep neural network
are well chosen, we further show that the second-stage estimator achieves the
semiparametric efficiency bound. Simulation studies on synthetic data and
application to automobile market data confirm our theory.

This parallel execution of tasks is done in accordance to a scheduling policy.
However, the minimization of human element beyond a certain point is difficult.
In fact, the expertise and experience of a group of humans, called the experts,
becomes imminent to design a fruitful scheduling policy. The aim of the
scheduling policy is to achieve the optimal value of an objective, like
production time, cost, etc. In real-life situations, there are more often than
not, multiple objectives in any parallel processing scenario. Furthermore, the
experts generally provide their opinions, about various scheduling criteria
(pertaining to the scheduling policies) in linguistic terms or words. Word
semantics are best modeled using fuzzy sets (FSs). Thus, all these factors have
motivated us to model the parallel processing scenario as a multi-objective
linguistic optimization problem (MOLOP) and use the novel perceptual reasoning
(PR) based methodology for solving it. We have also compared the results of the
PR based solution methodology with those obtained from the 2-tuple based
solution methodology. PR based solution methodology offers three main
advantages viz., it generates unique recommendations, here the linguistic
recommendations match a codebook word, and also the word model comes before the
word. 2-tuple based solution methodology fails to give all these advantages.

hosts topological flat bands in a wide range of twist angles. The dispersion of
these bands and gaps between them can be efficiently controlled by a
perpendicular electric field, which induces topological transitions accompanied
by changes of the Chern numbers. In the regime where the applied electric field
induces gaps between the flat bands, we find a relatively uniform distribution
of the Berry curvature. Consequently, interaction-induced valley- and/or
spin-polarized states at integer filling factors are energetically favorable.
In particular, we predict a quantum anomalous Hall state at filling factor
$\nu=1$ for a range of twist angles $1^\circ<\theta <1.4^\circ$. Furthermore,
to characterize the response of the system to magnetic field, we computed the
Hofstadter butterfly and the Wannier plot, which can be used to probe the

is immersed in the G~ring arc, and the satellites Anthe and Methone are
embedded in arcs named after them. Since most of the population of the arcs is
formed by $\mu$m-sized particles the dissipative effects, such as the plasma
drag and the solar radiation force, decrease the lifetime of the arcs. We
analysed the effects of the immersed satellites on these arcs by computing the

By comparing the lifetime of the particles and the mass production rate we
concluded that Aegaeon, Anthe and Methone did not act as sources for their

mixed-correlator bootstrap calculation with a minimal set of input assumptions.
This 'semi-blind' approach contrasts with other approaches for probing more
complicated groups, which 'target' known theories with additional spectral
assumptions or use the saturation of the single-correlator bootstrap bound as a
starting point. As a case study, we select the space of CFTs with product-group
symmetry $O(15)\otimes{O}(3)$ in $d=3$ dimensions. On the assumption that there
is only one relevant scalar ($\ell=0$) singlet operator in the theory, we find
a single 'allowed' region in our chosen space of scaling dimensions. The
scaling dimensions corresponding to two known large-$N$ critical theories, the
Heisenberg and the chiral ones, lie on or very near the boundary of this
region. The large-$N$ antichiral point lies well outside the 'allowed' region,
which is consistent with the expectation that the antichiral theory is
unstable, and thus has an additional relevant scalar singlet operator. We also
find a sharp kink in the boundary of the 'allowed' region at values of the
scaling dimensions that do not correspond to the $(N,M)=(15,3)$ instance of any

strain-induced pseudomagnetic field is investigated in a model with local
four-fermion interaction. It is found that only the inter-node pairing is
possible in the lowest pseudo-Landau level approximation. Unlike the case of
the lowest Landau level in a conventional magnetic field, the corresponding gap
equation has only a trivial solution. Nevertheless, superconductivity can be
induced via the proximity effect with a usual s-wave spin-singlet
superconductor. Since a pseudomagnetic field is present necessarily at the
surface of a Weyl semimetal, the proximity effect is strongly affected by the
pseudomagnetic field. The analysis of such an effect showed that while no gap
is opened in the spectrum, the degeneracy of energy levels is lifted. The
unique character of the proximity effect in Weyl semimetals can be probed via
the density of states, the spectral function, and the tunneling current. The
density of states does not vanish at small energies and scales linearly with
the pseudomagnetic field strength. This scaling is manifested also in the
tunneling current.

outside consciousness. Evidence for this view comes from unconscious priming.
In a typical experiment, visual stimuli are masked, such that participants are
close to chance when directly asked to which of two categories the stimuli
belong. This close-to-zero sensitivity is seen as evidence that participants
cannot consciously report the category of the masked stimuli. Nevertheless, the
category of the masked stimuli can indirectly affect responses to other stimuli
(e.g., reaction times or brain activity). Priming is therefore seen as evidence
that there is still some (albeit unconscious) sensitivity to the stimulus
categories, thereby indicating processing outside consciousness. Although this
""standard reasoning of unconscious priming"" has been used in many studies, we
show that it is flawed: Sensitivities are not calculated appropriately, hereby
creating the wrong impression that priming indicated better sensitivity than
the close-to-zero sensitivity of the direct discrimination. We describe the
appropriate way to determine sensitivities, replicate the behavioral part of a
landmark study, develop a method to estimate sensitivities for published
studies from reported summary statistics, and use this method to reanalyze 15
highly influential studies. Results show that the interpretations of many

the emergence of a singularity in the limiting Schwarzschild geometry. We
discuss particular metric solutions for similar properties of structures, the
metric Killing bundles (metric bundles MBs), related to the BH horizons

provides a way to recognize these geometries and detect phenomenological
evidence of LQG origin by the detection of stationary/static observers and the
properties of lightlike orbits with the analysis of the conformal invariant MBs

prediction. One way to do so is erasure: a subset of inputs is considered
irrelevant if it can be removed without affecting the prediction. Though
conceptually simple, erasure's objective is intractable and approximate search
remains expensive with modern deep NLP models. Erasure is also susceptible to
the hindsight bias: the fact that an input can be dropped does not mean that
the model `knows' it can be dropped. The resulting pruning is over-aggressive
and does not reflect how the model arrives at the prediction. To deal with
these challenges, we introduce Differentiable Masking. DiffMask learns to
mask-out subsets of the input while maintaining differentiability. The decision
to include or disregard an input token is made with a simple model based on
intermediate hidden layers of the analyzed model. First, this makes the
approach efficient because we predict rather than search. Second, as with
probing classifiers, this reveals what the network `knows' at the corresponding
layers. This lets us not only plot attribution heatmaps but also analyze how
decisions are formed across network layers. We use DiffMask to study BERT
models on sentiment classification and question answering.

and is especially prevalent inside biological cells. In cell biology, the
prevailing model for chemical activation rates has recently changed from the
first passage time (FPT) of a single searcher to the FPT of the fastest
searcher out of many searchers to reach a target, which is called an extreme
statistic or extreme FPT. In this paper, we investigate extreme statistics of
searchers which move by anomalous subdiffusion. We model subdiffusion by a
fractional Fokker-Planck equation involving the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivative. We prove an explicit and very general formula for every moment of
subdiffusive extreme FPTs and approximate their full probability distribution.
While the mean FPT of a single subdiffusive searcher is infinite, the fastest
subdiffusive searcher out of many subdiffusive searchers typically has a finite
mean FPT. In fact, we prove the counterintuitive result that extreme FPTs of
subdiffusion are faster than extreme FPTs of normal diffusion. Mathematically,
we employ a stochastic representation involving a random time change of a
standard Ito drift-diffusion according to the trajectory of the first crossing
time inverse of a Levy subordinator. A key step in our analysis is generalizing
Varadhan's formula from large deviation theory to the case of subdiffusion,
which yields the short-time distribution of subdiffusion in terms of a certain
geodesic distance.

barotropic flow during the inspiral phase. During the merger phase, where tidal
disruption and shock-heating occur, a baroclinic description is needed instead.
In the barotropic case, a Hamiltonian formulation potentially offers unique
benefits for numerical relativity simulations of the inspiral phase, including
highly accurate conservation of circulation and superconvergence of the fluid
variables, and is actively being explored. In this work, we investigate the
viability of a Hamiltonian formulation in the baroclinic case. At odds with the
barotropic case, this formulation is non-conservative, yet it can be treated
well with approximate Riemann solver algorithms since the non-conservative
terms vanish across genuinely nonlinear fields. Nonetheless, using numerical
1-dimensional shock tube tests we find that the weak solutions of the
Hamiltonian system differ from the standard ones obtained by enforcing
conservation of rest mass density, momentum density, and energy density across
discontinuities. We also show that barotropic Hamiltonian formulations can
admit shockwaves at fluid-vacuum interfaces, which may be related to the
unstable behavior of stellar surfaces observed in past numerical tests. In
light of the unphysical weak solutions, we expect that in future
implementations of the Hamiltonian formulation of hydrodynamics in numerical
relativity it will be necessary to use an explicitly barotropic formulation
during the inspiral phase, and then switch to a robust baroclinic formulation

semantic overlap between two texts by considering the word alignment. Such
alignment-based approaches are intuitive and interpretable; however, they are
empirically inferior to the simple cosine similarity between general-purpose
sentence vectors. To address this issue, we focus on and demonstrate the fact
that the norm of word vectors is a good proxy for word importance, and their
angle is a good proxy for word similarity. Alignment-based approaches do not
distinguish them, whereas sentence-vector approaches automatically use the norm
as the word importance. Accordingly, we propose a method that first decouples
word vectors into their norm and direction, and then computes alignment-based
similarity using earth mover's distance (i.e., optimal transport cost), which
we refer to as word rotator's distance. Besides, we find how to grow the norm

approach derived from sentence-vector estimation methods. On several textual

The first problem involves characterizing the properties of entanglement in the

many-body physics. The second problem is on the quantum communication
complexity of testing bipartite states with EPR assistance, a well-known
question in quantum information theory. We construct a communication protocol
for testing (or measuring) the ground state and use its communication
complexity to reveal a new structural property for the ground state
entanglement. This property, known as the entanglement spread, roughly measures
the ratio between the largest and the smallest Schmidt coefficients across a
cut in the ground state. Our main result shows that gapped ground states
possess limited entanglement spread across any cut, exhibiting an ""area law""
behavior. Our result quite generally applies to any interaction graph with an
improved bound for the special case of lattices. This entanglement spread area
law includes interaction graphs constructed in [Aharonov et al., FOCS'14] that
violate a generalized area law for the entanglement entropy. Our construction
also provides evidence for a conjecture in physics by Li and Haldane on the
entanglement spectrum of lattice Hamiltonians [Li and Haldane, PRL'08]. On the
technical side, we use recent advances in Hamiltonian simulation algorithms

test the hypothesis that data augmentation leads models to unlearn weaker

it is less effective when the preferred strong feature is much more difficult

explore a preliminary defense against such threats. We first show that MT
systems can be stolen by querying them with monolingual sentences and training
models to imitate their outputs. Using simulated experiments, we demonstrate
that MT model stealing is possible even when imitation models have different
input data or architectures than their target models. Applying these ideas, we
train imitation models that reach within 0.6 BLEU of three production MT
systems on both high-resource and low-resource language pairs. We then leverage
the similarity of our imitation models to transfer adversarial examples to the
production systems. We use gradient-based attacks that expose inputs which lead
to semantically-incorrect translations, dropped content, and vulgar model
outputs. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, we propose a defense that modifies
translation outputs in order to misdirect the optimization of imitation models.
This defense degrades the adversary's BLEU score and attack success rate at
some cost in the defender's BLEU and inference speed.

from an anelastic equation set with the complete Coriolis terms, which include
both the vertical and meridional planetary vorticity. The propagation mechanism
can change with the effective static stability. When the effective static
stability reduces to neutral, buoyancy ceases, but the role of buoyancy as an
eastward-propagation mechanism is replaced by the compressional beta effect,
i.e., vertical density-weighted advection of the meridional planetary
vorticity. For example, the Kelvin mode becomes a compressional Rossby mode.
Compressional Rossby waves are meridional vorticity disturbances that propagate
eastward owing to the compressional beta effect. The compressional Rossby wave
solutions can serve as a benchmark to validate the implementation of the
nontraditional Coriolis terms (NCTs) in numerical models; with an effectively
neutral condition and initial large-scale disturbances given a half vertical
wavelength spanning the troposphere on Earth, compressional Rossby waves are
expected to propagate eastward at a phase speed of 0.24 m s${}^{-1}$. The phase
speed increases with the planetary rotation rate and the vertical wavelength
and also changes with the density scale height. Besides, the compressional beta
effect and the meridional vorticity tendency are reconstructed using reanalysis
data and regressed upon tropical precipitation filtered for the Madden$-$Julian
oscillation (MJO). The results suggest that the compressional beta effect
contributes 10.8% of the meridional vorticity tendency associated with the MJO

depth for all pixels in a monocular video. We leverage a conventional
structure-from-motion reconstruction to establish geometric constraints on
pixels in the video. Unlike the ad-hoc priors in classical reconstruction, we
use a learning-based prior, i.e., a convolutional neural network trained for
single-image depth estimation. At test time, we fine-tune this network to
satisfy the geometric constraints of a particular input video, while retaining
its ability to synthesize plausible depth details in parts of the video that
are less constrained. We show through quantitative validation that our method
achieves higher accuracy and a higher degree of geometric consistency than
previous monocular reconstruction methods. Visually, our results appear more
stable. Our algorithm is able to handle challenging hand-held captured input
videos with a moderate degree of dynamic motion. The improved quality of the
reconstruction enables several applications, such as scene reconstruction and
advanced video-based visual effects.

model on synthetic systems of cities show the role of spatial interaction and

existence of intermediate ranges yielding an optimal utility. Multi-objective

tension for Lipschitz random surfaces, that is, for models of random Lipschitz
functions from $\mathbb Z^d$ to $\mathbb Z$ or $\mathbb R$. An essential
innovation is that random surface models with long- and infinite-range
interactions are included in the analysis. More specifically, we cover at
least: uniformly random graph homomorphisms from $\mathbb Z^d$ to a $k$-regular
tree for any $k\geq 2$ and Lipschitz potentials which satisfy the FKG lattice
condition. The latter includes perturbations of dimer- and six-vertex models
and of Lipschitz simply attractive potentials introduced by Sheffield. The main
result is that we prove strict convexity of the surface tension -- which
implies uniqueness for the limiting macroscopic profile -- if the model of
interest is monotone in the boundary conditions. This solves a conjecture of
Menz and Tassy, and answers a question posed by Sheffield. Auxiliary to this,
we prove several results which may be of independent interest, and which do not
rely on the model being monotone. This includes existence and topological
properties of the specific free energy, as well as a characterization of its
minimizers. We also prove a general large deviations principle which describes
both the macroscopic profile and the local statistics of the height functions.

Furthermore, within the context of Tsallis q-framework, we propose an
inflationary model that depends on the non-extensive parameter $q$. The main
source of such an inflation is the same scalar field mentioned before. Being
constrained by the observational data, the q-parameter along with the rest of
the model's parameters has been used to estimate the time at which inflation
ends as well as the reheating temperature. The latter is found to be related to
Gibbons-Hawking temperature. Thus, the present model offers an alternative
perspective regarding the nature of the cosmic background radiation (CMB).

Following seventy-nine nights of photometric monitoring with an NGTS telescope,
we observed a second full transit of NGTS-11 b approximately one year after the

transit signal and restricted the orbital period to a set of 13 discrete

image an occluded object off a scattering surface. The neural net is trained
using only handwritten digits, and yet exhibits capability to reconstruct
patterns distinct from the training set, including physical objects. It can
also reconstruct a cartoon video from its scattering patterns in real time,
demonstrating the robustness and generalization capability of the deep learning
based approach. Several scattering surfaces with varying degree of Lambertian
and specular contributions were examined experimentally; it is found that for a
Lambertian surface the structural similarity index (SSIM) of reconstructed
images is about 0.63, while the SSIM obtained from a scattering surface
possessing a specular component can be as high as 0.93. A forward model of
light transport was developed based on the Phong scattering model. Scattering
patterns from Phong surfaces with different degrees of specular contribution
were numerically simulated. It is found that a specular contribution of as
small as 5% can enhance the SSIM from 0.83 to 0.93, consistent with the results
from experimental data. Singular value spectra of the underlying transfer
matrix were calculated for various Phong surfaces. As the weight and the
shininess factor increase, i.e., the specular contribution increases, the
singular value spectrum broadens and the 50-dB bandwidth is increased by more
than 4X with a 10% specular contribution, which indicates that at the presence
of even a small amount of specular contribution the NLOS measurement can retain
significantly more singular value components, leading to higher reconstruction
fidelity. With an ordinary camera and incoherent light source, this work
enables a low-cost, real-time NLOS imaging system without the need of an
explicit physical model of the underlying light transport process.

redistribute matter is a source of uncertainty for weak-lensing surveys, which
accurately probe the clustering of matter in the Universe over a wide range of
scales. We develop a cosmology-dependent model for the matter distribution that
simultaneously accounts for the clustering of dark matter, gas and stars. We
inform our model by comparing it to power spectra measured from the BAHAMAS

spectra, we also consider spectra involving the electron-pressure field, which
directly relates to the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect. We fit
parameters in our model so that it can simultaneously model both matter and
pressure data and such that the distribution of gas as inferred from tSZ has
influence on the matter spectrum predicted by our model. We present two
variants; one that matches the feedback-induced suppression seen in the
matter-matter power spectrum at the per-cent level and a second that matches
the matter-matter data slightly less well (~2 per cent), but that is able to
simultaneously model the matter-electron pressure spectrum at the ~15 per-cent

decreased by an factor of six at 97 GHz and two at 343 GHz. The flux at 343 GHz
is large relative to that at 97 GHz and appears to be thermal emission from the
circumstellar disk around LS 2883. The decrease of the 343 GHz flux may
indicate that the disk has expanded and become partially optically-thin since
the disk is no longer affected by pulsar winds. The flux at 97 GHz is
consistent with that expected from the pulsed emission from the pulsar, which
indicates that the unpulsed emission that had been produced through pulsar-disk

consistent with a point source and shows no sign of ejecta.

mergers may undergo additional mergers. These hierarchical mergers are
predicted to have higher masses than the first generation of black holes made
from stars. The components of hierarchical mergers are expected to have
significant characteristic spins $\chi\sim 0.7$. However, since the population
properties of first-generation black holes are uncertain, it is difficult to
know if any given merger is first-generation or hierarchical. We use
observations of gravitational waves to reconstruct the binary black hole mass

employ a phenomenological model that captures the properties of merging binary

work on the isolated formation of low-spin black holes, we include a zero-spin
subpopulation. We analyze binary black holes from LIGO and Virgo's first two

GW170729, is mostly likely a first-generation merger, having a $4\%$
probability of being a hierarchical merger assuming a $5 \times 10^5 M_{\odot}$

analysis also provides a new and accurate estimate of the intra-cluster light

azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles available for all sample
galaxies. This allows to quantify the relative weight of all components in the
galaxy structure that contribute to the total light. In addition, we derived
the average g-i colours in each component identified by the fit, as well as the
azimuthally averaged g-i colour profiles, to correlate them with the stellar
mass of each galaxy and the location inside the cluster. We find that in the
most massive and reddest ETGs the fraction of light in, probably accreted,
halos is much larger than in the other galaxies. Less-massive galaxies have an
accreted mass fraction lower than 30%, bluer colours and reside in the
low-density regions of the cluster. Inside the virial radius of the cluster,
the total luminosity of the intra-cluster light, compared with the total
luminosity of all cluster members, is about 34%. Inside the Fornax cluster
there is a clear correlation between the amount of accreted material in the
stellar halos of galaxies and the density of the environment in which those
galaxies reside. By comparing this quantity with theoretical predictions and
previous observational estimates, there is a clear indication that the driving
factor for the accretion process is the total stellar mass of the galaxy, in
agreement with the hierarchical accretion scenario.

accurately estimating normative distributions of healthy anatomy and detecting
lesions as outliers without training examples. Recently, this problem has
received increased attention from the research community following the advances
in unsupervised learning with deep learning. Such advances allow the estimation
of high-dimensional distributions, such as normative distributions, with higher
accuracy than previous methods.The main approach of the recently proposed
methods is to learn a latent-variable model parameterized with networks to
approximate the normative distribution using example images showing healthy
anatomy, perform prior-projection, i.e. reconstruct the image with lesions
using the latent-variable model, and determine lesions based on the differences
between the reconstructed and original images. While being promising, the
prior-projection step often leads to a large number of false positives. In this
work, we approach unsupervised lesion detection as an image restoration problem
and propose a probabilistic model that uses a network-based prior as the
normative distribution and detect lesions pixel-wise using MAP estimation. The
probabilistic model punishes large deviations between restored and original
images, reducing false positives in pixel-wise detections. Experiments with
gliomas and stroke lesions in brain MRI using publicly available datasets show
that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised
methods by a substantial margin, +0.13 (AUC), for both glioma and stroke
detection. Extensive model analysis confirms the effectiveness of MAP-based

specify the form of these assumptions for two different analyses: 1) the one
performed by the EDGES team showing an absorption trough in brightness
temperature that they modeled separately from the sky foreground and 2) a new,
so-called Minimum Assumption Analysis (MAA), that makes the most conservative
assumptions possible for the signal. We show fits using the EDGES analysis on
various beam-weighted foreground simulations from the EDGES latitude with no
signal added. Depending on the beam used, these simulations produce large false
troughs due to the invalidity of the foreground model to describe the
combination of beam chromaticity and the shape of the Galactic plane in the
sky, the residuals of which are captured by the ad hoc flattened Gaussian
signal model. On the other hand, the MAA provides robust fits by including many
spectra at different time bins and allowing any possible 21-cm spectrum to be
modeled exactly. We present uncertainty levels and example signal
reconstructions found with the MAA for different numbers of time bins. With
enough time bins, one can determine the true 21-cm signal with the MAA to $<10$

aims to distinguish between global stationarity and nonstationarity for both
parametric and nonparametric stochastic processes. Interestingly, our theory
builds on our previous work on Bayesian characterization of infinite series,
which was applied to verification of the (in)famous Riemann Hypothesis. Thus,
there seems to be interesting and important connections between pure
mathematics and Bayesian statistics, with respect to our proposed ideas. We
validate our proposed method with simulation and real data experiments
associated with different setups. In particular, applications of our method
include stationarity and nonstationarity determination in various time series
models, spatial and spatio-temporal setups, and convergence diagnostics of
Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Our results demonstrate very encouraging performance,
even in very subtle situations. Using similar principles, we also provide a
novel Bayesian characterization of mutual independence among any number of
random variables, using which we characterize the properties of point
processes, including characterizations of Poisson point processes, complete
spatial randomness, stationarity and nonstationarity. Applications to
simulation experiments with ample Poisson and non-Poisson point process models
again indicate quite encouraging performance of our proposed ideas. We further
propose a novel recursive Bayesian method for determination of frequencies of
oscillatory stochastic processes, based on our general principle. Simulation
studies and real data experiments with varieties of time series models
consisting of single and multiple frequencies bring out the worth of our
method.

  Answering","EACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To extract answers from a large corpus, open-domain question answering (QA)
systems usually rely on information retrieval (IR) techniques to narrow the
search space. Standard inverted index methods such as TF-IDF are commonly used
as thanks to their efficiency. However, their retrieval performance is limited
as they simply use shallow and sparse lexical features. To break the IR
bottleneck, recent studies show that stronger retrieval performance can be
achieved by pretraining a effective paragraph encoder that index paragraphs
into dense vectors. Once trained, the corpus can be pre-encoded into
low-dimensional vectors and stored within an index structure where the
retrieval can be efficiently implemented as maximum inner product search.
  Despite the promising results, pretraining such a dense index is expensive
and often requires a very large batch size. In this work, we propose a simple
and resource-efficient method to pretrain the paragraph encoder. First, instead
of using heuristically created pseudo question-paragraph pairs for pretraining,
we utilize an existing pretrained sequence-to-sequence model to build a strong
question generator that creates high-quality pretraining data. Second, we
propose a progressive pretraining algorithm to ensure the existence of
effective negative samples in each batch. Across three datasets, our method
outperforms an existing dense retrieval method that uses 7 times more

uncertainty, groups outperform individuals. In a lab setting, real groups are
often replaced by simulated groups: Instead of performing an actual group
discussion, individual responses are aggregated by a numerical computation.
While studies typically use unweighted majority voting (MV) for this
aggregation, the theoretically optimal method is confidence weighted majority
voting (CWMV) -- if confidence ratings for the individual responses are
available. However, it is not entirely clear how well the theoretically derived
CWMV method predicts real group decisions and confidences. Therefore, we
compared simulated group responses using CWMV and MV to real group responses.
  Results: Simulated group decisions based on CWMV matched the accuracy of real
group decisions very well, while simulated group decisions based on MV showed
lower accuracy. Also, CWMV well predicted the confidence that groups put into
their group decisions. Yet, individuals and real groups showed a bias towards
under-confidence while CWMV does not.
  Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of taking into account
individual confidences when investigating group decisions: We found that real
groups can aggregate individual confidences such that they match the optimal
aggregation given by CWMV. This implies that research using simulated group
decisions should use CWMV and not MV.

young planets orbit prohibitively faint stars. We present the discovery of two
planets transiting HD 63433 (TOI 1726, TIC 130181866), a young Sun-like

($\tau=414\pm23$ Myr). Based on the TESS light curve and updated stellar
parameters, we estimate the planet radii are $2.15\pm0.10R_\oplus$ and
$2.67\pm0.12R_\oplus$, the orbital periods are 7.11 and 20.55 days, and the
orbital eccentricities are lower than about 0.2. Using HARPS-N velocities, we
measure the Rossiter-McLaughlin signal of the inner planet, demonstrating that
the orbit is prograde. Since the host star is bright (V=6.9), both planets are
amenable to transmission spectroscopy, radial velocity measurements of their
masses, and more precise determination of the stellar obliquity. This system is
therefore poised to play an important role in our understanding of planetary

LSTM networks are providing impressive results on text generation models by
learning language models with grammatically stable syntaxes. But the downside
is that the network does not learn about the context. The network only learns
the input-output function and generates text given a set of input words
irrespective of pragmatics. As the model is trained without any such context,
there is no semantic consistency among the generated sentences. The proposed
model is trained to generate text for a given set of input words along with a
context vector. A context vector is similar to a paragraph vector that grasps
the semantic meaning(context) of the sentence. Several methods of extracting
the context vectors are proposed in this work. While training a language model,
in addition to the input-output sequences, context vectors are also trained
along with the inputs. Due to this structure, the model learns the relation
among the input words, context vector and the target word. Given a set of
context terms, a well trained model will generate text around the provided
context. Based on the nature of computing context vectors, the model has been
tried out with two variations (word importance and word clustering). In the
word clustering method, the suitable embeddings among various domains are also
explored. The results are evaluated based on the semantic closeness of the

the main features of DNA-based data storage. First, information is stored on
many, short DNA strands. Second, the strands are stored in an unordered fashion
inside the storage medium and each strand is replicated many times. Third, the
data is accessed in an uncontrollable manner, i.e., random strands are drawn
from the medium and received, possibly with errors. As one of our results, we
show that there is a significant gap between the channel capacity and the
achievable rate of a standard concatenated code in which one strand corresponds
to an inner block. This is in fact surprising as for other channels, such as
$q$-ary symmetric channels, concatenated codes are known to achieve the
capacity. We further propose a modified concatenated coding scheme by combining

cosmic voids, have been widely used to characterize the properties of the
cosmic web through statistical analyses. On the other hand, the 2-point
correlation function of large-scale tracers such as galaxies or halos provides
a reliable statistical measure. However, this function applies to the spatial
distribution of point-like objects, and therefore it is not appropriate for
extended large structures which strongly depart from spherical symmetry. Here
we present an analysis based on the standard correlation function formalism
that can be applied to extended objects exhibiting arbitrary shapes. Following
this approach, we compute the probability excess $\Xi$ of having spheres
sharing parts of cosmic structures with respect to a realization corresponding
to a distribution of the same structures in random positions. For this aim, we
identify superstructures defined as Future Virialized Structures (FVSs) in
semi-anaytic galaxies on the MPDL2 MultiDark simulation. We have also
identified cosmic voids to provide a joint study of their relative distribution
with respect to the superstructures. Our analysis suggests that $\Xi$ provides
useful characterizations of the large scale distribution, as suggested from an
analysis of sub-sets of the simulation. Even when superstructure properties may
exhibit negligible variations across the sub-sets, $\Xi$ has the sensitivity to
statistically distinguish sub-boxes that departs from the mean at larger
scales. Thus, our methods can be applied in analysis of future surveys to
provide characterizations of large-scale structure suitable to distinguish
different theoretical scenarios.

photometric redshifts, angular positions, and weak lensing shapes for over a
billion galaxies. This large dataset will allow for cosmological analyses using
the angular clustering of galaxies and cosmic shear. The cross-correlation (XC)
between these probes can tighten constraints and it is therefore important to
quantify their impact for Euclid. In this study we carefully quantify the
impact of XC not only on the final parameter constraints for different
cosmological models, but also on the nuisance parameters. In particular, we aim
at understanding the amount of additional information that XC can provide for
parameters encoding systematic effects, such as galaxy bias or intrinsic
alignments (IA). We follow the formalism presented in Euclid Collaboration:
Blanchard et al. (2019) and make use of the codes validated therein. We show
that XC improves the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) by a factor $\sim 5$,
whilst it also reduces the uncertainties on galaxy bias by $\sim 17\%$ and the
uncertainties on IA by a factor $\sim 4$. We observe that the role of XC on the
final parameter constraints is qualitatively the same irrespective of the
galaxy bias model used. We also show that XC can help in distinguishing between
different IA models, and that if IA terms are neglected then this can lead to
significant biases on the cosmological parameters. We find that the XC terms
are necessary to extract the full information content from the data in future
analyses. They help in better constraining the cosmological model, and lead to
a better understanding of the systematic effects that contaminate these probes.
Furthermore, we find that XC helps in constraining the mean of the
photometric-redshift distributions, but it requires a more precise knowledge of
this mean in order not to degrade the final FoM. [Abridged]

A mechanistic model for probability weighting",,,,,"econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Behavioural economics provides labels for patterns in human economic
behaviour. Probability weighting is one such label. It expresses a mismatch
between probabilities used in a formal model of a decision (i.e. model

parameters estimated empirically). The inferred probabilities are called
""decision weights."" It is considered a robust experimental finding that
decision weights are higher than probabilities for rare events, and
(necessarily, through normalisation) lower than probabilities for common
events. Typically this is presented as a cognitive bias, i.e. an error of
judgement by the person. Here we point out that the same observation can be
described differently: broadly speaking, probability weighting means that a
decision maker has greater uncertainty about the world than the observer. We
offer a plausible mechanism whereby such differences in uncertainty arise
naturally: when a decision maker must estimate probabilities as frequencies in
a time series while the observer knows them a priori. This suggests an
alternative presentation of probability weighting as a principled response by a
decision maker to uncertainties unaccounted for in an observer's model.

maintaining the original accuracy on clean data. Therefore, mode connectivity
provides users with the power to repair backdoored or error-injected models. We
also use mode connectivity to investigate the loss landscapes of regular and
robust models against evasion attacks. Experiments show that there exists a
barrier in adversarial robustness loss on the path connecting regular and
adversarially-trained models. A high correlation is observed between the
adversarial robustness loss and the largest eigenvalue of the input Hessian
matrix, for which theoretical justifications are provided. Our results suggest
that mode connectivity offers a holistic tool and practical means for

methods applicable for data assimilation in subsurface flow settings. These
methods differ from model-based techniques in that they provide only posterior
predictions for quantities (time series) of interest, not posterior models with
calibrated parameters. DSI methods require a large number of flow simulations
to first be performed on prior geological realizations. Given observed data,
posterior predictions can then be generated directly. DSI operates in a
Bayesian setting and provides posterior samples of the data vector. In this
work we develop and evaluate a new approach for data parameterization in DSI.
Parameterization reduces the number of variables to determine in the inversion,
and it maintains the physical character of the data variables. The new
parameterization uses a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) for dimension reduction,
and a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network to represent flow-rate time series.
The RAE-based parameterization is combined with an ensemble smoother with
multiple data assimilation (ESMDA) for posterior generation. Results are
presented for two- and three-phase flow in a 2D channelized system and a 3D
multi-Gaussian model. The RAE procedure, along with existing DSI treatments,
are assessed through comparison to reference rejection sampling (RS) results.
The new DSI methodology is shown to consistently outperform existing
approaches, in terms of statistical agreement with RS results. The method is
also shown to accurately capture derived quantities, which are computed from
variables considered directly in DSI. This requires correlation and covariance
between variables to be properly captured, and accuracy in these relationships
is demonstrated. The RAE-based parameterization developed here is clearly
useful in DSI, and it may also find application in other subsurface flow
problems.

positions are modeled as latent variables enabling the reconstruction of the
scene. We then propose a series of approximations that make this problem

astrometric errors from the LSST and NGRST science requirements, redshift

brightest galaxies (r < 18) in the fiducial case. We use these catalogues to
make measurements of parallax versus redshift,for various assumed survey

component of galaxy proper motions. It will also be necessary to push
astrometry of extended sources into a new regime, and combine information from
the different elements of resolved galaxies. In an appendix we describe some
simple tests of galaxy image registration which yield relatively promising

  Can we (partially) reopen the economy without risking the second wave?",,,,,"econ.EM cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As we reach the apex of the COVID-19 pandemic, the most pressing question
facing us is: can we even partially reopen the economy without risking a second
wave? We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if
it did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic
while partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand
the effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their
corresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,
the key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential
trade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that
works best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of
Synthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a
data-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario
planning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between
different interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the
method leverages information from different interventions that have already
been enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of
interest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on
the U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility
restrictions to create a ""synthetic low mobility U.S."" and predict the
counterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar
intervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe
mobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at
retail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope
this provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the
population, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.

interacting spin-two fields in three dimensions. A significant simplification
refers to the treatment of constraints: instead of performing a Hamiltonian
analysis $\grave{a}\, la$ Dirac, we worked out a method that only uses
properties of the pre-symplectic two-form matrix and its corresponding
zero-modes to investigate the nature of constraints and the gauge structure of
the theory. For instance, we demonstrate that the contraction of the zero-modes
with the potential gradient, yields explicit expressions for the whole set of
constraints on the dynamics of the theory, including the symmetrization
condition and an explicit relationship between the coupling and cosmological
constants. This way, we further identify the necessary conditions for the
existence of a unique non-linear candidate for a partially massless theory,
using only the expression for the interaction parameters of the model. In the
case of gauge structure, the transformation laws for the entire set of
dynamical variables are more straightforwardly derived from the structure of
the remaining zero-modes; in this sense, the zero-modes must be viewed as the
generators of the corresponding gauge transformations. Thereafter, we use an
appropriate gauge-fixing procedure, the time gauge, to compute both the
quantization brackets and the functional measure on the path integral
associated with our model. Finally, we confirm that three-dimensional
bi-gravity has two physical degrees of freedom per space point. With the above,
we provide a new perspective for a better understanding of the dynamical
structure of theories of interacting spin-two fields, which does not require
the constraints to be catalogued as first- and second-class ones as in the case
of Dirac's standard method.

connects to at least $\gamma$ fraction of the other vertices (i.e., $\lceil

natural definitions for dense structures useful in finding communities in
social networks and discovering significant biomolecule structures and
pathways. However, mining maximal quasi-cliques is notoriously expensive.
  In this paper, we design parallel algorithms for mining maximal quasi-cliques
on G-thinker, a recent distributed framework targeting divide-and-conquer graph
mining algorithms that decomposes the mining into compute-intensive tasks to
fully utilize CPU cores. However, we found that directly using G-thinker
results in the straggler problem due to (i) the drastic load imbalance among
different tasks and (ii) the difficulty of predicting the task running time and
the time growth with task-subgraph size. We address these challenges by
redesigning G-thinker's execution engine to prioritize long-running tasks for
mining, and by utilizing a novel timeout strategy to effectively decompose the
mining workloads of long-running tasks to improve load balancing. While this
system redesign applies to many other expensive dense subgraph mining problems,
this paper verifies the idea by adapting the state-of-the-art quasi-clique
algorithm, Quick, to our redesigned G-thinker. We improve Quick by integrating
new pruning rules, and fixing some missed boundary cases that could lead to
missed results. Extensive experiments verify that our new solution scales well

fractional interval $[0,1]$. Examination of the modulational instability shows
that it tends to increase with an increase in the fractional exponent, where
the decay proceeds via the formation of filamentary structures that merge
eventually and form pure radiation. The dynamical selftrapping around an
initially localized excitation increases with the fractional exponent, but it
also shows a degree of trapping in the linear limit. This trapping increases
with a decrease in the exponent and can be explained by near-degeneracy
considerations.

has all the same challenges as traditional visible-visible disparity estimation
(occlusions, repetitive patterns, textureless surfaces), in addition of having
very few common visual information between images (e.g. color information vs.
thermal information). In this paper, we propose a new CNN architecture able to
do disparity estimation between images from different spectrum, namely thermal
and visible in our case. Our proposed model takes two patches as input and
proceeds to do domain feature extraction for each of them. Features from both
domains are then merged with two fusion operations, namely correlation and
concatenation. These merged vectors are then forwarded to their respective
classification heads, which are responsible for classifying the inputs as being
same or not. Using two merging operations gives more robustness to our feature
extraction process, which leads to more precise disparity estimation. Our
method was tested using the publicly available LITIV 2014 and LITIV 2018

the Core's parameter Gamma_c*theta_c and the Envelope's Lorentz factor index g,

  light-front and instant-time Hamiltonians",,,"SLAC-PUB-17390","hep-ph hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We compare light-front quantization and instant-time quantization both at the
level of operators and at the level of their Feynman diagram matrix elements.
At the level of operators light-front quantization and instant-time
quantization lead to equal light-front time commutation (or anticommutation)
relations that appear to be quite different from equal instant-time commutation
(or anticommutation) relations. Despite this we show that at unequal times
instant-time and light-front commutation (or anticommutation) relations
actually can be transformed into each other, with it only being the restriction
to equal times that makes the commutation (or anticommutation) relations appear
to be so different. While our results are valid for both bosons and fermions,
for fermions there are subtleties associated with tip of the light cone
contributions that need to be taken care of. At the level of Feynman diagrams
we show for non-vacuum Feynman diagrams that the pole terms in four-dimensional
light-front Feynman diagrams reproduce the three-dimensional light-front
on-shell Hamiltonian Fock space formulation in which the light-front energy and
light-front momentum are on shell. However, because of circle at infinity
contributions we show that this equivalence fails for four-dimensional
light-front vacuum tadpole diagrams. Then, precisely because of these circle at
infinity contributions, light-front vacuum tadpole diagrams are not only
nonzero, they are actually equal to instant-time vacuum tadpole diagrams.
Light-front vacuum diagrams are not correctly describable by the on-shell
Hamiltonian formalism, and thus not by the closely related infinite momentum
frame prescription either. With the transformation from instant-time fields to
light-front fields being a spacetime translation, not only are instant-time

potentials) for elastic nucleon-nucleus scattering has already in the past led
to a large body of work. For first-order calculations a nucleon-nucleon
(\textit{NN}) interaction and a one-body density of the nucleus were taken as
input to rigorous calculations of microscopic full-folding calculations.
  Purpose: Based on the spectator expansion of the multiple scattering series
we employ a chiral next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) nucleon-nucleon
interaction on the same footing in the structure as well as in the reaction
calculation to obtain an in leading-order consistent effective potential for
nucleon-nucleus elastic scattering, which includes the spin of the struck
target nucleon.
  Methods: The first order effective folding potential is computed by first
deriving a nonlocal scalar density as well as a spin-projected momentum
distribution. Those are then integrated with the off-shell Wolfenstein
amplitudes $A$, $C$, and $M$. The resulting nonlocal potential serves as input
to a momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, whose solutions are summed to
obtain the nucleon-nucleus scattering observables.
  Results: We calculate elastic scattering observables for $^4$He, $^6$He,
$^8$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O in the energy regime between 100 and 200 MeV
projectile kinetic energy, and compare to available data. We also explore the
extension down to about 70 MeV, and study the effect of ignoring the spin of
the struck nucleon in the nucleus.
  Conclusions: In our calculations we contrast elastic scattering off
closed-shell and open-shell nuclei. We find that for closed-shell nuclei the
approximation of ignoring the spin of the struck target nucleon is excellent.
We only see effects of the spin of the struck target nucleon when considering
$^6$He and $^8$He, which are nuclei with a $N/Z$ ratio larger than 1.

measures, introduced a significant increase in daily COVID-19 infections,
calling for a roll-back or substantial revisiting of these policies in many
states. The situation is suggestive of difficulties modeling the impact of
partial distancing/re-opening policies on future epidemic spread for purposes
of choosing safe alternatives. More specifically, one needs to understand the
impact of manipulating the availability of social interaction venues (e.g.,
schools, workplaces, and retail establishments) on virus spread. We introduce a
model, inspired by social networks research, that answers the above question.
Our model compartmentalizes interaction venues into categories we call mixing
domains, enabling one to predict COVID-19 contagion trends in different
geographic regions under different what if assumptions on partial re-opening of
individual domains. We apply our model to several highly impacted states
showing (i) how accurately it predicts the extent of current resurgence (from
available policy descriptions), and (ii) what alternatives might be more
effective at mitigating the second wave. We further compare policies that rely
on partial venue closure to policies that espouse wide-spread periodic testing
instead (i.e., in lieu of social distancing). Our models predict that the
benefits of (mandatory) testing out-shadow the benefits of partial venue
closure, suggesting that perhaps more efforts should be directed to such a
mitigation strategy.

made a particular prediction. In NLP this often entails extracting snippets of
an input text `responsible for' corresponding model output; when such a snippet
comprises tokens that indeed informed the model's prediction, it is a faithful
explanation. In some settings, faithfulness may be critical to ensure
transparency. Lei et al. (2016) proposed a model to produce faithful rationales
for neural text classification by defining independent snippet extraction and
prediction modules. However, the discrete selection over input tokens performed
by this method complicates training, leading to high variance and requiring
careful hyperparameter tuning. We propose a simpler variant of this approach
that provides faithful explanations by construction. In our scheme, named
FRESH, arbitrary feature importance scores (e.g., gradients from a trained
model) are used to induce binary labels over token inputs, which an extractor
can be trained to predict. An independent classifier module is then trained
exclusively on snippets provided by the extractor; these snippets thus
constitute faithful explanations, even if the classifier is arbitrarily
complex. In both automatic and manual evaluations we find that variants of this
simple framework yield predictive performance superior to `end-to-end'
approaches, while being more general and easier to train. Code is available at

animals by considering a single image. However, due to challenging scenes with
animals camouflaged in their natural habitat, it sometimes becomes difficult to
identify the presence of animals from merely a single image. We hypothesize
that a short burst of images instead of a single image, assuming that the
animal moves, makes it much easier for a human as well as a machine to detect
the presence of animals. In this work, we explore a variety of approaches, and
measure the impact of using short image sequences (burst of 3 images) on
improving the camera trap image classification. We show that concatenating

nonlinearities in an oscillating flow. Extensive research has sought to
identify different physical mechanisms and types of acoustic streaming in
systems of various geometries. While streaming in a channel maintains one of
the simplest geometries, dimensional analysis of the governing equations
reveals that multiple regimes of streaming may occur within a channel. In this
study, a framework is developed for investigating and understanding the
physical streaming regimes in a two-dimensional channel. By taking different
limits of the dimensionless number ratios found within the framework, streaming
models derived in previous works are recovered to demonstrate the different
streaming regimes within a channel. The onset of fast streaming is then
analyzed with the framework and nonlinear Reynolds numbers, which indicate
whether the streaming is slow or fast, are found for the different physical
streaming regimes. As a result, the framework provides a base for analyzing
fast streaming in a channel and streaming in multi-scale systems while
organizing previous streaming models into a physical spectrum for a channel
geometry.

operation covering estimates for gate parameters and gate error as well as
analyzing spectator qubits and multi-qubit frequency collisions. We start by
revisiting the derivation of effective Hamiltonian models following Magesan et
al. (arXiv:1804.04073). Transmon qubits are commonly modeled as a weakly
anharmonic Kerr oscillator. Kerr theory only accounts for qubit frequency
renormalization, while adopting number states as the eigenstates of the bare
qubit Hamiltonian. Starting from the Josephson nonlinearity and by accounting
for the eigenstates renormalization, due to counter-rotating terms, we derive a
new starting model for the cross-resonance gate with modified qubit-qubit
interaction and drive matrix elements. Employing time-dependent
Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for
the cross-resonance gate with estimates for the gate parameters calculated up
to the fourth order in drive amplitude. The new model with renormalized
eigenstates lead to 10-15 percent relative correction of the effective gate
parameters compared to Kerr theory. We find that gate operation is strongly
dependent on the ratio of qubit-qubit detuning and anharmonicity. In
particular, we characterize five distinct regions of operation, and propose
candidate parameter choices for achieving high gate speed and low coherent gate
error when the cross-resonance tone is equipped with an echo pulse sequence.
Furthermore, we generalize our method to include a third spectator qubit and
characterize possible detrimental multi-qubit frequency collisions.

hard to approximate within any factor less than $2$. Recently, the problem has
received significant attention from the perspective of parameterized
approximation. Gupta et al.~[SODA 2018] initiated the study of
FPT-approximation for the Min $k$-Cut problem and gave an
$1.9997$-approximation algorithm running in time
$2^{\mathcal{O}(k^6)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. Later, the same set of authors~[FOCS

$(k/\epsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{k+\mathcal{O}(1)}$, and a $1.81$-approximation

  In this paper we give a parameterized approximation algorithm with best
possible approximation guarantee, and best possible running time dependence on
said guarantee (up to Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) and constants in the
exponent). In particular, for every $\epsilon > 0$, the algorithm obtains a $(1
+\epsilon)$-approximate solution in time
$(k/\epsilon)^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$. The main ingredients of our
algorithm are: a simple sparsification procedure, a new polynomial time
algorithm for decomposing a graph into highly connected parts, and a new exact
algorithm with running time $s^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ on
unweighted (multi-) graphs. Here, $s$ denotes the number of edges in a minimum

Consequently, it is frequently impossible to set a particular analysis or event

months. This is important for academic referees questioning research on mobile
phone data and for the analysts in deciding how to sample, how much data to
process, and which events are anomalous. All these issues require an
understanding of variability in Big Data to answer the question of how average
is average? This paper provides a method, using a large mobile phone dataset,
to answer these basic but necessary questions. We show that file size is a
robust proxy for the activity level of phone users by profiling the temporal
variability of the data at an hourly, daily and monthly level. We then apply
time-series analysis to isolate temporal periodicity. Finally, we discuss
confidence limits to anomalous events in the data. We recommend an analytical
approach to mobile phone data selection which suggests that ideally data should
be sampled across days, across working weeks, and across the year, to obtain a
representative average. However, where this is impossible, the temporal
variability is such that specific weekdays' data can provide a fair picture of
other days in their general structure.

function of the mass number is well described by the $A^{1/3}$ rule, some fine
structures, such as the evolution along the calcium isotopic chain and the
corresponding odd-even staggerings, are notoriously difficult to describe both
in density functional theories and ab initio methods. In this letter, we
propose a novel ansatz to describe the charge radii of calcium isotopes, by
adding a correction term, proportional to the number of Cooper pairs, and
determined by the BCS amplitudes and a single parameter, to the charge radii
calculated in the relativistic mean field model with the pairing interaction
treated with the BCS method. The new ansatz yields results consistent with data
not only for calcium isotopes, but also for ten other isotopic chains,
including oxygen, neon, magnesium, chromium, nickel, germanium, zirconium,
cadmium, tin, and lead. It is remarkable that this ansatz with a single

particularly the odd-even staggerings and parabolic behavior. We hope that the
present study can stimulate more discussions about its nature and relation with
other effects proposed to explain the odd-even staggerings of charge radii.

sorted data to the graph-theoretic setting. The goal is to design an adaptive
query algorithm, called a strategy, that identifies an initially unknown target
vertex in a graph by asking queries. Each query is conducted as follows: the
strategy selects a vertex $q$ and receives a reply $v$: if $q$ is the target,
then $v=q$, and if $q$ is not the target, then $v$ is a neighbor of $q$ that
lies on a shortest path to the target. Furthermore, there is a noise parameter
$0\leq p<\frac{1}{2}$, which means that each reply can be incorrect with
probability $p$. The optimization criterion to be minimized is the overall
number of queries asked by the strategy, called the query complexity. The query
complexity is well understood to be $O(\varepsilon^{-2}\log n)$ for general
graphs, where $n$ is the order of the graph and $\varepsilon=\frac{1}{2}-p$.
However, implementing such a strategy is computationally expensive, with each
query requiring possibly $O(n^2)$ operations.
  In this work we propose two efficient strategies that keep the optimal query
complexity. The first strategy achieves the overall complexity of
$O(\varepsilon^{-1}n\log n)$ per a single query. The second strategy is
dedicated to graphs of small diameter $D$ and maximum degree $\Delta$ and has
the average complexity of $O(n+\varepsilon^{-2}D\Delta\log n)$ per query. We
stress out that we develop an algorithmic tool of graph median approximation
that is of independent interest: the median can be efficiently approximated by
finding a vertex minimizing the sum of distances to a randomly sampled vertex

the real world involves capturing the (1) static (things/objects and
trajectories of flow), (2) the dynamic (event identification), and (3) the
behavior (e.g., acceptable chronology of events) of the modeled system. This
paper focuses on examining the behavior notion in modeling and current works in
the behavior space to illustrate that the problem of behavior and its related
concepts in modeling lacks a clear-cut systematic basis. The purpose is to
advance the understanding of system behavior to avoid ambiguity-related
problems in system specification. It is proposed to base the notion of behavior
on a new conceptual model, called the thinging machine, which is a tool for
modeling that establishes three levels of representation: (1) a static
structural description that is constructed upon the flow of things in five
generic operations (activities; i.e., create, process, release, transfer and
receive); (2) a dynamic representation that identifies hierarchies of events
based on five generic events; and (3) a chronology of events. This is shown
through examples that support the thinging machine as a new methodology
suitable for all three levels of specification.

distinguishing feature, of the example models considered herein, is that the
collision arises due to the long-range interacting algebraic tails of these
solitary waves. We extend the approach to suitably initialize the relevant
kinks, in the additional presence of finite initial speed, in order to minimize
the dispersive wave radiation potentially created by their slow spatial decay.
We find that, when suitably initialized, these models still feature the
multi-bounce resonance windows earlier found in models in which the kinks bear
exponential tails, such as the $\phi^4$ and $\phi^6$ field theories among
others. Also present is the self-similar structure of the associated windows
with three- and more-bounce windows at the edges of two- and lower-bounce ones.
Moreover, phenomenological, but highly accurate (and predictive) scaling
relations are derived for the dependence of the time between consecutive
collisions and, e.g., the difference in kinetic energy between the incoming one
and the critical one for one-bounces. Such scalings are traced extensively over
two-bounce collision windows throughout the three models, hinting at the
possibility of an analytical theory in this direction.

Specifically, we train and test two Random Forest (RF) classifiers using
photometric features (colors and moments) from the PS1 data release 2. Labels
for the morphological classification are taken from Huertas-Company+2011, while
labels for the star formation fraction (SFF) are from the Blanton+2005 catalog.
We find that colors provide more predictive accuracy than photometric moments.
We morphologically classify galaxies as either early- or late-type, and our RF
model achieves a 78\% classification accuracy. Our second model classifies
galaxies as having either a low-to-moderate or high SFF. This model achieves an
89\% classification accuracy. We apply both RF classifiers to the entire PS1
$3\pi$ dataset, allowing us to assign two scores to each PS1 source:
$P_\mathrm{HSFF}$, which quantifies the probability of having a high SFF, and
$P_\mathrm{spiral}$, which quantifies the probability of having a late-type
morphology. Finally, as a proof of concept, we apply our classification
framework to supernova (SN) host-galaxies from the Zwicky Transient Factory and
the Lick Observatory Supernova Search samples. We show that by selecting on
$P_\mathrm{HSFF}$ or $P_\mathrm{spiral}$ it is possible to significantly
enhance or suppress the fraction of core-collapse SNe (or thermonuclear SNe) in

max-attention, a novel variant that effectively captures interactions among

substantially differ from their non-pooling equivalents in their learning

analyzing the gradient propagation, we discover that pooling facilitates better
gradient flow compared to BiLSTMs. Further, we expose how BiLSTMs are
positionally biased towards tokens in the beginning and the end of a sequence.
Pooling alleviates such biases. Consequently, we identify settings where
pooling offers large benefits: (i) in low resource scenarios, and (ii) when
important words lie towards the middle of the sentence. Among the pooling
techniques studied, max-attention is the most effective, resulting in
significant performance gains on several text classification tasks.

keep a bamboo garden from obstructing the view of the lake by your house.
  The garden consists of $n$ bamboo stalks with known daily growth rates and
the gardener can cut at most one bamboo per day. As a computer scientist, you
found out that this problem has already been formalized in [G\k{a}sieniec et
al., SOFSEM'17] as the Bamboo Garden Trimming (BGT) problem, where the goal is
that of computing a perpetual schedule (i.e., the sequence of bamboos to cut)
for the robotic gardener to follow in order to minimize the makespan, i.e., the
maximum height ever reached by a bamboo.
  Two natural strategies are Reduce-Max and Reduce-Fastest(x). Reduce-Max trims
the tallest bamboo of the day, while Reduce-Fastest(x) trims the fastest
growing bamboo among the ones that are taller than $x$. It is known that
Reduce-Max and Reduce-Fastest(x) achieve a makespan of $O(\log n)$ and $4$ for
the best choice of $x=2$, respectively. We prove the first constant upper bound
of $9$ for Reduce-Max and improve the one for Reduce-Fastest(x) to
$\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2} < 2.62$ for $x=1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$.
  Another critical aspect stems from the fact that your robotic gardener has a
limited amount of processing power and memory. It is then important for the
algorithm to be able to quickly determine the next bamboo to cut while
requiring at most linear space. We formalize this aspect as the problem of
designing a Trimming Oracle data structure, and we provide three efficient

often used to control the dynamics of viscous drops and bubbles. Surfactant
sorption kinetics has been shown to play a critical role in the deformation of
drops in extensional and shear flows, yet to the best of our knowledge these
kinetics effects on a viscous drop in an electric fieldhave not been accounted
for. In this paper we numerically investigate the effects of sorption kinetics
on a surfactant-covered viscous drop in an electric field. Over a range of
electric conductivity and permittivity ratios between the interior and exterior
fluids, we focus on the dependence of deformation and flow on the transfer
parameter $J$, and Biot number $\text{Bi}$ that characterize the extent of
surfactant exchange between the drop surface and the bulk. Our findings suggest
solubility affects the electrohydrodynamics of a viscous drop in distinct ways
as we identify parameter regions where (1) surfactant solubility may alter both
the drop deformation and circulation of fluid around a drop, and (2) surfactant
solubility affects mainly the flow and not the deformation.

paths. Although this idea already appeared in proposed TE systems, it was not

operations number reduction can be achieved or how to select thresholds or
sampling rates to cover the desired fraction of traffic. In this paper, we use
reproducible traffic models obtained from a 30-day-long campus trace covering 4
billion flows, to answer these questions. We establish theoretical boundaries
for flow table usage reduction algorithms that classify flows since the first
packet, after reaching a predefined counter threshold or detect elephants by
sampling. An important finding is that simple packet sampling performs
surprisingly well on realistic traffic, reducing the number of flow entries by
a factor up to 400, still covering 80% of the traffic. We also provide an

effectiveness of fine-tuning is limited by the inclusion of training examples

method that we call information gain filtration for improving the overall
training efficiency and final performance of language model fine-tuning. We
define the information gain of an example as the improvement on a test metric
after training on that example. A secondary learner is then trained to
approximate this quantity. During fine-tuning, this learner selects informative
examples and skips uninformative ones. We show that our method has consistent
improvement across datasets, fine-tuning tasks, and language model
architectures. For example, we achieve a median perplexity of 54.0 on a books
dataset compared to 57.3 for standard fine-tuning. We present statistical
evidence that offers insight into the improvements of our method over standard
fine-tuning. The generality of our method leads us to propose a new paradigm
for language model fine-tuning -- we encourage researchers to release
pretrained secondary learners on common corpora to promote efficient and

improve the performance and enable new functions of spintronic devices. It is
imperative to have a 2D material possessing diverse electronic and magnetic
properties that are required in spintronics. In this work, using density
functional theory calculations, we surveyed all IV, V and VI group transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and discovered that CrS2 has the most diverse
electronic and magnetic properties: antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic 1T phase,
nonmagnetic (NM) semiconductor 2H phase, and ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductor
1T_prime phase with a Curie temperature of ~1000 K. More interestingly, we
found that a tensile or compressive strain could turn 1T_prime phase into a
spin-up or spin-down half metal. Such a unique feature enables designing
strain-controlled spintronic devices using a single piece of CrS2 crystal with
improved energy efficiency, which remains a challenge in miniaturization of
spintronic devices. In-depth analysis attributed the unique strain tunability
to the interplay between strain-induced lattice deformation and different

averaging reduces generalization error when used with convex losses, and
tightens PAC-Bayes bounds. We provide empirical support of these theoretical
results, including a demonstration of why generalization may not improve by
training with data augmentation: the `learned invariance' fails outside of the

challenging applications necessarily require beams with good stability, high

probabilistic theories. We show that the answer is no - there are
infinite-dimensional convex sets for which the set of Scott-continuous states
on the corresponding set of 2-valued POVMs does not recover the original convex
set, but is strictly larger. This shows the necessity of the use of topologies
for state-effect duality in the general case, rather than purely order
theoretic notions.

ways: he can corrupt the observation of the supervisor editing the sensor
readings, and can enable events that are disabled by the supervisor. This is
done with the aim of leading the plant to an unsafe state, and keeping the
supervisor unaware of that before the unsafe state is reached. A special
automaton, called attack structure is constructed as the parallel composition
of two special structures. Such an automaton can be used by the attacker to
select appropriate actions (if any) to reach the above goal, or equivalently by
the supervisor, to validate its robustness with respect to such attacks.

model without sharing private data among users. However, an adversary may still
be able to infer the private training data by attacking the released model.
Differential privacy provides a statistical protection against such attacks at
the price of significantly degrading the accuracy or utility of the trained
models. In this paper, we investigate a utility enhancement scheme based on
Laplacian smoothing for differentially private federated learning (DP-Fed-LS),
where the parameter aggregation with injected Gaussian noise is improved in
statistical precision without losing privacy budget. Our key observation is
that the aggregated gradients in federated learning often enjoy a type of
smoothness, i.e. sparsity in the graph Fourier basis with polynomial decays of
Fourier coefficients as frequency grows, which can be exploited by the
Laplacian smoothing efficiently. Under a prescribed differential privacy
budget, convergence error bounds with tight rates are provided for DP-Fed-LS
with uniform subsampling of heterogeneous Non-IID data, revealing possible
utility improvement of Laplacian smoothing in effective dimensionality and
variance reduction, among others. Experiments over MNIST, SVHN, and Shakespeare
datasets show that the proposed method can improve model accuracy with
DP-guarantee and membership privacy under both uniform and Poisson subsampling
mechanisms.

introduced the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for the variable star
classification. Our goal is the development and analysis of an automatic
procedure, based on ML, for the identification of RRLs in the VVV Survey. This
procedure will be use to generate reliable catalogs integrated over several
tiles in the survey. After the reconstruction of light-curves, we extract a set
of period and intensity-based features. We use for the first time a new subset
of pseudo color features. We discuss all the appropriate steps needed to define
our automatic pipeline: selection of quality measures; sampling procedures;
classifier setup and model selection. As final result, we construct an ensemble
classifier with an average Recall of 0.48 and average Precision of 0.86 over 15
tiles. We also make available our processed datasets and a catalog of candidate
RRLs. Perhaps most interestingly, from a classification perspective based on
photometric broad-band data, is that our results indicate that Color is an
informative feature type of the RRL that should be considered for automatic
classification methods via ML. We also argue that Recall and Precision in both
tables and curves are high quality metrics for this highly imbalanced problem.
Furthermore, we show for our VVV data-set that to have good estimates it is
important to use the original distribution more than reduced samples with an
artificial balance. Finally, we show that the use of ensemble classifiers helps
resolve the crucial model selection step, and that most errors in the
identification of RRLs are related to low quality observations of some sources
or to the difficulty to resolve the RRL-C type given the date.

also use our derivation of the limit of the case-crossover estimator to analyze
its sensitivity to treatment effect heterogeneity, a violation of one of the
informal criteria for validity. The upshot of this work for practitioners is
that, while the case-crossover design can be useful for testing the causal null
hypothesis in the presence of baseline confounders, extra caution is warranted
when using the case-crossover design for point estimation of causal effects.

theoretically that the dc shift current appears in a noncentrosymmetric
disordered one-dimensional insulator with random potential. When the light
illuminates the entire sample, the photocurrent forms in presence of the
electron-phonon coupling. We find this photocurrent remains robustly even when
the energy scale of random potential is larger than the bandwidth. On the other
hand, the photocurrent decays exponentially when the excitation is local, or
the relaxation is only due to the contact with the electrodes. These results
open a route to design high-efficiency solar cells and photodetectors.

even in a system with an optical thickness as low as tau_0~100-500. We also
investigate the effects of the turbulent motion of the ISM on the emergent
Ly-alpha spectrum and color temperature. The turbulent motion broadens, as
generally expected, the emergent spectrum, but the color temperature is not
affected by the turbulent motion in typical astrophysical environments. We
utilize two multiphase ISM models, appropriate for the vicinity of the Sun, to
calculate the 21-cm spin temperature of neutral hydrogen, including excitation
via the Ly-alpha resonant scattering. The first ISM model is a simple clumpy
model, while the second is a self-consistent magnetohydrodynamics simulation

the Ly-alpha radiation field is, in general, likely to be strong enough to

behaviour of geodesics in such spacetimes. The types of Kundt spacetimes we
consider here are direct products of the form $H^2\times M(1,1)$ and $S^2\times
M(1,1)$. Both geometries have constant scalar curvature. We consider a scenario
in which initial velocities of the transverse geodesic coordinates are set to
zero (before the arrival of the pulse) in a spacetime with non-vanishing
background curvature. We look for changes in the separation between pairs of
geodesics caused by the pulse. Any relative change observed in the position and
velocity profiles of geodesics, after the burst, can be solely attributed to
the wave (hence, a memory effect). For constant negative curvature, we find
there is permanent change in the separation of geodesics after the pulse has
departed. Thus, there is displacement memory, though no velocity memory is
found. In the case of constant positive scalar curvature (Pleba\'nski-Hacyan
spacetimes), we find both displacement and velocity memory along one direction.
In the other direction, a new kind of memory (which we term as frequency memory
effect) is observed where the separation between the geodesics shows periodic
oscillations once the pulse has left. We also carry out similar analyses for
spacetimes with a non-constant scalar curvature, which may be positive or
negative. The results here seem to qualitatively agree with those for constant
scalar curvature, thereby suggesting a link between the nature of memory and
curvature.

Offsets in timing and the rapidly-changing development of $B_z$ in comparison

RMSE of $9$ nT, which is double the error of $4$ nT using measurements

susceptibilities. In this paper, we study the effect of two-loop matching
coefficients by Harlander et al. We also test the influence of the
renormalization scale in the SFtX method. We find that, by adopting the mu_0
renormalization scale of Harlander et al. instead of the conventional
mu_d=1/sqrt{8t} scale, the linear behavior at large t is improved so that we
can perform the t -> 0 extrapolation of the SFtX method more confidently. In
the calculation of the two-loop matching coefficients by Harlander et al., the
equation of motion for quark fields was used. For the entropy density in which
the equation of motion has no effects, we find that the results using the
two-loop coefficients agree well with those using one-loop coefficients. On the
other hand, for the trace anomaly which is affected by the equation of motion,
we find discrepancies between the one- and two-loop results at high
temperatures. By comparing the results of one-loop coefficients with and
without using the equation of motion, the main origin of the discrepancies is
suggested to be attributed to O((aT)^2)=O(1/N_t^2) discretization errors in the
equation of motion at N_t =< 10.

everywhere model in order to better handle the disproportionate increase in the
number of cores compared with other on-node resources. However, the
communication performance of MPI+threads can be 100x slower than that of MPI
everywhere. Both MPI users and developers are to blame for this slowdown.
Typically, MPI users do not expose logical communication parallelism.
Consequently, MPI libraries use conservative approaches, such as a global
critical section, to maintain MPI's ordering constraints for MPI+threads, thus
serializing access to parallel network resources and hurting performance.
  To enhance MP+threads' communication performance, researchers have proposed
MPI Endpoints as a user-visible extension to MPI-3.1. MPI Endpoints allows a
single process to create multiple MPI ranks within a communicator. This could
allow each thread to have a dedicated communication path to the network and
improve performance. The onus of mapping threads to endpoints, however, would
then be on domain scientists. We play the role of devil's advocate and question
the need for user-visible endpoints. We certainly agree that dedicated
communication channels are critical. To what extent, however, can we hide these
channels inside the MPI library without modifying the MPI standard and thus
unburden the user? More important, what functionality would we lose through
such abstraction? This paper answers these questions through a new MPI-3.1
implementation that uses virtual communication interfaces (VCIs). VCIs abstract
underlying network contexts. When users expose parallelism through existing MPI
mechanisms, the MPI library maps that parallelism to the VCIs, relieving domain
scientists from endpoints. We identify cases where VCIs perform as well as
user-visible endpoints, as well as cases where such abstraction hurts
performance.

biological and soft matter systems, including the adhesion of biological cells
and functionalized colloidal particles to various substrates. To elucidate
advantages and disadvantages of multiple bond populations for the stability of
heterogeneous adhesion clusters of receptor-ligand pairs, a theoretical model
for a homogeneous parallel adhesion bond cluster under constant loading is
extended to several bond types. The stability of the entire cluster can be
tuned by changing densities of different bond populations as well as their
extensional rigidity and binding properties. In particular, bond extensional
rigidities determine the distribution of total load to be shared between
different sub-populations. Under a gradual increase of the total load, the
rupture of a heterogeneous adhesion cluster can be thought of as a multistep
discrete process, in which one of the bond sub-populations ruptures first,
followed by similar rupture steps of other sub-populations or by immediate
detachment of the remaining cluster. This rupture behavior is qualitatively
independent of involved bond types, such as slip and catch bonds.
Interestingly, an optimal stability is generally achieved when the total
cluster load is shared such that loads on distinct bond populations are equal
to their individual critical rupture forces. We also show that cluster
heterogeneity can drastically affect cluster lifetime.

Equivalently, one could require that every tuple from any one of its
constraints extends to a solution of the instance.
  Clearly, any non-trivial template has instances which are not sensitive.
Therefore we follow the direction proposed (in the context of strict width) by
Feder and Vardi (SICOMP 1999) and require that only the instances produced by a
local consistency checking algorithm are sensitive. In the language of the
algebraic approach to the CSP we show that a finite idempotent algebra
$\mathbf{A}$ has a $k+2$ variable near unanimity term operation if and only if
any instance that results from running the $(k, k+1)$-consistency algorithm on
an instance over $\mathbf{A}^2$ is sensitive.

condition holding in a variety of algebras, settles a question posed by G.
Bergman about systems of projections of algebras that arise from some
subalgebra of a finite product of algebras.
  Our results hold for infinite (albeit in the case of $\mathbf{A}$ idempotent)

solve this problem, two iterative algorithms are proposed for the single-user

problem is solved by using a successive convex approximation method, which
admits a closed-form solution at each step. Moreover, the optimal RIS on-off

operations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates a
decentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT
workload balance and (local) quality of service (QoS), in terms of minimizing
the cost of deadline violation, service deployment, and unhosted services. The
proposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized multi-agent system for
collective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance the
input workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service
execution. The agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to
resources and then cooperatively select an assignment such that their
combination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service execution cost.
Extensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on
various networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of
workload balance and QoS, compared to approaches such as First Fit and
exclusively Cloud-based. The results confirm that EPOS Fog reduces service
execution delay up to 25% and the load-balance of network nodes up to 90%. The
findings also demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge

critical temperature of Niobium (9.25K) and then Aluminium (1.2K), while
measuring the quality factors of the electromagnetic resonances. This was then
compared with finite element analysis of the cavity and a measurement of the
same cavity with an Aluminium post of similar dimensions and frequency, to
extract the surface resistance of the Niobium post. The 3D-printed Niobium
exhibited a transition to the superconducting state at a similar temperature to
the regular Niobium, as well as a surface resistance of $3.1\times10^{-4}$
$\Omega$. This value was comparable to many samples of traditionally machined
Niobium previously studied without specialised surface treatment. Furthermore,
this study demonstrates a simple new method for characterizing the material
properties of a relatively small and geometrically simple sample of
superconductor, which could be easily applied to other materials, particularly
3D-printed materials. Further research and development in additive
manufacturing may see the application of 3D-printed Niobium in not only
superconducting cavity designs, but in the innovative technology of the future.

  orbitals for predicting the properties of semiconductors","Manuscript + Supporting Information",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurately modeling the electronic structure of materials is a persistent
challenge to high-throughput screening. A promising means of balancing accuracy
against computational cost are non-self-consistent calculations with hybrid
density-functional theory, where the electronic band energies are evaluated
using a hybrid functional from orbitals obtained with a less demanding
(semi-)local functional. We have quantified the performance of this technique
for predicting the physical properties of sixteen tetrahedral semiconductors
with bandgaps from 0.2-5.5 eV. Provided the base functional predicts a
non-metallic electronic structure, bandgaps within 5 % of the PBE0 and HSE06
gaps can be obtained with an order of magnitude reduction in computing time.
The positions of the valence and conduction band extrema and the Fermi level
are well reproduced, further enabling calculation of the band dispersion,
density of states, and dielectric properties using Fermi's Golden Rule. While
the error in the non-self-consistent total energies is ~50 meV atom-1, the
energy-volume curves are reproduced accurately enough to obtain the equilibrium
volume and bulk modulus with minimal error. We also test the
dielectric-dependent scPBE0 functional and obtain bandgaps and dielectric
constants to within 2.5 % of the self-consistent results, which amount to a
significant improvement over self-consistent PBE0 for a similar computational
cost. We identify cases where the non-self-consistent approach is expected to
perform poorly, and demonstrate that partial self-consistency provides a
practical and efficient workaround. Finally, we perform proof-of-concept
calculations on CoO and NiO to demonstrate the applicability of the technique
to strongly-correlated open-shell transition-metal oxides.

  Domain","Our code is available at https://github.com/zhaoyanpeng/srltransfer",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Semantic role labeling (SRL) is an NLP task involving the assignment of
predicate arguments to types, called semantic roles. Though research on SRL has
primarily focused on verbal predicates and many resources available for SRL
provide annotations only for verbs, semantic relations are often triggered by
other linguistic constructions, e.g., nominalizations. In this work, we
investigate a transfer scenario where we assume role-annotated data for the
source verbal domain but only unlabeled data for the target nominal domain. Our
key assumption, enabling the transfer between the two domains, is that
selectional preferences of a role (i.e., preferences or constraints on the
admissible arguments) do not strongly depend on whether the relation is
triggered by a verb or a noun. For example, the same set of arguments can fill
the Acquirer role for the verbal predicate `acquire' and its nominal form
`acquisition'. We approach the transfer task from the variational autoencoding
perspective. The labeler serves as an encoder (predicting role labels given a
sentence), whereas selectional preferences are captured in the decoder
component (generating arguments for the predicting roles). Nominal roles are
not labeled in the training data, and the learning objective instead pushes the
labeler to assign roles predictive of the arguments. Sharing the decoder
parameters across the domains encourages consistency between labels predicted
for both domains and facilitates the transfer. The method substantially
outperforms baselines, such as unsupervised and `direct transfer' methods, on
the English CoNLL-2009 dataset.

star-forming galaxies and compare them with the local star-forming galaxies.
For this purpose, we have used $409$ galaxies from the K-band Multi-Object
Spectrograph (KMOS) for Redshift One Spectroscopic Survey (KROSS). This sample
covers the redshift range $0.57\leq z \leq 1.04$, effective radii $0.69 \leq
R_e \left[kpc \right] \leq 7.73$, absolute H-band magnitude $-24.46 \leq M_H

\right]\right)=9.95$ and median total star-formation rate $log\left(SFR_{tot} \
\left[M_\odot \ yr^{-1} \right]\right)=1.49$. Using $^{3D}$BAROLO (Barolo), we
extract $H\alpha$ kinematic maps and corresponding Rotation Curves (RCs). The
main advantage of Barolo is that it incorporates the beam smearing in the 3D
observational space, which provide us with the intrinsic rotation velocity even
in the low spatial resolution data. Using Asymmetric Drift Correction (ADC), we
have corrected the RCs for the pressure gradient effect, which seems to be a
more dominant effect than beam smearing in high-z galaxies. Nearly all objects
($0.1 <v/ \sigma< 15$) are affected by the pressure gradient, and we noticed
that ADC improves the rotation velocity of these systems by $\sim 10-87\%$.
Only a combination of the three techniques (3D-kinematic modelling +
3D-Beamsmearing correction + ADC ) yields the intrinsic RC of an individual
galaxy. Further, we present the co-added RCs constructed out of 237
high-quality objects to obtain intrinsic RC shapes out to 6.4 $\times$ disk
scale length. We do not see any change in the shape of RCs with respect to the
local star-forming disk-type galaxies. In contrast, we do find a significant
evolution in the stellar-disk length ($R_D$) of the galaxies. Therefore, we
conclude stellar disk evolves over cosmic time while total mass distribution
stays constant.

particular, two RPCs were flushed with pure Ar gas for a prolonged period of
time and a plasma was created by fully ionizing the gas. The output gas was

  \[\{(z_1,z_2)\in \mathbb{C} ^2 : 1+|z_1|^2-|z_2|^2>|1+ z_1 ^2 -z_2 ^2|,
Im(z_1 (1+\overline{z_2}))>0\}\] in Isaev's list. Isaev calls it $\mathcal
D_1$. The road to the biholomorphism is paved with various geometric insights
about $\mathbb{G}$. Several consequences of the biholomorphism follow including
two new characterizations of the symmetrized bidisc and several new
characterizations of $\mathcal D_1$. Among the results on $\mathcal D_1$, of
particular interest is the fact that $\mathcal D_1$ is a ""symmetrization"". When
we symmetrize (appropriately defined in the context in the last section) either
$\Omega_1$ or $\mathcal{D}^{(2)}_1$ (Isaev's notation), we get $\mathcal D_1$.
These two domains $\Omega_1$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(2)}_1$ are in Isaev's list and
he mentioned that these are biholomorphic to $\mathbb{D} \times \mathbb{D}$. We
produce explicit biholomorphisms between these domains and $\mathbb{D} \times

problem for the modified matrix Korteweg-de Vries (mmKdV) equation with the
$2m\times2m$ $(m\geq 1)$ Lax pairs under the nonzero boundary conditions at
infinity. In the direct problem, by introducing a suitable uniform
transformation we establish the proper complex $z$-plane in order to discuss
the Jost eigenfunctions, scattering matrix and their analyticity and symmetry
of the equation. Moreover the asymptotic behavior of the Jost functions and
scattering matrix needed in the inverse problem are analyzed via
Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin expansion. In the inverse problem, the generalized
Riemann-Hilbert problem of the mmKdV equation is first established by using the
analyticity of the modified eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients. The
reconstruction formula of potential function with reflection-less case is
derived by solving this Riemann-Hilbert problem and using the scattering data.
In addition the dynamic behavior of the solutions for the focusing mmKdV
equation including one- and two- soliton solutions are presented in detail
under the the condition that the potential is scalar and the $2\times2$
symmetric matrix. Finally, we provide some detailed proofs and weak version of

Higgs field is in general localized at a boundary of the SED (TeV-brane) where
the gravity scale is redshifted to the TeV by a warp factor. If the SM gauge
bosons and fermions propagate into the warped SED, one can generate the mass
hierarchy for fermions. It is thus crucial to treat carefully the TeV-brane
localized masses for such fermions, which is done in the literature by applying
a regularization process suffering from a lack of consistency and more
importantly being useless, as we demonstrate in detail in the present thesis.
The first part of the thesis is devoted to the treatment of brane localized
mass terms for 5D fermions, which requires the introduction of new Lagrangian
terms at the SED boundaries, similar to the Gibbons-Hawking terms in gravity.
The second part consists in applying different methods (function/distribution
fields, 4D/5D calculations, etc) to various brane localized terms (kinetic
terms, Majorana masses, etc), as well as a generalization to several classified
models (flat/warped dimensions, intervalle/orbifold, etc). In the third part,
we propose to compactify a flat SED on a star/rose graph with a large number of
identical small leaves/petals. We obtain a compactified space with a large
volume without a large compactification length to stabilize. We use the
approach of 5D fermions to build a toy model of small Dirac neutrino masses

to stop leaks via speculation, it suffices to $\textit{cut}$ the dataflow from
expressions that speculatively introduce secrets ($\textit{sources}$) to those
that leak them through the cache ($\textit{sinks}$), rather than prohibit
speculation altogether. We formalize this insight in a $\textit{static type
system}$ that (1) types each expression as either $\textit{transient}$, i.e.,
possibly containing speculative secrets or as being $\textit{stable}$, and (2)
prohibits speculative leaks by requiring that all $\textit{sink}$ expressions
are stable. BLADE relies on a new new abstract primitive, $\textbf{protect}$,
to halt speculation at fine granularity. We formalize and implement
$\textbf{protect}$ using existing architectural mechanisms, and show how
BLADE's type system can automatically synthesize a $\textit{minimal}$ number of
$\textbf{protect}$s to provably eliminate speculative leaks. We implement BLADE
in the Cranelift WebAssembly compiler and evaluate our approach by repairing
several verified, yet vulnerable WebAssembly implementations of cryptographic
primitives. We find that Blade can fix existing programs that leak via

Interferometry (VLBI) is so far the only technique enabling the imaging of the
innermost jet at milli-arcsec resolution (parsec scale), where the high energy
emission possibly originates from. Here, we report on the radio properties of
the parsec scale jet in \txs{} derived from the analysis of multi-epoch
multi-frequency archive VLBI data. The half opening angle of the jet beam is
about 3.8\degr, and the jet inclination angle is about 20\degr. The overall jet
structure shows a helical trajectory with a precessing period of 5--6 years,
likely originating from instabilities operating at parsec scales. The
calculated beaming parameters (Doppler boosting factor, bulk Lorentz factor)
suggest a moderately relativistic jet. The pc-scale magnetic field strength is
estimated in the contexts of core-shift and variability, and is in general
agreement in the range of 0.2 - 0.7 G. And it is found to decrease from a
relatively larger value during the quiescent period before the ongoing flare.
This suggests a conversion of magnetic field energy density to particle energy
density that help accelerate injected particles at the jet base and result in
variable shocked emission. The neutrino event could be associated with the
onset of energetic particle injection into the jet. This scenario then supports
the lepto-hadronic origin of the VHE neutrinos and $\gamma$-ray emission owing
to a co-spatial origin.

because the blur is spatially varying and difficult to estimate. We propose an
effective defocus deblurring method that exploits data available on dual-pixel
(DP) sensors found on most modern cameras. DP sensors are used to assist a
camera's auto-focus by capturing two sub-aperture views of the scene in a
single image shot. The two sub-aperture images are used to calculate the
appropriate lens position to focus on a particular scene region and are
discarded afterwards. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture
that uses these discarded sub-aperture images to reduce defocus blur. A key
contribution of our effort is a carefully captured dataset of 500 scenes (2000

large aperture; (ii) the two associated DP sub-aperture views; and (iii) the

originating from translating monolingual corpora, a technique known as
backtranslation. Combining backtranslated data from different sources has led
to better results than when using such data in isolation. In this work we
analyse the impact that data translated with rule-based, phrase-based
statistical and neural MT systems has on new MT systems. We use a real-world
low-resource use-case (Basque-to-Spanish in the clinical domain) as well as a
high-resource language pair (German-to-English) to test different scenarios
with backtranslation and employ data selection to optimise the synthetic
corpora. We exploit different data selection strategies in order to reduce the
amount of data used, while at the same time maintaining high-quality MT
systems. We further tune the data selection method by taking into account the
quality of the MT systems used for backtranslation and lexical diversity of the
resulting corpora. Our experiments show that incorporating backtranslated data
from different sources can be beneficial, and that availing of data selection
can yield improved performance.

idiosyncratic biases of the dataset, which make them brittle against test cases
outside the training distribution. Recently, several proposed debiasing methods
are shown to be very effective in improving out-of-distribution performance.
However, their improvements come at the expense of performance drop when models
are evaluated on the in-distribution data, which contain examples with higher
diversity. This seemingly inevitable trade-off may not tell us much about the
changes in the reasoning and understanding capabilities of the resulting models
on broader types of examples beyond the small subset represented in the
out-of-distribution data. In this paper, we address this trade-off by
introducing a novel debiasing method, called confidence regularization, which
discourage models from exploiting biases while enabling them to receive enough
incentive to learn from all the training examples. We evaluate our method on
three NLU tasks and show that, in contrast to its predecessors, it improves the
performance on out-of-distribution datasets (e.g., 7pp gain on HANS dataset)

undulations of the wall topography drives the creation of bespoke longitudinal
vortices. A resonant interaction between the ambient vorticity of the
undisturbed shear flow and the undulation of streamlines enforced by the wall
topography serves to slightly rotate the spanwise vorticity of the mean flow
into the streamwise direction, creating a swirling motion, in the form of
regular streamwise rolls. The process is kinematic and essentially identical to
the `direct drive' CL1 mechanism for Langmuir circulation (LC) proposed by
Craik (1970). Boundary layers are modelled by selecting suitable primary flow
profiles. A simple, easily integrable expression for the cross-plane stream
function is found in two asymptotic regimes: the resonant onset of the
essentially inviscid instability at early times, and the fully developed steady
state viscous flow. Linear-order solutions for flow over undulating boundaries
are obtained, fully analytical in the special case of a power-law profile.
These solutions allow us to quickly map out the circulation response to
boundary design parameters. The study is supplemented with direct numerical
simulations which verify the manifestation of boundary induced Langmuir
vortices in laminar flows with no-slip boundaries. Simulations show good
qualitative agreement with theory. Quantitatively, the comparisons rest on a
displacement length closure parameter adopted in the perturbation theory. While
wall-driven LC appear to become unstable in turbulent flows, we propose that
the mechanism can promote swirling motion in boundary layers, a flow feature
which has been reported to reduce drag in some situations.

transfer to such an unseen dialect, specifically in two extreme cases: (i)
across scripts, using Modern Standard Arabic as a source language, and (ii)
from a distantly related language, unseen during pretraining, namely Maltese.
Our results constitute the first successful transfer experiments on this

resource-scarce, non-standardized and highly variable vernacular languages.

SNhunt120 consists of an early optical discovery, estimated to be within 3 days
after outburst, the subsequent optical and near-infrared broadband followup
extending over a $\sim$2 month period, two visual- and two near-infrared
wavelength spectra, and Spitzer Space Telescope observations extending from
early ($+$28 d) to late ($+$1155 d) phases. SNhunt120 resembles other ILRTs
such as NGC 300-2008-OT and SN 2008S, and like these other ILRTs, SNhunt120
exhibits prevalent mid-infrared emission at both early and late phases. From
the comparison of SNhunt120 and other ILRTs to electron-capture supernova
simulations, we find that the current models underestimate the explosion
kinetic energy and thereby produce synthetic light curves that over-estimate
the luminosity. Finally, examination of pre-outburst Hubble Space Telescope

imposed. The basis function weights are computed numerically using the discrete
sine and cosine transforms, which can be implemented using O(N log N)
operations analogous to the fast Fourier transform. Practical details of how to
implement spectral methods using discrete sine and cosine transforms are
provided. The technique is then illustrated through the solution of the wave

coefficients or boundaries that are non-reflecting is also demonstrated using
the weighted summation of the solutions with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary

for weakly supervised segmentation, such reference masks are used to train a
discriminator rather than a segmentation network, and thus are not required to

Consistently superior segmentation results over the size constrained-CNN loss

Existing methods mainly enhance the emotion expression by adding regularization

However, due to the lack of further consideration of content consistency, the
common problem of response generation tasks, safe response, is intensified.
Besides, query emotions that can help model the relationship between query and
response are simply ignored in previous models, which would further hurt the
coherence. To alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework named
Curriculum Dual Learning (CDL) which extends the emotion-controllable response
generation to a dual task to generate emotional responses and emotional queries
alternatively. CDL utilizes two rewards focusing on emotion and content to
improve the duality. Additionally, it applies curriculum learning to gradually
generate high-quality responses based on the difficulties of expressing various
emotions. Experimental results show that CDL significantly outperforms the
baselines in terms of coherence, diversity, and relation to emotion factors.

  fracture problems","20 pages",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Phase-field fracture models lead to variational problems that can be written
as a coupled variational equality and inequality system. Numerically, such
problems can be treated with Galerkin finite elements and primal-dual active
set methods. Specifically, low-order and high-order finite elements may be
employed, where, for the latter, only few studies exist to date. The most
time-consuming part in the discrete version of the primal-dual active set
(semi-smooth Newton) algorithm consists in the solutions of changing linear
systems arising at each semi-smooth Newton step. We propose a new parallel
matrix-free monolithic multigrid preconditioner for these systems. We provide
two numerical tests, and discuss the performance of the parallel solver
proposed in the paper. Furthermore, we compare our new preconditioner with a
block-AMG preconditioner available in the literature.

prove that, if $(X,L)$ is Fano-K3, then, except when $Y$ is a hyperquadric, all
deformations of $(X,L)$ are again hyperelliptic (if $Y$ is a hyperquadric, the
general deformation of $\varphi$ is an embedding). This contrasts with the
situation of hyperelliptic canonical curves and hyperelliptic K3 surfaces. If
$L^m=2g$, then we prove that, in most cases, a general deformation of $\varphi$

with redshift and that, typically, NHX is greater than the GRB host neutral
hydrogen column density. We have compiled a large sample of data for GRB NHX
and metallicity [X/H]. The main aims of this paper are to generate improved NHX
for our sample by using actual metallicities, dust corrected where available
for detections, and for the remaining GRB, a more realistic average intrinsic
metallicity using a standard adjustment from solar. Then, by approximating the
GRB host intrinsic hydrogen column density using the measured neutral column
(NHI,IC) adjusted for the ionisation fraction, we isolate a more accurate
estimate for the intergalactic medium (IGM) contribution. The GRB sample mean
metallicity is = -1.17+/-0.09 rms (or 0.07+/-0.05 Z/Zsol) from a sample of 36
GRB with a redshift 1.76 < z < 5.91, substantially lower than the assumption of
solar metallicity used as standard for many fitted NHX . Lower GRB host mean
metallicity results in increased estimated NHX with the correction scaling with
redshift as log (NHX cm-2) = (0.59+/-0.04)log(1+z) + 0.18+/-0.02. Of the 128
GRB with data for both NHX and NHI,IC in our sample, only 6 have NHI,IC > NHX
when revised for realistic metallicity, compared to 32 when solar metallicity
is assumed. The lower envelope of the revised NHX - NHI,IC, plotted against
redshift can be fit by log(NHX - NHI,IC cm-2) =20.3 + 2.4 log(1+z). This is
taken to be an estimate for the maximum IGM hydrogen column density as a
function of redshift. Using this approach, we estimate an upper limit to the
hydrogen density at redshift zero (n0) to be consistent with n0 = 0.17 x
10-7cm-3.

a phenomenological three-point ($PV\gamma$) vertex interaction determined from
the observed radiative decay width of $V\rightarrow P\gamma$. For charged
$D-D^*$ mixing, this parameter is dependent on the magnetic field, because of
the Landau level contributions to the vacuum masses of these mesons. The masses
of the charged $D$ and $D^*$ mesons modified due to $PV$ mixing, in addition,
have contributions from the lowest Landau levels in the presence of a strong

studied using a field theoretic model of composite hadrons with quark (and

leads to dominant modifications to their masses, and hence the decay widths of

boundary condition, to get perturbative series solutions (of the equation valid
in probe approximation) for three special modes of m^2=4, 0, -9/4. Meantime, we
remind that for the skew-whiffed M2-branes background, there are Higgs-like
(pseudo)scalars that make the equation homogeneous and provide spontaneous
symmetry breaking. Then, with the setups and solutions in the bulk, where all
supersymmetries and parity are broken, we swap the three fundamental
representations of SO(8) for gravitino, deform the ABJM-like three-dimensional
boundary actions with various corresponding SU(4) x U(1)-singlet operators made
of fermions, scalars and SU(N) gauge fields, find new SO(4)-invariant
instantons, and finally adjust the bulk and boundary solutions and confirm

can provide a unified description of both neutrino mass and dark matter. In our
model, $B-L$ breaking is responsible for neutrino masses via the seesaw
mechanism, whereas the real part of the $B-L$ breaking Higgs field (called
$\sigma$ here) plays the role of a freeze-in dark matter candidate for a wide
parameter range. Since the $\sigma$-particle is unstable, for it to qualify as
dark matter, its lifetime must be longer than $10^{25}$ seconds implying that
the $B-L$ gauge coupling must be very small. This in turn implies that the dark
matter relic density must arise from the freeze-in mechanism. The dark matter
lifetime bound combined with dark matter relic density gives a lower bound on
the $B-L$ gauge boson mass in terms of the dark matter mass. We point out
parameter domains where the dark matter mass can be both in the keV to MeV
range as well as in the PeV range. We discuss ways to test some parameter
ranges of this scenario in collider experiments. Finally, we show that if
instead of $B-L$, we consider the extra $U(1)$ generator to be
$-4I_{3R}+3(B-L)$, the basic phenomenology remains unaltered and for certain
gauge coupling ranges, the model can be embedded into a five dimensional

irreversibly erase the signatures of the near-Sun heating and acceleration

during transit however, making it an ideal tracer of these processes. We aimed
to verify directly if the solar wind elemental fractionation is reflective of
the coronal source region fractionation, both within and across different solar
wind source regions. A backmapping scheme was used to predict where solar wind
measured by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) originated in the corona.
The coronal composition measured by the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging
Spectrometer (EIS) at the source regions was then compared with the in-situ
solar wind composition. On hourly timescales there was no apparent correlation
between coronal and solar wind composition. In contrast, the distribution of
fractionation values within individual source regions was similar in both the
corona and solar wind, but distributions between different sources have
significant overlap. The matching distributions directly verifies that
elemental composition is conserved as the plasma travels from the corona to the
solar wind, further validating it as a tracer of heating and acceleration
processes. The overlap of fractionation values between sources means it is not
possible to identify solar wind source regions solely by comparing solar wind
and coronal composition measurements, but a comparison can be used to verify
consistency with predicted spacecraft-corona connections.

accrete via thin discs which should produce at most very weak jets. This is
contradicted by observations of powerful jets in flat-spectrum radio quasars
(FSRQs). We use gamma-ray luminosities observed with the \emph{fermi} Large
Area Telescope as a proxy of the jet power for a population of 154 FSRQs.
Assuming typical quasar accretion rates and using black hole mass measurements
from a variety of methods, we find a mean jet production efficiency of about 10
per cent for FSRQs, with values as high as 222 per cent. We find that this is
consistent with FSRQs hosting moderately thin, magnetically arrested accretion
discs around rapidly spinning black holes (BHs). Modeling our observations
using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of jets from
thin discs, we find an average lower limit of $a_* = 0.59$ for the SMBH spins
of FSRQs, with tendency for the spins to decrease as the black hole mass
increases. Our results are consistent with the merger-driven evolution of
SMBHs. 3 per cent of the sample cannot be explained by current GRMHD models of

tracking problems with eye tracking in virtual reality using commodity
hardware. Using gaze data, and especially smooth pursuit eye movements, we are
able to track cells in time series of 3D volumetric datasets. The problem of
tracking cells is ubiquitous in developmental biology, where large volumetric
microscopy datasets are acquired on a daily basis, often comprising hundreds or
thousands of time points that span hours or days. The image data, however, is
only a means to an end, and scientists are often interested in the
reconstruction of cell trajectories and cell lineage trees. Reliably tracking
cells in crowded three-dimensional space over many timepoints remains an open
problem, and many current approaches rely on tedious manual annotation and
curation. In our Bionic Tracking approach, we substitute the usual 2D
point-and-click annotation to track cells with eye tracking in a virtual
reality headset, where users simply have to follow a cell with their eyes in 3D
space in order to track it. We detail the interaction design of our approach
and explain the graph-based algorithm used to connect different time points,
also taking occlusion and user distraction into account. We demonstrate our
cell tracking method using the example of two different biological datasets.
Finally, we report on a user study with seven cell tracking experts,
demonstrating the benefits of our approach over manual point-and-click
tracking.

with agents bearing one's tag and defecting with others) when tags are assigned
at random makes the emergence of the later an even more interesting phenomenon

through their speakers via sonic and ultrasonic waves. To eliminate the threat
of such acoustic covert channels in sensitive systems, audio hardware can be
disabled and the use of loudspeakers can be strictly forbidden. Such audio-less
systems are considered to be \textit{audio-gapped}, and hence immune to
acoustic covert channels.
  In this paper, we introduce a technique that enable attackers leak data
acoustically from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems. Our developed malware
can exploit the computer power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and use it as
an out-of-band, secondary speaker with limited capabilities. The malicious code
manipulates the internal \textit{switching frequency} of the power supply and
hence controls the sound waveforms generated from its capacitors and
transformers. Our technique enables producing audio tones in a frequency band
of 0-24khz and playing audio streams (e.g., WAV) from a computer power supply
without the need for audio hardware or speakers. Binary data (files,
keylogging, encryption keys, etc.) can be modulated over the acoustic signals
and sent to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone). We show that our technique
works with various types of systems: PC workstations and servers, as well as
embedded systems and IoT devices that have no audio hardware at all. We provide
technical background and discuss implementation details such as signal
generation and data modulation. We show that the POWER-SUPPLaY code can operate
from an ordinary user-mode process and doesn't need any hardware access or
special privileges. Our evaluation shows that using POWER-SUPPLaY, sensitive

algorithms for multipoint plastic scintillator detector calibration in
high-dose-rate brachytherapy. Methods: The dosimetry system consisted of an
optimized 1-mm-core mPSD and a compact assembly of photomultiplier tubes
coupled with dichroic mirrors and filters. An $^{192}$Ir source was remotely
controlled and sent to various positions in a homemade PMMA holder. Dose
measurements covering a range of 0.5 to 12 cm of source displacement were
carried out according to TG-43 recommendations. Individual scintillator doses
were decoupled using a linear regression model, a random forest estimator, and
artificial neural network algorithms. The performance of the different
algorithms was evaluated using different sample sizes and distances to the
source for the mPSD system calibration. Results: The decoupling methods'
deviations from the expected TG-43 dose generally remained below 20%. However,
the dose prediction with the three algorithms was accurate to within 7%
relative to the dose predicted by the TG-43 formalism for measurements
performed in the same range of distances used for calibration. The performance
random forest was compromised when the predictions were done beyond the range
of distances used for calibration. The dose prediction by the linear regression
was less influenced by the calibration conditions than random forest, but with
more significant deviations. The number of available measurements for training
purposes influenced the random forest and neural network models the most. Their
accuracy tended to converge toward deviation values close to 1% from a number
of dwell positions greater than 100. Conclusions: In performing HDR
brachytherapy dose measurements with an optimized mPSD system, ML algorithms
are good alternatives for precise dose reporting and treatment assessment.

when animals enter intensive use zones. This capability also facilitates use of
ocean observations from animal-borne sensors in operational ocean forecasting

control to deal with error-prone Argos locations. We formulate a
continuous-time state-space model for the three types of Argos location data
(Least-Squares, Kalman filter, and Kalman smoother), accounting for irregular
timing of observations. Our model is deliberately simple to ensure speed and
reliability for automated, near real-time quality control of Argos data. We
validate the model by fitting to Argos data collected from 61 individuals
across 7 marine vertebrates and compare model-estimated locations to GPS
locations. Estimation accuracy varied among species with median Root Mean
Squared Errors usually < 5 km and decreased with increasing data sampling rate
and precision of Argos locations. Including a model parameter to inflate Argos
error ellipse sizes resulted in more accurate location estimates. In some
cases, the model appreciably improved the accuracy of the Argos Kalman smoother
locations, which should not be possible if the smoother uses all available
information. Our model provides quality-controlled locations from Argos
Least-Squares or Kalman filter data with slightly better accuracy than Argos
Kalman smoother data that are only available via reprocessing. Simplicity and
ease of use make the model suitable both for automated quality control of near

knowledge from one circuit to another to reduce the re-design overhead. In this

(RL) to transfer the knowledge between different technology nodes and
topologies. Moreover, inspired by the simple fact that circuit is a graph, we
learn on the circuit topology representation with graph convolutional neural
networks (GCN). The GCN-RL agent extracts features of the topology graph whose
vertices are transistors, edges are wires. Our learning-based optimization
consistently achieves the highest Figures of Merit (FoM) on four different

Optimization, Evolutionary Algorithms), random search, and human expert

higher FoMs than methods without knowledge transfer. Our transferable

improve the predictions of 3D flows relevant to reactor safety during transient
conditions. In order to fulfill this goal, one approach is to implement
modeling of turbulent flow in SAM through establishing an embedded surrogate
model for Reynolds stress/turbulence viscosity based on machine learning
techniques. The proposed approach is based on an assumption that there exists a
functional dependency relationship between local flow features and local
turbulence viscosity or Reynolds stress. There have been very limited studies
performed to validate this assumption. This paper documents a case study to
examine the assumption in a scenario of potential reactor applications. The
work doesn't aim to theoretically validate the assumption, but practically
validate the assumption within the limited application domain. From the
methodological point of view, the approach used in this paper could be
classified into the so-called Type I machine learning (ML) approach, where a
scale separation assumption is proposed claiming that conservation equations
and closure relations are scale separable, for which the turbulence models are
local rather than global. The CFD case studied in this work is a 3D transient
thermal stratification tank flow problem performed using a Reynolds-averaged
Navier-Stokes turbulence model in STARCCM+ code. Flow information of all

renewable energy. A multi-energy management framework including fuel cell

is proposed, and the characteristics and scheduling arrangements of fuel cell
vehicles are considered to further improve the local absorption of the
renewable energy and enhance the economic benefits of microgrids. While
intensive research has been conducted on energy scheduling and trading problem,
a fundamental question still remains unanswered on microgrid economics. Namely,
due to multi-energy coupling, stochastic renewable energy generation and
demands, when and how a microgrid should schedule and trade energy with others,
which maximizes its long-term benefit. This paper designs a joint energy
scheduling and trading algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and a
double-auction mechanism. Its purpose is to determine the valuations of energy

purchase and sell energy with the current electricity prices. Simulations based
on real data show that each individual microgrid, under the management of the

in the semi-streaming model when edges arrive in a \emph{random} order. In the
semi-streaming model, the edges of the input graph G = (V,E) are given as a
stream e_1, ..., e_m, and the algorithm is allowed to make a single pass over
this stream while using $O(n \textrm{polylog}(n))$ space ($m = |E|$ and $n =
|V|$). If the order of edges is adversarial, a simple single-pass greedy
algorithm yields a $1/2$-approximation in $O(n)$ space; achieving a better
approximation in adversarial streams remains an elusive open question.
  A line of recent work shows that one can improve upon the $1/2$-approximation
if the edges of the stream arrive in a random order. The state of the art for
this model is two-fold: Assadi et al. [SODA 2019] show how to compute a
$2/3(\sim.66)$-approximate matching, but the space requirement is $O(n^{1.5}
\textrm{polylog}(n))$. Very recently, Farhadi et al. [SODA 2020] presented an
algorithm with the desired space usage of $O(n \textrm{polylog}(n))$, but a
worse approximation ratio of $6/11(\sim.545)$, or $3/5(=.6)$ in bipartite
graphs.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm that computes a
$2/3(\sim.66)$-approximate matching using only $O(n \log(n))$ space, improving
upon both results above. We also note that for adversarial streams, a lower
bound of Kapralov [SODA 2013] shows that any algorithm that achieves a
$1-1/e(\sim.63)$-approximation requires $(n^{1+\Omega(1/\log\log(n))})$ space.
Our result for random-order streams is the first to go beyond the
adversarial-order lower bound, thus establishing that computing a maximum
matching is provably easier in random-order streams.

constrain the standard cosmological model or alternatives. By using
measurements of the galaxy-galaxy lensing cross-correlation spectrum or of the
galaxy bispectrum, it is possible to break the $f\sigma_8$ degeneracy and
obtain separate estimates of $f$ and $\sigma_8$ from the same galaxy sample.
Currently there are only a handful of such separate measurements, but even this
allows for improved constraints on cosmological models. We explore how having a
larger and more precise sample of such measurements in the future could
constrain further cosmological models. We consider what can be achieved by a
future nominal sample that delivers a $\sim 1\%$ constraint on $f$ and
$\sigma_8$ separately, compared to the case with a similar precision on the
combination $f\sigma_8$. For the six cosmological parameters of $\Lambda$CDM,
we find improvements of $\sim\! 5$--$50\%$ on their constraints. For modified
gravity models in the Horndeski class, the improvements on these standard
parameters are $\sim\! 0$--$15\%$. However, the precision on the sum of
neutrino masses improves by 65\% and there is a significant increase in the
precision on the background and perturbation Horndeski parameters.

calculation speed but also in the complexity of choosing turbulence model and
parameters for different flow patterns. Data-driven turbulence modeling aims to
develop a RANS-based method which not only computationally efficient but also
applicable to different flow patterns. To achieve this goal, the first step is
to develop an approach to properly perform RANS for selected flow patterns. In
this work, a machine learning approach is selected to achieve this goal.
  The main purpose of this study is to perform a data-driven approach to model
turbulence Reynolds stress leveraging the potential of massive direct numerical
simulation (DNS) data. The approach is validated by a turbulence flow
validation case: a parallel plane quasi-steady state turbulence flow case.
  The work contains three parts. The first part is database preparation. In
this step, turbulence properties (Reynolds stress) are extracted from DNS
results, which are considered as ""physically correct data"". Meanwhile, flow
features are extracted from RANS results, which are considered as ""data to be
corrected"". The second part is surrogate model establishment. In this step, a
data-driven regression function is trained between flow features and turbulence
properties obtained from the previous step. The last part is model validation,
which is applying trained data-driven regression function to a test case to
validate this approach.

dynamics of multifield models involving nonminimal couplings. We explore the
parameter dependence of preheating in these models and describe the various
time-scales that control such nonlinear processes as energy transfer,
re-scattering, and the approach to radiation-domination and thermalization. In
the limit of large nonminimal couplings ($\xi_I \sim 100$), we find that
efficient transfer of energy from the inflaton condensate to radiative degrees
of freedom, emergence of a radiation-dominated equation of state, and the onset
of thermalization each consistently occur within $N_{\rm reh} \lesssim 3$
$e$-folds after the end of inflation, largely independent of the values of the
other couplings in the models. The exception is the case of negative
ellipticity, in which there is a misalignment between the dominant direction in
field-space along which the system evolves and the larger of the nonminimal
couplings $\xi_I$. In those cases, the field-space-driven parametric resonance
is effectively shut off. More generally, the competition between the scalar
fields' potential and the field-space manifold structure can yield interesting
phenomena such as two-stage resonances. Despite the explosive particle
production, which can lead to a quick depletion of the background energy
density, the nonlinear processes do not induce any super-horizon correlations
after the end of inflation in these models, which keeps predictions for CMB
observables unaffected by the late-time amplification of isocurvature
fluctuations. Hence the excellent agreement between primordial observables and
recent observations is preserved for this class of models, even when we
consider post-inflation dynamics.

years are now allowing to observe molecular complexes at atomic resolution. As
a consequence, numerous structures derived from cryo-EM are now available in
the Protein Data Bank. However, if for some complexes atomic resolution is
reached, this is not true for all. This is also the case in cryo-electron
tomography where the achievable resolution is still limited. Furthermore the
resolution in a cryo-EM map is not a constant, with often outer regions being
of lower resolution, possibly linked to conformational variability. Although
those low to medium resolution EM maps (or regions thereof) cannot directly
provide atomic structure of large molecular complexes, they provide valuable
information to model the individual components and their assembly into them.
Most approaches for this kind of modelling are performing rigid fitting of the
individual components into the EM density map. While this would appear an
obvious option, they ignore key aspects of molecular recognition, the
energetics and flexibility of the interfaces. Moreover, these often restricts
the modelling to a unique source of data, the EM density map. In this chapter,
we describe a protocol where an EM map is used as restraint in HADDOCK to guide

dependencies. Different from previous models, which only consider the
unidirectional delivery of information from innermost layers to outer ones (or

module to construct an entity graph, which is fed to the next graph module. The
richer representation learned from graph module carries the dependencies of

  liquid",,,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The search for local structures within a disordered medium has led to
proposals of several methods for probing transient short-range symmetry in a
homogeneous mono-atomic liquid. We offer a comparison of different
characterizations of such local structure in an in-homogeneous liquid. We
simulate the interfaces between a Lennard-Jones liquid and (i) a flat
Lennard-Jones wall, (ii) a wall of face-centered cubic-packed Lennard-Jones
particles, and (iii) a Lennard-Jones vapor. The interface density distributions
in cases (i) and (ii) have oscillations extending several particle diameters
into the bulk liquid, while that in case (iii) the interface density
distribution monotonically decays from the bulk liquid to the vapor. We search
for transient ordered fluctuations, which we identify with local ordered
structures, using the Aperture Cross Correlation Function of the system. We
find that only particles in the FCC-liquid interface that are in the two layers
closest to the FCC surface exhibit preferred four-fold symmetry. Furthermore,
the absence of three- or five-fold symmetry peaks in the Aperture Cross
Correlation Function of the liquid-vapor interface yields a different picture
of that interface than derived from the high density of bi-pyramidal clusters
found in the Topological Cluster Classification study (Molecular Physics, 109
(7-10), 1393-1402 (2011)). While the Aperture Cross Correlation Function
results need not be viewed as contradictory with the Topological Cluster
Classification results, we argue the advantages of using the former to
characterize transient ordered fluctuations as being both experimentally
accessible in favorable cases and not reliant on a list of structures.

known that $A$, $A^*$ act on $V$ as a tridiagonal pair of $q$-Racah type,

are directly linked to the quality-of-experience (QoE) of VR users. These QoE
requirements can only be met by wireless connectivity that offers high-rate and
high-reliability low latency communications (HRLLC), unlike the low rates
usually considered in vanilla ultra-reliable low latency communication
scenarios. The high rates for VR over short distances can only be supported by
an enormous bandwidth, which is available in terahertz (THz) frequency bands.
Guaranteeing HRLLC requires dealing with the uncertainty that is specific to
the THz channel. To explore the potential of THz for meeting HRLLC
requirements, a quantification of the risk for an unreliable VR performance is
conducted through a novel and rigorous characterization of the tail of the
end-to-end (E2E) delay. Then, a thorough analysis of the tail-value-atrisk
(TVaR) is performed to concretely characterize the behavior of extreme wireless
events crucial to the real-time VR experience. System reliability for scenarios
with guaranteed line-of-sight (LoS) is then derived as a function of THz
network parameters after deriving a novel expression for the probability
distribution function of the THz transmission delay. Numerical results show
that abundant bandwidth and low molecular absorption are necessary to improve
the reliability. However, their effect remains secondary compared to the
availability of LoS, which significantly affects the THz HRLLC performance. In
particular, for scenarios with guaranteed LoS, a reliability of 99.999% (with
an E2E delay threshold of 20 ms) for a bandwidth of 15 GHz along with data
rates of 18.3 Gbps can be achieved by the THz network (operating at a frequency
of 1 THz), compared to a reliability of 96% for twice the bandwidth, when
blockages are considered.

unprecedented challenge to the world's medical resources and prevention and

breathe and life-threatening, but also the heart, kidneys, brain and other
vital organs of the body, with possible sequela. At present, the detection of
COVID-19 needs to be realized by the reverse transcription-polymerase Chain

epidemic, and the medical resources are very limited. They cannot provide
sufficient numbers of gene sequence detection, and many patients may not be
isolated and treated in time. Given this situation, we researched the
analytical and diagnostic capabilities of deep learning on chest radiographs
and proposed Cascade-SEMEnet which is cascaded with SEME-ResNet50 and
SEME-DenseNet169. The two cascade networks of Cascade - SEMEnet both adopt
large input sizes and SE-Structure and use MoEx and histogram equalization to
enhance the data. We first used SEME-ResNet50 to screen chest X-ray and
diagnosed three classes: normal, bacterial, and viral pneumonia. Then we used
SEME-DenseNet169 for fine-grained classification of viral pneumonia and
determined if it is caused by COVID-19. To exclude the influence of
non-pathological features on the network, we preprocessed the data with U-Net
during the training of SEME-DenseNet169. The results showed that our network
achieved an accuracy of 85.6\% in determining the type of pneumonia infection

the baseline CNN based on some prior domain knowledge. Firstly, image
sharpening and median filtering are used to remove impulse noise, and the edge
is enhanced to some extent. Next, adaptive histogram equalization is used to
overcome the problem of excessive amplification noise of HE. Finally, a
multi-CNN hybrid model is proposed to classify six different locations of
dental slices. The results showed that the accuracy and specificity of the test
set exceeded 90\%, and the AUC reached 0.97. In addition, four dentists were
invited to manually annotate the test data set (independently) and then compare
it with the labels obtained by our proposed algorithm. The results show that
our method can effectively identify the X-ray location of teeth.

Considering these features, by interfering with mechanism of the {preferential

'Fractional Preferential Attachment' (FPA) scale-free network model---that
generates networks with time-independent degree distributions $p(k)\sim
k^{-\gamma}$ with degree exponent $2<\gamma\leq3$ (where $\gamma=3$ corresponds
to the typical value of the BA model). In the FPA model, the element
controlling the network properties is the $f$ parameter, where $f \in
(0,1\rangle$. Depending on the different values of $f$ parameter, we study the
statistical properties of the numerically generated networks. We investigate
the topological properties of FPA networks such as degree distribution, degree
correlation (network assortativity), clustering coefficient, average node
degree, network diameter, average shortest path length and features of
fractality. We compare the obtained values with the results for various
synthetic and real-world networks. It is found that, depending on $f$, the FPA
model generates networks with parameters similar to the real-world networks.
Furthermore, it is shown that $f$ parameter has a significant impact on, among
others, degree distribution and degree correlation of generated networks.
Therefore, the FPA scale-free network model can be an interesting alternative
to existing network models. In addition, it turns out that, regardless of the
value of $f$, FPA networks are not fractal.

single fault often propagates through the plant and triggers a (sometimes
large) number of alarms. A graphical plant topology can help operators, process
engineers and maintenance experts find the root cause of a plant upset or
discover the propagation path of a fault. In this paper, a method is developed
to extract plant topology form alarm data. The method is based on process
mining, a collection of concepts and algorithms that model a process (not
necessarily an engineering one) based on recorded events. The event based
nature of alarm data as well as the chronological order of recorded alarms make
them suitable for process mining. The methodology developed in this paper is
based on preparing alarm data for process mining and then using the suitable
process mining algorithms to extract plant topology. The extracted topology is
represented by the familiar Petri net which can be used for root cause analysis
and discovering fault propagation paths. The methods to evaluate the extracted
topology are also discussed. A case study on the well-known Tennessee Eastman

scientifically accurate mesoscale biological models. Resulting 3D models are
based on few 2D microscopy scans and the latest knowledge about the biological
entity represented as a set of geometric relationships. Our new technique is
based on statistical and rule-based modeling approaches that are rapid to
author, fast to construct, and easy to revise. From a few 2D microscopy scans,
we learn statistical properties of various structural aspects, such as the
outer membrane shape, spatial properties and distribution characteristics of
the macromolecular elements on the membrane. This information is utilized in 3D
model construction. Once all imaging evidence is incorporated in the model,
additional information can be incorporated by interactively defining rules that
spatially characterize the rest of the biological entity, such as mutual
interactions among macromolecules, their distances and orientations to other
structures. These rules are defined through an intuitive 3D interactive
visualization and modeling feedback loop. We demonstrate the utility of our
approach on a use case of the modeling procedure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus
particle ultrastructure. Its first complete atomistic model, which we present
here, can steer biological research to new promising directions in fighting
spread of the virus.

identify the crime itself, we instead model suspicious behavior -- the one that
may occur before a person commits a crime -- by detecting precise segments of a

provide the staff with more opportunities to act and prevent crime. We
implemented a 3DCNN model as a video feature extractor and tested its

setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected
model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of
experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for
COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures.
Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for
train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of
prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data
augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was
trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a
publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results
indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a
meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false
negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While
these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further
support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training
in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these
modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable

Furthermore, the KNF framework outperforms the LSTM network when it comes to
short-term predictions. We also observe that using a loss function based only
on the instantaneous predictions of the chaotic system can lead to suboptimal
reproductions in terms of long-term statistics. Thus, we propose a
model-selection criterion based on the computed statistics which allows to
achieve excellent statistical reconstruction even on small datasets, with

presence of a strong wave-driven mean current in submerged vegetation canopies.
Luhar et al. (2010) suggested that this mean current is analogous to the
streaming flow generated in wave boundary layers over bare beds, and developed
a simple energy and momentum balance model to predict its magnitude. However,
this model predicts that the magnitude of the mean current does not depend on
canopy spatial density, which is inconsistent with the measurements made by
Abdolahpour et al. (2017) in recent laboratory experiments. Motivated by
observations that the wave-driven mean flow is most pronounced at the canopy
interface, Abdolahpour et al. (2017) proposed an alternate explanation for its
origin: that it is driven by the vertical heterogeneity in orbital motion
created by canopy drag. Such heterogeneity can give rise to incomplete particle
orbits near the canopy interface and a Lagrangian mean current analogous to
Stokes drift in the direction of wave propagation. A model guided by this
physical insight and dimensional analysis is able to generate much more
accurate predictions. This comment aims to reconcile these two different models
for the wave-driven mean flow in submerged canopies.

number of documents at the same time. Usually most of the time we setup a
gateway server connected to the CIDB and it serve all the identity document
verification requests. Though it work well, there are still chances that this
model will collapse in high traffic. We obviously can tune the system to be
sustainable, but the process is economically expensive. In this paper we
propose an economically cheaper way to verify ID documents with private
BitTorrent network and hash function.

  Microspheres for Syntactic Foam Applications","19 page, 7 figure, 3 tables",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently, hollow thermoplastic microspheres, such as Expancel made by
Nouryon, have emerged as an innovative filler material for use in
polymer-matrix composites. The resulting all-polymer syntactic foam takes on
excellent damage tolerance properties, strong recoverability under large
strains, and favourable energy dissipation characteristics. Despite finding
increasing usage in various industries and applications, including in coatings,
films, sealants, packaging, composites for microfluidics, medical ultrasonics
and cementious composites, there is a near-complete absence of statistical
geometrical information for Expancel microspheres. Further, their mechanical
properties have not yet been reported. In this work we characterise the
geometrical quantities of two classes of Expancel thermoplastic microspheres
using X-ray computed tomography, focused ion beam and electron microscopy. We
also observe the spatial distribution of microspheres within a
polyurethane-matrix syntactic foam. We show that the volume-weighted
polydisperse shell diameter in both classes of microsphere follows a normal
distribution. Interestingly, polydispersity of the shell wall thickness is not
observed and in particular the shell thickness is not correlated to the shell
diameter. We employ the measured geometrical information in analytical
micromechanical techniques in the small strain regime to determine, for the
first time, estimates of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the
microsphere shell material. Our results contribute to potential future
improvements in the design and fabrication of syntactic foams that employ
thermoplastic microspheres. Given the breadth of fields which utilise
thermoplastic microspheres, we anticipate that our results, together with the
methods used, will be of use in a much broader context in future materials
research.

estimating its operating life. Using high temperature operating life (HTOL)
tests, it is possible to model the failure mechanisms for integrated circuits.
Conventional HTOL standards are not suitable for operating life prediction of
photonic components owing to their functional dependence on thermo-optic
effect. This work presents an IR-assisted thermal vulnerability detection
technique suitable for photonic as well as electronic components. By accurately
mapping the thermal profile of an integrated circuit under a stress condition,
it is possible to precisely locate the heat center for predicting the long-term
operational failures within the device under test. For the first time, the
reliability testing is extended to a fully functional microwave photonic system
using conventional IR thermography. By applying image fusion using affine
transformation on multimodal acquisition, it was demonstrated that by comparing
the IR profile and GDSII layout, it is possible to accurately locate the heat
centers along with spatial information on the type of component. Multiple IR
profiles of optical as well as electrical components/circuits were acquired and
mapped onto the layout files. In order to ascertain the degree of effectiveness
of the proposed technique, IR profiles of CMOS RF and digital circuits were
also analyzed. The presented technique offers a reliable automated
identification of heat spots within a circuit/system.
