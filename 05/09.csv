$m_{\rm KK}$ at the TeV scale or beyond. The backreaction of the radion field
on the gravitational metric is taken into account by using the superpotential
formalism. The confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition leads to
a gravitational wave stochastic background which mainly depends on the scale
$m_{\rm KK}$ and the number of colors, $N$, in the dual theory. Its power
spectrum peaks at a frequency that depends on the amount of tuning required in
the electroweak sector. It turns out that the present and forthcoming
gravitational wave observatories can probe scenarios where the KK resonances
are very heavy. Current aLIGO data already rule out vector boson KK resonances
with masses in the interval $m_{\rm KK}\sim(1 - 10) \times 10^5$ TeV. Future
gravitational experiments will be sensitive to resonances with masses $m_{\rm

metric bundles) of the Kerr geometry. Metric bundles, first introduced in [21]
can be generally defined for axially symmetric spacetimes with Killing horizons
and, for the case of Kerr geometries, are sets of black holes (BHs) or black
holes and naked singularities (NSs) geometries. Each metric of a bundle has an
equal limiting photon (orbital) frequency, which defines the bundle and
coincides with the frequency of a Killing horizon in the extended plane. In
this plane each bundle is represented as a curve tangent to the curve that
represents the horizons, which thus emerge as the envelope surfaces of the
metric bundles. We show that the horizons frequency can be used to establish a
connection between BHs and NSs, providing an alternative representation of such
spacetimes in the extended plane and an alternative definition of the BH
horizons. We introduce the concept of inner horizon confinement and horizons
replicas and study the possibility of detecting their frequencies. We study the
bundle characteristic frequencies constraining the inner horizon confinement in
the outer region of the plane i.e. the possibility of detect frequency related
to the inner horizon, and the horizons replicas, structures which may be
detectable, for example, from the emission spectra of BHs spacetimes. It is
shown that such observations can be performed close to the rotation axis of the
Kerr geometry, depending on the BH spin. We argue that these results could be
used to further investigate black holes and their thermodynamic properties.

restricted. In this paper, we consider data-free network quantization with
synthetic data. The synthetic data are generated from a generator, while no
data are used in training the generator and in quantization. To this end, we
propose data-free adversarial knowledge distillation, which minimizes the
maximum distance between the outputs of the teacher and the (quantized) student
for any adversarial samples from a generator. To generate adversarial samples
similar to the original data, we additionally propose matching statistics from
the batch normalization layers for generated data and the original data in the
teacher. Furthermore, we show the gain of producing diverse adversarial samples
by using multiple generators and multiple students. Our experiments show the
state-of-the-art data-free model compression and quantization results for

directly applied to source code to decide all token repetitions, the model
performance will decrease sharply. As we use pre-order traversal to traverse
the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to generate token sequence, tokens corresponding
to AST grammar are ignored when learning token repetition. For non-grammar
tokens, there are many kinds: strings, chars, numbers and identifiers. For each
kind of tokens, we try to learn its repetition pattern and find that only
identifiers have the property of token repetition. For identifiers, there are
also many kinds such as variables, package names, method names, simple types,
qualified types or qualified names. Actually, some kinds of identifiers such as
package names, method names, qualified names or qualified types are unlikely to
be repeated. Thus, we ignore these kinds of identifiers that are unlikely to be
repeated when learning token repetition. This step is crucial and this
important implementation trick is not clearly presented in the paper because we
think it is trivial and too many details may bother readers. We offer the

perform integrative analyses of high-dimensional multi-omic data with the goal
to better understand genomic processes that correlate with cancer outcomes,
e.g. elucidate gene networks that discriminate a specific cancer subgroups
(cancer sub-typing) or discovering gene networks that overlap across different
cancer types (pan-cancer studies). In this paper, we propose a novel mixed

LASSO method and the standard BDMCMC method using simulations and find that our
method is superior in terms of both computational efficiency and the accuracy
of the model selection results. Finally, an application to the TCGA breast
cancer data shows that integrating genomic information at different levels

could lead to a better overall sensitivity. Here we expand on this study in two
respects: (i) using (simulated) strain data from two detectors simultaneously,
and (ii) training for directed (i.e.\ single sky-position) searches in addition
to all-sky searches. For a data timespan of $T = 10^5\, s$, the all-sky
two-detector DNN is about $7\%$ less sensitive (in amplitude $h_0$) at low
frequency ($f=20\,Hz$), and about $51\,\%$ less sensitive at high frequency
($f=1000\,Hz$) compared to fully-coherent matched-filtering (using WEAVE). In
the directed case the sensitivity gap compared to matched-filtering ranges from
about $7-14\%$ at $f=20\,Hz$ to about $37-49\%$ at $f=1500\,Hz$. Furthermore we
assess the DNN's ability to generalize in signal frequency, spindown and
sky-position, and we test its robustness to realistic data conditions, namely
gaps in the data and using real LIGO detector noise. We find that the DNN
performance is not adversely affected by gaps in the test data or by using a
relatively undisturbed band of LIGO detector data instead of Gaussian noise.
However, when using a more disturbed LIGO band for the tests, the DNN's
detection performance is substantially degraded due to the increase in false
alarms, as expected.

  Local nonconvex Low-Rank matrix Approximation","Accepted for publication in IEEE IGARSS 2020 conference",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Several bandwise total variation (TV) regularized low-rank (LR)-based models
have been proposed to remove mixed noise in hyperspectral images (HSIs).
Conventionally, the rank of LR matrix is approximated using nuclear norm (NN).
The NN is defined by adding all singular values together, which is essentially
a $L_1$-norm of the singular values. It results in non-negligible approximation
errors and thus the resulting matrix estimator can be significantly biased.
Moreover, these bandwise TV-based methods exploit the spatial information in a
separate manner. To cope with these problems, we propose a spatial-spectral TV
(SSTV) regularized non-convex local LR matrix approximation (NonLLRTV) method
to remove mixed noise in HSIs. From one aspect, local LR of HSIs is formulated
using a non-convex $L_{\gamma}$-norm, which provides a closer approximation to
the matrix rank than the traditional NN. From another aspect, HSIs are assumed
to be piecewisely smooth in the global spatial domain. The TV regularization is
effective in preserving the smoothness and removing Gaussian noise. These facts
inspire the integration of the NonLLR with TV regularization. To address the
limitations of bandwise TV, we use the SSTV regularization to simultaneously
consider global spatial structure and spectral correlation of neighboring
bands. Experiment results indicate that the use of local non-convex penalty and
global SSTV can boost the preserving of spatial piecewise smoothness and
overall structural information.

unbroken $U(1)$ gauge interaction, with a massless dark photon as force
carrier, and interacting with ordinary matter via scalar messengers. We study
its early Universe evolution by solving a set of coupled Boltzmann equations
that track the number density of the different species, as well as entropy and
energy exchanges between the dark and visible sectors. Phenomenologically
viable realizations include: i) a heavy (order 1 TeV or more) lepton-like dark
fermion playing the role of the dark matter candidate, with various production
mechanisms active depending on the strength of the dark-visible sector portal;
ii) light (few GeV to few tens of GeV) quark-like dark fermions, stable but
with suppressed relic densities; iii) an extra radiation component in Universe
due to dark photons, with temperature constrained by cosmic microwave
background data, and in turn preventing dark fermions to be lighter than about
1 GeV. Extra constraints on our scenario stem from dark matter direct detection
searches: the elastic scattering on nuclei is driven by dipole or charge radius
interactions mediated by either Standard Model or dark photons, providing
long-range effects which, however, are not always dominant, as usually assumed
in this context. Projected sensitivities for next-generation detectors cover a
significant portion of the viable parameter space and are competitive with
respect to the model-dependent constraints derived from the magnetic dipole
moments of leptons and cooling of stellar systems.

is interpreted as a diagram, encoding a specific interaction of words according
to the grammar. It is this interaction which, together with a specific choice
of word embedding, realises the meaning (or ""semantics"") of a sentence.

important concern. To be a valid model of a system, the graph structure must
satisfy a number of constraints. To date, consistency has primarily been viewed
as a binary property: a graph either is or is not consistent with respect to a
set of graph constraints. This has enabled the definition of notions such as
constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing graph transformations. Many
practical applications - for example model repair or evolutionary search -
implicitly assume a more graduated notion of consistency, but without an
explicit formalisation only limited analysis of these applications is possible.
In this paper, we introduce an explicit notion of consistency as a graduated
property, depending on the number of constraint violations in a graph. We
present two new characterisations of transformations (and transformation rules)
enabling reasoning about the gradual introduction of consistency: while
consistency-sustaining transformations do not decrease the consistency level,
consistency-improving transformations strictly reduce the number of constraint
violations. We show how these new definitions refine the existing concepts of
constraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing transformations. To support a
static analysis based on our characterisations, we present criteria for
deciding which form of consistency ensuring transformations is induced by the
application of a transformation rule. We illustrate our contributions in the
context of an example from search-based model engineering.

outcome of a merger that occurred in a low mass ratio (q = M2/M1 = 0.07 - 0.25)
binary system some time in the past hundreds of thousands of years. To that
goal, we present a simple analytical model to approximate the perturbed
internal structure of a post-merger object following the coalescence of a
secondary in the mass range 1-4 Msun into the envelope of a 15-17 Msun primary.
We then compute the long-term evolution of post-merger objects for a grid of
initial conditions and make predictions about their surface properties for
evolutionary stages that are consistent with the observed location of
Betelgeuse in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We find that if a merger
occurred after the end of the primary's main-sequence phase, while it was
expanding toward becoming a red supergiant star and typically with radius ~200
- 300 Rsun, then it's envelope is spun-up to values which remain in a range
consistent with the Betelgeuse observations for thousands of years of
evolution. We argue that the best scenario that can explain both the fast
rotation of Betelgeuse and its observed large space velocity is one where a
binary was dynamically ejected by its parent cluster a few million years ago
and then subsequently merged. An alternative scenario in which the progenitor
of Betelgeuse was spun up by accretion in a binary and released by the
supernova explosion of the companion requires a finely tuned set of conditions
but cannot be ruled out.

the supercritical atomic collapses in QED for Z > 137, but with a much lower

ground for the analysis of quantum field theory vacuum instabilities. We
analyze the quantum transition from subcritical to supercritical charge regimes
in gapped graphene in a common framework that preserves unitarity for any value
of charge impurities. In the supercritical regime it is possible to introduce
boundary conditions which control the singular behavior at the impurity. We
show that for subcritical charges there are also non-trivial boundary
conditions which are similar to those that appear in QED for nuclei in the
intermediate regime 118<Z<137. We analyze the behavior of the energy levels
associated to the different boundary conditions. In particular, we point out
the existence of new bound states in the subcritical regime which include a
negative energy bound state in the attractive Coulomb regime. A remarkable
property is the continuity of the energy spectral flow under variation of the
impurity charge even when jumping across the critical charge transition. We
also remark that the energy levels of Hydrogenoid bound states at critical
values of charge impurities act as focal points of the spectral flow.

learning (ML) models and analyze performance in terms of prediction ability,
sparsity, and fairness. Unlike previous works, this study trains interpretable
models that output probabilities rather than binary predictions, and uses
quantitative fairness definitions to assess the models. This study also
examines whether models can generalize across geographic locations. Methods: We
generated black-box and interpretable ML models on two different criminal
recidivism datasets from Florida and Kentucky. We compared predictive
performance and fairness of these models against two methods that are currently
used in the justice system to predict pretrial recidivism: the Arnold PSA and
COMPAS. We evaluated predictive performance of all models on predicting six
different types of crime over two time spans. Results: Several interpretable ML
models can predict recidivism as well as black-box ML models and are more
accurate than COMPAS or the Arnold PSA. These models are potentially useful in
practice. Similar to the Arnold PSA, some of these interpretable models can be
written down as a simple table. Others can be displayed using a set of
visualizations. Our geographic analysis indicates that ML models should be
trained separately for separate locations and updated over time. We also
present a fairness analysis for the interpretable models. Conclusions:
Interpretable machine learning models can perform just as well as
non-interpretable methods and currently-used risk assessment scales, in terms
of both prediction accuracy and fairness. Machine learning models might be more
accurate when trained separately for distinct locations and kept up-to-date.

the edge. With the identification of this direction, an additional boundary
condition on the wedge edge can be assigned to make sure that the shock is
attached on the edge and linearly stable under small perturbation. Based on the
linear stability, we introduce an iteration scheme and prove that there exists
a unique fixed point of the iteration scheme, which leads to the global
existence and nonlinear structural stability of the attached weak transonic

support the spontaneous Chern insulating phase driven by the short-range
repulsive interaction. This phase still emerges with in-plane ferromagnetism,

As $J$ gradually increases, the ferromagnetism is suppressed and the system
first becomes partially-polarized with large magnetization and then enters a

We identify this non-polarized phase as an insulator with a nematic charge
density wave. In the end, we discuss the potential experimental observations of
our theoretical findings.

the 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).
Among various foreground components, the Galactic free-free emission is less
studied, so that its impact on the EoR observations remains unclear. In this
work, we employ the observed $\rm H\alpha$ intensity map with the correction of
dust absorption and scattering, the Simfast21 software, and the latest SKA1-Low
layout configuration to simulate the SKA ""observed"" images of Galactic
free-free emission and the EoR signal. By calculating the one-dimensional power
spectra from the simulated image cubes, we find that the Galactic free-free
emission is about $10^{3.5}$-$10^{2.0}$, $10^{3.0}$-$10^{1.3}$, and
$10^{2.5}$-$10^{1.0}$ times more luminous than the EoR signal on scales of
$0.1~\rm Mpc^{-1} < k < 2~\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in the $116$-$124$, $146$-$154$, and
$186$-$194$ ${\rm MHz}$ frequency bands. We further analyse the two-dimensional
power spectra inside the properly defined EoR window and find that the leaked
Galactic free-free emission can still cause non-negligible contamination, as
the ratios of its power (amplitude squared) to the EoR signal power can reach
about $200\%$, $60\%$, and $15\%$ on scales of $1.2~\rm Mpc^{-1}$ in three
frequency bands, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that the Galactic

carefully treated in the forthcoming deep EoR observations.

distributed setting considers a network graph $G = (V,E)$, in which the goal of
each vertex $v \in V$ is selecting a neighbor, such that the maximum number of
vertices in $V$ that select the same vertex is minimized [Halldorsson et al.,
2015]. Previous backup placement algorithms suffer from obliviousness to main
factors of real-world heterogeneous wireless network. Specifically, there is no
consideration of the nodes memory and storage capacities, and no reference to a
case in which nodes have different energy capacity, and thus can leave (or
join) the network at any time. These parameters are strongly correlated in
wireless networks, as the load on different parts of the network can differ
greatly, thus requiring more communication, energy, memory and storage. In
order to fit the real-world attributes of wireless networks, this work
addresses a generalized version of the original problem, namely $K$-Backup
Placement, in which each vertex selects $K$ neighbors, for a positive parameter
$K$. Our $K$-Backup Placement algorithm terminates within just one round. In
addition we suggest two complementary algorithms which employ
$K$-Backup-Placement to obtain efficient virtual memory schemes for wireless
networks. The first algorithm divides the memory of each node to many small
parts. Each vertex is assigned the memories of a large subset of its neighbors.
Thus more memory capacity for more vertices is gained, but with much
fragmentation. The second algorithm requires greater round-complexity, but
produces larger virtual memory for each vertex without any fragmentation.

CP-violating operators of dimension higher than four. QCD calculations of the
nucleon matrix elements of these operators are required to fully reconstruct
the sources and magnitudes of the different CP-violating contributions to the
nucleon EDM. Herein we study the quark-chromo electric dipole moment (qCEDM)
operator and the three-gluon Weinberg operator. The non-perturbative
determination, using lattice QCD, of the nucleon matrix elements of these
CP-violating operators is hampered by their short-distance behavior. Under
renormalization these operators mix with lower dimensional operators, which
induces power divergences in the lattice spacing, as the continuum limit is
approached. We study the short-distance behavior of the qCEDM and the Weinberg
operators using the gradient flow. We perform a short flow time expansion and
determine, in perturbation theory, the expansion coefficients of the
linearly-divergent terms stemming from the mixing with the pseudoscalar density
and the topological charge, confirming the expectations of the operator product
expansion. We introduce a new method to perform calculations at non-zero
flow-time for arbitrary values of the external momenta. This method allows us
to work in four dimensions for most of the calculations described in this
paper, avoiding the complications associated with defining $\gamma_5$ in
generic d dimensions. We show that leading contributions in the external
momenta can be reproduced by defining $\gamma_5$ using the 't

Halpha line center by the Visible Imaging Spectrometer (VIS) installed on the
Goode Solar Telescope (GST) to detect the origin of UFs and UWs in a sunspot
with a uniform umbra free of LBs and clusters of umbral dots. The data showed
that UFs do not randomly originate over the umbra. Instead, they appear to be
repeatedly triggered at locations with the lowest umbral intensity and the most
powerful oscillations of Halpha-0.04 nm intensity. GST magnetic field
measurements using Near Infra-Red Imaging Spectropolarimeter (NIRIS) also
showed that the dominant location of prevalent UF origin is co-spatial
associated with the strongest fields in the umbra. Interface Region Imaging
Spectrograph 149.0 nm images showed that no bright UV loops were anchored in
the umbra in general and near the UF patches in particular suggesting that UFs
and UWs alone can not be responsible for the origin of warm coronal loops. We
thus conclude that the existence of locations with prevalent origin of UFs
confirms the idea that they may be driven by a sub-surface source located near
the axis of a flux rope, while the presence of several UFs trigger centers may

additional samples and redshift distributions constructed in three ways:
excluding certain spectroscopic surveys during redshift calibration, excluding
lower-confidence spectroscopic redshifts in redshift calibration, and
considering only photometric sources which are jointly calibrated by at least
three spectroscopic surveys. In all cases, the method utilised here proves
robust: we find a maximal deviation from our fiducial analysis of $|\Delta S_8|

the reduction in systematic biases found within our analysis, we highlight our
results when performing redshift calibration without the DEEP2 spectroscopic

$S_8=0.707_{-0.042}^{+0.046}$; a difference with respect to the fiducial that
is both significantly smaller than, and in the opposite direction to, the
equivalent shift from previous work. These results suggest that our improved

mysterious. In this paper, we work toward a better understanding of the
geometry of the loss function $L$ of overparameterized feedforward neural
networks. In this setting, we identify several components of the critical locus
of $L$ and study their geometric properties. For networks of depth $\ell \geq
4$, we identify a locus of critical points we call the star locus $S$. Within
$S$ we identify a positive-dimensional sublocus $C$ with the property that for
$p \in C$, $p$ is a degenerate critical point, and no existing theoretical
result guarantees that gradient descent will not converge to $p$. For very wide
networks, we build on earlier work and show that all critical points of $L$ are
degenerate, and give lower bounds on the number of zero eigenvalues of the
Hessian at each critical point. For networks that are both deep and very wide,
we compare the growth rates of the zero eigenspaces of the Hessian at all the
different families of critical points that we identify. The results in this
paper provide a starting point to a more quantitative understanding of the
properties of various components of the critical locus of $L$.

  Leveraging certain additional moment assumptions, we also show a
first-of-its-kind approximate recovery of the true label generating parameters

the worst case and its accuracy of recovering the true weight degrades
gracefully with increasing probability of attack and its magnitude.
  For both the realizable and the non-realizable cases as outlined above, our
analysis allows for mini-batching and computes how the convergence time scales
with the mini-batch size. We corroborate our theorems with simulation results

this paper, we examine using N-body simulations how the properties of planetary
systems are determined during the final stages of assembly. While accretion is
a chaotic process, trends in the ensemble properties of planetary systems
provide a memory of the initial distribution of solid mass around a star prior
to accretion. We also use EPOS, the Exoplanet Population Observation Simulator,
to account for detection biases and show that different accretion scenarios can
be distinguished from observations of the Kepler systems. We show that the
period of the innermost planet, the ratio of orbital periods of adjacent
planets, and masses of the planets are determined by the total mass and radial
distribution of embryos and planetesimals at the beginning of accretion. In
general, some amount of orbital damping, either via planetesimals or gas,
during accretion is needed to match the whole population of exoplanets.
Surprisingly, all simulated planetary systems have planets that are similar in
size, showing that the ""peas in a pod"" pattern can be consistent with both a
giant impact scenario and a planet migration scenario. The inclusion of
material at distances larger than what Kepler observes has a profound impact on
the observed planetary architectures, and thus on the formation and delivery of
volatiles to possible habitable worlds.

particles with spin. In de Sitter space, these correlators are constrained both
by symmetries and by locality. In particular, the de Sitter isometries become
conformal symmetries on the future boundary of the spacetime, which are
reflected in a set of Ward identities that the boundary correlators must
satisfy. We solve these Ward identities by acting with weight-shifting
operators on scalar seed solutions. Using this weight-shifting approach, we
derive three- and four-point correlators of massless spin-1 and spin-2 fields
with conformally coupled scalars. Four-point functions arising from tree-level
exchange are singular in particular kinematic configurations, and the
coefficients of these singularities satisfy certain factorization properties.
We show that in many cases these factorization limits fix the structure of the
correlators uniquely, without having to solve the conformal Ward identities.
The additional constraint of locality for massless spinning particles manifests
itself as current conservation on the boundary. We find that the four-point
functions only satisfy current conservation if the s, t, and u-channels are
related to each other, leading to nontrivial constraints on the couplings
between the conserved currents and other operators in the theory. For spin-1
currents this implies charge conservation, while for spin-2 currents we recover
the equivalence principle from a purely boundary perspective. For multiple
spin-1 fields, we recover the structure of Yang-Mills theory. Finally, we apply
our methods to slow-roll inflation and derive a few phenomenologically relevant
scalar-tensor three-point functions.

gaps. A possible explanation for the origin of such rings is the tidal
interaction with an unseen planetary companion. The protoplanetary disc around
DS Tau shows a wide gap in the ALMA observation at 1.3 mm. We construct a
hydrodynamical model for the dust continuum observed by ALMA assuming the
observed gap is carved by a planet between one and five Jupiter masses. We fit
the shape of the radial intensity profile along the disc major axis varying the
planet mass, the dust disc mass, and the evolution time of the system. The best
fitting model is obtained for a planet with $M_{\rm p}=3.5\,M_{\rm Jup}$ and a
disc with $M_{\rm dust}= 9.6\cdot10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$. Starting from this
result, we also compute the expected signature of the planet in the gas
kinematics, as traced by CO emission. We find that such a signature (in the
form of a ""kink"" in the channel maps) could be observed by ALMA with a velocity
resolution between $0.2-0.5\,\rm{kms}^{-1}$ and a beam size between 30 and 50
mas.

  Proceedings of ACL, 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Throughout a conversation, participants make choices that can orient the flow
of the interaction. Such choices are particularly salient in the consequential
domain of crisis counseling, where a difficulty for counselors is balancing
between two key objectives: advancing the conversation towards a resolution,
and empathetically addressing the crisis situation.
  In this work, we develop an unsupervised methodology to quantify how
counselors manage this balance. Our main intuition is that if an utterance can
only receive a narrow range of appropriate replies, then its likely aim is to
advance the conversation forwards, towards a target within that range.
Likewise, an utterance that can only appropriately follow a narrow range of
possible utterances is likely aimed backwards at addressing a specific
situation within that range. By applying this intuition, we can map each
utterance to a continuous orientation axis that captures the degree to which it
is intended to direct the flow of the conversation forwards or backwards.
  This unsupervised method allows us to characterize counselor behaviors in a
large dataset of crisis counseling conversations, where we show that known
counseling strategies intuitively align with this axis. We also illustrate how
our measure can be indicative of a conversation's progress, as well as its
effectiveness.

materials exhibit similar responses, characterized by two features, well
resolved in time and energy. The first transient feature decays after a few
hundred femtoseconds, while the second lasts for nanoseconds. Using
Drude-Lorentz fits of the materials' equilibrium reflectance, we show that the
fast response is well-represented by a decrease of the Drude plasma frequency,
and the second feature by an increase of the Drude scattering rate. This
directly connects the transient data to a physical picture in which carriers,
after being excited away from the Fermi energy, return to that vicinity within
a few hundred femtoseconds by sharing their excess energy with the phonon bath,
resulting in a hot lattice that relaxes only through slow diffusion processes
(ns). The emerging picture reveals that the sudden change of the density of
carriers at the Fermi level instantaneously modifies the transport properties
of the materials on a timescale not compatible with electron phonon
thermalization and is largely driven by the reduced density of states at the
nodal line.

of the numerical bounds from bootstrapping four point function of $O(N)$
vector. Moving away from the WF kinks, there indeed exists another family of
kinks (dubbed non-WF kinks) on the curve of $O(N)$ numerical bounds. Different
from the $O(N)$ WF kinks that exist for arbitary $N$ in $2<d<4$ dimensions, the
non-WF kinks exist in arbitrary dimensions but only for a large enough
$N>N_c(d)$ in a given dimension $d$. In this paper we have achieved a thorough
understanding for few special cases of these non-WF kinks. The first case is
the $O(4)$ bootstrap in 2d, where the non-WF kink turns out to be the $SU(2)_1$
Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, and all the $SU(2)_{k>2}$ WZW models saturate
the numerical bound on the left side of the kink. We further carry out
dimensional continuation of the 2d $SU(2)_1$ kink towards the 3d $SO(5)$
deconfined phase transition. We find the kink disappears at around $d=2.7$
dimensions indicating the $SO(5)$ deconfined phase transition is weakly first
order. The second interesting observation is, the $O(2)$ bootstrap bound does
not show any kink in 2d ($N_c=2$), but is surprisingly saturated by the 2d free
boson CFT (also called Luttinger liquid) all the way on the numerical curve.
The last case is the $N=\infty$ limit, where the non-WF kink sits at
$(\Delta_\phi, \Delta_T)=(d-1, 2d)$ in $d$ dimensions. We manage to write down
its analytical four point function in arbitrary dimensions, which equals to the
subtraction of correlation functions of a free fermion theory and generalized
free theory. An important feature of this solution is the existence of a full
tower of conserved higher spin current. We speculate that a new family of CFTs
will emerge at non-WF kinks for finite $N$, in a similar fashion as $O(N)$ WF
CFTs originating from free boson at $N=\infty$.

can be seen as a special case of the Argyris isogeometric element of (Kapl,
Sangalli and Takacs, CAGD, 2019). The quadrilateral elements possess similar
degrees of freedom as the classical Argyris triangles. Just as for the Argyris
triangle, we additionally impose $C^2$ continuity at the vertices. In this
paper we focus on the lower degree cases, that may be desirable for their lower
computational cost and better conditioning of the basis: We consider indeed the
polynomial quadrilateral of (bi-)degree~$5$, and the polynomial degrees $p=3$
and $p=4$ by employing a splitting into $3\times3$ or $2\times2$ polynomial
pieces, respectively.
  The proposed elements reproduce polynomials of total degree $p$. We show that
the space provides optimal approximation order. Due to the interpolation
properties, the error bounds are local on each element. In addition, we
describe the construction of a simple, local basis and give for $p\in\{3,4,5\}$
explicit formulas for the B\'{e}zier or B-spline coefficients of the basis
functions. Numerical experiments by solving the biharmonic equation demonstrate
the potential of the proposed $C^1$ quadrilateral finite element for the
numerical analysis of fourth order problems, also indicating that (for $p=5$)
the proposed element performs comparable or in general even better than the
Argyris triangle with respect to the number of degrees of freedom.

macroscopic mechanical oscillators in their quantum ground states, in
quadrature squeezed states, and in entangled states of motion. In addition to
coaxing ever larger and more tangible objects into a regime of quantum
behavior, this new capability has encouraged ideas of using mechanical
oscillators in the processing and communication of quantum information and as
precision force sensors operating beyond the standard quantum limit. But the
effectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity
precludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat
states or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted
the possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic
coupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental
demonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not
yet accessed nonclassical states of motion. Here we create nonclassical states
by quadratically coupling motion to the energy levels of a Cooper-pair box
(CPB) qubit. By monitoring the qubit's transition frequency, we detect the
oscillator's phonon distribution rather than its position. Through microwave
frequency drives that change both the state of the oscillator and qubit, we
then dissipatively stabilize the oscillator in a state with a large mean phonon
number of 43 and sub-Poissonian number fluctuations of approximately 3. In this
energy squeezed state we observe a striking feature of the quadratic coupling:
the recoil of the mechanical oscillator caused by qubit transitions, closely
analogous to the vibronic transitions in molecules.

administrations) have become more popular, for instance in the development of
treatments for atopic dermatitis. If the relationship of the dose and response
is described by a parametric model, a simplistic approach is to pool doses from
different schedules. However, this approach ignores the potential heterogeneity
in dose-response curves between schedules. A more reasonable approach is the
partial pooling, i.e. certain parameters of the dose-response curves are
shared, while others are allowed to vary. Rather than using schedule-specific
fixed-effects, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with random-effects to
model the between-schedule heterogeneity with regard to certain parameters.
Schedule-specific dose-response relationships can then be estimated using
shrinkage estimation. Considering Emax models, the proposed method displayed
desirable performance in terms of the mean absolute error and the coverage
probabilities for the dose-response curve compared to the complete pooling.
Furthermore, it outperformed the partial pooling with schedule-specific
fixed-effects by producing lower mean absolute error and shorter credible
intervals. The methods are illustrated using simulations and a phase II trial
example in atopic dermatitis. A publicly available R package, \texttt{ModStan},

  Logic",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we assess the security and testability of the state-of-the-art
design-for-security (DFS) architectures in the presence of scan-chain
locking/obfuscation, a group of solution that has previously proposed to
restrict unauthorized access to the scan chain. We discuss the key leakage
vulnerability in the recently published prior-art DFS architectures. This
leakage relies on the potential glitches in the DFS architecture that could
lead the adversary to make a leakage condition in the circuit. Also, we
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art DFS architectures impose some substantial
architectural drawbacks that moderately affect both test flow and design
constraints. We propose a new DFS architecture for building a secure scan chain
architecture while addressing the potential of key leakage. The proposed
architecture allows the designer to perform the structural test with no
limitation, enabling an untrusted foundry to utilize the scan chain for
manufacturing fault testing without needing to access the scan chain. Our
proposed solution poses negligible limitation/overhead on the test flow, as
well as the design criteria.

transparent high bandgap material such as glass, followed by nonlinear
absorption of 800 nm light in polymers, allows us to further restrict

this confinement by simulating femtosecond-laser-induced polymer modification

energy absorption in polymers that multiphoton processes offer. Energy
deposited behind a thin polymer film induces a protruding blister. We present
experimental results of blister diameter and height scaling with pulse energy.
Using 0.95 NA focussing, we obtained laser-induced blisters with diameters as
small as 700 nm suggesting blister-based Laser-Induced Forward Transfer is
possible on and below the single-micron scale. Sub-micrometer blister formation
using femtosecond lasers also offers a novel method of direct, precise
laser-writing of microstructures on films with single laser pulses. This method
is a possible alternative to lithography, laser milling, and laser-based
additive machining which leaves the surface composition unchanged.

have emerged about their robustness to adversarial perturbations to inputs.
While most attacks aim to ensure that these are imperceptible, physical
perturbation attacks typically aim for being unsuspicious, even if perceptible.
However, there is no universal notion of what it means for adversarial examples
to be unsuspicious. We propose an approach for modeling suspiciousness by
leveraging cognitive salience. Specifically, we split an image into foreground
(salient region) and background (the rest), and allow significantly larger
adversarial perturbations in the background, while ensuring that cognitive
salience of background remains low. We describe how to compute the resulting
non-salience-preserving dual-perturbation attacks on classifiers. We then
experimentally demonstrate that our attacks indeed do not significantly change
perceptual salience of the background, but are highly effective against
classifiers robust to conventional attacks. Furthermore, we show that
adversarial training with dual-perturbation attacks yields classifiers that are
more robust to these than state-of-the-art robust learning approaches, and
comparable in terms of robustness to conventional attacks.

an inhomogeneous superfluid state with optimum finite center-of-mass momentum

robust against the magnetic field and does not undergo pair breaking unlike the

scaling (where all the numbers have the same order of magnitude) and the
multi-scale case (where some effect is predominant with respect to the others).
In the case when the Mach number is of higher order than the Rossby number, we
prove that the limit dynamics is described by an incompressible
Oberbeck-Boussinesq system, where the velocity field is horizontal (according
to the Taylor-Proudman theorem), but vertical effects on the temperature
equation are not negligible. Instead, when the Mach and Rossby numbers have the
same order of magnitude, and in absence of the centrifugal force, we show
convergence to a quasi-geostrophic equation for a stream function of the limit
velocity field, coupled with a transport-diffusion equation for a new unknown,
which links the target density and temperature profiles.
  The proof of the convergence is based on a compensated compactness argument.
The key point is to identify some compactness properties hidden in the system
of acoustic-Poincar\'e waves. Compared to previous results, our method enables
first of all to treat the whole range of parameters in the multi-scale problem,
and also to consider a low Froude number regime with the somehow critical
choice $Fr=\sqrt{Ma}$, where $Ma$ is the Mach number. This allows us to capture

machine learning tools given their potential and applicability in various

to improve quantitative metrics, notwithstanding the lack of information about
models' decisions such metrics convey. This paradigm has recently shifted, and
strategies beyond tables and numbers to assist in interpreting models'
decisions are increasing in importance. Part of this trend, visualization
techniques have been extensively used to support classification models'
interpretability, with a significant focus on rule-based models. Despite the
advances, the existing approaches present limitations in terms of visual
scalability, and the visualization of large and complex models, such as the
ones produced by the Random Forest (RF) technique, remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose Explainable Matrix (ExMatrix), a novel visualization method
for RF interpretability that can handle models with massive quantities of
rules. It employs a simple yet powerful matrix-like visual metaphor, where rows
are rules, columns are features, and cells are rules predicates, enabling the
analysis of entire models and auditing classification results. ExMatrix
applicability is confirmed via different examples, showing how it can be used
in practice to promote RF models interpretability.

and inviscid heat-conducting fluids, which correspond to the stiff relaxation
limit of the model. In the absence of relaxation source terms, the homogeneous
PDE system is endowed with two stationary linear differential constraints
(involutions), which require the curl of distortion field and the curl of the

The new structure-preserving scheme presented in this paper can be proven to be
exactly curl-free for the homogeneous part of the PDE system, i.e. in the

quasi asymptotic preserving in the stiff relaxation limit, in the sense that
the numerical scheme reduces to a consistent second-order accurate
discretization of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations when the relaxation
times tend to zero. Last but not least, the proposed scheme is suitable for the

Navier-Stokes equation, we consider the relative importance of local and
non-local terms in the FVGT eigenframe equations across the scales using
statistical analysis. The analysis of the eigenframe rotation-rate, that drives
vorticity tilting, shows that the anisotropic pressure Hessian plays a key
role, with the sub-grid stress making an important contribution outside the
dissipation range, and the local spinning due to vorticity making a much
smaller contribution. The results also show the striking behavior that the
vorticity tilting term remains highly intermittent even at relatively large
scales. We derive a generalization of the Lumley triangle that allows us to
show that the pressure Hessian has a preference for two-component axisymmetric
configurations at small scales, with a transition to a more isotropic state at
larger scales. Correlations between the sub-grid stress and other terms in the
eigenframe equations are considered, highlighting the coupling between the
sub-grid and nonlinear amplification terms, with the sub-grid term playing an
important role in regularizing the system. These results provide useful
guidelines for improving Lagrangian models of the FVGT, since current models

make both those abstract theories and their mappings to the domain of interest

in the incompressible limit, where the MHD flow is parallel to the background

an asymmetry of the instability growth in the shear plane: perturbations with

without any direct experience (zero-shot), based on its relationship to
previous tasks. Humans can exhibit this cognitive flexibility. By contrast,
models that achieve superhuman performance in specific tasks often fail to
adapt to even slight task alterations. To address this, we propose a general
computational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship
to prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt
to new tasks, we propose meta-mappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic
task representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across
a wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to
image classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human
adaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these
domains, meta-mapping is successful, often achieving 80-90% performance,
without any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts
prior experience. We further show that meta-mapping can not only generalize to
new tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel
relationships unseen during training. Finally, using meta-mapping as a starting
point can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task, and reduce
learning time and cumulative error substantially. Our results provide insight
into a possible computational basis of intelligent adaptability and offer a
possible framework for modeling cognitive flexibility and building more
flexible artificial intelligence systems.

  In this paper we propose the Bayesian Optimisation of Elites (BOP-Elites)
algorithm that uses techniques from Bayesian Optimisation to explicitly model
both quality and diversity with Gaussian Processes. By considering user defined
regions of the feature space as 'niches' our task is to find the optimal

intelligently choose new points that provide the highest expected improvement
to the ensemble problem of identifying the best solution in every niche. In

parts of the search space that belong to a niche in feature space, and finding
the optimal solution in each niche. It is also significantly more sample
efficient than simpler benchmark approaches. BOP-Elites goes further than
existing QD algorithms by quantifying the uncertainty around our predictions
and offering additional illumination of the search space through surrogate
models.

motions within the local Universe. Such measurement has the potential to
constrain the growth rate $f\sigma_8$ and test gravity through determination of
the gravitational growth index $\gamma$, complementing constraints from other
peculiar velocity measurements. We find that binary neutron star mergers with
associated counterpart at $z\lesssim 0.2$ that will be detected by the Einstein
Telescope (ET) will be able to constrain $f\sigma_8$ to $\sim 3\%$ precision
after $10$ years of operations when combined with galaxy overdensities from
DESI and TAIPAN. If a larger network of third generation GW detectors is
available (e.g. including the Cosmic Explorer), the same constraints can be
reached over a shorter timescale ($\sim 5$ years for a 3 detectors network).
The same events (plus information from their hosts' redshifts) can constrain
$\gamma$ to $\sigma_\gamma\lesssim 0.04$. This constraint is precise enough to
discern General Relativity from other popular gravity models at $3\sigma$. This
constraint is improved to $\sigma_\gamma\sim 0.02-0.03$ when combined with

after turning a corner around a tall building, or a sudden knot of traffic
blocking the direct path between the UE and its serving BS. In this work, we
propose a scheme to temporarily increase the data rate to/from this UE with
additional bandwidth from the nearest Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) cluster of
BSs, while the slower process of handover of the UE to a new serving BS is
ongoing. We emphasize that this additional bandwidth is additional to the data
rates the UE is getting over its primary connection to the current serving BS
and, after the handover, to the new serving BS. The key novelty of the present
work is the proposal of a decentralized market-based resource allocation method
to perform resource allocation to support Coordinated Beamforming (CB) CoMP. It
is scalable to large numbers of UEs and BSs, and it is fast because resource
allocations are made bilaterally, between BSs and UEs. Once the resource
allocation to the UE has been made, the coordinated of transmissions occurs as
per the usual CB methods. Thus the proposed method has the benefit of giving
the UE access to its desired amount of resources fast, without waiting for
handover to complete, or reporting channel state information before it knows
the resources it will be allocated for receiving transmissions from the serving

materials. Recently, a two-dimensional conical model was proposed to explain
the experimental optical spectroscopy in the 3D ZrTe5, Martino et al. [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 122, 217402 (2019)]. Motivated by this work, in this paper, we
perform a systematic theoretical study on the optical conductivity of this
model in both cases without and with an external magnetic field to further
demonstrate the validity of this model and to recover new physics.We find that
there exist completely different characteristics for optical conductivity along
different directions, due to anisotropic low-energy excitations in this
two-dimensional conical model. Specifically, for the interband optical
conductivity, we find asymptotic dependence on the optical frequency as
Re(\sigma_x)\sim\omega^{1/2} and Re(\sigma_z)\sim{\omega}^{3/2}, which are
universal both in the gapped insulator phase and Weyl semimetal phase. For the
magneto-optical conductivity, on the contrary, Re(\sigma^B_{x/z}) shows
distinct signatures in the gapped insulator phase and Weyl semimetal phase,
which can help distinguish the two phases. Our results, to be verified in
future experiments, could provide more insights into the understanding of the
topological nature of ZrTe5.

obtained through mapping the radial component onto a polar angle of a four

for binary Ni-Mo alloys are obtained based on linear and neural network
regression models. Numerical experiments suggest that both descriptors produce
similar results in terms of accuracy. For linear regression, the smooth SO(3)
power spectrum is superior to the SO(4) bispectrum when a large band limit is
used. In neural network regression, a better accuracy can be achieved with even
less number of expansion components for both descriptors. As such, we
demonstrate that spectral neural network potentials are feasible choices for
large scale atomistic simulation.

increases to 14 {\AA} from 8 {\AA} in the low-resolution spectra (R$\sim$ 2000)
accompanied with the large white-light flares, (2) some weak H$\alpha$/X-ray
flares are not accompanied with white-light emissions, and (3) the non-flaring
emissions show clear rotational modulations in X-ray and H$\alpha$ intensity in

hydrodynamic flare simulations are performed by using the RADYN code. As a
result of simulations, we found the simulated H$\alpha$ line profiles with hard
and high-energy non-thermal electron beams are consistent with that of the
initial phase line profiles of the superflares, while those with more soft-
and/or weak-energy beam are consistent with those in decay phases, indicating
the changes in the energy fluxes injected to the lower atmosphere. Also, we
found that the relation between optical continuum and H$\alpha$ intensity is
nonlinear, which can be one cause of the non-white-light flares. The flare
energy budget exhibits diversity in the observations and models, and more
observations of stellar flares are necessary for constraining the occurrence of
various emission line phenomena in stellar flares.

By examining the patterns of individual decision trees JigSaw identifies
high-order interactions between measured features that are strongly associated
with a particular outcome and identifies the relevant decision thresholds.
JigSaw's effectiveness was tested in simulation studies where it was able to
recover multiple ground truth patterns;even in the presence of significant

world data sets.It was first used to identify patterns clinical measurements
associated with heart disease. It was then used to find patterns associated
with breast cancer using metabolites measured in the blood. In heart disease,
JigSaw identified several three-way interactions that combine to explain most
of the heart disease records (66%) with high precision (93%). In breast cancer,
three two-way interactions were recovered that can be combined to explain
almost all records (92%) with good precision (79%). JigSaw is an efficient
method for exploring high-dimensional feature spaces for rules that explain

correlations. We then analyze a linear setting and theoretically show how the
inductive bias of models towards ""memorizing"" fewer examples can cause

information capacity of a quantum machine. A large barrier to designing quantum
algorithms for execution on real quantum machines is that, in general, it is
intractably difficult to construct an arbitrary quantum state to high

in a simple state, and evolving the state through an efficient (i.e. at most
polynomial-depth) quantum algorithm. In this work, we show that there exist
families of quantum states that can be prepared to high precision with circuits
of linear size and depth. We focus on real-valued, smooth, differentiable
functions with bounded derivatives on a domain of interest, exemplified by
commonly used probability distributions. We further develop an algorithm that
requires only linear classical computation time to generate accurate
linear-depth circuits to prepare these states, and apply this to well-known and
heavily-utilized functions including Gaussian and lognormal distributions. Our
procedure rests upon the quantum state representation tool known as the matrix
product state (MPS). By efficiently and scalably encoding an explicit amplitude

generated. These results enable the execution of many quantum algorithms that,

up-to-date information with low latency, two schemes are designed for cache
update and content delivery at the roadside units (RSUs). The roadside unit
centric (RSUC) scheme decouples cache update and content delivery through
bandwidth splitting, where the cached content items are updated regularly in a
round-robin manner. The request adaptive (ReA) scheme updates the cached
content items upon user requests with certain probabilities. The performance of
both proposed schemes are analyzed, whereby the average age of information
(AoI) and service latency are derived in closed forms. Surprisingly, the
AoI-latency trade-off does not always exist, and frequent cache update can
degrade both performances. Thus, the RSUC and ReA schemes are further optimized
to balance the AoI and latency. Extensive simulations are conducted on SUMO and
OMNeT++ simulators, and the results show that the proposed schemes can reduce
service latency by up to 80\% while guaranteeing content freshness in heavily

modified so as to better describe characteristic features of the underlying

infections not related to contact with documented infectious individuals, the
model includes a cohort of asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic infectious
individuals, not accounted for in the data of new daily counts of infections. A
Bayesian particle filtering algorithm is used to update dynamically the
relevant cohort and simultaneously estimate the transmission rate as the new
data on the number of new infections and disease related death become
available. The underlying assumption of the model is that the infectivity rate
is dynamically changing during the epidemics, either because of a mutation of
the pathogen or in response to mitigation and containment measures. The
sequential Bayesian framework naturally provides a quantification of the
uncertainty in the estimate of the model parameters, including the reproduction
number, and of the size of the different cohorts. Moreover, we introduce a
dimensionless quantity, which is the equilibrium ratio between asymptomatic and
symptomatic cohort sizes, and propose a simple formula to estimate the
quantity. This ratio leads naturally to another dimensionless quantity that
plays the role of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ of the model. When we
apply the model and particle filter algorithm to COVID-19 infection data from
several counties in Northeastern Ohio and Southeastern Michigan we found the
proposed reproduction number $R_0$ to have a consistent dynamic behavior within

computations over sensitive data within hardware-assisted Trusted Execution
Environments (TEE). Such TEE-powered software is called secure enclaves. Secure
enclaves hold various advantages against competing for privacy-preserving
computation solutions. However, enclaves are much more challenging to build
compared with ordinary software. The reason is that the development of TEE
software must follow a restrictive programming model to make effective use of
strong memory encryption and segregation enforced by hardware. These
constraints transitively apply to all third-party dependencies of the software.
If these dependencies do not officially support TEE hardware, TEE developers
have to spend additional engineering effort in porting them. High development
and maintenance cost is one of the major obstacles against adopting TEE-based
privacy protection solutions in production. In this paper, we present our
experience and achievements with regard to constructing and continuously

that can still be utilized for certain premised intended purpose. Existing data
releasing approaches, however, are either privacy-emphasized (no consideration
on utility) or utility-driven (no guarantees on privacy). In this work, we
propose a two-step perturbation-based utility-aware privacy-preserving data
releasing framework. First, certain predefined privacy and utility problems are
learned from the public domain data (background knowledge). Later, our approach
leverages the learned knowledge to precisely perturb the data owners' data into
privatized data that can be successfully utilized for certain intended purpose
(learning to succeed), without jeopardizing certain predefined privacy
(training to fail). Extensive experiments have been conducted on Human Activity
Recognition, Census Income and Bank Marketing datasets to demonstrate the
effectiveness and practicality of our framework.

of improving the sample efficiency for new, previously unobserved, tasks. A key
performance measure for meta-learning is the meta-generalization gap, that is,
the difference between the average loss measured on the meta-training data and
on a new, randomly selected task. This paper presents novel
information-theoretic upper bounds on the meta-generalization gap. Two broad
classes of meta-learning algorithms are considered that uses either separate
within-task training and test sets, like MAML, or joint within-task training
and test sets, like Reptile. Extending the existing work for conventional
learning, an upper bound on the meta-generalization gap is derived for the
former class that depends on the mutual information (MI) between the output of
the meta-learning algorithm and its input meta-training data. For the latter,
the derived bound includes an additional MI between the output of the per-task
learning procedure and corresponding data set to capture within-task
uncertainty. Tighter bounds are then developed, under given technical
conditions, for the two classes via novel Individual Task MI (ITMI) bounds.
Applications of the derived bounds are finally discussed, including a broad
class of noisy iterative algorithms for meta-learning.

task-oriented dialogue systems. This is insufficient for training intermediate
dialogue turns since supervision signals (or rewards) are only provided at the
end of dialogues. To address this issue, reward learning has been introduced to
learn from state-action pairs of an optimal policy to provide turn-by-turn
rewards. This approach requires complete state-action annotations of
human-to-human dialogues (i.e., expert demonstrations), which is labor
intensive. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel reward learning
approach for semi-supervised policy learning. The proposed approach learns a
dynamics model as the reward function which models dialogue progress (i.e.,
state-action sequences) based on expert demonstrations, either with or without
annotations. The dynamics model computes rewards by predicting whether the
dialogue progress is consistent with expert demonstrations. We further propose
to learn action embeddings for a better generalization of the reward function.

waves. To this aim, we solve the initial value problem for the incompressible
linearized viscous MHD equations in a radially inhomogeneous flux tube in the
limit of long wavelengths. Using a modal expansion technique the
spatio-temporal behavior of the perturbations is obtained. We confirm that for
large Reynolds numbers representative of the coronal plasma the decrement in
the amplitude of the kink oscillations is due to the resonant absorption
mechanism that converts the global transverse oscillation to rotational motions
in the inhomogeneous layer of the flux tube. We show that viscosity suppresses
the rate of phase mixing of the perturbations in the inhomogeneous region of
the flux tube and prevents the continuous building up of small scales in the
system once a sufficiently small scale is reached. The viscous dissipation
function is calculated to investigate plasma heating by viscosity in the
inhomogeneous layer of the flux tube. For Reynolds numbers of the order of
10^6-10^8, the energy of the kink wave is transformed into heat in two to eight
periods of the kink oscillation. For larger and more realistic Reynolds
numbers, heating happens, predominantly, after the global kink oscillation is

statistical averages over the ensemble of microscopic base pair fluctuations.
The average molecule elongation, measured by the end-to-end distance, is
derived as a function of the channel potential parameters both for a
homogeneous and a heterogeneous chain. The overall results suggest that the
mesoscopic model, with the channel potential term, yields consistent
quantitative estimates for the stretching and twisting of short chains.

that the condition for self-assembly of a three-dimensional crystal is
satisfied when the energies of dipoles in the parallel and antiparallel states

particular, the usefulness of duality relations has been demonstrated in some
models such as population models and Brownian momentum processes. In this
study, a discussion based on combinatorics is made and applied to calculate the
expectation values of functions in systems in which evolution is governed by
stochastic differential equations. Starting with the duality theory of
stochastic processes, some modifications to the interpretation and usage of
time-ordering operators naturally lead to discussions on combinatorics. For
demonstration, the first and second moments of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process
are re-derived from the discussion on combinatorics. Furthermore, two numerical
methods for practical applications are proposed. One method is based on a
conventional exponential expansion and the Pade approximation. The other uses a
resolvent of a time-evolution operator, along with the application of the
Aitken series acceleration method. Both methods yield reasonable
approximations. Particularly, the resolvent and Aitken acceleration show
satisfactory results. These findings will provide a new way of calculating
expectations numerically and directly without using time-discretization.

  Distributed Presynaptic Connections","15 pages, 17 figures, 4 tables",,,,"cs.AI cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Collision detection is one of the most challenging tasks for Unmanned Aerial
Vehicles (UAVs). This is especially true for small or micro UAVs, due to their
limited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple
visual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid
collision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by
locusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a
motion based visual neuron called the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD).
The defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a
flying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for
building UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot
distinguish looming clearly from other visual cues such as complex background
movements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new
model implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is
inspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first
introduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused
by visual motion with preferred velocities. Then radially extending temporal
latency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed
excitation and selectively suppress the non-preferred visual motions.
Systematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the
proposed model for UAV agile flights. The results have demonstrated that this
new model enhances the looming selectivity in complex flying scenes
considerably, and has potential to be implemented on embedded collision
detection systems for small or micro UAVs.

unknown to the learner, or anyway too complicated to analyze, and the only
available information are pairs of input-output data samples, possibly obtained
by submitting queries to the system or provided by a third party. Previous
research has mainly focused on counting the frequencies to estimate the
input-output conditional probabilities (referred to as frequentist approach),
however this method is not accurate when the domain of possible outputs is
large. To overcome this difficulty, the estimation of the Bayes error of the
ideal classifier was recently investigated using Machine Learning (ML) models
and it has been shown to be more accurate thanks to the ability of those models
to learn the input-output correspondence. However, the Bayes vulnerability is
only suitable to describe one-try attacks. A more general and flexible measure
of leakage is the g-vulnerability, which encompasses several different types of
adversaries, with different goals and capabilities. In this paper, we propose a
novel approach to perform black-box estimation of the g-vulnerability using ML.
A feature of our approach is that it does not require to estimate the
conditional probabilities, and that it is suitable for a large class of ML
algorithms. First, we formally show the learnability for all data
distributions. Then, we evaluate the performance via various experiments using
k-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Networks. Our results outperform the frequentist
approach when the observables domain is large.

also becoming popular for general purpose photography. Recently, adversarial
training has produced some of the most visually impressive results for image
manipulation, including the face aging/de-aging task. In spite of considerable
progress, current methods often present visual artifacts and can only deal with
low-resolution images. In order to achieve aging/de-aging with the high quality
and robustness necessary for wider use, these problems need to be addressed.
This is the goal of the present work. We present an encoder-decoder
architecture for face age editing. The core idea of our network is to create
both a latent space containing the face identity, and a feature modulation
layer corresponding to the age of the individual. We then combine these two
elements to produce an output image of the person with a desired target age.
Our architecture is greatly simplified with respect to other approaches, and
allows for continuous age editing on high resolution images in a single unified
model.

content that are directed at any specific candidate.Such technique allows us to
more accurately quantify adversarial interactions towards political candidates.
Further, we introduce an algorithm to induce candidate-specific adversarial
terms to capture more nuanced adversarial interactions that previous techniques
may not consider toxic. Finally, we use these techniques to outline the breadth
of adversarial interactions seen in the election, including offensive
name-calling, threats of violence, posting discrediting information, attacks on

show that among moderately active users, adversarial activity is associated

cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), but the available analytical results are
very limited by far. Considering system in a bounded smooth domain with Neumann

components are grouped into reproducing collectives -- e.g., organelles are
grouped into cells, and cells are grouped into multicellular organisms. In such
systems, evolution can operate at two levels: evolution among collectives,
which tends to promote selfless cooperation among components within collectives
(called altruism), and evolution within collectives, which tends to promote
cheating among components within collectives. The balance between within- and
among-collective evolution thus exerts profound impacts on the fitness of these
systems. Here, we investigate how this balance depends on the size of a
collective (denoted by $N$) and the mutation rate of components ($m$) through
mathematical analyses and computer simulations of multiple population genetics
models. We first confirm a previous result that increasing $N$ or $m$
accelerates within-collective evolution relative to among-collective evolution,
thus promoting the evolution of cheating. Moreover, we show that when within-
and among-collective evolution exactly balance each other out, the following
scaling relation generally holds: $Nm^{\alpha}$ is a constant, where scaling
exponent $\alpha$ depends on multiple parameters, such as the strength of
selection and whether altruism is a binary or quantitative trait. This relation
indicates that although $N$ and $m$ have quantitatively distinct impacts on the
balance between within- and among-collective evolution, their impacts become
identical if $m$ is scaled with a proper exponent. Our results thus provide a
novel insight into conditions under which cheating or altruism evolves in
hierarchically-organised replicating systems.

repatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011
census data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A
modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to
estimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in
India's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model
considered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of
migrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the
origin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily
arrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants
(i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and
active cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days
needed to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence,
travel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh

based on Temporal-Framing Adaptive Network (TFAN), including state transition
loss and dynamic inference for decoding the most likely state sequence.
Methods: In contrast to previous state-of-the-art approaches, the TFAN-based
method does not require any knowledge of the state duration of heart sounds and
is therefore likely to generalize to non sinus rhythm. The TFAN-based method
was trained on 50 recordings randomly chosen from Training set A of the 2016
PhysioNet/Computer in Cardiology Challenge and tested on the other 12
independent training and test databases (2099 recordings and 52180 beats). The
databases for segmentation were separated into three levels of increasing
difficulty (LEVEL-I, -II and -III) for performance reporting. Results: The
TFAN-based method achieved a superior F1 score for all 12 databases except for
`Test-B', with an average of 96.7%, compared to 94.6% for the state-of-the-art
method. Moreover, the TFAN-based method achieved an overall F1 score of 99.2%,
94.4%, 91.4% on LEVEL-I, -II and -III data respectively, compared to 98.4%,
88.54% and 79.80% for the current state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The
TFAN-based method therefore provides a substantial improvement, particularly
for more difficult cases, and on data sets not represented in the public
training data. Significance: The proposed method is highly flexible and likely
to apply to other non-stationary time series. Further work is required to
understand to what extent this approach will provide improved diagnostic
performance, although it is logical to assume superior segmentation will lead
to improved diagnostics.

promising solutions that can improve the key-rate scaling with channel loss. By
using a middle node with quantum storage and measurement functionalities, they
offer the same key-rate scaling with distance as a single-node quantum
repeater. However, the distance at which they can surpass the nominal key rate
of repeaterless systems, in terms of bits per second, is typically long, owing
to the efficiency and/or interaction time issues when one deals with quantum
memories. This crossover distance can be a few hundred kilometres, for
instance, when one relies on the exchange of infinitely many key bits for the
key-rate analysis. In a realistic setup, however, we should account for the
finite-key effects in our analysis. Here, we show that accounting for such
effects would actually favour MA-QKD setups, by reducing the crossover distance
to the regime where realistic implementations can take place. We demonstrate
this by rigorously analysing a decoy-state version of MA-QKD, in the finite-key

theory of density of states (DOS) in three-dimensional quantum magnets with the

resonant and non-resonant scattering which appearance is governed by the ratio
of scattering length and the average distance between impurities. Corrections
to the quasiparticles band gap in these cases are shown to be $\propto c^{2/3}$
and $\propto c$, respectively. Moreover, the theory yields a semi-circle form
of DOS for the bound states inside the gap which results in highly nontrivial
DOS in the intermediate parameters region between two limiting cases when the
band DOS and the semi-circle are overlapped. Long-wavelength excitations are
discussed. In the resonant regime their damping is almost constant $\propto
c^{2/3}$, which according to Ioffe-Regel criterion means their localization.
Applicability of the theory is illustrated by a quantitative description of the

autonomous vehicle operation when the vehicle is unable to safely proceed on

of a generic alarm indicating an imminent transfer of control back to the human
driver. However, certain levels of vehicle autonomy may allow the driver to
engage in other, non-driving related tasks prior to a handover, leading to
substantial difficulty in quickly regaining situational awareness. This delay
in re-orientation could potentially lead to life-threatening failures unless
mitigating steps are taken. Explainable AI has been shown to improve fluency
and teamwork in human-robot collaboration scenarios. Therefore, we hypothesize
that by utilizing autonomous explanation, these car-to-driver handovers can be
performed more safely and reliably. The rationale is, by providing the driver
with additional situational knowledge, they will more rapidly focus on the
relevant parts of the driving environment. Towards this end, we propose an
algorithmic failure-mode identification and explanation approach to enable
informed handovers from vehicle to driver. Furthermore, we propose a set of

one of twelve vectors of unit length, which are given by the normalized
vertices of the icosahedron, as value. Similar to the Blume-Capel model, where
in addition to $-1$ and $1$, as in the Ising model, the spin might take the
value $0$, we add in the generalized model $(0,0,0)$ as allowed value. There is
a parameter $D$ that controls the density of these voids. For a certain range
of $D$, the model undergoes a second-order phase transition. On the critical
line, $O(3)$ symmetry emerges. Furthermore, we demonstrate that within this
range, similar to the Blume-Capel model on the simple cubic lattice, there is a
value of $D$, where leading corrections to scaling vanish. We perform Monte
Carlo simulations for lattices of a linear size up to $L=400$ by using a hybrid
of local Metropolis and cluster updates. The motivation to study this
particular model is mainly of technical nature. Less memory and CPU time are
needed than for a model with $O(3)$ symmetry at the microscopic level. As the
result of a finite-size scaling analysis we obtain $\nu=0.71164(10)$,
$\eta=0.03784(5)$, and $\omega=0.759(2)$ for the critical exponents of the
three-dimensional Heisenberg universality class. The estimate of the irrelevant

reliable software tool that reproduces the complete response of a triple-GEM
detector to the passage of a charged particle, taking into account the main
physical effects. Starting from the detector configuration and the particle
information, PARSIFAL reproduces ionization, spatial and temporal diffusion,
effect of magnetic field, if present, and GEM amplification to provide the
dependable triple-GEM detector response. In the design and optimization stages
of this kind of detectors, simulations play an important role. Accurate and
robust software programs, such as GARFIELD++, can simulate the transport of
electrons and ions in a gas medium and their interaction with the electric
field, but they are CPU-time consuming. The necessity to reduce the processing
time while maintaining the precision of a full simulation is the main driver of
this work. For a given set of geometrical and electrical settings, GARFIELD++
is run once-and-for-all to provide the input parameters for PARSIFAL. Once
PARSIFAL is initialized and run, it produces the detector output, including the
signal induction and the output of the electronics. The results of the analysis
of the simulated data obtained with PARSIFAL are compared with the results of
the experimental data collected during a testbeam: some tuning factors are
applied to the simulation to improve the agreement. This paper describes the
structure of the code and the methodology used to match the output to the
experimental data.

in the world. The cataract, a developing opacity of the human eye lens,
constitutes the world's most frequent cause for blindness. During surgery, the
lens is removed and replaced by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). To
prevent patients from needing strong visual aids after surgery, a precise
prediction of the optical properties of the inserted IOL is crucial. There has
been lots of activity towards developing methods to predict these properties
from biometric eye data obtained by OCT devices, recently also by employing
machine learning. They consider either only biometric data or physical models,
but rarely both, and often neglect the IOL geometry. In this work, we propose
OpticNet, a novel optical refraction network, loss function, and training
scheme which is unsupervised, domain-specific, and physically motivated. We
derive a precise light propagation eye model using single-ray raytracing and
formulate a differentiable loss function that back-propagates physical
gradients into the network. Further, we propose a new transfer learning
procedure, which allows unsupervised training on the physical model and
fine-tuning of the network on a cohort of real IOL patient cases. We show that
our network is not only superior to systems trained with standard procedures

In this paper, we propose a Session-based Recommendation approach with an

long-term and recent behavior in an ongoing session. We employ a modified
self-attention mechanism to estimate item importance in a session, which is

transport (ENAQT), a unique situation in open system where an
environment-induced dephasing can, counter-intuitively, enhance transport.
First, we show a surprising situation where the particle current grows with
increasing disorder, even without dephasing. Then, we suggest a specific
mechanism for ENAQT (which we dub population uniformization) and demonstrate
that it can explain the persistence of ENAQT deep into the disorder-induced
localization regime. Finally, we show that repulsive interactions are
detrimental to ENAQT, and lead to an environment-hampered quantum transport.

both by a functional plausibility score derived from functionality analysis of

partial matching to evaluate functional plausibility on partial shapes. We show
a variety of plausible hybrid shapes generated by our functionality-aware model
evolution, which can complement existing datasets as training data and boost
the performance of contemporary data-driven segmentation schemes, especially in

was continued with a full-scale detector in 2016 - 2021. In this article we
describe all steps of preparatory work on this experiment. We present all
results of the Neutrino-4 experiment with increased statistical accuracy
provided to date. The experimental setup is constructed to measure the flux and
spectrum of the reactor antineutrinos as a function of distance to the center
of the active zone of the SM-3 reactor (Dimitrovgrad, Russia) in the range of 6
- 12 meters. Using all the collected data, we performed a model-independent
analysis to determine the oscillation parameters $\Delta m_{14}^2$ and
$\sin^22\theta_{14}$. The method of coherent summation of measurement results
allows to directly demonstrate the oscillation effect. We present the analysis
of possible systematic errors and the MC model of the experiment, which
considers the possibility of the effect manifestation at the present precision
level. As a result of the analysis, we can conclude that at currently available
statistical accuracy we observe the oscillations at the $2.9\sigma$ level with
parameters $\Delta m_{14}^2=(7.3\pm0.13_{st}\pm1.16_{sys})\text{eV}^2 =
(7.3\pm1.17)\text{eV}^2$ and $\sin^22\theta_{14}=
0.36\pm0.12_{stat}(2.9\sigma)$. Monte Carlo based statistical analysis gave
estimation of confidence level at $2.7\sigma$. We plan to improve the currently
working experimental setup and create a completely new setup in order to
increase the accuracy of the experiment by 3 times. We also provide a brief
analysis of the general experimental situation in the search for sterile
neutrinos.

the energy-transfer mechanisms sustaining wall turbulence can be ascribed to
linear processes. The different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and
comprise exponential instabilities, neutral modes, transient growth from
non-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow
variations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading
to the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in theoretical and conceptual
arguments. Whether the flow follows any or a combination of them remains
elusive. Here, we evaluate the linear mechanisms responsible for the energy
transfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow ($\bf U$) to the fluctuating
velocities ($\bf u'$). We use cause-and-effect analysis based on interventions.
This is achieved by direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows at
low Reynolds number, in which the energy transfer from $\bf U$ to $\bf u'$ is
constrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. We show that transient
growth is sufficient for sustaining realistic wall turbulence. Self-sustaining
turbulence persists when exponential instabilities, neutral modes, and
parametric instabilities of the mean flow are suppressed. We further show that
a key component of transient growth is the Orr/push-over mechanism induced by
spanwise variations of the base flow. Finally, we demonstrate that an ensemble
of simulations with various frozen-in-time $\bf U$ arranged so that only
transient growth is active, can faithfully represent the energy transfer from
$\bf U$ to $\bf u'$ as in realistic turbulence. Our approach provides direct
cause-and-effect evaluation of the linear energy-injection mechanisms from $\bf
U$ to $\bf u'$ in the fully nonlinear system and simplifies the conceptual
model of self-sustaining wall turbulence.

between an origin-destination (OD) pair is generated, and a probabilistic

further compared in terms of computational efficiency in estimation and

growth exceeding 1.2 billion cars by 2050. The economic contribution of the
transport sector represents 5% of the GDP in Europe and costs an average of US
$482.05 billion in the United States. These figures indicate the rapid rise of
industrial cities and the urgent need to move from traditional cities to smart
cities. This article provides a survey of different approaches and technologies
such as intelligent transportation systems (ITS) that leverage communication
technologies to help maintain road users safe while driving, as well as support
autonomous mobility through the optimization of control systems. The role of
ITS is strengthened when combined with accurate artificial intelligence models
that are built to optimize urban planning, analyze crowd behavior and predict
traffic conditions. AI-driven ITS is becoming possible thanks to the existence
of a large volume of mobility data generated by billions of users through their
use of new technologies and online social media. The optimization of urban
planning enhances vehicle routing capabilities and solves traffic congestion
problems, as discussed in this paper. From an ecological perspective, we
discuss the measures and incentives provided to foster the use of mobility
systems. We also underline the role of the political will in promoting open
data in the transport sector, considered as an essential ingredient for
developing technological solutions necessary for cities to become healthier and
more sustainable.

This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing
social media data like public attitudes towards disaster response and public
demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We
focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types,
durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper,
public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets,
which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies,
satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to
natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine
learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model,
the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and
prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different
natural disasters and the evolution of people's behavior of using social media
for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as
Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate
the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide
relief agencies with insights into better disaster management.

as well as the relations connecting different characters and objects. Based on
these signals, our framework enables weakly-supervised face naming through
multi-instance co-occurrence matching and supports high-level reasoning

geology is described in terms of complex facies distributions. Inspired by the
impressive results obtained by deep generative networks in areas such as image
and video generation, we started an investigation focused on the use of
autoencoders networks to construct a continuous parameterization for facies
models. In our previous publication, we combined a convolutional variational
autoencoder (VAE) with the ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation
(ES-MDA) for history matching production data in models generated with
multiple-point geostatistics. Despite the good results reported in our previous
publication, a major limitation of the designed parameterization is the fact
that it does not allow applying distance-based localization during the ensemble
smoother update, which limits its application in large-scale problems.
  The present work is a continuation of this research project focusing in two
aspects: firstly, we benchmark seven different formulations, including VAE,
generative adversarial network (GAN), Wasserstein GAN, variational
auto-encoding GAN, principal component analysis (PCA) with cycle GAN, PCA with
transfer style network and VAE with style loss. These formulations are tested
in a synthetic history matching problem with channelized facies. Secondly, we
propose two strategies to allow the use of distance-based localization with the
deep learning parameterizations.

for urban authorities to infer the traffic violation-prone locations in the
city. Therefore, we propose a low-cost, comprehensive, and dynamic framework to
infer traffic violation-prone locations in cities based on the large-scale
vehicle trajectory data and road environment data. Firstly, we normalize the
trajectory data by map matching algorithms and extract key driving behaviors,
i.e., turning behaviors, parking behaviors, and speeds of vehicles. Secondly,
we restore spatiotemporal contexts of driving behaviors to get corresponding
traffic restrictions such as no parking, no turning, and speed restrictions.
After matching the traffic restrictions with driving behaviors, we get the
traffic violation distribution. Finally, we extract the spatiotemporal patterns
of traffic violations, and build a visualization system to showcase the
inferred traffic violation-prone locations. To evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, we conduct extensive studies on large-scale, real-world
vehicle GPS trajectories collected from two Chinese cities, respectively.
Evaluation results confirm that the proposed framework infers traffic

incident angle of EM waves has influence on the reflection coefficient of RIS.
In addition, the angle-reciprocity on RIS is investigated and further proved to
be tenable when the reflection phase difference of adjacent RIS unit cells is

their topological characteristics. The conditions of the band-gaps, band
