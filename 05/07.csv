conventional neutron stars (NS) but involved at least one if not two hybrid
stars with a quark matter core which might even belong to a third family of
compact stars. To this end, we develop a Bayesian analysis method for selecting
the most probable equation of state (EoS) under a set of constraints from
compact star physics, which now also include the tidal deformability from
GW170817 and the first result for the mass and radius determination for PSR
J0030+0451 by NICER. We apply this method for the first time to a two-parameter
family of hybrid EoS based on the DD2 model with nucleonic excluded volume for
hadronic matter and the color superconducting generalized nlNJL model for quark
matter. The model has a variable onset of deconfinement and can mimic the
effects of pasta phases with the possibility of a third family of hybrid stars
in the mass-radius ($M-R$) diagram. The main findings of this study are that:
1) the presence of multiple configurations for a given mass (twins) corresponds
to a set of disconnected lines in the diagram of tidal deformabilities for
binary mergers, so that merger events from the same mass range may result in a
probability landscape with different peak positions; 2) the Bayesian analysis
with the above observational constraints favors an early onset of the
deconfinement transition, at masses of $M_{\rm onset}\le 0.8~M_\odot$ with a
$M-R$ relationship that in the range of observed neutron star masses is almost
indistinguishable from that of a soft hadronic APR EoS; 3) a few yet fictitious
measurements of the NICER experiment with a $1\sigma$ range that is half of the
present value and different mass and radius would change the posterior
likelihood so that hybrid EoS with a phase transition onset in the range
$M_{\rm onset} = 1.1 - 1.6~M_\odot $ would be favored.

decaying particle that generates the lepton-number asymmetry is in thermal
equilibrium. As the right-handed Dirac neutrinos are produced non-thermally,
the lepton-number asymmetry is accumulated and partially converted to the
baryon-number asymmetry via the rapid sphaleron transitions. The necessary
CP-violating condition can be fulfilled by a purely thermal kinetic phase from
the wavefunction correction in the lepton-doublet sector, which has been
neglected in most leptogenesis-based setup. Furthermore, this condition
necessitates a preferred flavor basis in which both the charged-lepton and
neutrino Yukawa matrices are non-diagonal. To protect such a proper Yukawa
structure from the basis transformations in flavor space prior to the
electroweak gauge symmetry breaking, we can resort to a plethora of model
buildings aimed at deciphering the non-trivial Yukawa structures.
Interestingly, based on the well-known tri-bimaximal mixing with a minimal
correction from the charged-lepton or neutrino sector, we find that a
simultaneous explanation of the baryon-number asymmetry in the Universe and the
low-energy neutrino oscillation observables can be attributed to the mixing
angle and the CP-violating phase introduced in the minimal correction.

$n$-Calabi-Yau triples $(\mathcal{T}, \mathcal{T}^{fd}, \mathcal{M})$. In this
paper, we use some classic tools of homological algebra to give a deeper
understanding of such categories $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^{fd}$.
  Let $k$ be a field, $n\geq 3$ an integer and $\mathcal{T}$ a $k$-linear
triangulated category with a triangulated subcategory $\mathcal{T}^{fd}$ and a
subcategory $\mathcal{M}=\text{add}(M)$ such that $(\mathcal{T},

Hom-spaces in these categories, using limits and colimits. Our second result is
a Gap Theorem in $\mathcal{T}$, showing when the truncation triangles split.
  Moreover, we apply our two theorems to present an alternative proof to a
result by Guo, originally stated in a more specific setup of dg $k$-algebras
$A$ and subcategories of the derived category of dg $A$-modules. This proves
that $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^{fd}$ is Hom-finite and $(n-1)$-Calabi-Yau, its
object $M$ is $(n-1)$-cluster tilting and the endomorphism algebras of $M$ over
$\mathcal{T}$ and over $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^{fd}$ are isomorphic. Note that
these properties make $\mathcal{T}/\mathcal{T}^{fd}$ a generalisation of the

the sample complexity of training RNN-based policies, without losing their

either increase the randomness within the applied transformations, or make the
defense computationally intensive, making it substantially more challenging for
the attacker. However, it limits the applicability of such defenses as a
pre-processing step, similar to computationally heavy approaches that use
retraining and network modifications to achieve robustness to perturbations. In
this work, we propose a defense strategy that applies random image corruptions
to the input image alone, constructs a self-correlation based subspace followed
by a projection operation to suppress the adversarial perturbation. Due to its
simplicity, the proposed defense is computationally efficient as compared to
the state-of-the-art, and yet can withstand huge perturbations. Further, we
develop proximity relationships between the projection operator of a clean
image and of its adversarially perturbed version, via bounds relating geodesic
distance on the Grassmannian to matrix Frobenius norms. We empirically show
that our strategy is complementary to other weak defenses like JPEG compression
and can be seamlessly integrated with them to create a stronger defense. We
present extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset across four different

role to develop ideas concerning the wave-particle duality and the Bohr's
complementarity principle. Ideally, a slit with a sufficiently low mass recoils
due to the passage of the photon. This motion denounces the path taken by the
light and suppresses any attempt to observe an interference pattern. In real
life, however, available which-way information in such a setup is significantly
impaired by the typical magnitudes of photons and slits, making the
verification of the effect almost impossible. Here, we extend this discussion
by applying similar ideas to the Mach-Zehnder interferometer. That is, we study
the consequences of the beam-splitter recoil, during the passage of the photon,
over the interference pattern produced by the device. Unlike the double-slit
experiment, this recoil can now be encoded in the wavelength of the photon
itself, which, in principle, is more easily accessed. Fortuitously, the model
used to describe the interaction between the idealized beam-splitter and the
photon clearly indicates that an interferometer based on Compton's effect could
be build to study wave-particle duality. We follow this hint, finding realistic

more liberal on the approval of Covid-19 tests in the US. In the UK emergency
measures allowed to increase the daily number of locally produced test kits to
100,000. China has recently launched a massive test manufacturing program.
However, all those efforts are very insufficient and many poor countries are
still under threat. A popular method for reducing the number of tests consists
in pooling samples, i.e. mixing patient samples and testing the mixed samples
once. If all the samples are negative, pooling succeeds at a unitary cost.
However, if a single sample is positive, failure does not indicate which
patient is infected. This paper describes how to optimally detect infected
patients in pools, i.e. using a minimal number of tests to precisely identify
them, given the a priori probabilities that each of the patients is healthy.
Those probabilities can be estimated using questionnaires, supervised machine

interpreted as informed divide-and-conquer strategies, are non-intuitive and
quite surprising. They are patent-free. Co-authors are listed in alphabetical

the so-called Grossman-Nir (GN) bound, which states that the branching
fractions of the $K_L$ and $K^+$ modes must satisfy the relation
$\mathcal{B}(K_L\to\pi^0$+$E_{\rm
miss})\lesssim4.3\,\mathcal{B}(K^+\to\pi^+$+$E_{\rm miss})$ and applies within
and beyond the SM, as long as the hadronic transitions change isospin by
$\Delta I=1/2$. In this paper we extend the study of these modes to include
new-physics scenarios where the missing energy is due to unobserved
lepton-number-violating neutrino pairs, invisible light new scalars, or pairs
of such scalars. The new interactions are assumed to arise above the
electroweak scale and described by an effective field theory. We explore the
possibility of violating the GN bound through $\Delta I=3/2$ contributions to
the $K\to\pi$ transitions within these scenarios and find that large violations
are only possible in the case where the missing energy is due to an invisible
light new scalar.

We make use of the elegant parametrization in the canonical form of these

Majorana geometric representation. The reduced two-qubit states, extracted from
an arbitrary pure entangled symmetric three-qubit state do not violate the CHSH
inequality and hence they are CHSH-local. However, when Alice and Bob perform a
CHSH test, after conditioning over measurement results of Charlie, nonlocality
of the state is revealed. We have also shown that two different families of
three-qubit pure symmetric states, consisting of two and three distinct spinors
(qubits) respectively, can be distinguished based on the strength of violation
in the conditional CHSH nonlocality test. Furthermore, we identify six of the
46 classes of tight Bell inequalities in the three-party, two-setting,
two-outcome i.e., (3,2,2) scenario (Phys. Rev. A 94, 062121 (2016)). Among the
two inequivalent families of three-qubit pure symmetric states, only the states
belonging to three distinct spinor class show maximum violations of these six

selectively inner-shell ionizes the core cluster formed of heavier rare-gas

This ignites a He nanoplasma which is then driven by an intense near-infrared

He$^+$ and He$^{2+}$ ion yields from the nanoplasma within $<70$ fs, leads to
strong damping of the core cluster expansion. Thus, He droplets act as

  AC Optimal Power Flow: A Second-Order Cone Programming Approach",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) is increasing
dramatically. Due to the uncertainty of DERs, the operation of the distribution
system is facing higher risks and challenges. To overcome such challenges, a
two-stage chance-constrained convex AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) model is
proposed in this paper, which can increase the economic efficiency of
distribution system operation and manage the intermittency of DERs. In the
first stage, a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based ACOPF model is
proposed in which the detailed models and limitations of DER, namely, demand
response (DR), energy storage units, and rooftop PV systems are modeled to
obtain participation ratio of DERs. In the second stage, Monte Carlo simulation
is utilized to model the uncertainties of DERs. A probability violation index
is introduced to make a trade-off between scheduling more DERs and imposing a
higher risk to the distribution system. In this stage, power flow analysis is
conducted for each scenario to determine the probability violation index of
system. Then, a modified SOCP-based ACOPF is proposed to satisfy the system
probability violation criterion. Simulation results illustrate that the
proposed two-stage chance-constrained model improves economic efficiency and
reliability of real-time operation of the distribution system.

capital allocation of Value-at-Risk. A superlevel set of this conditional
distribution can be interpreted as a set of severe and plausible stress
scenarios the given capital is supposed to cover. We show that various
distributional properties of this conditional distribution, such as modality,

the variety of risky scenarios likely to occur in a stressed situation. Under
unimodality, we introduce a novel risk allocation method called maximum
likelihood allocation (MLA), defined as the mode of the conditional

allocations can be less sound. To overcome this issue, we investigate the
so-called multimodalty adjustment to increase the soundness of risk

portion of reality, based on ontology of different kinds of things and their
basic relations to each other. Relations are defined in terms of their

specifically causal relations among events in modeling. We examine causality in
many fields of study to understand its role in modeling. The problem is that,
according to many researchers, causation is so inextricably bound up in
misleading associations that it is hard to define and is shrouded in mystery,
controversy, and caution. We study and clarify the notion of causality through
several examples, utilizing an event definition as a time thing/machine in a

Theory of Mind capabilities are central to providing an explanation to another

misclassifies at most $k^{O(k)}(\epsilon+\eta)$ fraction of the points whenever
every pair of mixture components are separated by

result was not previously known even for $k=2$. TV separation is the
statistically weakest possible notion of separation and captures important
special cases such as mixed linear regression and subspace clustering.
  Our main conceptual contribution is to distill simple analytic properties -
(certifiable) hypercontractivity and bounded variance of degree 2 polynomials
and anti-concentration of linear projections - that are necessary and
sufficient for mixture models to be (efficiently) clusterable. As a
consequence, our results extend to clustering mixtures of arbitrary affine
transforms of the uniform distribution on the $d$-dimensional unit sphere. Even
the information-theoretic clusterability of separated distributions satisfying
these two analytic assumptions was not known prior to our work and is likely to
be of independent interest.

anti-concentration first introduced in the works of Karmarkar, Klivans, and

two schemes (appending and substitution) to integrate the NMs with the
traditional modes (TM) defined in high efficiency video coding (HEVC). For the
appending scheme, each NM is corresponding to a certain range of TMs. The
categorization of TMs is based on the expected prediction errors. After
determining the relevant TMs for each NM, we present a probability-aware mode
signaling scheme. The NMs with higher probabilities to be the best mode are
signaled with fewer bits. For the substitution scheme, we propose to replace
the highest and lowest probable TMs. New most probable mode (MPM) generation
method is also employed when substituting the lowest probable TMs. Experimental
results demonstrate that using multiple NMs will improve the coding efficiency

with seven NMs can save 2.6%, 3.8%, 3.1% BD-rate for Y, U, V components

generalized network structures that can represent the many-body interactions
existing in complex systems raging from the brain to high-order social
networks. Simplicial complexes are formed by simplicies, such as nodes, links,
triangles and so on. Cell complexes further extend these generalized network
structures as they are formed by regular polytopes such as squares, pentagons
etc. Pseudo-fractal simplicial and cell complexes are a major example of
generalized network structures and they can be obtained by gluing
$2$-dimensional $m$-polygons ($m=2$ triangles, $m=4$ squares, $m=5$ pentagons,
etc.) along their links according to a simple iterative rule. Here we
investigate the interplay between the topology of pseudo-fractal simplicial and
cell complexes and their dynamics by characterizing the critical properties of
link percolation defined on these structures. By using the renormalization
group we show that the pseudo-fractal simplicial and cell complexes have a
continuous percolation threshold at $p_c=0$. When the pseudo-fractal structure
is formed by polygons of the same size $m$, the transition is characterized by
an exponential suppression of the order parameter $P_{\infty}$ that depends on
the number of sides $m$ of the polygons forming the pseudo-fractal cell
complex, i.e., $P_{\infty}\propto p\exp(-\alpha/p^{m-2})$. Here these results
are also generalized to random pseudo-fractal cell-complexes formed by polygons
of different number of sides $m$.

performed jointly within the same network. The network becomes a denoising
expert by seeing all available raw data, while co-learning to segment, even if
only a few segmentation labels are available. This hypothesis is additionally
fueled by our observation that the best segmentation results on high quality

are added. This renders the denoising-task non-trivial and unleashes the

evolution in late phases. It, however, shows a few distinguishable properties
from the canonical Ca-rich transients: a short-duration first peak in the light
curve, high peak luminosity, and association with a star-forming environment.
Indeed, some of these features are shared with iPTF14gqr and iPTF16hgs, which
are candidates for a special class of core-collapse SNe (CCSNe): the so-called
ultra-stripped envelope SNe, i.e., a relatively low-mass He (or C+O) star
explosion in a binary as a precursor of double neutron star binaries. The
estimated ejecta mass ($0.43 M_\odot$) and explosion energy ($1.7 \times
10^{50} $~erg) are consistent with this scenario. The analysis of the first
peak suggests existence of dense circumstellar material in the vicinity of the
progenitor, implying a CCSN origin. Based on these analyses, we suggest SN
2019ehk is another candidate for an ultra-stripped envelope SN. These
ultra-stripped envelope SN candidates seem to form a subpopulation among
Ca-rich transients, associated with young population. We propose that the key
to distinguishing this population is the early first peak in their light

causal wedges, and it has been argued previously that they may be useful for
understanding bulk locality in flat space holography. In this paper, we use
ACD-inspired ideas to argue that there exist natural candidates for Quantum
Extremal Surfaces (QES) and entanglement wedges in flat space, anchored to the
conformal boundary. When there is a holographic screen at finite radius, we can
also associate entanglement wedges and entropies to screen sub-regions, with
the system naturally coupled to a sink. The screen and the boundary provide two
complementary ways of formulating the information paradox. We explain how they
are related and show that in both formulations, the flat space entanglement
wedge undergoes a phase transition at the Page time in the background of an
evaporating Schwarzschild black hole. Our results closely parallel recent
observations in AdS, and reproduce the Page curve. That there is a variation of
the argument that can be phrased directly in flat space without reliance on
AdS, is a strong indication that entanglement wedge phase transitions may be
key to the information paradox in flat space as well. Along the way, we give
evidence that the entanglement entropy of an ACD is a well-defined, and likely
instructive, quantity. We further note that the picture of the sink we present

can only exist in the region of anomalous dispersion, recent theoretical
studies have predicted that higher-order dispersion can fundamentally alter the
situation, enabling bright localized structures even under conditions of normal
dispersion driving. Here we demonstrate a flexible optical fibre ring resonator
platform that offers unprecedented control over dispersion conditions, and we
report on the first experimental observations of bright localized structures
that are fundamentally enabled by higher-order dispersion. In broad agreement
with past theoretical predictions, we find that several distinct bright
structures can co-exist for the same parameters, and we observe experimental
evidence of their collapsed snaking bifurcation structure. In addition to
enabling direct experimental verifications of a number of theoretical
predictions, we show that the ability to judiciously control the dispersion
conditions offers a novel route for ultrashort pulse generation: the bright
structures observed in our work correspond to pulses of light as short as
220~fs -- the record for a passive all-fibre ring resonator. We envisage that

partial, when the so-called many-body mobility edge separates localized and

delocalization. In order to study such instability mechanism, in this work we
design a model featuring many-body mobility edge in \emph{particle density}:
the states at small particle density are localized, while increasing the

matrix product states we demonstrate the stability of MBL with respect to small
bubbles in large dilute systems for experimentally relevant timescales. In
addition, we demonstrate that processes where the bubble spreads are favored

functions are conditional on an uncertain state of the network. The agents have
the same prior belief about the state, but only a fixed fraction receive
private route recommendations or a common message, which are generated by a
known randomization, referred to as private or public signaling policy
respectively. The remaining agents choose route according to Bayes Nash flow
with respect to the prior. We develop a computational approach to solve the
optimal information design problem, i.e., to minimize expected social latency
over all public or obedient private signaling policies. For a fixed flow
induced by non-participating agents, design of an optimal private signaling
policy is shown to be a generalized problem of moments for polynomial link
latency functions, and to admit an atomic solution with a provable upper bound
on the number of atoms. This implies that, for polynomial link latency
functions, information design can be equivalently cast as a polynomial
optimization problem. This in turn can be arbitrarily lower bounded by a known
hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations. The first level of this hierarchy is
shown to be exact for the basic two link case with affine latency functions. We
also identify a class of private signaling policies over which the optimal
social cost is non-increasing with increasing fraction of participating agents
for parallel networks. This is in contrast to existing results where the cost
of participating agents under a fixed signaling policy may increase with their
increasing fraction.

unknown. In addition, the computational result---energy and charge density
distribution of the ground state---is useful for electronic properties of
solids mostly when reduced to a band structure interpretation based on the
Kohn-Sham approach. Here, we demonstrate how machine learning algorithms can
help to free density functional theory from these limitations. We study a
theory of spinless fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The density
functional is implicitly represented by a neural network, which predicts,
besides the ground-state energy and density distribution, density-density
correlation functions. At no point do we require a band structure
interpretation. The training data, obtained via exact diagonalization, feeds
into a learning scheme inspired by active learning, which minimizes the
computational costs for data generation. We show that the network results are
of high quantitative accuracy and, despite learning on random potentials,
capture both symmetry-breaking and topological phase transitions correctly.

Focusing on the strongly barred galaxy NGC 1300, we investigate the possibility
that the presence of a large amount of diffuse molecular gas, which would not
contribute to the SF, makes the SFE low in appearance. We examine the relation
between the SFE and the diffuse molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm dif}$), which
is derived using the $^{12}$CO($1-0$) flux obtained from the interferometer of
ALMA 12-m array, which has no sensitivity on diffuse (extended; FWHM
$\gtrapprox 700$ pc) molecular gases due to the lack of ACA, and the total
$^{12}$CO($1-0$) flux obtained from Nobeyama 45-m single-dish telescope. We
find that the SFE decreases with increasing $f_{\rm dif}$. The $f_{\rm dif}$
and ${\rm SFE}$ are $0.74 - 0.91$ and $(0.06 - 0.16) ~\rm Gyr^{-1}$ in the bar
regions, and $0.28 - 0.65$ and $(0.23 - 0.96) ~\rm Gyr^{-1}$ in the arm and
bar-end regions. This result supports the idea that the presence of a large
amount of diffuse molecular gas makes the SFE low. The suppression of the SFE
in the bar has also been seen even when we exclude the diffuse molecular gas
components. This suggests that the low SFE appears to be caused not only by a
large amount of diffuse molecular gases but also by other mechanisms such as
fast cloud-cloud collisions.

correlation technique, and corresponds to a planetary mass of
1.4$^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$ $M_J$ and an orbital inclination of 21 $\pm$ 5$^{\circ}$.
The technique works by treating the planet/star system as a spectroscopic
binary and obtaining high signal-to-noise, high resolution observations at
multiple points across the planet's orbit to constrain the system's binary
dynamical motion. All together, seven epochs of Keck/NIRSPEC $L$-band
observations were obtained, with five before the instrument upgrade and two
after. Using high resolution SCARLET planetary and PHOENIX stellar spectral
models, along with a line-by-line telluric absorption model, we were able to
drastically increase the confidence of the detection by running simulations
that could reproduce, and thus remove, the non-random structured noise in the
final likelihood space well. The ability to predict multi-epoch results will be
extremely useful for furthering the technique. Here, we use these simulations
to compare three different approaches to combining the cross correlations of
high resolution spectra and find that the Zucker 2003 log(L) approach is least
affected by unwanted planet/star correlation for our HD187123 data set.
Furthermore, we find that the same total S/N spread across an orbit in many,
lower S/N epochs rather than fewer, higher S/N epochs could provide a more
efficient detection. This work provides a necessary validation of multi-epoch
simulations which can be used to guide future observations and will be key to
studying the atmospheres of further separated, non-transiting exoplanets.

strength. In this paper, we explore in detail the properties of the underlying
stellar populations by use of ~230 thousand high-quality spectra from the Sloan

via dust-corrected colours. We explore high quality stacked SDSS spectra, and
find a population trend that suggests a substantial difference between low- and

formation quenching, and the latter showing older (post-quenching) populations
that include rejuvenation events. Subtle but measurable differences are found
between a colour-based approach and our definition, especially as our selection
of GV galaxies produces a cleaner ""stratification"" of the GV, with more
homogeneous population properties within sections of the GV. Our definition
based on 4000$\AA$ break strength gives a clean representation of the
transition to quiescence, easily measurable in the upcoming and future

extracted from a fit to this angular distribution. One can measure CP-violating
angular asymmmetries. If one integrates over some of the five kinematic
parameters parametrizing the angular distribution, one obtains (i) familiar
observables such as the $q^2$ distribution and the $D^*$ polarization, and (ii)

of this suite of simulations we are able to quantify the overestimate of
open-star-cluster-like models' dynamical masses when making a straight
application of the virial theorem using available position and radial velocity
measurements. The mass inflation caused by the binary 'heating' contribution to
the measured velocity dispersion depends, of course, on the initial binary

done using experimentally sounding estimates for the velocity dispersion can be
up to a factor 45. We provide a useful fitting formula to correct the dynamical

the role of binaries in stellar systems might lead to erroneous conclusions
about their total mass budget. If this trend remains valid for larger systems

however, shows large scatter at low O/H, and is strongly dependent on galactic
environment. We show that several heretofore unexplained features of the N/O

being mostly primary nitrogen that is returned to the ISM via pre-supernova
winds from rapidly rotating massive stars ($M \gtrsim 10$ M$_\odot$, $v/v_{\rm

at low O/H. We show that the large scatter in N/O at low O/H also arises
naturally from variations in star-formation efficiency. By contrast, models in
which the N and O come primarily from supernovae provide a very poor fit to the
observed abundance distribution. We propose that the peculiar abundance
patterns we observe at low O/H are a signature that dwarf galaxies retain
little of their SN ejecta, leaving them with abundance patterns typical of

35 galaxies. Galaxies in the new sample cover a wider dynamic range in redshift
($z$ = 0.65 - 4.73), are on average twice as large (1.3 vs 0.65 kpc) and and

larger physical sizes, these galaxies have still far-infrared sizes
significantly more compact than inferred from their optical emission. We show
that the astrometry of the HST image does not only suffer from a global
astrometric shift, as already discussed in previous papers, but also from local
shifts. These distortions were artificially introduced in the process of
building the mosaic of the GOODS-South HST image. By comparing the positions of
almost 400 galaxies detected by HST, Pan-STARRS and ALMA, we create a

Since the previous paper focused solely on the energy flux, here we concentrate
initially on analyzing the angular momentum flux to infinity. A first step
involves finding convenient forms for hereditary contributions to the flux at
low-PN order, analogous to similar terms worked out previously for the energy

with three unique properties: i) its mass ratio is about 0.28, the lowest found
so far, ii) it has a relatively high positive effective spin parameter
\chi_eff=0.25, and iii) it is observed to be precessing due to in-plane
projected spin of the binary with an in-plane precession parameter \chi_p=0.3.
The two main formation channels of BBH formation fail to account for GW190412:
field formation scenarios cannot explain the observed precession unless by
invoking large natal kicks, and dynamical assembly in dense stellar systems is
inefficient in producing such low mass-ratio BBH mergers. Here, we investigate
whether ""double mergers"" in wide hierarchical quadruple systems in the ""3+1""
configuration could explain the unique properties of GW190412. In this
scenario, a compact object quadruple system experiences two mergers: first, two
compact objects in the innermost orbit merge due to secular chaotic evolution.
At a later time, the merged compact object coalesces with another compact
object due to secular Lidov-Kozai oscillations. We find that our scenario is
consistent with GW190412. In particular, we find a preferential projected spin
around \chi_p=0.2. However, the likelihood of a double merger is small and the
formation efficiency of these systems is uncertain. If GW190412 originated from
a double merger in a 3+1 quadruple, we find a strong constraint that the first
merger likely occurred between roughly equal-mass BHs in the innermost orbit,

theories with all UV particles living in at most one irreducible representation

determined by the symmetries and can be systematically identified via group

reverse-engineering the UV physics from the Standard Model EFT, and thus
deserve more theoretical and experimental investigations. Second, theoretical

For this reason, we use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn a

small-scale features of the matter density field, as validated through a
variety of n-point statistics. The use of a data scaling that preserves

mean power spectra from generated samples agree to within 5% up to k=3 and
within 10% for k<5 when compared with N-body simulations, and similar accuracy
is obtained for a variety of bispectra. By modeling the latent space with a
heavy-tailed prior rather than a standard Gaussian, we better capture sample
variance in the high-density voxel PDF and reduce errors in power spectrum and
bispectrum covariance on all scales. Furthermore, we show that a conditional

at prevalences up to 30%, while for estimation of COVID-19 prevalence rates in
the total population, Gibbs-Gower testing is the best choice at prevalences up
to 30% given a fixed and relatively small number of tests. For instance, at a
prevalence of up to 2%, Dorfman testing gives an efficiency gain of 3.5--8; at
1% prevalence, Gibbs-Gower testing gives an efficiency gain of 18, even when
capping the pool size at a feasible number .

measurements. In one phase, a finite fraction of the system belongs to a
fully-entangled state, one for which no subsystem is in a pure state, while in
the second phase, the steady-state is a product state over extensively many,
finite subsystems. We study this ""separability"" transition in a family of
solvable models in which we analytically determine the transition point, the
evolution of certain entanglement properties of interest, and relate this to a
mean-field percolation transition. Since the entanglement entropy density does
not distinguish these phases, we introduce the entangling power - which
measures whether local measurements outside of two finite subsystems can boost
their mutual information - as an order parameter, after considering its
behavior in tensor network states, and numerically studying its behavior in a
model of Clifford dynamics with measurements. We argue that in our models, the
separability transition coincides with a transition in the computational
""hardness"" of classically determining the output probability distribution for
the steady-state in a certain basis of product states. A prediction for this

is the determination of whether they explode or implode in the end. While the
final fate of a massive star is sensitive to its core structure at the onset of
collapse, the existing binary population synthesis studies do not reach
core-collapse. Instead, they employ simple prescriptions to infer their final
fates without knowing the presupernova core structure. We explore a potential
solution to this problem by treating the carbon-oxygen (CO) core independently
from the rest of the star. Using the implicit hydrodynamics code KEPLER, we
have computed an extensive grid of 3496 CO-core models from a diverse range of
initial conditions, each evolved from carbon ignition until core-collapse. The
final core structure, and thus the explodability, varies non-monotonically and
depends sensitively on both the mass and initial composition of the CO-core.
Although bare CO-cores are not perfect substitutes for cores embedded in
massive stars, our models compare well both with MESA and full hydrogenic and
helium star calculations. Our results can be used to infer the presupernova
core structures from population synthesis estimates of CO-core properties, thus
to determine the final outcomes based on the results of modern neutrino-driven
explosion simulations. A sample application is presented for a population of

dynamical tides in such binaries. We focus on the global three-mode parametric
instability and show that it has a much lower threshold energy than the local
wave-breaking condition studied previously. By integrating networks of coupled
modes, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period.
We construct phenomenological models that match these numerical results and use
them to evaluate the spin and luminosity evolution of a WD binary. While in
linear theory the WD's spin frequency can lock to the orbital frequency, we
find that such a lock cannot be maintained when nonlinear effects are taken
into account. Instead, as the orbit decays, the spin and orbit go in and out of
synchronization. Each time they go out of synchronization, there is a brief but
significant dip in the tidal heating rate. While most WDs in compact binaries
should have luminosities that are similar to previous traveling-wave estimates,
a few percent should be about ten times dimmer because they reside in heating
rate dips. This offers a potential explanation for the low luminosity of the CO
WD in J0651. Lastly, we consider the impact of tides on the GW signal and show
that LISA and TianGO can constrain the WD's moment of inertia to better than 1%

cosmological distances with $N\gg 1000$ antennas could face a significant
computational challenge in building correlators with the traditional
architecture, whose computational resource requirement scales as
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ with array size. The fundamental output of such correlators
is the cross-correlation products of all antenna pairs in the array. The
FFT-correlator architecture reduces the computational resources scaling to
$\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$ by computing cross-correlation products through a
spatial Fourier transform. However, the output of the FFT-correlator is
meaningful only when the input antenna voltages are gain- and phase-calibrated.
Traditionally, interferometric calibration has used the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
cross-correlations produced by a standard correlator. This paper proposes two
real-time calibration schemes that could work in parallel with an
FFT-correlator as a self-contained $\mathcal{O}(N\log{N})$ correlator system
that can be scaled to large-N redundant arrays. We compare the performance and
scalability of these two calibration schemes and find that they result in
antenna gains whose variance decreases as $1/\log{N}$ with increase in the size
of the array.

a learning system is introduced that provides AI assistance for finding
recommended changes to a program. Specifically, it is shown how the evaluative
feedback, delayed-reward performance programming domain can be effectively
formulated via the Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) framework. It is then shown
that established methods from computational games for using learning to
expedite tree-search computation can be adapted to speed up computing
recommended program alterations. Estimates of expected utility from MCTS trees
built for previous problems are used to learn a sampling policy that remains
effective across new problems, thus demonstrating transferability of
optimization knowledge. This formulation is applied to the Apache Spark
distributed computing environment, and a preliminary result is observed that
the time required to build a search tree for finding recommendations is reduced
by up to a factor of 10x.

SnoopDog localizes the clandestine device in a 2D plane using a novel

IL and model free RL methods have been proved to be capable of solving lots of

The algorithm iteratively learns a parameterized dynamic model to approximate
the complex and interactive driving task, and optimizes the driving policy
under the nonlinear approximate dynamic model. As a model based RL approach,
when applied in urban autonomous driving, the GPS has the advantages of higher
sample efficiency, better interpretability, and greater stability. We provide
extensive experiments validating the effectiveness of the proposed method to
learn robust driving policy for urban driving in Carla. We also compare the

has become difficult to maintain ideal performance by static RRAM controllers.
Machine Learning provides a promising solution for this, and hence, this work
focuses on extending such controllers to allow dynamic parameter updates. In
this work we propose an Adaptive RRAM Variability-Aware Controller, AVAC, which
periodically updates Wait Buffer and batch sizes using on-the-fly learning
models and gradient ascent. AVAC allows Edge devices to adapt to different
applications and their stages, to improve computation performance and reduce

visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As
the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where
in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19
retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage

on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity
level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set
of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than
$h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured

categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and
high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates
proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\%$

required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when
immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups
with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates.
Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is
uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.

desired target locations. These step-by-step navigational instructions are
crucial when the agent is navigating new environments about which it has no
prior knowledge. Most recent works that study VLN observe a significant
performance drop when tested on unseen environments (i.e., environments not
used in training), indicating that the neural agent models are highly biased
towards training environments. Although this issue is considered as one of the
major challenges in VLN research, it is still under-studied and needs a clearer
explanation. In this work, we design novel diagnosis experiments via
environment re-splitting and feature replacement, looking into possible reasons
for this environment bias. We observe that neither the language nor the
underlying navigational graph, but the low-level visual appearance conveyed by
ResNet features directly affects the agent model and contributes to this
environment bias in results. According to this observation, we explore several
kinds of semantic representations that contain less low-level visual
information, hence the agent learned with these features could be better
generalized to unseen testing environments. Without modifying the baseline
agent model and its training method, our explored semantic features
significantly decrease the performance gaps between seen and unseen on multiple
datasets (i.e. R2R, R4R, and CVDN) and achieve competitive unseen results to
previous state-of-the-art models. Our code and features are available at:

(EA) to solve complex problems using the linkage information between problem

However, LTGA is an unsuitable method for dealing with multi-task optimization
problems. On the other hand, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) can
simultaneously solve independent optimization problems, which are encoded in a
unified representation to take advantage of the process of knowledge transfer.
In this paper, we introduce Multifactorial Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm
(MF-LTGA) by combining the main features of both LTGA and MFO. MF-LTGA is able
to tackle multiple optimization tasks at the same time, each task learns the
dependency between problem variables from the shared representation. This
knowledge serves to determine the high-quality partial solutions for supporting
other tasks in exploring the search space. Moreover, MF-LTGA speeds up
convergence because of knowledge transfer of relevant problems. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on two benchmark problems:
Clustered Shortest-Path Tree Problem and Deceptive Trap Function. In comparison
to LTGA and existing methods, MF-LTGA outperforms in quality of the solution or
in computation time.

We tested how well both measures can predict the compensating area for the loss

been recently unveiled. Owing to their potential impact on the realisation of
twisted spin-textures, their implication in spintronics or quantum computing is
very promising. Here, I address the long-range behavior of multi-spin MEI on
the basis of a multiple-scattering formalism implementable in Green functions
based methods. I consider the impact of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as described
in the one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) Rashba model, from which the
analytical forms of the four- and six-spin interactions are extracted and
compared to the bilinear isotropic, anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
interactions (DMI). Similarly to the DMI between two sites $i$ and $j$, there
is a four-spin chiral vector perpendicular to the bond connecting the two
sites. The oscillatory behavior of the MEI and their decay as function of
interatomic distances are analysed and quantified for the Rashba surfaces
states characterizing Au surfaces. The interplay of beating effects and
strength of SOC gives rise to a wide parameter space where chiral MEI are more
prominent than the isotropic ones. The multi-spin interactions for a plaquette
of $N$ magnetic moments decay like $\{q_F^{N-d} P^{\frac{1}{2}(d-1)}L\}^{-1}$
simplifying to $\{q_F^{N-d} R^{\left[1+\frac{N}{2}(d-1)\right]}N\}^{-1}$ for
equidistant atoms, where $d$ is the dimension of the mediating electrons, $q_F$
the Fermi wave vector, $L$ the perimeter of the plaquette while $P$ is the
product of interatomic distances. This recovers the behavior of the bilinear
MEI, $\{q_F^{2-d} R^{d}\}^{-1}$, and shows that increasing the perimeter of the
plaquette weakens the MEI. More important, the power-law pertaining to the
distance-dependent 1D MEI is insensitive to the number of atoms in the
plaquette in contrast to the linear dependence associated with the 2D MEI.

scales. Development over this method mainly focuses on aggregating contextual
information at different levels while seldom touching the inter-level
correlation in the feature pyramid. Early computer vision methods extracted
scale-invariant features by locating the feature extrema in both spatial and
scale dimension. Inspired by this, a convolution across the pyramid level is
proposed in this study, which is termed pyramid convolution and is a modified
3-D convolution. Stacked pyramid convolutions directly extract 3-D (scale and
spatial) features and outperforms other meticulously designed feature fusion
modules. Based on the viewpoint of 3-D convolution, an integrated batch
normalization that collects statistics from the whole feature pyramid is
naturally inserted after the pyramid convolution. Furthermore, we also show
that the naive pyramid convolution, together with the design of RetinaNet head,
actually best applies for extracting features from a Gaussian pyramid, whose
properties can hardly be satisfied by a feature pyramid. In order to alleviate
this discrepancy, we build a scale-equalizing pyramid convolution (SEPC) that
aligns the shared pyramid convolution kernel only at high-level feature maps.
Being computationally efficient and compatible with the head design of most
single-stage object detectors, the SEPC module brings significant performance
improvement ($>4$AP increase on MS-COCO2017 dataset) in state-of-the-art
one-stage object detectors, and a light version of SEPC also has $\sim3.5$AP
gain with only around 7% inference time increase. The pyramid convolution also
functions well as a stand-alone module in two-stage object detectors and is
able to improve the performance by $\sim2$AP. The source code can be found at

= 2.20 \pm 0.27$ and flux F($>315$ GeV) = ($7.6\pm 1.2_{\mathrm stat} \pm
2.3_{\mathrm syst})\times 10^{-13}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, or approximately 0.7%
of the Crab Nebula flux above the same threshold. 3C 264 ($z = 0.0217$) is the
most distant radio galaxy detected at VHE, and the elevated state is thought to
be similar to that of the famously outbursting jet in M 87. Consequently,
extensive contemporaneous multi-wavelength data were acquired in 2018 at the
time of the VHE high state. An analysis of these data, including VLBA, VLA,

theory may result in a totally new class of fermions. These particles have
distinct properties: they appear at high symmetry points of the reciprocal
lattice, they are connected by helicoidal surface Fermi arcs spanning the
entire Brillouin zone, and they are expected to exist over a large energy
range. Additionally, they are expected to give rise to totally new effects
forbidden in other topological classes. Understanding how these unconventional
quasiparticles propagate and interact is crucial for exploiting their potential
in innovative chirality-driven device architectures. These aspects necessarily
rely on the detection of handedness-dependent effects in the two enantiomers
and remain largely unexplored so far. Here, we use scanning tunnelling
microscopy to visualize the electronic properties of both enantiomers of the
prototypical chiral topological semimetal PdGa at the atomic scale. We reveal
that the surface-bulk connectivity goes beyond ensuring the existence of
topological Fermi arcs, but also determines how quasiparticles propagate and
scatter at impurities, giving rise to chiral quantum interference patterns of
opposite handedness and opposite spiralling direction for the two different
enantiomers, a direct manifestation of the change of sign of their Chern
number. Additionally, we demonstrate that PdGa remains topologically
non-trivial over a large energy range, experimentally detecting Fermi arcs in
an energy window of more than 1.6 eV symmetrically centerd around the Fermi
level. These results are rationalized in terms of the deep connection between
chirality in real and reciprocal space in this class of materials, and they
allow to identify PdGa as an ideal topological chiral semimetal.

was found to be the same as the the speed of the gamma rays to approximately
one part in $10^{15}$. Here we present a different method of measuring the
speed of gravitational waves, not based on an associated electromagnetic signal
but instead by the measured transit time across a geographically separated
network of detectors. While this method is far less precise, it provides an
independent measurement of the speed of gravitational waves. For GW170817 a
binary neutron star inspiral observed by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, by
fixing sky localization of the source at the electromagnetic counterpart the
speed of gravitational waves is constrained to 90% confidence interval (0.97c,
1.02c), where c is the speed of light in a vacuum. By combing seven BBH events
and the BNS event from the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Advanced
Virgo, the 90% confidence interval is narrowed down to (0.97c, 1.01c). The
accurate measurement of the speed of gravitational waves allows us to test the
general theory of relativity. We further interpret these results within the

spin-orbit interaction has been the cornerstone of nuclear structure since its
inception more than seven decades ago. In this paper we introduce---or rather
re-introduced---the ""Dirac Oscillator"", a fully relativistic basis that has all
the desired attributes of the ordinary harmonic oscillator while naturally
incorporating a strong spin-orbit coupling.
  Purpose: To assess---to our knowledge for the first time---the power and
flexibility of the Dirac Oscillator basis in the solution of nuclear structure
problems within the framework of covariant density functional theory.
  Methods: Self-consistent calculations of binding energies and ground-state
densities for a selected set of doubly-magic magic are performed using the
Dirac-oscillator basis and are then compared against results obtained with the
often-used Runge-Kutta method.
  Results: Results obtained using the Dirac oscillator basis reproduced with
high accuracy those derived using the Runge-Kutta method and suggest a clear
path for a generalization to systems with axial symmetry.
  Conclusions: Although the three-dimensional harmonic oscillator with
spin-orbit corrections has been the staple of the nuclear shell model since the
beginning, the Dirac oscillator is practically unknown among the nuclear
physics community. In this paper we illustrate the power and flexibility of the
Dirac oscillator and suggest extensions to the study of systems without
spherical symmetry as required in constrained calculations of nuclear
excitations.

regulated by transcription factors (TFs), which are single proteins or protein
complexes. Proteins are in turn synthesised from expressed genes, creating a
feedback loop of regulation. This leads to a directed bipartite network in
which a link from a gene to a TF exists if the gene codes for a protein
contributing to the TF, and a link from a TF to a gene exists if the TF
regulates the expression of the gene. Both genes and TFs are modelled as binary
variables, which indicate, respectively, whether a gene is expressed or not,
and a TF is synthesised or not. We consider the scenario where for a TF to be
synthesised, all of its contributing genes must be expressed. This results in
an ``AND'' gate logic for the dynamics of TFs. By adapting percolation theory
to directed bipartite graphs, evolving according to the AND logic dynamics, we
are able to determine the necessary conditions, in the network parameter space,
under which bipartite networks can support a multiplicity of stable gene
expression patterns, under noisy conditions, as required in stable cell types.
  In particular, the analysis reveals the possibility of a bi-stability region,
where the extensive percolating cluster is or is not resilient to
perturbations. This is remarkably different from the transition observed in
standard percolation theory. Finally, we consider perturbations involving
single node removal that mimic gene knockout experiments. Results reveal the
strong dependence of the gene knockout cascade on the logic implemented in the

A3073-A3096], where a Reynolds-robust preconditioner for the three-dimensional

multigrid method for the stress-velocity block that involves a
divergence-capturing space decomposition and a custom prolongation operator.
The solver exhibits excellent robustness with respect to the parameters arising
in the constitutive relation, allowing for the simulation of a wide range of
materials.

  Randomize for Minimax Variance and Design-Based Inference",,,,,"stat.ME math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  I study the minimax-optimal design for a two-arm controlled experiment where
conditional mean outcomes may vary in a given set. When this set is permutation
symmetric, the optimal design is complete randomization, and using a single
partition (i.e., the design that only randomizes the treatment labels for each
side of the partition) has minimax risk larger by a factor of $n-1$. More
generally, the optimal design is shown to be the mixed-strategy optimal design
(MSOD) of Kallus (2018). Notably, even when the set of conditional mean
outcomes has structure (i.e., is not permutation symmetric), being
minimax-optimal for variance still requires randomization beyond a single
partition. Nonetheless, since this targets precision, it may still not ensure
sufficient uniformity in randomization to enable randomization (i.e.,
design-based) inference by Fisher's exact test to appropriately detect
violations of null. I therefore propose the inference-constrained MSOD, which
is minimax-optimal among all designs subject to such uniformity constraints. On
the way, I discuss Johansson et al. (2020) who recently compared
rerandomization of Morgan and Rubin (2012) and the pure-strategy optimal design
(PSOD) of Kallus (2018). I point out some errors therein and set straight that
randomization is minimax-optimal and that the ""no free lunch"" theorem and
example in Kallus (2018) are correct.

divided into two tracks. Track 1 targeted the single image demoireing problem,
which seeks to remove moire patterns from a single image. Track 2 focused on
the burst demoireing problem, where a set of degraded moire images of the same
scene were provided as input, with the goal of producing a single demoired

using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) between the ground truth clean

events within thick, non-centrosymmetric crystals. However, two-dimensional
(2D) materials such as a single monolayer of MoS$_2$ can also violate Friedel's
law, with unexpected contrast between conjugate Bragg peaks. We show
analytically that retaining higher order terms in the power series expansion of
the scattered wavefunction can describe the anomalous contrast between $hkl$

inversion symmetry. These higher-order terms describe multiple scattering paths
starting from the same atom in an atomically thin material. Furthermore, 2D
materials containing heavy elements, such as WS$_2$, always act as strong phase
objects, violating Friedel's law no matter how high the energy of the incident

techniques to provide rapid imaging of polarity, twin domains, in-plane

this result can be written as a power series of Bessel type of certain

In these cases, the CK-extension depends on two initial functions on which two

type but they give rise to an additional structure in terms of Appell
polynomials. This pattern also is present in the structure of the Pizzetti
formula, which describes integration over the supersphere in terms of

  Estimation",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model Stealing (MS) attacks allow an adversary with black-box access to a
Machine Learning model to replicate its functionality, compromising the
confidentiality of the model. Such attacks train a clone model by using the
predictions of the target model for different inputs. The effectiveness of such
attacks relies heavily on the availability of data necessary to query the
target model. Existing attacks either assume partial access to the dataset of
the target model or availability of an alternate dataset with semantic
similarities. This paper proposes MAZE -- a data-free model stealing attack
using zeroth-order gradient estimation. In contrast to prior works, MAZE does
not require any data and instead creates synthetic data using a generative
model. Inspired by recent works in data-free Knowledge Distillation (KD), we
train the generative model using a disagreement objective to produce inputs
that maximize disagreement between the clone and the target model. However,
unlike the white-box setting of KD, where the gradient information is
available, training a generator for model stealing requires performing
black-box optimization, as it involves accessing the target model under attack.
MAZE relies on zeroth-order gradient estimation to perform this optimization
and enables a highly accurate MS attack. Our evaluation with four datasets
shows that MAZE provides a normalized clone accuracy in the range of 0.91x to
0.99x, and outperforms even the recent attacks that rely on partial data (JBDA,
clone accuracy 0.13x to 0.69x) and surrogate data (KnockoffNets, clone accuracy
0.52x to 0.97x). We also study an extension of MAZE in the partial-data setting
and develop MAZE-PD, which generates synthetic data closer to the target
distribution. MAZE-PD further improves the clone accuracy (0.97x to 1.0x) and
reduces the query required for the attack by 2x-24x.

the `concordance' $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology. Even though the model is not
free of fundamental problems, they have not been circumvented by any
alternative dark energy proposal either. Here we stick to the $\Lambda$-term,
but we contend that it can be a `running quantity' in quantum field theory
(QFT) in curved spacetime. A plethora of phenomenological works have shown that
this option can be highly competitive with the $\Lambda$CDM with a rigid
cosmological term. The, so-called, `running vacuum models' (RVM's) are
characterized by the vacuum energy density, $\rho_{vac}$, being a series of
(even) powers of the Hubble parameter and its time derivatives. Such
theoretical form has been motivated by general renormalization group arguments,
which look plausible. Here we dwell further upon the origin of the RVM
structure within QFT in FLRW spacetime. We compute the renormalized
energy-momentum tensor with the help of the adiabatic regularization procedure
and find that it leads essentially to the RVM form. This means that
$\rho_{vac}(H)$ evolves as a constant term plus dynamical components ${\cal
O}(H^2)$ and ${\cal O}(H^4)$, the latter being relevant for the early universe
only. However, the renormalized $\rho_{vac}(H)$ does not carry dangerous terms
proportional to the quartic power of the masses ($\sim m^4$) of the fields,
these terms being a well-known source of exceedingly large contributions. At
present, $\rho_{vac}(H)$ is dominated by the additive constant term accompanied
by a mild dynamical component $\sim \nu H^2$ ($|\nu|\ll1$), which mimics
quintessence.

texture. Since it is regarded as an interference pattern by multiple helical
spin density waves, the texture changes with the relative phases among the
constituent waves. Although the phase degree of freedom is relevant to not only
magnetism but also transport properties, its effect has not been elucidated
thus far. We here theoretically show that a phase shift can occur in the
skyrmion crystals to stabilize tetra-axial vortex crystals with staggered
scalar spin chirality. This leads to spontaneous breaking of the lattice
symmetry, which results in nonreciprocal transport phenomena even without the
relativistic spin-orbit coupling. We show that such a phase shift is driven by
long-range chirality interactions or thermal fluctuations in spin-charge
coupled systems.

programming solutions feature a mixture of dynamics associated unobservable
state components and the local state-feedback policy based on the observable
local information. We further characterize the optimal local-state feedback
policy using linear programming methods. To reduce the computational complexity
of the optimal policy, we propose an approximate algorithm based on virtual

studying the correlations between CMB polarization maps and residual maps (the
difference between the full signal and the CMB map) for the frequency range of
100--217 GHz with both the Q/U and E/B approaches. Although all the CMB maps
reveal almost Gaussian statistical properties for Q/U and E/B domains, we have
detected very significant anomalies for cross-correlations with residuals at
100 GHz at the level of $3.7\sigma$ for the Commander map and $5.2\sigma$ for
NILC, for both the Q and U parameters. Using the NILC--Commander difference,
which does not contain a cosmological signal, we find a sub-dominant
non-Gaussian component in Q skewness and kurtosis at the level of $4.3\sigma$
and $10\sigma$, respectively. For the B-mode we have found a very high level of
cross-correlation (0.63--0.69) between the NILC/Commander maps and the 143 GHz
total signal, which cannot be associated with the cosmological component. These
strong deviations suggest that remnants of foregrounds, systematic effects, and
component separation exist in the 2018 Planck CMB polarization maps in the
BICEP2 sky area, which is far away from the Galactic plane. Our analysis also
demonstrates the preferability of the Q/U domain over E/B for determination of
the statistical properties of the derived CMB signals, due to non-locality of
the transition Q/U $\rightarrow$ E/B.

When reacting with water, silicon carbide converts to silica (stishovite) and
diamond at pressures up to 50 GPa and temperatures up to 2500 K: SiC + 2H$_2$O

planets during their formation or through later delivery, they could be
oxidized and have mineralogy dominated by silicates and diamond in their

greater depths which could be degassed from the interior, causing the
atmospheres of the converted carbon planets to be rich in reducing gases.
Excess water after the reaction can be stored in dense silica polymorphs in the

the converted planets distinct from silicate planets in mass-radius relations

constructions of strongly regular Cayley graphs on abelian groups by extending
the theory of building blocks. The constructions are large generalizations of
Polhill's construction. In particular, we show that for a positive integer $m$

seemingly unrelated topic in pure and applied mathematics, is a class of
stochastic point processes with probability distribution characterized by
sub-determinants of a kernel matrix. Recent work has uncovered deep and
fruitful connections between DPPs and RandNLA which lead to new guarantees and
improved algorithms that are of interest to both areas. We provide an overview
of this exciting new line of research, including brief introductions to RandNLA
and DPPs, as well as applications of DPPs to classical linear algebra tasks
such as least squares regression, low-rank approximation and the Nystr\""om

understanding of these algorithms; a DPP is, in some sense, an optimal
randomized algorithm for the Nystr\""om method; and a RandNLA technique called
leverage score sampling can be derived as the marginal distribution of a DPP.
We also discuss recent algorithmic developments, illustrating that, while not

be modeled as functional optimization problems over a graph. In this
formulation, all vertices and arcs of the graph are functionals; i.e., a
mapping from a space of measurable functions to the field of real numbers. Many
variants of the TSP, such as those with neighborhoods, with forbidden
neighborhoods, with time-windows and with profits, can all be framed under this
construct. In sharp contrast to their discrete-optimization counterparts, the
modeling constructs presented in this paper represent a fundamentally new
domain of analysis and computation for TSPs and their variants. Beyond its
apparent mathematical unification of a class of problems in graph theory, the
main advantage of the new approach is that it facilitates the modeling of
certain application-specific problems in their home space of measurable
functions. Consequently, certain elements of economic system theory such as
dynamical models and continuous-time cost/profit functionals can be directly
incorporated in the new optimization problem formulation. Furthermore, subtour
elimination constraints, prevalent in discrete optimization formulations, are
naturally enforced through continuity requirements. The price for the new
modeling framework is nonsmooth functionals. Although a number of theoretical
issues remain open in the proposed mathematical framework, we demonstrate the
computational viability of the new modeling constructs over a sample set of
problems to illustrate the rapid production of end-to-end TSP solutions to
extensively-constrained practical problems.

acquiring true labels is costly or time-consuming. We prove that AMKL achieves
an optimal sublinear regret, implying that the proposed selection criterion
indeed avoids unuseful label-requests. Furthermore, we propose AMKL with an
adaptive kernel selection (AMKL-AKS) in which irrelevant kernels can be
excluded from a kernel dictionary 'on the fly'. This approach can improve the
efficiency of active learning as well as the accuracy of a function
approximation. Via numerical tests with various real datasets, it is
demonstrated that AMKL-AKS yields a similar or better performance than the
best-known OMKL, with a smaller number of labeled data.

registration with correspondences. A point cloud is considered as a rigid body
consisting of particles. The problem of registering two point clouds is
formulated as a dynamical system, where the dynamic model point cloud
translates and rotates in a viscous environment towards the static scene point
cloud, under forces and torques induced by virtual springs placed between each
pair of corresponding points. We first show that the potential energy of the
system recovers the objective function of the maximum likelihood estimation. We
then adopt Lyapunov analysis, particularly the invariant set theorem, to
analyze the rigid body dynamics and show that the system globally
asymptotically tends towards the set of equilibrium points, where the globally
optimal registration solution lies in. We conjecture that, besides the globally
optimal equilibrium point, the system has either three or infinite ""spurious""
equilibrium points, and these spurious equilibria are all locally unstable. The
case of three spurious equilibria corresponds to generic shape of the point
cloud, while the case of infinite spurious equilibria happens when the point
cloud exhibits symmetry. Therefore, simulating the dynamics with random
perturbations guarantees to obtain the globally optimal registration solution.
Numerical experiments support our analysis and conjecture.

Weyl semimetals (WSMs) by the Kondo effect. We find that in a magnetic and
electric field driven WSM, the locations of the Kondo peaks can be modulated by
the chiral chemical potential, which is proportional to $\mathbf{E}\cdot
\mathbf{B}$. The Kondo peaks come from spin fluctuations within the impurities,
which apart from the temperature, relate closely to the host's Fermi level. In
WSMs, the chiral-anomaly-induced chirality population imbalance will shift the
local Fermi levels of the paired Weyl valleys toward opposite directions in
energy, and then affects the Kondo effect. Consequently, the Kondo effect can
be tunable by an external electric field via the chiral chemical potential.
This is unique to the chiral anomaly. Base on this, we argue that the
electrically tunable Kondo effect can serve as a direct measurement of the
chiral anomaly in WSMs. The Kondo peaks are robust against the disorder effect
and therefore, the signal of the chiral anomaly survives for a relatively weak
magnetic field.

their own. However, these tasks can be complex, containing both coarse reaching
motions and fine-grained manipulation. For example, when eating, not only does
one need to move to the correct food item, but they must also precisely
manipulate the food in different ways (e.g., cutting, stabbing, scooping).
Shared autonomy methods make robot teleoperation safer and more precise by
arbitrating user inputs with robot controls. However, these works have focused
mainly on the high-level task of reaching a goal from a discrete set, while
largely ignoring manipulation of objects at that goal. Meanwhile,
dimensionality reduction techniques for teleoperation map useful
high-dimensional robot actions into an intuitive low-dimensional controller,
but it is unclear if these methods can achieve the requisite precision for
tasks like eating. Our insight is that---by combining intuitive embeddings from
learned latent actions with robotic assistance from shared autonomy---we can
enable precise assistive manipulation. In this work, we adopt learned latent
actions for shared autonomy by proposing a new model structure that changes the
meaning of the human's input based on the robot's confidence of the goal. We
show convergence bounds on the robot's distance to the most likely goal, and
develop a training procedure to learn a controller that is able to move between

placed on the delay-Doppler plane such that the overall overloading factor of
the OTFS-SCMA system is equal to that of the underlying basic SCMA system. The
receiver in downlink performs the detection in two sequential phases: first,
the conventional OTFS detection using the method of linear minimum mean square

a single-phase detector based on message-passing algorithm (MPA) to detect the

L2-norm of the coefficients in linear regression. One of the challenges of
using RR is the need to set a hyperparameter ($\alpha$) that controls the
amount of regularization. Cross-validation is typically used to select the best
$\alpha$ from a set of candidates. However, efficient and appropriate selection
of $\alpha$ can be challenging, particularly where large amounts of data are
analyzed. Because the selected $\alpha$ depends on the scale of the data and

reparameterize RR in terms of the ratio $\gamma$ between the L2-norms of the

proof-of-concept, we focus on the UK where previously identified deformation is
associated with coal-mining, ground water withdrawal, landslides and

make this a challenging application for deep learning networks, which involve
calculations of the spatial convolution between images. Moreover, insufficient
ground truth data exists to construct a balanced training data set, and the
deformation signals are slower and more localised than in previous
applications. We propose three enhancement methods to tackle these problems: i)
spatial interpolation with modified matrix completion, ii) a synthetic training

discontinuous. To ameliorate these issues in a computationally efficient way,
we use the method of distributions, which here takes the form of a
deterministic equation for spatiotemporal evolution of the cumulative
distribution function (CDF) of the random system state, as a means of forward
uncertainty propagation. Uncertainty reduction is achieved by recasting the
standard loss function, i.e., discrepancy between observations and model
predictions, in distributional terms. This step exploits the equivalence
between minimization of the square error discrepancy and the Kullback-Leibler

enforcing fulfillment of the CDF equation. Minimization is performed

in an iterative and incremental learning manner. In each step, the deep
supervision mechanism guides the learning process of hidden layers and selects

higher-level neural representations to account for sensory input. Although
originating in the neuroscience community, there are also efforts in the
machine learning community to study these models. This paper reviews some of
the more well known models. Our review analyzes module connectivity and
patterns of information transfer, seeking to find general principles used
across the models. We also survey some recent attempts to cast these models
within a deep learning framework. A defining feature of Bayesian predictive
coding is that it uses top-down, reconstructive mechanisms to predict incoming
sensory inputs or their lower-level representations. Discrepancies between the
predicted and the actual inputs, known as prediction errors, then give rise to
future learning that refines and improves the predictive accuracy of learned
higher-level representations. Predictive coding models intended to describe
computations in the neocortex emerged prior to the development of deep learning
and used a communication structure between modules that we name the Rao-Ballard
protocol. This protocol was derived from a Bayesian generative model with some
rather strong statistical assumptions. The RB protocol provides a rubric to
assess the fidelity of deep learning models that claim to implement predictive
coding.

quickly adapt to new goals while avoiding situations that might cause damage to
themselves or their environments. One way agents learn is through exploration
mechanisms, which are needed to discover new policies. However, in deep
reinforcement learning, exploration is normally done by injecting noise in the
action space. While performing well in many domains, this setup has the
inherent risk that the noisy actions performed by the agent lead to unsafe
states in the environment. Here we introduce a novel approach called
Meta-Learned Instinctual Networks (MLIN) that allows agents to safely learn
during their lifetime while avoiding potentially hazardous states. At the core
of the approach is a plastic network trained through reinforcement learning and
an evolved ""instinctual"" network, which does not change during the agent's
lifetime but can modulate the noisy output of the plastic network. We test our
idea on a simple 2D navigation task with no-go zones, in which the agent has to
learn to approach new targets during deployment. MLIN outperforms standard
meta-trained networks and allows agents to learn to navigate to new targets
without colliding with any of the no-go zones. These results suggest that
meta-learning augmented with an instinctual network is a promising new approach
for safe AI, which may enable progress in this area on a variety of different

the crucial question of its fundamental electronic and magnetic processes. The
unexplained basic feature that we address is that, for $x$=0 and as opposed to
strongly antiferromagnetic (AFM) CaCuO$_2$, NdNiO$_2$ with the same structure
and formal $d^9$ configuration does not undergo AFM order. We study this issue
not in the conventional manner, as energetically unfavored or as frustrated
magnetic order, but as an instability of the AFM phase itself. We are able to
obtain the static AFM ordered state, but find that a flat-band,
one-dimensional-like van Hove singularity (vHs) is pinned to the Fermi level.
This situation is unusual in a non-half-filled, effectively two-band system.
The vHs makes the AFM phase unstable to spin-density disproportionation,
breathing and half-breathing lattice distortions, and (innate or parasitic)
charge-density disproportionation. These flat-band instabilities, distant
relatives of single band cuprate models, thereby inhibit but do not eliminate
incipient AFM tendencies at low temperature. The primary feature is that a pair
of active bands ($d_{x^2-y^2}$, $d_{z^2})$ eliminate half-filled physics and,
due to instabilities, preclude the AFM phase seen in CaCuO$_2$. This strongly
AFM correlated, conducting spin-liquid phase with strong participation of the
Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital, forms the platform for superconductivity in NdNiO$_2$.

conservation laws reproduce a discrete entropy inequality by combining entropy
conservative finite volume fluxes with summation-by-parts (SBP) discretization
matrices. In the DG context, on tensor product (quadrilateral and hexahedral)
elements, SBP matrices are typically constructed by collocating at Lobatto
quadrature points. Recent work has extended the construction of entropy-stable
DG schemes to collocation at more accurate Gauss quadrature points.
  In this work, we extend entropy-stable Gauss collocation schemes to
non-conforming meshes. Entropy-stable DG schemes require computing entropy
conservative numerical fluxes between volume and surface quadrature nodes. On
conforming tensor product meshes where volume and surface nodes are aligned,
flux evaluations are required only between ""lines"" of nodes. However, on
non-conforming meshes, volume and surface nodes are no longer aligned,
resulting in a larger number of flux evaluations. We reduce this expense by
introducing an entropy-stable mortar-based treatment of non-conforming
interfaces via a face-local correction term, and provide necessary conditions
for high-order accuracy. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions
confirm the stability and accuracy of this approach.

ECDFs at $N$ evaluation points requires a quadratic $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$
operations, which is prohibitive for large-scale problems. Two fast and exact

antiparallel-coupled Mn sites using x-ray magnetic circular and linear
dichroism (XMCD/XMLD) and a first-principles calculation. We found that the
contribution of orbital magnetic moments in PMA is small from XMCD and that the
finite quadrupole-like orbital distortion through spin-flipped electron hopping
is dominant from XMLD and theoretical calculations. These findings suggest that
the spin-flipped orbital quadrupole formations originate from the PMA in
Mn$_{3-{\delta}}$Ga and bring the paradigm shift in the researches of PMA

is composed by bosons with masses ranging from $10^{-24}\, \mathrm{eV} < m <
\mathrm{eV}$. These models have been receiving a lot of attention in the past
few years given their interesting property of forming a Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) or a superfluid on galactic scales. BEC and superfluidity are
one of the most striking quantum mechanical phenomena manifest on macroscopic
scales, and upon condensation, the particles behave as a single coherent state,
described by the wavefunction of the condensate. The idea is that condensation
takes place inside galaxies while outside DM behaves like a normal cold
particle DM. This wave nature of DM on galactic scales that arise upon
condensation can address some of the curiosities of the behaviour of DM on
small scales while maintaining the successes of LCDM on large scales. There are
many models in the literature that describe a DM component that condenses in
galaxies. In this review, we are going to describe those models and classify
them according to the different ways they achieve condensation. For that, we
review the phenomena of BEC and superfluidity, and apply this knowledge to the
DM in order to explain their construction and phenomenology. We describe the
small scale challenges these models aim to solve and how ULDM alleviates them.
These models present a rich phenomenology that is manifest in different
astrophysical consequences. We review here the astrophysical and cosmological
tests used to constrain those models, together with new and future observations
that promise to test these models in different regimes. We finalize by showing
some predictions that are a consequence of the wave nature of this component,
like vortices and interference, that could represent a smoking gun in the
search of these rich and interesting alternative class of DM. (Abridged)

considered in the coincidence limit $p \to P$, they generically exhibit a
dependence on the geodesic along which the varying point $p$ approached $P$,
sort of memory of how $p$ went to $P$. This fact demands a deeper understanding
of the meaning of the quantity $R_{(q)}$, for this latter tells about curvature
of spacetime as a whole at $P$ and would not be supposed to depend on whichever
vector we might happen to consider at $P$. Here, we try to search for a
framework in which these two apparently conflicting aspects might be
consistently reconciled. We find a tentative sense in which this could be
achieved by endowing spacetime of a specific operational meaning. This comes,
however, at the price (or with the benefit) of having a spacetime no longer
arbitrary but, in a specific sense, constrained. The constraint turns out to be
in the form of a relation between spacetime geometry in the large scale (as
compared to $L_0$) and the matter content, namely as sort of field equations.
This comes thanks to something which happens to coincide with the expression of
balance of (matter and spacetime) exchanged heats, i.e. the thermodynamic
variational principle from which the field equations have been reported to be
derivable. This establishes a link between (this specific, operational
understanding of) the meaning of the limit expression of $R_{(q)}$ on one side
and the (large-scale) field equations on the other, this way reconnecting (once
more) the latter to a quantum feature.

spectrum of any astrophysical black hole is determined solely by its mass and
spin. The countably infinite number of quasinormal modes of a Kerr black hole
are thus related to each other and any deviations from these relations provide
a strong hint for physics beyond the general theory of relativity. To test the
no-hair theorem using ringdown signals, it is necessary to detect at least two
quasinormal modes. In particular, one can detect the fundamental mode along
with a subdominant overtone or with another angular mode, depending on the mass
ratio and the spins of the progenitor binary. Also in the light of the recent
discovery of GW190412, studying how the mass ratio affects the prospect of
black hole spectroscopy using overtones or angular modes is pertinent, and this
is the major focus of our study. First, we provide ready-to-use fits for the
amplitudes and phases of both the angular modes and overtones as a function of
mass ratio $q\in[0,10]$. Using these fits we estimate the minimum
signal-to-noise ratio for detectability, resolvability, and measurability of
subdominant modes/tones. We find that performing black-hole spectroscopy with
angular modes is preferable when the binary mass ratio is larger than $q\approx
1.2$ (provided that the source is not located at a particularly disfavoured
inclination angle). For nonspinning, equal-mass binary black holes, the
overtones seem to be the only viable option to perform a spectroscopy test of
the no-hair theorem. However this would require a large ringdown
signal-to-noise ratio ($\approx 100$ for a $5\%$ accuracy test with two
overtones) and the inclusion of more than one overtone to reduce modelling
errors, making black-hole spectroscopy with overtones impractical in the near
future.

Borwein and Lewis provided broad and easy-to-verify conditions that guarantee
strong duality for such problems. Their approach is to construct a function in
the quasi-relative interior of the relevant infinite-dimensional set, which
assures the existence of a point in the core of the relevant finite-dimensional
set. We revisit this problem, and provide an alternative proof by directly
appealing to the definition of the core, rather than by relying on any
properties of the quasi-relative interior. Our approach admits a minor
relaxation of the linear independence requirements in Borwein and Lewis'
framework, which allows us to work with certain piecewise-defined moment
functions precluded by their conditions. We provide such a computed example
that illustrates how this relaxation may be used to tame observed Gibbs
phenomenon when the underlying data is discontinuous. The relaxation
illustrates the understanding we may gain by tackling partially-finite problems
from both the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional sides. The comparison

less controllable. In this paper, we present CARL, a quadruped agent that can
be controlled with high-level directives and react naturally to dynamic
environments. Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation
clips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls,
such as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the
original animations. Further fine-tuning through the deep reinforcement
learning enables the agent to recover from unseen external perturbations while
producing smooth transitions. It then becomes straightforward to create
autonomous agents in dynamic environments by adding navigation modules over the
entire process. We evaluate our approach by measuring the agent's ability to
follow user control and provide a visual analysis of the generated motion to
show its effectiveness.

the mean-field theory. In the absence of the SOC and magnetic field, the ground
state changes from the nonmagnetic band-insulating state to the EI state by
increasing the Hund coupling. In an applied magnetic field, the magnetic moment
appears in the EI state, which is continuously connected to the forced
ferromagnetic state. On the other hand, in the presence of the SOC, they are
separated by a phase boundary. We find that the magnetic susceptibility is
strongly enhanced in the EI phase near the boundary with a small SOC. This
peculiar behavior is attributed to the low-energy fluctuation of the spin
nematicity inherent in the high-spin local state stabilized by the Hund
coupling. The present study not only reveals the impact of the SOC for the EI
state but also sheds light on the role of quantum fluctuations of the spin
nematicity for the EI state.

propose a data driven solution, in which the intersection usage sequence is
obtained through a data-driven online classification and the trajectories are
computed sequentially. This approach also allows for the incorporation of macro
information such as traffic arrival rates into the solution. The overall
algorithm is provably safe and can be implemented in a distributed manner.
Finally, we compare the proposed algorithm against traditional methods of

features arising from the inner regions of the disc can be significantly
modified by the relativistic effects near the black hole. We investigate the
relationship between the relativistic reflection fraction $R_f$, defined as the
ratio of the coronal intensity that illuminates the accretion disc to the
coronal intensity observed directly, and the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$
of a NuSTAR sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray spectra are modelled using
relxill code which helps to directly obtain the reflection fraction of a
relativistically smeared reflection component. The parameter $R_f$ depends on
the amount of Comptonised X-ray emission intercepted by the inner accretion
disc. We found a positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and $R_f$ in our sample.
Seed photons from a larger area of an accretion disc entering the corona will
result in increased cooling of the coronal plasma, giving rise to steeper X-ray

higher reflection fraction. Thus, the observed $R_f-\Gamma$ relation is most

distinguish different objects. It has been studied from different contexts by
employing mathematical, psychological, and fuzzy approaches. Image
steganography is the art of hiding secret data into an image in such a way that
it cannot be detected by an intruder. In image steganography, hiding secret
data in the plain or non-edge regions of the image is significant due to the
high similarity and redundancy of the pixels in their neighborhood. However,
the similarity measure of the neighboring pixels, i.e., their proximity in
color space, is perceptual rather than mathematical. This paper proposes an
interval type 2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) to determine the similarity
between the neighboring pixels by involving an instinctive human perception
through a rule-based approach. The pixels of the image having high similarity
values, calculated using the proposed IT2 FLS similarity measure, are selected
for embedding via the least significant bit (LSB) method. We term the proposed
procedure of steganography as IT2 FLS LSB method. Moreover, we have developed
two more methods, namely, type 1 fuzzy logic system based least significant
bits (T1FLS LSB) and Euclidean distance based similarity measures for least
significant bit (SM LSB) steganographic methods. Experimental simulations were
conducted for a collection of images and quality index metrics, such as PSNR,
UQI, and SSIM are used. All the three steganographic methods are applied on
datasets and the quality metrics are calculated. The obtained stego images and
results are shown and thoroughly compared to determine the efficacy of the IT2
FLS LSB method. Finally, we have done a comparative analysis of the proposed
approach with the existing well-known steganographic methods to show the
effectiveness of our proposed steganographic method.

large-scale characteristics of the corona, using more realistic coronal heating
prescription is necessary. We analyse coronal rain formation and evolution in a
3-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation spanning from convection
zone to corona which is self-consistently heated by magnetic field braiding as
a result of convective motions. We investigate the spatial and temporal
evolution of energy dissipation along coronal loops which become thermally
unstable. Ohmic dissipation in the model leads to the heating events capable of
inducing sufficient chromospheric evaporation into the loop to trigger thermal
instability and condensation formation. The cooling of the thermally unstable
plasma occurs on timescales comparable to the duration of the individual
impulsive heating events. The impulsive heating has sufficient duration to
trigger thermal instability in the loop but does not last long enough to lead
to coronal rain limit cycles. We show that condensations can either survive and
fall into the chromosphere or be destroyed by strong bursts of Joule heating
associated with a magnetic reconnection events. In addition, we find that
condensations can also form along open magnetic field lines.

we propose a mapping to translate an IDL document into a constraint

vulnerabilities arise when a web application includes the user input in the web

detected fairly reliably with blackbox scanners, which inject malicious payload
into sensitive parts of HTTP requests and look for the reflected values in the

  Contemporary blackbox scanners are not effective against stored XSS
vulnerabilities, where the malicious payload in an HTTP response originates
from the database storage of the web application, rather than from the
associated HTTP request. Similarly, many blackbox scanners do not
systematically handle context-sensitive XSS vulnerabilities, where the user

  paper Bitvector-aware Query Optimization for Decision Support Queries",,,"MSR-TR-2020-8","cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bitvector filtering is an important query processing technique that can
significantly reduce the cost of execution, especially for complex decision
support queries with multiple joins. Despite its wide application, however, its
implication to query optimization is not well understood.
  In this work, we study how bitvector filters impact query optimization. We
show that incorporating bitvector filters into query optimization
straightforwardly can increase the plan space complexity by an exponential
factor in the number of relations in the query. We analyze the plans with
bitvector filters for star and snowflake queries in the plan space of right
deep trees without cross products. Surprisingly, with some simplifying
assumptions, we prove that, the plan of the minimal cost with bitvector filters
can be found from a linear number of plans in the number of relations in the
query. This greatly reduces the plan space complexity for such queries from
exponential to linear.
  Motivated by our analysis, we propose an algorithm that accounts for the
impact of bitvector filters in query optimization. Our algorithm optimizes the
join order for an arbitrary decision support query by choosing from a linear
number of candidate plans in the number of relations in the query. We implement
our algorithm in Microsoft SQL Server as a transformation rule. Our evaluation
on both industry standard benchmarks and customer workload shows that, compared
with the original Microsoft SQL Server, our technique reduces the total CPU
execution time by 22%-64% for the workloads, with up to two orders of magnitude
reduction in CPU execution time for individual queries.

ensemble-based design to improve the stability and accuracy of speaker
verification systems. The proposed method segments an input utterance into
several short utterances and then aggregates the segment embeddings extracted
from the segmented inputs to compose a speaker embedding. Then, this method
simultaneously trains the segment embeddings and the aggregated speaker
embedding. In addition, we also modified the teacher-student learning method

captured by mobile phones. Recognizing low-resolution text images is
challenging because they lose detailed content information, leading to poor
recognition accuracy. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution
(SR) techniques as pre-processing. However, previous single image
super-resolution (SISR) methods are trained on synthetic low-resolution images
(e.g.Bicubic down-sampling), which is simple and not suitable for real
low-resolution text recognition. To this end, we pro-pose a real scene text SR
dataset, termed TextZoom. It contains paired real low-resolution and
high-resolution images which are captured by cameras with different focal
length in the wild. It is more authentic and challenging than synthetic data,
as shown in Fig. 1. We argue improv-ing the recognition accuracy is the
ultimate goal for Scene Text SR. In this purpose, a new Text Super-Resolution
Network termed TSRN, with three novel modules is developed. (1) A sequential
residual block is proposed to extract the sequential information of the text
images. (2) A boundary-aware loss is designed to sharpen the character
boundaries. (3) A central alignment module is proposed to relieve the
misalignment problem in TextZoom. Extensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate
that our TSRN largely improves the recognition accuracy by over 13%of CRNN, and
by nearly 9.0% of ASTER and MORAN compared to synthetic SR data. Furthermore,
our TSRN clearly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art SR methods in boosting the
recognition accuracy of LR images in TextZoom. For example, it outperforms
LapSRN by over 5% and 8%on the recognition accuracy of ASTER and CRNN. Our

we first characterize the global attractor via an infinite dimensional linear
programming problem (LP) in the space of Borel measures. The dual to this LP is
in the space of continuous functions and its feasible solutions provide
guaranteed outer approximations to the global attractor. For systems with
polynomial dynamics, a hierarchy of finite-dimensional sum-of-squares
tightenings of the dual LP provides a sequence of outer approximations to the
global attractor with guaranteed convergence in the sense of volume discrepancy
tending to zero. The method is very simple to use and based purely on convex

the SDO and STEREO satellites. We studied coronal dimmings that were observed
above the limb by STEREO/EUVI and compared their properties with the mass and
speed of the associated CMEs. The unique position of satellites allowed us to
compare our findings with the results from Dissauer et al. (2018b, 2019), who
studied the same events observed against the solar disk by SDO/AIA. Such
statistics is done for the first time and confirms the relation of coronal
dimmings and CME parameters for the off-limb viewpoint. The observations of
dimming regions from different lines-of-sight reveal a similar decrease in the
total EUV intensity ($c=0.60\pm0.14$). We find that the (projected) dimming
areas are typically larger for off-limb observations (mean value of
$1.24\pm1.23\times10^{11}$ km$^2$ against $3.51\pm0.71\times10^{10}$ km$^2$ for
on-disk), with a correlation of $c=0.63\pm0.10$. This systematic difference can
be explained by the (weaker) contributions to the dimming regions higher up in
the corona, that cannot be detected in the on-disk observations. The off-limb
dimming areas and brightnesses show very strong correlations with the CME mass
($c=0.82\pm0.06$ and $c=0.75\pm0.08$), whereas the dimming area and brightness
change rate correlate with the CME speed ($c\sim0.6$). Our findings suggest
that coronal dimmings have the potential to provide early estimates of mass and
speed of Earth-directed CMEs, relevant for space weather forecasts, for
satellite locations both at L1 and L5.

a locally adaptive interpretable regression (LoAIR). In LoAIR, a metamodel

results on public benchmark datasets show that our model not only achieves
comparable or better predictive performance than the other state-of-the-art

target variables such as a parabolic relationship between CO2 emissions and
Gross National Product (GNP). Therefore, LoAIR is a step towards bridging the
gap between econometrics, statistics, and machine learning by improving the
predictive ability of linear regression without depreciating its
interpretability.

as Cd$_3$As$_2$ and Na$_3$Bi, contain electrons that obey a linear
momentum-energy dispersion with different Fermi velocities along the three
orthogonal momentum dimensions. Despite being extensively studied in recent
years, the inherent \emph{Fermi velocity anisotropy} has often been neglected
in the theoretical and numerical studies of 3D DSMs. Although this omission
does not qualitatively alter the physics of light-driven massless
quasiparticles in 3D DSMs, it does \emph{quantitatively} change the optical
coefficients which can lead to nontrivial implications in terms of
nanophotonics and plasmonics applications. Here we study the linear optical
response of 3D DSMs for general Fermi velocity values along each direction.
Although the signature conductivity-frequency scaling, $\sigma(\omega) \propto
\omega$, of 3D Dirac fermion is well-protected from Fermi velocity anisotropy,
the linear optical response exhibits strong linear dichroism as captured by the
\emph{universal} extinction ratio scaling law, $\Lambda_{ij} = (v_i/v_j)^2$
(where $i\neq j$ denotes the three spatial coordinates $x,y,z$, and $v_i$ is
the $i$-direction Fermi velocity), which is independent of frequency,
temperature, doping, and carrier scattering lifetime. For Cd$_3$As$_2$ and
Na$_3$Bi$_3$, an exceptionally strong extinction ratio larger than 15 and
covering broad terahertz window is revealed. Our findings shed new light on the
role of Fermi velocity anisotropy in the optical response of Dirac semimetals

this work finds that orthogonal random codes can be applied directly. In the
high power regime, a more sophisticated effort is needed. This work shows that
power-profile optimization by means of linear programming as pioneered by Caire

of orthogonal random coding and iterative soft decoding even outperforms the
existence bounds of Zadik et al. [2] in the low power regime and is very close

the approach of power optimization by linear programming proposed for the high
power regime is found to benefit from power imbalances due to fading which
makes is even more attractive for typical mobile radio channels.

excitations in a nematic superconductor using Ginzburg-Landau theory. An
isolated excitation at low field is shown to be either a distorted phase vortex
or a tightly-bounded pair of half quantum vortices. Close to upper critical
field $H_{c2}$, the vortex lattice is shown to be always hexagonal in the
extreme type-II limit. Due to the different symmetries of the vortex lattice
states, at least two phase transitions must take place when the external field
is lowered from $H_{c2}$.

to score necrosis in roots based on a qualitative score which is quite
subjective. In this paper we present an approach to automate root necrosis
scoring using deep convolutional neural networks with semantic segmentation.
Our experiments show that the UNet model performs this task with high accuracy
achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.90 on the test set. This
method provides a means to use a quantitative measure for necrosis scoring on
root cross-sections. This is done by segmentation and classifying the

a wide orbit (Pb~1200 days, semi-major axis ~2 au) and a Neptune-mass planet
with a period Pc ~76 days. We searched for additional low-mass companions in
the inner region of the system. We compared the radial velocities (RV) and the
activity indices derived from the HARPS-N time series to measure the rotation
period of the star and used a Gaussian process regression to describe the
behaviour of the stellar activity. We exploited this information in a combined
model of planetary and stellar activity signals in an RV time-series composed
of almost 700 high-precision RVs, both from HARPS-N and literature data. We
performed a dynamical analysis to evaluate the stability of the system and the
allowed regions for additional potential companions. Thanks to the high
sensitivity of the HARPS-N dataset, we detect an additional inner super-Earth
with an RV semi-amplitude of 1.3+/-0.2 m/s, a minimum mass of ~4+/-1 M_E and a
period of 12.458+/-0.003 days. We disentangle the planetary signal from
activity and measure a stellar rotation period of ~42 days. The dynamical
analysis shows the long term stability of the orbits of the three-planet system
and allows us to identify the permitted regions for additional planets in the
semi-major axis ranges 0.18-0.21 au and 0.6-1.4 au. The latter partially
includes the habitable zone of the system. We did not detect any planet in
these regions, down to minimum detectable masses of 5 and 18 M_E, respectively.
A larger region of allowed planets is expected beyond the orbit of planet b,

One of the most important parts is to improve the network lifetime in the
wireless sensor network. Since the sensor nodes are generally powered by
batteries, the most important issue to consider in these types of networks is
to reduce the power consumption of the nodes in such a way as to increase the

using topology control, the threshold for the remaining energy in nodes, and
two of the meta-algorithms include SA (Simulated annealing) and VNS (Variable

Moreover, using a low-cost spanning tree, an appropriate connectivity control
among nodes is created in the network in order to increase the network

emergence event occurring at mesogranular scale (up to 12 Mm$^{2}$ area). Using
a modified version of the SIR code for inverting the IMaX spectropolarimetric

photospheric feature. In particular, we find evidence of highly inclined
emerging fields in the structure, carrying a magnetic flux content up to $4

of flux emergence, compared with a very quiet region of the Sun, indicates that
the additional pressure carried by the emerging flux increases by about 5% the
total pressure and appears to allow the granulation to be modified, as
predicted by numerical simulations. The overall characteristics suggest that a
multi-polar structure emerges into the photosphere, resembling an almost
horizontal flux sheet. This seems to be associated with exploding granules.
Finally, we discuss the origin of such flux emergence events.

the same constraint equation, written in terms of conjugate variables (loosely
the expansion factor and the Hubble parameter). A number of subtleties in the
mapping, related to the contour of integration of the connection, shed light on
the issue of boundary conditions in quantum cosmology. If we insist on a {\it

the CS state, with the Hubble parameter covering the whole real line. For the V

positive real line (which makes sense, since the state only admits outgoing

the state is not admissible if reality conditions are imposed upon the

terms to the Hamiltonian constraint, are examined and found to be more
palatable. In the dual picture the HH state predicts a uniform distribution for
the Hubble parameter over the whole real line; the modified V state a uniform

oracle, which reveals the processing time of a given job. Each test occupies a

algorithm needs to decide beforehand which jobs to test, and which jobs to

joint locations are not discrete and predefined, but continuously movable. The
underlying coupling equations allow for connecting dissimilar meshes and avoid
the need for remeshing when joint locations change. The presented method models
the force transfer at a joint location not only by using single spring elements
but accounts for the size and type of the joints. When considering riveted or
bolted joints, the local part geometry at the joint location consists of holes
that are surrounded by material. For spot welds, the joint locations are filled
with material and may be smaller than for bolts. The presented method
incorporates these material and clearance zones into the simultaneously running
topology optimization of the parts. Furthermore, failure of joints may be taken
into account at the optimization stage, yielding assemblies connected in a

great importance to conduct early diagnosis of COVID-19 and predict the time
that patients might convert to the severe stage, for designing effective
treatment plan and reducing the clinicians' workloads. In this study, we
propose a joint classification and regression method to determine whether the
patient would develop severe symptoms in the later time, and if yes, predict
the possible conversion time that the patient would spend to convert to the
severe stage. To do this, the proposed method takes into account 1) the weight
for each sample to reduce the outliers' influence and explore the problem of
imbalance classification, and 2) the weight for each feature via a sparsity
regularization term to remove the redundant features of high-dimensional data
and learn the shared information across the classification task and the
regression task. To our knowledge, this study is the first work to predict the
disease progression and the conversion time, which could help clinicians to
deal with the potential severe cases in time or even save the patients' lives.
Experimental analysis was conducted on a real data set from two hospitals with
422 chest computed tomography (CT) scans, where 52 cases were converted to
severe on average 5.64 days and 34 cases were severe at admission. Results show
that our method achieves the best classification (e.g., 85.91% of accuracy) and
regression (e.g., 0.462 of the correlation coefficient) performance, compared
to all comparison methods. Moreover, our proposed method yields 76.97% of
accuracy for predicting the severe cases, 0.524 of the correlation coefficient,

distribution network protections. The fault current of a HIF is much lower than
that of a normal load, and fault feature is significantly affected by fault
scenarios. A detection and feeder identification algorithm for HIFs is proposed
in this paper, based on the high-resolution and synchronous waveform data. In
the algorithm, an interval slope is defined to describe the waveform
distortions, which guarantees a uniform feature description under various HIF
nonlinearities and noise interferences. For three typical types of network
neutrals, i.e.,isolated neutral, resonant neutral, and low-resistor-earthed
neutral, differences of the distorted components between the zero-sequence
currents of healthy and faulty feeders are mathematically deduced,
respectively. As a result, the proposed criterion, which is based on the
distortion relationships between zero-sequence currents of feeders and the
zero-sequence voltage at the substation, is theoretically supported. 28 HIFs
grounded to various materials are tested in a 10kV distribution networkwith
three neutral types, and are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the

solution in conformally invariant gravity, uplifted to (3+1)-dimensional
spacetime. As matter content we use a scalar-gauge field. The metric is written
as $g_{\mu\nu}=\omega^2\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$, where the {\it dilaton field}
$\omega$ contains all the scale dependencies and where $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$
represents the ""un-physical"" spacetime. A numerical solution is presented and
shows how the dilaton can be treated on equal footing with the scalar field.
The location of the apparent horizon and ergo-surface depends critically on the
parameters and initial values of the model. It is not a hard task to find
suitable initial parameters in order to obtain a regular and {\it singular
free} $g_{\mu\nu}$ out of a BTZ-type solution for $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$. In the
vacuum situation, an {\it exact} time-dependent solution in the
Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates is found, which is valid for the
(2+1)-dimensional BTZ spacetime as well as for the uplifted (3+1)-dimensional
BTZ spacetime. While $\tilde g_{\mu\nu}$ resembles the standard BTZ solution
with its horizons, $g_{\mu\nu}$ is {\it flat}. The dilaton field becomes an
infinitesimal renormalizable quantum field, which switches on and off Hawking
radiation. This solution can be used to investigate the small distance scale of
the model and the black hole complementarity issues. It can also be used to
describe the problem how to map the quantum states of the outgoing radiation as
seen by a distant observer and the ingoing by a local observer in a one-to-one
way. The two observers will use a different conformal gauge. A possible
connection is made with the antipodal identification and unitarity issues.

inverse gamma hyperprior with a shape parameter close to zero and a scale
parameter not necessary close to zero. This hyperprior is associated with the
concept of a weakly informative prior. The effect of this hyperprior is
investigated through regression to non-homogeneous data. Because it is
difficult to capture the structure of such data with a single kernel function,
we apply the multiple kernel method, in which multiple kernel functions with
different widths are arranged for input data. We confirm that the degrees of
freedom in a model is controlled by adjusting the scale parameter and keeping
the shape parameter close to zero. A candidate for selecting the scale
parameter is the predictive information criterion. However the estimated model
using this criterion seems to cause over-fitting. This is because the multiple
kernel method makes the model a situation where the dimension of the model is
larger than the data size. To select an appropriate scale parameter even in
such a situation, we also propose an extended prediction information criterion.
It is confirmed that a multiple kernel relevance vector regression model with
good predictive accuracy can be obtained by selecting the scale parameter
minimizing extended prediction information criterion.

aspiration which takes into account imitation of successful strategies for
dissatisfied individuals. This helps cooperative members to resist. Individuals
compare their success to their desired satisfaction level before making a
decision to update their strategies. This mechanism helps individuals with a
minimum of self-satisfaction to maintain their strategies. If an individual is
dissatisfied, it will learn from others by choosing successful strategies. We
derive an exact expression of the fixation probability in well-mixed

technologies that will be required for a gravitational wave observatory in
space. Magnetically driven forces play a key role in the instrument sensitivity
in the low-frequency regime (mHz and below), the measurement band of interest
for a space-based observatory. The magnetic field can couple to the magnetic
susceptibility and remanent magnetic moment from the test masses and disturb
them from their geodesic movement. LISA Pathfinder carried on-board a dedicated
magnetic measurement subsystem with noise levels of 10 $ \rm nT \ Hz^{-1/2}$
from 1 Hz down to 1 mHz. In this paper we report on the magnetic measurements
throughout LISA Pathfinder operations. We characterise the magnetic environment
within the spacecraft, study the time evolution of the magnetic field and its
stability down to 20 $\mu$Hz, where we measure values around 200 $ \rm nT \
Hz^{-1/2}$ and identify two different frequency regimes, one related to the
interplanetary magnetic field and the other to the magnetic field originating
inside the spacecraft. Finally, we characterise the non-stationary component of
the fluctuations of the magnetic field below the mHz and relate them to the
dynamics of the solar wind.

two small spots of excitation, and no subsequent input. Thus, there are no
refractory cells in the initial condition. For this model, even random spots of

to suggest that this could happen in living tissue.

establish a controlled theoretical framework to this issue via a dynamical
large-N fermionic multichannel approach to the two-dimensional Kondo-Heisenberg
lattice model, where KB transition separates a heavy-Fermi liquid from
fermionic spin-liquid state. With Kondo fluctuations being fully considered, we
find a distinct SM behavior with quasi-linear-in-temperature scattering rate
associated with KB. When particle-hole symmetry is present, signatures of a
critical spin-liquid SM phase as $T \rightarrow 0$ are revealed with $\omega/T$
scaling extended to a wide range. We attribute these features to the interplay
of critical bosonic charge (Kondo) fluctuations and gapless fermionic spinons.
The implications of our results for the experiments are discussed.

important than magnetic dissipation. We furthermore find that the entrained

nutritional status (measured by the protein to carbohydrate ratio) may regulate
population dynamics and foraging task allocation of social insect colonies.
Mathematical analysis of our model shows that both investment to brood rearing
and brood nutrition are important for colony survival and dynamics. When
division of labor and/or nutrition are in an intermediate value range, the
model undergoes a backward bifurcation and creates multiple attractors due to
bistability. This bistability implies that there is a threshold population size
required for colony survival. When the investment in brood is large enough or
nutritional requirements are less strict the colony tends to survive, otherwise
the colony faces collapse. Our model suggests that the needs of colony survival
are shaped by the brood survival probability, which requires good nutritional
status. As a consequence, better nutritional status can lead to a better
survival rate of larvae, and thus a larger worker population.

confined fluids under a perturbation, from equilibrium molecular simulations.
The correlation functions derived with the Green-Kubo formalism are difficult
to sample accurately and we consider two complementary strategies: improving
the spacial sampling thanks to a new estimator of the local fluxes involving
the forces acting on the particles in addition to their positions and
velocities, and improving temporal sampling thanks to the Einstein-Helfand
approach instead of the Green-Kubo one. We illustrate this method on the case
of a binary mixture confined between parallel walls, under a pressure or
chemical potential gradient. All equilibrium methods are compared to standard
non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) and provide the correct mobility
profiles. We recover quantitatively fluid viscosity and diffusio-osmostic
mobility in the bulk part of the pore. Interestingly, the matrix of mobility
profiles for local fluxes is not symmetric, unlike the Onsager matrix for the
total fluxes. Even the most computationally efficient equilibrium method
(Einstein-Helfand combined with the force-based estimator) remains less
efficient than NEMD to determine a single mobility profile. However, the
equilibrium approach provides all responses to all perturbations
simultaneously, whereas NEMD requires the simulation of several types of
perturbations to determine the various responses, each with different
magnitudes to check the validity of the linear regime. While NEMD seems more
competitive for the present example, the balance should be different for more
complex systems, in particular for electrolyte solutions for the responses to
pressure, salt concentration and electric potential gradients.

nontrivial multipole-mode mixings are inevitable in the covariance of the
Legendre decomposition coefficient commonly used in the small-angle power
spectrum analysis, our analytic computation of the covariance of the TripoSH
decomposition coefficient shows that such mixings are absent by virtue of high
separability of the TripoSH basis, yielding the minimum variance. Via the
simple signal-to-noise ratio assessment, we confirm that the detectability
improvement by the TripoSH decomposition approach becomes more significant at
higher multipole modes, and, e.g., the hexadecapole of the density power
spectrum has two orders of magnitude improvement. The TripoSH decomposition
approach is expected to be applied to not only currently available survey data
but also forthcoming wide-angle one, and to bring about something new or much
more accurate cosmological information.

i.e. the currently infected one (or total currently positive). After the April
7 the large increase in the number of swabs meant that the logistical behavior
of the infected curve no longer worked. So we decided to generalize the model,
introducing new parameters. Moreover, we adopt a similar approach used in [1]
(for the estimation of deaths) in order to evaluate the recoveries. In this
way, introducing a simple conservation law, we define a model with 4
populations: total infected, currently positives, recoveries and deaths.
Therefore, we propose an alternative method to a classical SIRD model for the
evaluation of the Sars-Cov-2 epidemic. However, the method is general and thus
applicable to other diseases. Finally we study the behavior of the ratio
infected over swabs for Italy, Germany and USA, and we show as studying this

Understanding this phenomena has been done by various DC threshold models,
self-tuned at their critical point. Here we attempt to describe it using an AC
threshold model, with a second-order Kuramoto type equation of motion of the
power-flow. We have focused on the exploration of network heterogeneity
effects, starting from homogeneous 2D lattices to the US power-grid, possessing
identical nodes and links, to a realistic electric power-grid obtained from the
Hungarian electrical database. The last one exhibits node dependent parameters,
topologically marginally on the verge of robust networks. We show that too weak
quenched heterogeneity, coming solely from the probabilistic self-frequencies
of nodes (2D lattice) is not sufficient to find power-law distributed cascades.
On the other hand too strong heterogeneity destroys the synchronization of the
system. We found agreement with the empirically observed power-law failure size
distributions on the US grid, as well as on the Hungarian networks near the
synchronization transition point. We have also investigated the consequence of
replacing the usual Gaussian self-frequencies to exponential distributed ones,
describing renewable energy sources. We found a drop in the steady state
synchronization averages, but the cascade size distribution both for the US and
Hungarian systems remained insensitive and have kept the universal tails,
characterized by the exponent $\tau\simeq 1.8$. We have also investigated the

study further claims that the position information enables accurate inference
for several tasks, such as object recognition, segmentation, etc. However,
there is a technical issue with the design of the experiments of the study, and

image position may not be essential for the segmentation of natural images, in
which target objects will appear at any image position. In this study, we
investigate how positional information is and can be utilized for segmentation
tasks. Toward this end, we consider {\em positional encoding} (PE) that adds
channels embedding image position to the input images and compare PE with
several padding methods. Considering the above nature of natural images, we
choose medical image segmentation tasks, in which the absolute position appears
to be relatively important, as the same organs (of different patients) are
captured in similar sizes and positions. We draw a mixed conclusion from the
experimental results; the positional encoding certainly works in some cases,
but the absolute image position may not be so important for segmentation tasks

Recently, deep-learningbased image translation approaches, most notably the

improvements over model-based methods. Such networks, however, involve
potential drawbacks that need to be considered. First, they are trained in a
data-driven fashion without making use of prior knowledge and X-ray physics.
Second, due to their high parameter complexity, the validity of deep neural
networks is difficult to assess. To circumvent these issues, we introduce here
a surrogate function to model X-ray scatter distributions that can be expressed
by few parameters. We could show empirically that cubic B-splines are
well-suited to model X-ray scatter in the diagnostic energy regime. Based on
these findings, we propose a lean convolutional encoder architecture that
extracts local scatter characteristics from X-ray projection images. These
characteristics are embedded into a global context using a constrained
weighting matrix yielding spline coefficients that model the scatter
distribution. In a first simulation study with 17 thorax data sets, we could
show that our method and the U-Net-based state of the art reach about the same

With dose
being generally difficult to monitor reliably, fast computational methods are
desirable. A major drawback of the gold standard based on Monte Carlo (MC)
methods is its computational complexity. Besides common variance reduction
techniques, filter approaches are often applied to achieve conclusive results
within a fraction of time. Inspired by these methods, we propose a novel
approach. We down-sample the target volume based on the fraction of mass,
simulate the imaging situation, and then revert the down-sampling. To this end,
the dose is weighted by the mass energy absorption, up-sampled, and distributed
using a guided filter. Eventually, the weighting is inverted resulting in
accurate high resolution dose distributions. The approach has the potential to
considerably speed-up MC simulations since less photons and boundary checks are
necessary. First experiments substantiate these assumptions. We achieve a
median accuracy of 96.7 % to 97.4 % of the dose estimation with the proposed
method and a down-sampling factor of 8 and 4, respectively. While maintaining a
high accuracy, the proposed method provides for a tenfold speed-up. The overall
findings suggest the conclusion that the proposed method has the potential to
allow for further efficiency.

Typically, computed tomography (CT) scans can be mapped to tissue labels and
mass densities to obtain training data. However, care has to be taken to make
sure that the different clinical settings are properly accounted for. First,
the interventional environment is characterized by wide variety of table setups
that are significantly different from the typical patient tables used in
conventional CT. This cannot be ignored, since tables play a crucial role in
sound skin dose estimation in an interventional setup, e. g., when the X-ray
source is directly underneath a patient (posterior-anterior view). Second, due
to interpolation errors, most CT scans do not facilitate a clean segmentation
of the skin border. As a solution to these problems, we applied connected
component labeling (CCL) and Canny edge detection to (a) robustly separate the
patient from the table and (b) to identify the outermost skin layer. Our
results show that these extensions enable fully-automatic, generalized
pre-processing of CT scans for further simulation of both skin dose and

coupled with a redox reporter and electrochemical detection, enables
reagent-free biosensing with a sub-minute temporal resolution for in vivo
therapeutic drug monitoring. Specifically, we design a chronoamperometry-based
electrochemical circuit that measures the direct changes in the electron
transfer (ET) kinetics of a methylene blue reporter conjugated at the
distal-end of the aptamer. To overcome the high-frequency noise amplification
issue when interfacing with a large-size (> 0.25 mm2) implantable electrode, we
present a sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit technique in which the desired
electrode potentials are held onto noiseless capacitors during the recording of
the redox currents. This allows disconnecting the feedback amplifiers to avoid
its noise injection while reducing the total power consumption. A prototype

population and find that, on average, the backward scattered population shows a
harder spectrum with the effect being stronger at higher energies. ii) We use a
numerical SEP transport model to simulate the effect of particle scattering
(both in terms of pitch-angle and perpendicular to the mean field) on the
spectrum. We find that pitch-angle scattering can lead to spectral changes at
higher energies (E $>100$ keV) and further away from the Sun (r $> 1$ au) which
are also often observed. At lower energies, and closer to the Sun the effect of
pitch-angle scattering is much reduced so that the simulated energy spectra
still resemble the injected power-law functions. When examining pitch-angle
dependent spectra, we find, in agreement with the observational results, that
the spectra of the backward propagating electrons are harder than that of the
forward (from the Sun) propagating population. {We conclude that {\it Solar
Orbiter} and {\it Parker Solar Probe} will be able to observe the unmodulated
omni-directional SEP electron spectrum close to the Sun at higher energies,
giving a direct indication of the accelerated spectrum. }

Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are considered golden standard to simulate the
interaction of X-ray radiation with matter. However, sensitivity of MC
simulation results to variations in the experimental or clinical setup of image
guided interventional procedures are only limited studied. In particular, the
impact of patient material compositions is poorly investigated. This is mainly
due to the fact, that these methods are commonly validated in phantom studies
utilizing a single anthropomorphic phantom. In this study, we therefore
investigate the impact of patient material parameters mapping on the outcome of
MC X-ray dose simulations. A computation phantom geometry is constructed and
three different commonly used material composition mappings are applied. We
used the MC toolkit Geant4 to simulate X-ray radiation in an interventional
setup and compared the differences in dose deposition, scatter distributions
and resulting X-ray images. The evaluation shows a discrepancy between
different material composition mapping up to 20 % concerning directly
irradiated organs. These results highlight the need for standardization of
material composition mapping for MC simulations in a clinical setup.

sequentially is crucial to achieving artificial general intelligence. Many
continual learning (CL) methods have been proposed to overcome catastrophic
forgetting which results from non i.i.d data in the sequential learning of
neural networks. In this paper we focus on class incremental learning, a
challenging CL scenario. For this scenario, generative replay is a promising
strategy which generates and replays pseudo data for previous tasks to
alleviate catastrophic forgetting. However, it is hard to train a generative
model continually for relatively complex data. Based on recently proposed
orthogonal weight modification (OWM) algorithm which can approximately keep
previously learned feature invariant when learning new tasks, we propose to 1)
replay penultimate layer feature with a generative model; 2) leverage a
self-supervised auxiliary task to further enhance the stability of feature.
Empirical results on several datasets show our method always achieves
substantial improvement over powerful OWM while conventional generative replay
always results in a negative effect. Meanwhile our method beats several strong
baselines including one based on real data storage. In addition, we conduct
experiments to study why our method is effective.

to quantify the influence of these parameters on local X-ray dose to evaluate

Phantom dosimetry experiments using MOSFET dosimeters were conducted

Associated organ-equivalent dose of prostate, bladder, colon and skin was
determined. Dose deviation induced by possible small displacements of the

material differences was investigated by analyzing two different commonly used
phantoms. We reconstructed the experiments using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations,
a reference male geometry, and different material properties. Overall, MC
simulated organ dose values are in accordance with the measured ones for the
majority of cases. Marginal displacements of X-ray source relative to the
phantoms lead to deviations of 6% to 135% in organ dose values, while skin dose
remains relatively constant. Regarding the impact of phantom material
composition, underestimation of internal organ dose values by 12% to 20% is

The
creep rate in this case exhibits three temporal regimes viz. an initial
decelerating regime followed by a steady-state regime and a stage of
accelerating creep that ultimately leads to catastrophic breakdown. Due to the
statistical regularities in the creep rate, the time evolution of creep rate
has often been used to predict residual lifetime until catastrophic breakdown.
However, in disordered samples, these efforts met with limited success.
Nevertheless, it is clear that as the failure is approached, the damage become
increasingly spatially correlated, and the spatio-temporal patterns of acoustic
emission, which serve as a proxy for damage accumulation activity, are likely
to mirror such correlations. However, due to the high dimensionality of the
data and the complex nature of the correlations it is not straightforward to
identify the said correlations and thereby the precursory signals of failure.
Here we use supervised machine learning to estimate the remaining time to
failure of samples of disordered materials. The machine learning algorithm uses
as input the temporal signal provided by a mesoscale elastoplastic model for
the evolution of creep damage in disordered solids. Machine learning algorithms
are well-suited for assessing the proximity to failure from the time series of
the acoustic emissions of sheared samples. We show that materials are
relatively more predictable for higher disorder while are relatively less
predictable for larger system sizes. We find that machine learning predictions,
in the vast majority of cases, perform substantially better than other
prediction approaches proposed in the literature.

this purpose, we associate the $p$-core with its characteristic vector and let
all entries of this vector simultaneously tend to infinity. This result
generalizes the Wronskian Hermite setting which is recovered when $p=2$.

G57.2+0.8 and its environment. The SNR hosts the magnetar SGR 1935+2154, which
emitted an extremely bright ms-duration radio burst on 2020 Apr 28 (The
Chime/Frb Collaboration et al. 2020; Bochenek et al. 2020). We used the 12CO
and 13CO J=1-0 data from the Milky Way Image Scroll Painting (MWISP) CO line
survey to search for molecular gas associated with G57.2+0.8, in order to
constrain the physical parameters (e.g., the distance) of the SNR and its
magnetar. We report that SNR G57.2+0.8 is likely impacting the molecular clouds
(MCs) at the local standard of rest (LSR) velocity V_{LSR} ~ 30 km/s and
excites a weak 1720 MHz OH maser with a peak flux density of 47 mJy/beam. The
chance coincidence of a random OH spot falling in the SNR is <12%, and the
OH-CO correspondence chance is 7% at the maser spot. This combines to give < 1%
false probability of the OH maser, suggesting a real maser detection. The LSR
velocity of the MCs places the SNR and magnetar at a kinematic distance of
d=6.6 +/- 0.7 kpc. The nondetection of thermal X-ray emission from the SNR and
the relatively dense environment suggests G57.2+0.8 be an evolved SNR with an
age $t>1.6 \times 10^4$ (d/6.6 kpc) yr. The explosion energy of G57.2+0.8 is
lower than $2 \times 10^{51}(n_0/10 cm^{-3})^{1.16} (d/~6.6 kpc)^{3.16}$ erg,
which is not very energetic even assuming a high ambient density $n_0$ = 10
cm$^{-3}$. This reinforces the opinion that magnetars do not necessarily result
from very energetic supernova explosions.

review, after a brief discussion of the DM evidences and the main proposed
candidates and scenarios for the DM phenomenon, we focus on recent results on
rotating disc galaxies giving a special attention to the Low Surface Brightness
(LSB) galaxies. The main observational properties related to the baryonic
matter in LSBs, investigated over the last decades, are briefly recalled. Next,
the LSBs are analysed by means of the mass modelling of their rotation curves
both individually and stacked. The latter analysis, via the Universal Rotation
Curve (URC) method, results really powerful in giving a global/universal
description of the disc galaxies properties. We show the presence in LSBs of
scaling relations between the galactic structural properties and we compare
them with those of galaxies of different morphologies. The findings confirm,
for all disc systems, a strong entanglement between the luminous matter (LM)
and the DM. Moreover, we report how in LSBs the tight relationship between
their radial gravitational acceleration $g$ and their baryonic component $g_b$
results to also depend on the galactic radius at which the former have been
measured. Finally, LSB galaxies strongly challenge the $\Lambda$CDM scenario
with the relative collisionless dark particle and, alongside with the
non-detection of the latter, contribute to guide us towards a new scenario for
the DM phenomenon.

splitting after a stochastic waiting time. In laboratory experiments, the mean
waiting time was observed to increase double-exponentially as the Reynolds
number (Re) approaches its critical value. To understand the origin of this
double-exponential increase, we perform many pipe flow direct numerical
simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, and measure the cumulative
histogram of the maximum axial vorticity field over the pipe (turbulence
intensity). In the domain where the turbulence intensity is not small, we
observe that the histogram is well-approximated by the Gumbel extreme-value
distribution. The smallest turbulence intensity in this domain roughly
corresponds to the transition value between the locally stable turbulence and a
meta-stable (edge) state. Studying the Re dependence of the fitting parameters
in this distribution, we derive that the time scale of the transition between
these two states increases double-exponentially as Re approaches its critical
value. On the contrary, in smaller turbulence intensities below this domain, we
observe that the distribution is not sensible to the change of Re. This means
that the decay time of the meta-stable state (to the laminar state) is
stochastic but Re-independent in average. Our observation suggests that the
conjecture made by Goldenfeld et al. to derive the double-exponential increase
of turbulence decay time is approximately satisfied in the range of Re we
studied. We also discuss using another extreme-value distribution, Fr\'echet
distribution, instead of the Gumbel distribution to approximate the histogram
of the turbulence intensify, which reveals interesting perspectives.

classification of astrophysical sources is of great interest, and we explore
its applications in the context of a multifrequency data-frame. We test the use
of supervised ML to classify blazars according to its synchrotron peak
frequency, either lower or higher than 10$^{15}$Hz. We select a sample with
4178 blazars labelled as 1279 high synchrotron peak (HSP: $\rm \nu$-peak >
10$^{15}$Hz) and 2899 low synchrotron peak (LSP: $\rm \nu$-peak < 10$^{15}$Hz).
A set of multifrequency features were defined to represent each source, that
includes spectral slopes ($\alpha_{\nu_1, \nu_2}$) between the radio,
infra-red, optical, and X-ray bands, also considering IR colours. We describe
the optimisation of five ML classification algorithms that classify blazars
into LSP or HSP: Random Forests (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest
Neighbours (KNN), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and the Ludwig auto-ML framework.
In our particular case, the SVM algorithm had the best performance, reaching
93% of balanced-accuracy. A joint-feature permutation test revealed that the
spectral slopes alpha-radio-IR and alpha-radio-optical are the most relevant
for the ML modelling, followed by the IR colours. This work shows that ML
algorithms can distinguish multifrequency spectral characteristics and handle

present computation we demonstrate the gauge invariance of the EChL result, not
only for the case of on-shell Higgs boson, but also for the most general and
interesting case of off-shell Higgs boson. We finally analyse and conclude on
the special relevance of the Goldstone boson loops, in good agreement with the
expected chiral loops behaviour in Chiral Lagrangians. We perform a systematic
comparison with the corresponding computation of the Standard Model in the

that for large enough $V$ fixed, as $V'$ is varied, the system goes from a
charge-density wave into a Luttinger liquid, then a bond-order, and then a
second charge density wave phase. We find that the Luttinger liquid state is
further split into two, separating parts with distinct values of the many-body
polarization Berry phase. Inside this phase, the variance of the polarization
is infinite in the thermodynamic limit, meaning that even if the polarization
differs, it would not be measurable. However, in the gapped phases on each side
of the Luttinger liquid, the polarization takes a different measurable value,
implying topologically distinction. The key difference is that the large-$V'$
phases are link-inversion symmetric, while the small-$V'$ one is site-inversion
symmetric. We show that large-$V'$ phase can be related to an $S=1$ spin chain,
and exhibits many features of the Haldane phase. The lowest lying states of the

distribution of the future state of the atmosphere is sampled with
Monte-Carlo-like simulations, called ensembles. These ensembles have
deficiencies (such as conditional biases) that can be corrected thanks to
statistical post-processing methods. Several ensembles exist and may be
corrected with different statistiscal methods. A further step is to combine
these raw or post-processed ensembles. The theory of prediction with expert
advice allows us to build combination algorithms with theoretical guarantees on
the forecast performance. This article adapts this theory to the case of
probabilistic forecasts issued as step-wise cumulative distribution functions
(CDF). The theory is applied to wind speed forecasting, by combining several
raw or post-processed ensembles, considered as CDFs. The second goal of this
study is to explore the use of two forecast performance criteria: the Continous
ranked probability score (CRPS) and the Jolliffe-Primo test. Comparing the
results obtained with both criteria leads to reconsidering the usual way to
build skillful probabilistic forecasts, based on the minimization of the CRPS.
Minimizing the CRPS does not necessarily produce reliable forecasts according
to the Jolliffe-Primo test. The Jolliffe-Primo test generally selects reliable
forecasts, but could lead to issuing suboptimal forecasts in terms of CRPS. It
is proposed to use both criterion to achieve reliable and skillful
probabilistic forecasts.

domain walls (DWs) induced by pulsed magnetic field in a ferromagnetic film
with in-plane uniaxial anisotropy. Different from what have been seen up to now
in out-of-plane anisotropy films, the nucleated domains have a rectangular
shape in which a pair of the opposite sides are perfectly linear DWs, while the
other pair present zigzags. This can be explained by magnetostatic
optimization, knowing that the pulse field is applied parallel to the easy
magnetization axis. The field induced propagation of these two DW types are
very different. The linear ones follow a creep law identical to what is usually
observed in out-of-plane films, when the velocity of zigzag DWs depends
linearly on the applied field amplitude down to very low field. This most
unusual feature can be explained by the shape of the DW, which makes it
possible to go round the pinning defects. Thanks to that, it seems that
propagation of zigzag walls agrees with the 1D model, and these results provide
a first experimental evidence of the 1D model relevance in two dimensional
ferromagnetic thin films. Let's note that it is the effective DW width parallel
to DW propagation direction that matters in the 1D model formula, which is a
relevant change when dealing with zigzag DWs.

distributional modality gaps that pose significant challenges. In this paper,
we aim to learn effective modality representations to aid the process of
fusion. We propose a novel framework, MISA, which projects each modality to two
distinct subspaces. The first subspace is modality-invariant, where the
representations across modalities learn their commonalities and reduce the
modality gap. The second subspace is modality-specific, which is private to
each modality and captures their characteristic features. These representations
provide a holistic view of the multimodal data, which is used for fusion that
leads to task predictions. Our experiments on popular sentiment analysis
benchmarks, MOSI and MOSEI, demonstrate significant gains over state-of-the-art
models. We also consider the task of Multimodal Humor Detection and experiment
on the recently proposed UR_FUNNY dataset. Here too, our model fares better

been recently well established. The second two time-scale design, in which
actor and critic update simultaneously but with different learning rates, has
much fewer tuning parameters than the nested-loop design and is hence
substantially easier to implement. Although two time-scale AC and NAC have been
shown to converge in the literature, the finite-sample convergence rate has not

represents an analog of a classical Ising spin, networks of coupled parametric
oscillators are considered as simulators of Ising spin models, aiming to
efficiently calculate the ground state of an Ising network - a computationally
hard problem. However, the coherent dynamics of coupled parametric oscillators
can be considerably richer than that of Ising spins, depending on the nature of
the coupling between them (energy preserving or dissipative), as was recently
shown for two coupled parametric oscillators. In particular, when the
energy-preserving coupling is dominant, the system displays everlasting
coherent beats, transcending the Ising description. Here, we extend these
findings to three coupled parametric oscillators, focusing in particular on the
effect of frustration of the dissipative coupling. We theoretically analyze the
dynamics using coupled nonlinear Mathieu's equations, and corroborate our
theoretical findings by a numerical simulation that closely mimics the dynamics
of the system in an actual experiment. Our main finding is that frustration
drastically modifies the dynamics. While in the absence of frustration the
system is analogous to the two-oscillator case, frustration reverses the role
of the coupling completely, and beats are found for small energy-preserving
couplings.

follow. To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection
mechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain
protocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the
next block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS
protocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive
corruptions.
  In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync,
to achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on
performance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each
block, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the
digital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain
power, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all
the valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake
to enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the
chain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection
rule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When
we use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to
vulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant
function implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync
satisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence
it is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of
adversarial attack strategies. Our analysis demonstrates that QuickSync
performs better than Bitcoin by an order of magnitude on both transactions per

mechanism to amplify the magnetic field in fast-rotating protoneutron stars and
form magnetars. This scenario is supported by many local studies showing that
magnetic fields could be amplified by the MRI on small scales. However, the
efficiency of the MRI at generating a dipole field is still unknown. To answer
this question, we study the MRI dynamo in an idealized global model of a fast
rotating protoneutron star with differential rotation. We perform 3D
incompressible MHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit
diffusivities where the differential rotation is forced at the outer boundary.
We vary the initial magnetic field and investigated different magnetic boundary
conditions. These simulations were compared to local shearing box simulations.
We obtain a self-sustained turbulent MRI-driven dynamo, whose saturated state
is independent of the initial magnetic field. The MRI generates a strong
turbulent magnetic field of $B \geq 2\times 10^{15}$ G and a non-dominant
magnetic dipole, which represents systematically about $5\%$ of the averaged
magnetic field strength. Interestingly, this dipole is tilted towards the
equatorial plane. We find that local shearing box models can reproduce fairly
well several characteristics of global MRI turbulence such as the kinetic and
magnetic spectra. The turbulence is nonetheless more vigorous in the local
models than in the global ones. Overall, our results support the ability of the
MRI to form magnetar-like large-scale magnetic fields. They furthermore predict
the presence of a stronger small-scale magnetic field. The resulting magnetic
field could be important to power outstanding stellar explosions, such as
superluminous supernovae and GRBs.

static aging-specific subnetwork, despite the aging process being dynamic. This
could be because the dynamic subnetwork was inferred using a naive Induced

subnetwork using a methodologically more advanced notion of network propagation
(NP), which improved upon Induced dynamic aging-specific subnetwork in a
different task, that of unsupervised analyses of the aging process. Here, we
evaluate whether our existing NP-based dynamic subnetwork will improve upon the

NP-based subnetwork is unweighted, i.e., it gives equal importance to each of

might be important, we additionally propose a weighted NP-based dynamic
aging-specific subnetwork. We demonstrate that a predictive machine learning

goal of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data analysis. Neural networks
have been employed to identify cell types from scRNAseq data with high
performance. However, it requires a large mount of individual cells with
accurate and unbiased annotated types to build the identification models.
Unfortunately, labeling the scRNAseq data is cumbersome and time-consuming as
it involves manual inspection of marker genes. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a semi-supervised learning model to use unlabeled scRNAseq cells and
limited amount of labeled scRNAseq cells to implement cell identification.
Firstly, we transform the scRNAseq cells to ""gene sentences"", which is inspired
by similarities between natural language system and gene system. Then genes in
these sentences are represented as gene embeddings to reduce data sparsity.

Mathematical languages of these two theories are entirely different, one is
geometric while the other one is probabilistic. This curious feature makes the
merging of these theories (quantum-gravity) considerably difficult. In this
manuscript, we explore quantum-gravity in a dynamical system perspective. For
example, in the standard quantum theory, the wave equation is a linear partial
differential equation while in General Theory of relativity, the field
equations are highly nonlinear. A classical dynamical system can show very rich
phase-space structures which is absent in a linear partial differential
equation. In order to incorporate gravitational corrections one can think about
the nonlinear extensions of quantum theory. In this manuscript such an attempt
to quantum gravity is explored. Dissipative and forcing corrections are found

health crisis since it started in early 2020. CT imaging has been used as a
complementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid
identification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases.
The main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in
the COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and
imaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty
Vertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP
using CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional
features and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each
case. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a
hypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph.
The uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score
measurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process
of the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case
belongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia
dataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five
hospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.
Results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on
the identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

recognition has so far been investigated under unrealistic assumptions: (i) a

of the technology must be available and (iii) a transmitter must be
trustworthy. In reality these assumptions cannot be readily met, as a
transmitter's bandwidth may only be scanned intermittently, partially, or
alongside other transmitters, and modulation obfuscation may be introduced by
short-lived scans or malicious activity.
  This paper presents LinksIQ, which bridges the gap between real-world
spectrum sensing and the growing body of modrec methods designed under
simplifying assumptions. Our key insight is that ordered IQ samples form
distinctive patterns across modulations, which persist even with scan
deficiencies. We mine these patterns through a Fisher Kernel framework and
employ lightweight linear support vector machine for modulation classification.
LinksIQ is robust to noise, scan partiality and data biases without utilizing
prior knowledge of transmitter technology. Its accuracy consistently
outperforms baselines in both simulated and real traces. We evaluate LinksIQ
performance in a testbed using two popular SDR platforms, RTL-SDR and USRP. We
demonstrate high detection accuracy (i.e. 0.74) even with a $20 RTL-SDR

  This constitutes an average of 43% improvement over existing counterparts
employed on RTL-SDR scans. We also explore the effects of platform-aware

  2019",,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Networks that have power-law connectivity, commonly referred to as the
scale-free networks, are an important class of complex networks. A
heterogeneous mean-field approximation has been previously proposed for the
Ising model of the Barab\'{a}si-Albert model of scale-free networks with
classical spins on the nodes wherein it was shown that the critical temperature
for such a system scales logarithmically with network size. For finite sizes,
there is no criticality for such a system and hence no true phase transition in
terms of singular behavior. Further, in the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field
prediction of an infinite critical temperature for the system may exclude any
true phase transition even then. Nevertheless, with an eye on potential
applications of the model on biological systems that are generally finite, one
may still try to find approximations that describe the relevant observables
quantitatively. Here we present an alternative, approximate formulation for the
description of the Ising model of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network. Using the
classical definition of magnetization, we show that Ising models on a network
can be well-approximated by a long-range interacting homogeneous Ising model
wherein each node of the network couples to all other spins with a strength
determined by the mean degree of the Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network. In such an
effective long-range Ising model of a Barab\'{a}si-Albert Network, the critical

several fully end-to-end models that directly predict steering and acceleration
commands for an autonomous race car as well as a model that predicts a list of
waypoints to follow in the car's local coordinate system, with the task of
selecting a steering/throttle angle left to a classical control algorithm. We

Weather Prediction (NWP) models are becoming more complex, with higher

meteorologist: how should the information from all available models, each with

stakeholders with well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts to use in decision

Quantile Regression Forests to learn the error profile of each numerical model,

forecasts. Second, we combine these probabilistic forecasts using quantile
averaging. Third, we interpolate between the aggregate quantiles in order to
generate a full predictive distribution, which we demonstrate has properties
suitable for decision support. Our results suggest that this approach provides

the required noise level necessary to probe non-Gaussianity studies with
upcoming CMB experiments. In addition, the amplitude of the polarization caused
by the CMB shadow due to dust is comparable to or larger than the RMS value of
the CMB B-mode polarization, imprinted by primordial gravitational waves. We
show that applying a single-power law model as the dust spectrum to observed
multifrequency data introduces systematic errors, which are comparable to or
larger than the required noise level for forthcoming CMB B-mode polarization
experiments. Deducing the intrinsic spectrum of dust emission from the
submillimeter waveband data reduces systematic error below the required noise
level. However, this method requires dust temperature measurements with an
accuracy of better than a few percent. We conclude that the CMB shadow due to

sensitivity. Our results will be important to detect the primordial CMB B-mode

replacing a continuous-time gradient profile by narrow pulses. In this

examining the value relevance of the components of oil and gas reserve quantity
change disclosures of upstream oil and gas companies in the London Stock

empirical results suggested that changes in reserves as well as the components
of these changes where associated with share returns though insignificantly due
to the significant impact of oil price and longitudinal effect posed by

the quality of reserves disclosures has a positively significant relationship
