hidden layer are initialized using eigenvectors of the cross-moment matrix
between the input's second-order score function and the response. The input
data is then forward propagated to the next layer and such a procedure can be
repeated until all the hidden layers are initialized. Finally, the weights for
the output layer are initialized by generalized linear modeling. Such a

much faster and more accurate than other popular methods commonly used for

of sensors; scanning is usually necessary in these cases. To mitigate this
challenge, snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) was proposed to capture the
high-dimensional (usually 3D) images using a 2D sensor (detector). Via novel
optical design, the {\em measurement} captured by the sensor is an encoded
image of multiple frames of the 3D desired signal. Following this,
reconstruction algorithms are employed to retrieve the high-dimensional data.
Though various algorithms have been proposed, the total variation (TV) based
method is still the most efficient one due to a good trade-off between
computational time and performance. This paper aims to answer the question of
which TV penalty (anisotropic TV, isotropic TV and vectorized TV) works best
for video SCI reconstruction? Various TV denoising and projection algorithms
are developed and tested for video SCI reconstruction on both simulation and
real datasets.

When analyzed with the R20 prescription, about $11\%$ of artificial

However, we believe that the detected oscillations are not due to an

heart rate variability (HRV) as an alternative indicator of thermal comfort
status. Since HRV is linked to homeostasis, we conjectured that people's
thermal comfort could be more accurately estimated based on their heart rate
variability (HRV). To test our hypothesis, we analyzed statistical, spectral,
and nonlinear HRV indices of 17 human subjects doing light office work in a
cold, neutral, and hot environment. The resulting HRV indices were used as
inputs to machine learning classification algorithms. We observed that HRV is
distinctively different depending on the thermal environment and that it is
possible to reliably predict each subject's thermal state (cold, neutral, and

be possible to design automatic real-time thermal comfort controllers based on

existing work deals with explicit sensitive features such as gender,
occupations or race which doesn't work with data where such features are not

classification parity across explicit as well as implicit sensitive features.
We define explicit cohorts as groups of people based on explicit sensitive

are defined as groups of people with similar language usage. We obtain implicit
cohorts by clustering embeddings of each individual trained on the language
generated by them using a language model. We achieve two primary objectives in

differences across cohorts based on implicit and explicit features , [2] We
improved classification parity by introducing modification to the loss function

We further applied graph-theoretical metrics on output class activation maps to
identify areas of the matrices that the CNN preferentially used to make the
classification, focusing particularly on hubs. Our results gave AUROCs of

of the effective one-body picture. Additionally, when many-body correlations
play a substantial role, the one-body density is in general not sufficient for
deciding upon the phase at hand which we demonstrate exemplarily.

consecutively until convergence, and requires the dualization of an

We first reformulate the lower bound problem using the properties of an optimal

unnecessary. The reformulation makes possible the integration of a greedy

Automatic assessment of the quality of the collected recordings is important to

proposed by jointly using bidirectional long short-term memory and an attention

interferences from desired signals by highlighting target related features. To

results for experimentally relevant system parameters from both approaches are

intracomponent interactions favors the azimuthal phase separation for all
intercomponent interactions. Only an imbalance in the intracomponent
interactions can result in a transition to the radial phase separation, for
which the transition becomes sensitive to the shape of the trap. We present
phase diagrams as a function of the inter and intracomponent interactions.

azimuthal phase separation is favoured for narrower Corbino geometries. We
explore the rotational properties of the spatially separated condensates under
the magnetic field, studying their angular momenta and velocity fields. The
quantization of circulation breaks down for the azimuthal phase separation. In
this case, the bulk region of the condensate continues to display superfluid
flow behavior whereas the velocity field shows a rigid body behavior along the

where a model takes as inputs a lengthy document and a question and then
extracts a text span from the document as an answer. State-of-the-art models
tend to use a pretrained transformer model (e.g., BERT) to encode the joint
contextual information of document and question. However, these
transformer-based models can only take a fixed-length (e.g., 512) text as its
input. To deal with even longer text inputs, previous approaches usually chunk
them into equally-spaced segments and predict answers based on each segment
independently without considering the information from other segments. As a
result, they may form segments that fail to cover the correct answer span or
retain insufficient contexts around it, which significantly degrades the
performance. Moreover, they are less capable of answering questions that need
cross-segment information.
  We propose to let a model learn to chunk in a more flexible way via
reinforcement learning: a model can decide the next segment that it wants to
process in either direction. We also employ recurrent mechanisms to enable
information to flow across segments. Experiments on three MRC datasets -- CoQA,
QuAC, and TriviaQA -- demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed recurrent
chunking mechanisms: we can obtain segments that are more likely to contain
complete answers and at the same time provide sufficient contexts around the
ground truth answers for better predictions.

on that, we consider each user associated with a probability with which we can
activate her as a seed, and we can attempt to activate her many times. In this
paper, we study the adaptive influence maximization with multiple activations

whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the influence
diffusion process; If no, we can attempt to activate her again with a higher

  Web Science Conference 2020). Please cite that version instead",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Censuses around the world are key sources of data to guide government
investments and public policies. However, these sources are very expensive to
obtain and are collected relatively infrequently. Over the last decade, there
has been growing interest in the use of data from social media to complement
traditional data sources. However, social media users are not representative of
the general population. Thus, analyses based on social media data require
statistical adjustments, like post-stratification, in order to remove the bias
and make solid statistical claims. These adjustments are possible only when we
have information about the frequency of demographic groups using social media.
These data, when compared with official statistics, enable researchers to
produce appropriate statistical correction factors. In this paper, we leverage
the Facebook advertising platform to compile the equivalent of an
aggregate-level census of Facebook users. Our compilation includes the
population distribution for seven demographic attributes such as gender and age
at different geographic levels for the US. By comparing the Facebook counts
with official reports provided by the US Census and Gallup, we found very high
correlations, especially for political leaning and race. We also identified
instances where official statistics may be underestimating population counts as
in the case of immigration. We use the information collected to calculate bias
correction factors for all computed attributes in order to evaluate the extent
to which different demographic groups are more or less represented on Facebook.
We provide the first comprehensive analysis for assessing biases in Facebook
users across several dimensions. This information can be used to generate
bias-adjusted population estimates and demographic counts in a timely way and
at fine geographic granularity in between data releases of official statistics

discrete Fourier transform (DFT) cannot be localized simultaneously in an
arbitrary small area in the time and the frequency domain. The product of the
number of nonzero samples in the time domain and the frequency domain is
greater or equal to the total number of signal samples. The support uncertainty
principle has been extended to the arbitrary orthogonal pairs of signal basis
and the graph signals, stating that the product of supports in the vertex
domain and the spectral domain is greater than the reciprocal squared maximum
absolute value of the basis functions. This form is then used in compressive

transition point, $p^*$, between these two regimes, showing that there are

$\delta\approx 1$, and revealed an approximately linear relationship between
$p^*$ and the difference between the layers' average degrees. Furthermore, we
showed that this multiplex structural transition is intrinsically connected

decoder relies on the attention mechanism to efficiently extract information

different encoder layers for diversified levels of information. Nonetheless,
the decoder still obtains only a single view of the source sequences, which
might lead to insufficient training of the encoder layer stack due to the

decoding, where for each decoder layer, together with the representations from
the last encoder layer, which serve as a global view, those from other encoder

Systematic experiments and analyses show that we successfully address the

success, several issues remain open. One issue, in particular, is the lack of

we observe that the most prominent method is the one based on a canonical

2D operations. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis and show
theoretically that particles can be trapped and assembled in three-dimensions
with synchronized spherical vortices. We show that the particles can be
approached both laterally and axially and we determine the maximum assembly
speed by balancing the Stokes' drag force and the critical radiation force.
These theoretical results provide guidelines to design selective acoustical

tool to solve a wide variety of complex learning problems ranging from image
classification to human pose estimation, which is challenging to solve using
statistical machine learning algorithms. However, despite their superior
performance, deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial perturbations,
which can cause the network's prediction to change without making perceptible
changes to the input image, thus creating severe security issues at the time of
deployment of such systems. Recent works have shown the existence of Universal
Adversarial Perturbations, which, when added to any image in a dataset,
misclassifies it when passed through a target model. Such perturbations are
more practical to deploy since there is minimal computation done during the
actual attack. Several techniques have also been proposed to defend the neural
networks against these perturbations. In this paper, we attempt to provide a
detailed discussion on the various data-driven and data-independent methods for
generating universal perturbations, along with measures to defend against such
perturbations. We also cover the applications of such universal perturbations
in various deep learning tasks.

that the mean rewards are constant over time. This assumption can be
restrictive in the business world as decision-makers often face an evolving
environment where the mean rewards are time-varying. In this paper, we consider
a non-stationary MAB model with $K$ arms whose mean rewards vary over time in a
periodic manner. The unknown periods can be different across arms and scale
with the length of the horizon $T$ polynomially. We propose a two-stage policy
that combines the Fourier analysis with a confidence-bound-based learning
procedure to learn the periods and minimize the regret. In stage one, the
policy correctly estimates the periods of all arms with high probability. In
stage two, the policy explores the periodic mean rewards of arms using the
periods estimated in stage one and exploits the optimal arm in the long run. We
show that our learning policy incurs a regret upper bound
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T\sum_{k=1}^K T_k})$ where $T_k$ is the period of arm $k$.
Moreover, we establish a general lower bound $\Omega(\sqrt{T\max_{k}\{ T_k\}})$

affected by these emerging technologies. At the same time, artificial
intelligence, deep learning, machine learning, cognitive computing, blockchain,
virtual reality and augmented reality, belong to the fields most likely to
affect law and, in particular, administrative law. The book examines
universally applicable patterns in administrative decisions and judicial
rulings. First, similarities and divergence in behavior among the different
cases are identified by analyzing parameters ranging from geographical location
and administrative decisions to judicial reasoning and legal basis. As it turns
out, in several of the cases presented, sources of general law, such as
competition or labor law, are invoked as a legal basis, due to the lack of
current specialized legislation. This book also investigates the role and
significance of national and indeed supranational regulatory bodies for
advanced algorithms and considers ENISA, an EU agency that focuses on network
and information security, as an interesting candidate for a European regulator
of advanced algorithms. Lastly, it discusses the involvement of representative

studies by traditional micro computed tomography (CT), routine scout imaging is
constrained by a time window of minutes and minimal sample handling to avoid
interfering with the pathology protocols. Traditional micro CT was not able to
meet the requirements due to lengthy study times or sample alteration by the
introduction of x-ray contrast agents. A form of x-ray tomosynthesis used in
security screening was found to be efficient for rapid microscopy of unstained

increase in imaging speed and a 4.8-fold increase in contrast-to-noise ratio.

ubiquitous throughout modern statistics, computer science and statistical
physics. While there has been success evidencing these gaps from the failure of
restricted classes of algorithms, progress towards a more traditional
reduction-based approach to computational complexity in statistical inference
has been limited. Existing reductions have largely been limited to inference
problems with similar structure -- primarily mapping among problems
representable as a sparse submatrix signal plus a noise matrix, which are
similar to the common hardness assumption of planted clique.
  The insight in this work is that a slight generalization of the planted
clique conjecture -- secret leakage planted clique -- gives rise to a variety
of new average-case reduction techniques, yielding a web of reductions among
problems with very different structure. Using variants of the planted clique
conjecture for specific forms of secret leakage planted clique, we deduce tight
statistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems including
robust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions, robust
sparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic
block models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense
subgraph, detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for
learning sparse mixtures. In particular, a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of
the planted clique conjecture is sufficient to establish all of our
computational lower bounds. Our techniques also reveal novel connections to
combinatorial designs and to random matrix theory. This work gives the first
evidence that an expanded set of hardness assumptions, such as for secret
leakage planted clique, may be a key first step towards a more complete theory
of reductions among statistical problems.

$-$ training one segmentation network on image labels $-$ which was abandoned
due to inferior segmentation accuracy. In this work, we first define three
desirable properties of a weakly supervised method: local consistency, semantic
fidelity, and completeness. Using these properties as guidelines, we then
develop a segmentation-based network model and a self-supervised training
scheme to train for semantic masks from image-level annotations in a single
stage. We show that despite its simplicity, our method achieves results that
are competitive with significantly more complex pipelines, substantially
outperforming earlier single-stage methods.

unstudied discontinuity in $2-D $ and higher dimensions. The shortcoming can
result in severe artifacts whereas the problem does not exist in $1-D $
signals. Direct use of Gabor phase, or its gradient, in computer vision and
biometric recognition e.g., as done in influential studies
\cite{fleet90,wiskott1997face}, may produce undesired results that will go
unnoticed unless special images similar to ours reveal them. Instead of the
Analytic Signal phase, we suggest the use of Linear Symmetry phase, relying on
more than one set of Gabor filters, but with a negligible computational add-on,
as a remedy. Gradient magnitudes of this phase are continuous in contrast to
that of the analytic signal whereas continuity of the gradient direction of the
phase is guaranteed if Linear Symmetry Tensor replaces gradient vector. The
suggested phase has also a built-in automatic scale estimator, useful for
robust detection of patterns by multi-scale processing. We show crucial
concepts on synthesized fingerprint images, where ground truth regarding
instantaneous frequency, (scale \& direction), and phase are known with
favorable results. A comparison to a baseline alternative is also reported. To
that end, a novel multi-scale minutia model where location, direction, and
scale of minutia parameters are steerable, without the creation of
uncontrollable minutia is also presented. This is a useful tool, to reduce
development times of minutia detection methods with explainable behavior. A
revealed consequence is that minutia directions are not determined by the
linear phase alone, but also by each other and the influence must be corrected
to obtain steerability and accurate ground truths. Essential conclusions are
readily transferable to $N-D $, and unrelated applications, e.g. optical flow

consider a satellite with an on-board atomic clock, orbiting in the
Finslerian-perturbed gravitational field of the earth, whose time signal is
transmitted to a ground station, where its receive time and frequency are
measured with respect to another atomic clock. This configuration is realized
by the Galileo 5 and 6 satellites that have gone astray and are now on
non-circular orbits. Our method consists in the numerical integration of the
satellite's orbit, followed by an iterative procedure which provides the
numerically integrated signals, i.e., null geodesics, from the satellite to the
ground station. One of our main findings is that for orbits that are
considerably more eccentric than the Galileo 5 and 6 satellite orbits,
Finslerian effects can be separated from effects of perturbations of the
Schwarzschild spacetime within the Lorentzian geometry. We also discuss the
separation from effects of non-gravitational perturbations. This leads us to
the conclusion that observations of this kind combined with appropriate

with gravitational waves and short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this work, we
explore detectability of radio afterglows from BNS mergers and compare it to
the observed radio limits on FRB afterglows. We calculate the afterglow flux
powered by the two components: a relativistic jet and a slower isotropic
ejecta, and quantify the detection probability as a function of the source
redshift, observing time, and flux sensitivity. The model parameter
distributions inferred from short GRB afterglows are adopted, and viewing angle
distributions (uniform spherical, gravitational-wave, on-axis biased) are
assumed to reflect different searching scenario. Assuming that FRBs are not
strongly beamed, we make comparison to FRBs detected with reported radio limits

strong constraint on the BNS progenitor model considering the small sample

190608), we find a high chance of detection (>20% at 10$\mu$Jy sensitivity) for
the isotropic component that would peak around $\sim$1--10 years after the
merger. Therefore a long term radio monitoring of persistent radio emission for
these objects is important.

a valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been

created the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation
of a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment
designed as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a
radio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two
conditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA).
The goal of the experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure
the operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A
successful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL
while operating locally. Performance metrics showed greater SA and lower CL in
the local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to

result, having access to accurate state estimates, even in the presence of
attacks on sensor measurements, is of critical importance. In this paper, we
analyze performance of resilient state estimators (RSEs) when any subset of
sensors may be compromised by a stealthy attacker. Specifically, we consider
systems with the well-known l0-based RSE and two commonly used sound intrusion
detectors (IDs). For linear time-invariant plants with bounded noise, we define
the notion of perfect attackability (PA) when attacks may result in unbounded
estimation errors while remaining undetected by the employed ID (i.e.,
stealthy). We derive necessary and sufficient PA conditions, showing that a
system can be perfectly attackable even if the plant is stable. While PA can be
prevented with the use the standard cryptographic mechanisms (e.g.,message
authentication) that ensure data integrity under network-based attacks, their
continuous use imposes significant communication and computational overhead.
Consequently, we also study the impact that even intermittent use of data
authentication has on RSE performance guarantees in the presence of stealthy
attacks. We show that if messages from some of the sensors are even
intermittently authenticated, stealthy attacks could not result in unbounded
state estimation errors.

by the Sars-CoV-2 virus. There are several factors involved in the epidemic
spreading such as the individual characteristics of each city/country. The true
shape of the epidemic dynamics is a large, complex system such as most of the
social systems. In this context, Complex networks are a great candidate to
analyze these systems due to their ability to tackle structural and dynamical
properties. Therefore this study presents a new approach to model the COVID-19
epidemic using a multi-layer complex network, where nodes represent people,
edges are social contacts, and layers represent different social activities.
The model improves the traditional SIR and it is applied to study the Brazilian
epidemic by analyzing possible future actions and their consequences. The
network is characterized using statistics of infection, death, and
hospitalization time. To simulate isolation, social distancing, or
precautionary measures we remove layers and/or reduce the intensity of social
contacts. Results show that even taking various optimistic assumptions, the
current isolation levels in Brazil still may lead to a critical scenario for
the healthcare system and a considerable death toll (average of 149,000). If
all activities return to normal, the epidemic growth may suffer a steep
increase, and the demand for ICU beds may surpass 3 times the country's
capacity. This would surely lead to a catastrophic scenario, as our estimation
reaches an average of 212,000 deaths even considering that all cases are
effectively treated. The increase of isolation (up to a lockdown) shows to be
the best option to keep the situation under the healthcare system capacity,
aside from ensuring a faster decrease of new case occurrences (months of
difference), and a significantly smaller death toll (average of 87,000).

we propose a Neural Collaborative Reasoning (NCR) framework to bridge learning

differentiable neural networks and symbolic reasoning in a shared architecture
for optimization and inference. To solve the problem, we propose a modularized
reasoning architecture, which learns logical operations such as AND ($\wedge$),
OR ($\vee$) and NOT ($\neg$) as neural modules for implication reasoning
($\rightarrow$). In this way, logical expressions can be equivalently organized
as neural networks, so that logical reasoning and prediction can be conducted

synthetic data has been explored as an alternative. While providing a
significant increase in the size of the training dataset compared to using

of machine learning models trained on simulated and experimental data and their
ability to generalise to experimental charge stability diagrams in two

additive manufacturing, heat management, and coating, in which the ability to
exert control over the impact dynamics and duration is critical. While past
studies have established a comprehensive understanding of the impact on flat
substrates, what we know about the impact dynamics on curved solid surfaces is
still limited. This work aims to elucidate the physics of droplet impact on
spherical surfaces with different Weber numbers ($We$), radii ($R_s$), and
surface wettability ($\theta^{eq}$) using a combination of axisymmetric lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM) and theoretical analysis. The model developed in our
previous work [H. Dalgamoni and X. Yong, Phys. Rev. E 98, 13102 (2018)] was
extended and modified for simulating the normal impact of droplet on curved
substrates in the low Weber number regime (i.e., $We \leq 15$), in which
axisymmetric assumption of droplet deformation holds. The LBM simulations show
that $We$, $R_s$, and $\theta^{eq}$ significantly affect the spreading and
recoiling of droplet during impact. The parametric studies uncover five
outcomes of impact, which range from complete deposition to total rebound. A
simulation-predicted phase diagram was constructed and correlated with the
total time that the droplet was in contact with the solid. In addition, a
theoretical model based on energy budget during impact was developed to predict
the rebound threshold for impact on spherical targets when varying We, and
independently, which agrees well with simulation observations. These findings
provide fundamental insight into surface structure design for controlling
droplet hydrodynamics and the contact time during impact.

at high flow rates of viscous Solution B, the final droplet volume deviates
from the scaling law that correlates final droplet volume to the flow rate of
non-viscous Solution B, reported in previous work. We attribute this deviation
to a two-regime growth in viscous Solution B, where transition from an initial,
fast regime to a final slow regime influenced by the flow rate. Moreover,
viscous solution B hinders the coalescence of growing droplets, leading to a
distinct bimodal distribution of droplet size with stable nanodroplets, in
contrast to a continuous size distribution of droplets in non-viscous case. We
demonstrate that the group of small droplets produced in high viscosity

however has led to fragmentation and a lack of standardisation in the field,
especially concerning performance evaluation. Moreover, the notion of viewpoint

La2NiMnO6 at room temperature for microwave magnetic fields with frequencies, f
= 1 GHz to 5 GHz, using two cavity-less methods. We use an indirect impedance
method which makes use of a radio frequency impedance analyzer and a folded
copper strip coil for the frequency range f = 1 to 2.2 GHz. In this method,
when an applied dc magnetic field is swept, high-frequency resistance of the
strip coil exhibits a sharp peak and the reactance curve crosses zero
exhibiting resonance. A lock-in based broadband setup using a coplanar
waveguide for microwave excitation was used for f = 2 to 5 GHz The resonance
fields (Hr) obtained from both the techniques increase linearly with frequency
and a large spectroscopic g-factor, equal to 2.1284, which supports the
presence of Ni2+ cation with strong spin-orbit coupling. Line shape analysis
and analytical fitting were performed to characterize the material in terms of
its initial susceptibility and damping parameters.

Bessel-Macdonald function (also known as $K_0$-potential) using the
Foldy-Wouthuysen unitary transformation. Initially, we prove that the
two-dimensional Brown-Ravenhall operator with $K_0$-potential is bounded from
below when the coupling constant is below a specified critical value (a
property also referred to as stability). A major feature of this model is the
fact that it does not cease to be bounded below even if the coupling constant
is above the specified critical value. We also investigate the nature of the
spectrum of this operator, in particular the location of the essential
spectrum, and the existence of eigenvalues, which are either isolated from the

laborious process that entails reading through full-text articles to understand
the study design, assess study quality, and extract the reported cancer risk
estimates associated with particular hereditary cancer genes (i.e.,

elements from full-text cancer genetics articles, with the ultimate aim of
expediting the manual workflow currently in place.
  We propose two challenging tasks that are critical for characterizing the
findings reported cancer genetics studies: (i) Extracting snippets of text that

population studied may introduce bias owing to deviations from the target
population; (ii) Extracting reported risk estimates (e.g., odds or hazard

viewed as a joint entity tagging and relation extraction problem. To train
models for these tasks, we induce distant supervision over tokens and snippets
in full-text articles using the manually constructed knowledge base. We propose
and evaluate several model variants, including a transformer-based joint entity
and relation extraction model to extract <germline mutation, risk-estimate>}
pairs. We observe strong empirical performance, highlighting the practical
potential for such models to aid KB construction in this space. We ablate

CopyAttack is constructed to both efficiently and effectively learn policy

which some methods have usually been combined to improve performance, have
become pervasive. In this work, we first introduce a novel method to extract
the implicit relationship between content features using a sort of well-known

contrast to the typical use of Word2Vec, we utilize some features of items as
words of sentences to produce neural feature embeddings, through which we can
calculate the similarity between features. Next, we propose a novel
content-based recommendation system that employs the relationship to determine
vector representations for items by which the similarity between items can be
computed (RELFsim). Our evaluation results demonstrate that it can predict the
preference a user would have for a set of items as good as pure collaborative
filtering. This content-based algorithm is also embedded in a pure item-based
collaborative filtering algorithm to deal with the cold-start problem and
enhance its accuracy. Our experiments on a benchmark movie dataset corroborate
that the proposed approach improves the accuracy of the system.

more agents with fewest possible blocking edges. In particular, we find a
matching whose size exceeds that of stable matching in the graph by at least t
and has at most k blocking edges. We study this question in the realm of
parameterized complexity with respect to several natural parameters, k,t,d,

and hexagon packing, and the benefits of hexagon packing for minimizing the
number of deployed UAVs have been shown. Based on the number of UAVs available
and the desired loitering altitude, the proposed algorithm solves an
optimization problem to calculate the centres of the loitering circles and the
loitering radius for that altitude. The algorithm also incorporates fault
recovery capacity in case of simultaneous multiple UAV failures. These failures
could form clusters of survivor (active) UAVs over the area with no overall
survivor information. The algorithm deploys a super-agent with a larger
communication capacity at a higher altitude to recover from the failure. The
super-agent collects the information of survivors, and updates the homogeneous
radius and the locations of the loitering circles at the same altitude to
restore the full coverage. The individual survivor UAVs are then informed and
transit to the new loitering circles using Dubin's paths. The relationship with
the extent of recoverable loss fractions of the deployed UAVs have been
analysed for varying the initial loiter radii. Simulation results have been

then that solution is unique among all tangles. This result potentially opens a
door to a purely topological line of attack on the Jones conjecture.
  Additionally, we relate systems of tangle equations to the Cosmetic Surgery

In this paper, we study the shilling attack: a subsistent and profitable attack
where an adversarial party injects a number of user profiles to promote or
demote a target item. Conventional shilling attack models are based on simple
heuristics that can be easily detected, or directly adopt adversarial attack
methods without a special design for RS. Moreover, the study on the attack
impact on deep learning based RS is missing in the literature, making the
effects of shilling attack against real RS doubtful. We present a novel
Augmented Shilling Attack framework (AUSH) and implement it with the idea of
Generative Adversarial Network. AUSH is capable of tailoring attacks against RS
according to budget and complex attack goals, such as targeting a specific user
group. We experimentally show that the attack impact of AUSH is noticeable on a
wide range of RS including both classic and modern deep learning based RS,
while it is virtually undetectable by the state-of-the-art attack detection
model.

Computer Vision and Graphics over these years. It aims to generate a more
attractive face via manipulations on image and geometry structure while
preserving face identity. In this paper, we propose the first Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) for enhancing facial attractiveness in both
geometry and appearance aspects, which we call ""FA-GANs"". FA-GANs contain two
branches and enhance facial attractiveness in two perspectives: facial geometry
and facial appearance. Each branch consists of individual GANs with the
appearance branch adjusting the facial image and the geometry branch adjusting
the facial landmarks in appearance and geometry aspects, respectively. Unlike
the traditional facial manipulations learning from paired faces, which are
infeasible to collect before and after enhancement of the same individual, we
achieve this by learning the features of attractiveness faces through
unsupervised adversarial learning. The proposed FA-GANs are able to extract
attractiveness features and impose them on the enhancement results. To better
enhance faces, both the geometry and appearance networks are considered to
refine the facial attractiveness by adjusting the geometry layout of faces and
the appearance of faces independently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the
first to enhance the facial attractiveness with GANs in both geometry and
appearance aspects. The experimental results suggest that our FA-GANs can
generate compelling perceptual results in both geometry structure and facial
appearance and outperform current state-of-the-art methods.

In recent years, it has been realized that not all IRDCs harbour HM Young
Stellar Objects (YSOs). Only those IRDCs satisfying a certain mass-size
criterion, or equivalently above a certain threshold density, are found to
contain HMYSOs. In all cases, IRDCs provide ideal conditions for the formation
of stellar clusters. In this paper, we study the massive stellar content of
IRDCs to re-address the relation between IRDCs and HM star formation. For this
purpose, we have identified all IRDCs associated to a sample of 12 Galactic
molecular clouds (MCs). The selected MCs have been the target of a systematic
search for YSOs in an earlier study. The catalogued positions of YSOs have been
used to search all YSOs embedded in each identified IRDC. In total, we have
found 834 YSOs in 128 IRDCs. The sample of IRDCs have mean surface densities of
319 Mo/pc2, mean mass of 1062 Mo, and a mass function power-law slope -1.8,
which are similar to the corresponding properties for the full sample of IRDCs
and resulting physical properties in previous studies. We find that all those
IRDCs containing at least one intermediate to high-mass young star satisfy the
often-used mass-size criterion for forming HM stars. However, not all IRDCs
satisfying the mass-size criterion contain HM stars. We find that the often
used mass-size criterion corresponds to 35% probability of an IRDC forming a
massive star. Twenty five (20%) of the IRDCs are potential sites of stellar
clusters of mass more than 100 Mo.

propagation region, where the shockwave attenuation occurs mainly due to wall

of branch predictors. Branch predictors record history about the execution of
different programs, and such information from different processes are stored in
the same structure and thus accessible to each other. This leaves the attackers
with the opportunities for malicious training and malicious perception. Instead
of flush-based or physical isolation of hardware resources, we want to achieve
isolation of the content in these hardware tables with some lightweight
processing using randomization as follows. (1) Content encoding. We propose to
use hardware-based thread-private random numbers to encode the contents of the
branch predictor tables (both direction and destination histories) which we
call XOR-BP. Specifically, the data is encoded by XOR operation with the key
before written in the table and decoded after read from the table. Such a
mechanism obfuscates the information adding difficulties to cross-process or
cross-privilege level analysis and perception. It achieves a similar effect of
logical isolation but adds little in terms of space or time overheads. (2)
Index encoding. We propose a randomized index mechanism of the branch predictor
(Noisy-XOR-BP). Similar to the XOR-BP, another thread-private random number is
used together with the branch instruction address as the input to compute the
index of the branch predictor. This randomized indexing mechanism disrupts the
correspondence between the branch instruction address and the branch predictor
entry, thus increases the noise for malicious perception attacks. Our analyses
using an FPGA-based RISC-V processor prototype and additional auxiliary
simulations suggest that the proposed mechanisms incur a very small performance
cost while providing strong protection.

widely used in voice activity detection (VAD). However, the performance may
degrade if no sufficient data especially for practical data could be used for

Moreover, large model structure could not always be used in practical,
especially for low cost devices where restricted hardware is used. This is on
the contrary for Gaussian mixture model (GMM) where model parameters can be
updated in real-time, but, with low modeling ability. In this paper, deeply
integrated scheme combining these two models are proposed to improve
adaptability and modeling ability. This is done by directly combining the
results of models and feeding it back, together with the result of the DNN
model, to update the GMM model. Besides, a control scheme is elaborately
designed to detect the endpoints of speech. The superior performance by
employing this scheme is validated through experiments in practical, which give
an insight into the advantage of combining supervised learning and unsupervised

$A$ and $B$ of respective lengths $m$ and $n$, there is a fundamental dynamic
programming algorithm that computes the DTW distance for $A$ and $B$ together
with an optimal alignment in $\Theta(mn)$ time and space. In this paper, we
tackle the problem of interactive computation of the DTW distance for dynamic
strings, denoted $\mathrm{D^2TW}$, where character-wise edit operation
(insertion, deletion, substitution) can be performed at an arbitrary position
of the strings. Let $M$ and $N$ be the sizes of the run-length encoding (RLE)

Spectral blocks are introduced to be used along with spatial groups to jointly
exploit spectral and spatial redundancies. To reduce the computational
complexity of sparse modeling, spectral blocks are used to break the
high-dimensional optimization problems into small-size sub-problems that are
faster to solve. Furthermore, the proposed sparse structure enables to extract
the most discriminative spectral blocks and further reduce the computational
burden. Experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., Pavia University Image

and analytical calculations, we find that the total folding time is a
non-monotonic function of the number of faces, with a minimum for five faces.
The motion of each face is consistent with a Brownian process and folding
occurs through a sequence of irreversible binding events that close edges
between pairs of faces. The first edge closing is well-described by a
first-passage process in 2D, with a characteristic time that decays with the
number of faces. By contrast, the subsequent edge closings are all
first-passage processes in 1D and so the time of the last one grows
logarithmically with the number of faces. It is the interplay between these two
different sets of events that explains the non-monotonic behavior. Implications
in the self-folding of more complex structures are discussed.

model is the proper multi-user extension of the basic model since the encoder
and decoder pairs are not assumed to trust other pairs after key agreement,
unlike assumed in the literature. Strong secrecy constraints imposed on all
secret keys jointly, which is more stringent than separate secrecy leakage
constraints for each secret key considered in the literature, are satisfied.
Inner bounds for maximum key rate, and minimum privacy-leakage and
database-storage rates are proposed for any finite number of entities. Inner
and outer bounds for degraded and less-noisy BCs are given to illustrate cases
with strong privacy. A multi-enrollment model that is used for common physical
unclonable functions is also considered to establish inner and outer bounds for
key-leakage-storage regions that differ only in the Markov chains imposed. For
this special case, the encoder and decoder measurement channels have the same
channel transition matrix and secrecy leakage is measured for each secret key
separately. We illustrate cases for which it is useful to have multiple
enrollments as compared to a single enrollment and vice versa.

possible deviations from the Kerr quadrupole moment to within fractional errors

allow for improvements in both detection rates (by a factor $\sim 1.5$ -$3$)

SD-WSN, the selection of the optimum route from source to destination is
accomplished by the SDN controller(s). On the other hand, if moving sensors are
there, then SDN controllers of zones cannot handle route discovery sessions by
themselves; they can only store information about the most recent zone state.
Moving sensors find lots of robotics applications where robots continue to move
from one room to another to sensing the environment. A huge amount of energy
can be saved in these networks if transmission range control is applied.
Multiple power levels exist in each node, and each of these levels takes
possible actions after a potential sender node decides to transmit/forward a
message. Based on each such activity, the next states of the concerned sender
node and the communication session are re-determined while the router receives
a reward. The Epsilon-greedy algorithm is applied in this study to decide the
optimum power level in the next iteration. It is determined anew depending upon
the present network scenario. Simulation results show that our proposed work
leads the network to equilibrium by reducing energy consumption and maintaining

sparse regression, and developments in mathematical optimization over the past
decade have made it more computationally tractable than ever. Notwithstanding
its desirable statistical properties, the best subsets estimator is susceptible
to outliers and can break down in the presence of a single contaminated data
point. To address this issue, a robust adaption of best subsets is proposed
that is highly resistant to contamination in both the response and the
predictors. The adapted estimator generalizes the notion of subset selection to
both predictors and observations, thereby achieving robustness in addition to
sparsity. This procedure, referred to as ""robust subset selection"" (or ""robust
subsets""), is defined by a combinatorial optimization problem for which modern
discrete optimization methods are applied. The robustness of the estimator in
terms of the finite-sample breakdown point of its objective value is formally
established. In support of this result, experiments on synthetic and real data
are reported that demonstrate the superiority of robust subsets over best
subsets in the presence of contamination. Importantly, robust subsets fares
competitively across several metrics compared with popular robust adaptions of

in five dimensional warped cosmological spacetimes is studied. The four
dimensional part of our model represents a warped cosmological thick brane and
the scale of the extra dimension is time-dependent. We use a simple ansatz to
solve the Dirac equation in the bulk that helps us to compare our results with
the known four dimensional case. Renormalisation of the components of the
energy momentum tensor is achieved using adiabatic regularization method. We
compute the leading order finite contribution to the stress-energy tensor which
is of adiabatic order six. The resulting energy and pressure densities
explicitly show the effects of the so-called warping factor and the dynamic
extra dimension on the created matter. We show how the energy density produced
are localized to form 3-branes along the extra dimension.

general compensation scheme for reducing total harmonic distortion at the local
WT buses and the specific compensation scheme for reducing the selected-order
harmonics at the remote PCC are combined in the proposed harmonic mitigation

to predict a feasible robotic grasping for a unsymmetrical three-finger robotic
gripper using RGB images. The feasible grasping of a target should be a
collection of grasp regions with the same grasp angle and width. In other
words, a simplified planar grasp representation should be pixel-level rather
than region-level such as five-dimensional grasp representation.Therefore, we
propose a pixel-level grasp representation, oriented base-fixed triangle. It is
also more suitable for unsymmetrical three-finger gripper which cannot grasp
symmetrically when grasping some objects, the grasp angle is at [0, 2{\pi})
instead of [0, {\pi}) of parallel plate gripper.In order to predict the
appropriate grasp region and its corresponding grasp angle and width in the RGB
image, SGDN uses DeepLabv3+ as a feature extractor, and uses a three-channel
grasp predictor to predict feasible oriented base-fixed triangle grasp
representation of each pixel.On the re-annotated Cornell Grasp Dataset, our
model achieves an accuracy of 96.8% and 92.27% on image-wise split and

the global pandemic. At each stage, sentiment analysis enables us to recognize
the negative sentiment from tweets with racist hashtags, and keyword extraction
allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by
these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based

that heating of ions is related to the Lower-Hybrid-Drift (LHD) instability,
and heating of electrons to the Electron-Cyclotron-Drift (ECD) instability.
Both processes represent stochastic acceleration caused by the electric field
gradients on the electron gyroradius scales, produced by the two instabilities.
Stochastic heating is a single particle mechanism where large gradients break
adiabatic invariants and expose particles to direct acceleration by the DC- and
wave-fields. The acceleration is controlled by function $\chi = m_iq_i^{-1}
B^{-2}$div($\mathbf{E}$), which represents a general diagnostic tool for
processes of energy transfer between electromagnetic fields and particles, and
the measure of the local charge non-neutrality. The identification was made
with multipoint measurements obtained from the Magnetospheric Multiscale
spacecraft (MMS). The source for the LHD instability is the diamagnetic drift
of ions, and for the ECD instability the source is ExB drift of electrons. The
conclusions are supported by laboratory diagnostics of the ECD instability in
Hall ion thrusters.

  https://github.com/bknyaz/sgg",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to predict graph-structured descriptions of
input images, in the form of objects and relationships between them. This task
is becoming increasingly useful for progress at the interface of vision and
language. Here, it is important - yet challenging - to perform well on novel
(zero-shot) or rare (few-shot) compositions of objects and relationships. In
this paper, we identify two key issues that limit such generalization. Firstly,
we show that the standard loss used in this task is unintentionally a function
of scene graph density. This leads to the neglect of individual edges in large
sparse graphs during training, even though these contain diverse few-shot
examples that are important for generalization. Secondly, the frequency of
relationships can create a strong bias in this task, such that a blind model
predicting the most frequent relationship achieves good performance.
Consequently, some state-of-the-art models exploit this bias to improve
results. We show that such models can suffer the most in their ability to
generalize to rare compositions, evaluating two different models on the Visual
Genome dataset and its more recent, improved version, GQA. To address these
issues, we introduce a density-normalized edge loss, which provides more than a
two-fold improvement in certain generalization metrics. Compared to other works
in this direction, our enhancements require only a few lines of code and no
added computational cost. We also highlight the difficulty of accurately
evaluating models using existing metrics, especially on zero/few shots, and
introduce a novel weighted metric.

characteristics within the dataset on which the algorithms are trained, i.e.,
the data does not warrant a generalized inference. We, however, hypothesize
that a different `mechanism', hitherto not articulated in the literature, may
also be responsible for machine's bias, namely that biases may originate from
(i) the programmers' cultural background, such as education or line of work, or
(ii) the contextual programming environment, such as software requirements or
developer tools. Combining an experimental and comparative design, we studied
the effects of cultural metaphors and contextual metaphors, and tested whether
each of these would `transfer' from the programmer to program, thus
constituting a machine bias. The results show (i) that cultural metaphors
influence the programmer's choices and (ii) that `induced' contextual metaphors
can be used to moderate or exacerbate the effects of the cultural metaphors.
This supports our hypothesis that biases in automated systems do not always
originate from within the machine's training data. Instead, machines may also
`replicate' and `reproduce' biases from the programmers' cultural background by
the transfer of cultural metaphors into the programming process. Implications
for academia and professional practice range from the micro programming-level
to the macro national-regulations or educational level, and span across all
societal domains where software-based systems are operating such as the popular
AI-based automated decision support systems.

ubiquitous in nature and engineering, model reduction methods are not well
developed for non-equilibrium behaviors. The proposed framework addresses this
need by exploiting recent advances on dominance theory. Classical balanced
truncation for linear time-invariant systems is used to develop a
dominance-preserving model reduction method for Lure systems, i.e. systems that
can be decomposed as the feedback interconnection of a linear system and a
static nonlinearity. The method is illustrated by approximating the oscillatory
behavior of a discretized heat flow control system.

$\Delta_d$ at the place where the field strength $B$ is strongest are

either due to external periodic modulations or to self-pulsing phenomena
typically following a Hopf bifurcation. In both cases, the quantum fluctuations
around classical solutions do not reach a quantum-statistical stationary state,
which prevents adopting the simple and reliable methods used for stationary
quantum systems. Here we put forward a general and efficient method to compute
two-time correlations and corresponding spectral densities of time-periodic
open quantum systems within the usual linearized (Gaussian) approximation for
their dynamics. Using Floquet theory we show how the quantum Langevin equations
for the fluctuations can be efficiently integrated by partitioning the time
domain into one-period duration intervals, and relating the properties of each
period to the first one. Spectral densities, like squeezing spectra, are
computed similarly, now in a two-dimensional temporal domain that is treated as
a chessboard with one-period x one-period cells. This technique avoids
cumulative numerical errors as well as efficiently saves computational time. As
an illustration of the method, we analyze the quantum fluctuations of a damped
parametrically-driven oscillator (degenerate parametric oscillator) below
threshold and far away from rotating-wave approximation conditions, which is a
relevant scenario for modern low-frequency quantum oscillators. Our method
reveals that the squeezing properties of such devices are quite robust against
the amplitude of the modulation or the low quality of the oscillator, although
optimal squeezing can appear for parameters that are far from the ones
predicted within the rotating-wave approximation.

H$^{13}$CO$^+(J=2-1)$, SiO$(J=4-3)$, HN$^{13}$C$(J=2-1)$, and C$_2$H$(N=2-1)$.
While SO, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, and HN$^{13}$C were detected in every source, the

Only one source (SMM 3) showed detectable SiO emission (7.1% detection rate).
Three clumps (SMM 5, 6, and 7) showed the SO, H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$,
HN$^{13}$C, and C$_2$H lines in absorption. We found three positive
correlations among the derived molecular abundances, of which those between
C$_2$H and HN$^{13}$C and HN$^{13}$C and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ are the most
significant (correlation coefficient $r\simeq0.9$). The statistically most
significant evolutionary trends we uncovered are the drops in the C$_2$H
abundance and in the $[{\rm HN^{13}C}]/[{\rm H^{13}CN}]$ ratio as the clump
evolves from an IR dark stage to an IR bright stage and then to an HII region.
The correlations we found between the different molecular abundances can be
understood as arising from the gas-phase electron (ionisation degree) and
atomic carbon abundances. The [C$_2$H] evolutionary indicator we found is in
agreement with previous studies, and can be explained by the conversion of
C$_2$H to other species (e.g. CO) when the clump temperature rises, especially
after the ignition of a hot molecular core in the clump. The decrease of $[{\rm
HN^{13}C}]/[{\rm H^{13}CN}]$ as the clump evolves is also likely to reflect the
increase in the clump temperature, which leads to an enhanced formation of HCN
and its $^{13}$C isotopologue.

the semantic gap issue has been widely studied in the literature. However,
there are challenges that hinder their widespread use in real-world
applications. Among these challenges is the insufficient knowledge individually
encoded in existing medical ontologies, which is magnified when users express
their information needs using long-winded natural language queries. In this
context, many of the users query terms are either unrecognized by the used
ontologies, or cause retrieving false positives that degrade the quality of
current medical information search approaches. In this article, we explore the
combination of multiple extrinsic semantic resources in the development of a
full-fledged medical information search framework to: i) highlight and expand
head medical concepts in verbose medical queries (i.e. concepts among query
terms that significantly contribute to the informativeness and intent of a

contribute to a heuristical weighting technique in the query document matching
process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we

of a Frobenius manifold $M$. This is the set of points of the extended manifold
$\mathbb C^*\times M$ at which the unit vector field is a cyclic vector for the
isomonodromic system defined by the flatness condition of the extended deformed
connection. The study of the geometry of the complement of the cyclic stratum
is addressed. We show that at points of the cyclic stratum, the isomonodromic
system attached to $M$ can be reduced to a scalar differential equation, called
the ""master differential equation"" of $M$. In the case of Frobenius manifolds
coming from Gromov-Witten theory, namely quantum cohomologies of smooth
projective varieties, such a construction reproduces the notion of quantum
differential equation.
  In the second part of the paper, we introduce two multilinear transforms,
called ""Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol \alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms"",
on spaces of Ribenboim formal power series with exponents and coefficients in
an arbitrary finite dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra $A$. When $A$ is
specialized to the cohomology of smooth projective varieties, the integral
forms of the Borel-Laplace $(\boldsymbol
\alpha,\boldsymbol\beta)$-multitransforms are used in order to rephrase the
Quantum Lefschetz Theorem. This leads to explicit Mellin-Barnes integral
representations of solutions of the quantum differential equations for a wide
class of smooth projective varieties, including Fano complete intersections in
projective spaces.
  In the third and final part of the paper, as an application, we show how to
use the new analytic tools, introduced in the previous parts, in order to study
the quantum differential equations of Hirzebruch surfaces. This finally leads
to the proof of Dubrovin Conjecture for all Hirzebruch surfaces.

that create a large matching in the sampled graphs. We define the price of
stochasticity for this problem which intuitively captures the loss of any
algorithm in the worst case in the size of the matching due to the uncertainty
of the model. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a deterministic optimal
algorithm for the problem. In our second set of results we show that we can
efficiently approximate the expected size of a maximum cardinality matching by
deriving a fully randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for it. The FPRAS is
the backbone of a probabilistic algorithm that is optimal when the model is
defined over two timesteps. Our last result is an upper bound of $\frac{2}{3}$
on the price of stochasticity. This means that there is no algorithm that can
match more than $\frac{2}{3}$ of the edges of an optimal matching in hindsight.

we propose modeling the distribution of the observed values of each object as a
blending of a cluster effect and an individual effect, hence also giving an
estimate of how much the behavior of an object is determined by the cluster to
which it belongs. Further, it is important to detect how explanatory variables
affect the clustering. An advantage of our method is that it can handle
multiple explanatory variables of any type through a linear modeling of the

induced by illuminating Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with a Gaussian laser
beam, can help trap a spinor Bose gas in multi-dimensional space. Previous
works on this topic were all based on a Boson gas featuring an attractive
interaction. In this paper, we consider the trapping effect in the case in
which the Boson gas features a repulsive interaction. After replacing the
repulsive effect, stable excited modes of semi-vortex (SV) type and mixed-mode
(MM) type, which cannot be created in a boson gas with attractive interactions,
can be found in the current setting. The trapping ability and the capacity of
the confined SO coupling versus the degree of the repulsive strength as well as
the order of the excited mode are systematically discussed firstly through the
paper. Moreover, the stability of the nonlinear mode trapped in this system
with a moving reference frame is also discussed. Unlike the system with
homogeneous SO coupling, two different types of stationary mobility modes can
be stabilized when the SO coupling moves in the x- and y- directions,
respectively. This finding indicates that the system with moving confined SO
coupling features a typical anisotropic character that differs from the system

important. Accurate estimates of physical size, dust masses, and some other
properties of SNRs depend critically on accurate distance measurements.
However, the determination of SNR distances is still a tough task. Red clump
stars (RCs) have a long history been used as standard candles. In this work, we
take RCs as tracers to determine the distances to a large group of SNRs in the
inner disk. We first select RC stars based on the near-infrared (IR)
color-magnitude diagram (CMD). Then, the distance to and extinction of RC stars
are calculated. To extend the measurable range of distance, we combine near-IR
photometric data from the 2MASS survey with the deeper UKIDSS and VVV surveys.
With the help of the Gaia parallaxes, we also remove contaminants including
dwarfs and giants. Because an SN explosion compresses the surrounding
interstellar medium, the SNR region would become denser and exhibit higher
extinction than the surroundings. The distance of a SNR is then recognized by
the position where the extinction and its gradient is higher than that of the
ambient medium. A total of 63 SNRs' distances in the Galactic inner disk are
determined and divided into three Levels A, B, and C with decreasing
reliability. The distances to 43 SNRs are well determined with reliability A or
B. The diameters and dust masses of SNRs are estimated with the obtained
distance and extinction.

detect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them
inefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious
contract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.
  In this paper, we present the design of a scalable attack detection framework
on Ethereum. It overcomes the scalability issue by saving the Ethereum state

arbitrary transactions. The state is well-designed to avoid saving unnecessary

  mobile chasses and inertial measurement units based on nonlinear optimization",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mobile robot positioning, mapping, and navigation systems generally employ an
inertial measurement unit (IMU) to obtain the acceleration and angular velocity
of the robot. However, errors in the internal and external parameters of an IMU
arising from defective calibration directly affect the accuracy of robot
positioning and pose estimation. While this issue has been addressed by the
mature internal reference calibration methods available for IMUs, external
reference calibration methods between the IMU and the chassis of a mobile robot
are lacking. This study addresses this issue by proposing a novel chassis-IMU
internal and external parameter calibration algorithm based on nonlinear
optimization, which is designed for robots equipped with cameras, IMUs, and
wheel speed odometers, and functions under the premise of accurate calibrations
for the internal parameters of the IMU and the internal and external parameters
of the camera. All of the internal and external reference calibrations are
conducted using the robot's existing equipment without the need for additional
calibration aids. The feasibility of the method is verified by its application
to a Mecanum wheel omnidirectional mobile platform as an example, as well as
suitable for other type chassis of mobile robots. The proposed calibration
method is thereby demonstrated to guarantee the accuracy of robot pose
estimation.

the PDE problem admit series representations, and thus the difficulty in
verifying the link between the density function and the PDE solution in each

controversial. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that the motor cortex can

trained on foreign language (L2) words and their native language translations
over four consecutive days. L2 words were accompanied by complementary gestures
(sensorimotor enrichment) or pictures (sensory enrichment). Following training,
participants translated the auditorily-presented L2 words that they had learned
and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) was applied to the
bilateral posterior motor cortices. Compared to sham stimulation, effective
perturbation by rTMS slowed down the translation of sensorimotor-enriched L2

sensorimotor-enriched training induced changes in L2 representations within the
motor cortex, which in turn facilitated the translation of L2 words. The motor
cortex may play a causal role in precipitating sensorimotor-based learning
benefits, and may directly aid in remembering the native language translations
of foreign language words following sensorimotor-enriched training. These
findings support multisensory theories of learning while challenging

or natural systems whose primary goal is the transportation of information or
goods. We say that a graph $\mathcal{G}$ is navigable when an agent is able to
efficiently reach any target node in $\mathcal{G}$ by means of local routing
decisions. In a social network navigability translates to the ability of
reaching an individual through personal contacts. Graph navigability is
well-studied, but a fundamental question is still open: why are some
individuals more likely than others to be reached via short,
friend-of-a-friend, communication chains? In this article we answer the
question above by proposing a novel centrality metric called the potential
gain, which, in an informal sense, quantifies the easiness at which a target
node can be reached. We define two variants of the potential gain, called the
geometric and the exponential potential gain, and present fast algorithms to
compute them. The geometric and the potential gain are the first instances of a
novel class of composite centrality metrics, i.e., centrality metrics which
combine the popularity of a node in $\mathcal{G}$ with its similarity to all
other nodes. As shown in previous studies, popularity and similarity are two
main criteria which regulate the way humans seek for information in large
networks such as Wikipedia. We give a formal proof that the potential gain of a
node is always equivalent to the product of its degree centrality (which
captures popularity) and its Katz centrality (which captures similarity).

predictions, they mostly require protected structures, moreover, they are at
risk of several attacks. IoTs are endowed with particular routing disobedience
called sinkhole attack owing to their distributed features. In these attacks, a
malicious node broadcasts illusive information regarding the routings to impose
itself as a route towards specific nodes for the neighboring nodes and thus,
attract data traffic. RPL (IP-V6 routing protocol for efficient and low-energy

networks and IoT. This protocol is called SoS-RPL consisting of two key
sections of the sinkhole detection. In the first section rating and ranking the

technique is assessed through wide simulations performed within the NS-3

joint distribution of the attributes of a network's actors. This class of
models can estimate both the effect of individual characteristics as well as
the network effect, or social influence, on some actor attribute of interest.
Collecting data on the entire network, however, is very often infeasible or
impossible if the network boundary is unknown or difficult to define. Obtaining
egocentric network data overcomes these obstacles, but as of yet there has been
no clear way to model this type of data and still appropriately capture the
network effect on the actor attributes in a way that is compatible with a joint
distribution on the full network data. This paper adapts the class of network
autocorrelation models to handle egocentric data. The proposed methods thus
incorporate the complex dependence structure of the data induced by the network
rather than simply using ad hoc measures of the egos' networks to model the
mean structure, and can estimate the network effect on the actor attribute of
interest. The vast quantities of unknown information about the network can be
succinctly represented in such a way that only depends on the number of alters
in the egocentric network data and not on the total number of actors in the
network. Estimation is done within a Bayesian framework. A simulation study is
performed to evaluate the estimation performance, and an egocentric data set is
analyzed where the aim is to determine if there is a network effect on
environmental mastery, an important aspect of psychological well-being.

applied to network data there are unrealistic assumptions made about the
dependence structure of the data. For temporal networks measured in discrete
time, recent work has made good advances \citep{almquist2014logistic}, but
there is still the assumption that the dyads are conditionally independent
given the edge histories. This assumption can be quite strong and is sometimes
difficult to justify. If time steps are rather large, one would typically
expect not only the existence of temporal dependencies among the dyads across
observed time points but also the existence of simultaneous dependencies
affecting how the dyads of the network co-evolve. We propose a general
observation driven model for dynamic networks which overcomes this problem by
modeling both the mean and the covariance structures as functions of the edge
histories using a flexible autoregressive approach. This approach can be shown
to fit into a generalized linear mixed model framework. We propose a
visualization method which provides evidence concerning the existence of
simultaneous dependence. We describe a simulation study to determine the
method's performance in the presence and absence of simultaneous dependence,
and we analyze both a proximity network from conference attendees and a world
trade network. We also use this last data set to illustrate how simultaneous
dependencies become more prominent as the time intervals become coarser.

intragroup, heterogeneity can be useful in enhancing the effectiveness of many
socio-economic policy interventions; yet it has received little attention in
promoting clean cooking. Here, we use PERMANOVA, a distance-based multivariate
analysis, to identify the factor that captures the highest intergroup
heterogeneity in the choice of cooking fuels. Applying this approach to the
post-earthquake data on 747,137 households from Nepal, we find that ethnicity
explains 39.12% of variation in fuel choice, followed by income (26.30%),
education (12.62%), and location (4.05%). This finding indicates that
ethnicity, rather than income or other factors, as a basis of policy
interventions may be more effective in promoting clean cooking. We also find
that, among the ethnic groups in Nepal, the most marginalized Chepang/Thami
community exhibits the lowest intragroup diversity (Shannon index = 0.101)
while Newars the highest (0.667). This information on intra-ethnic diversity in
fuel choice can have important policy implications for reducing ethnic gap in
clean cooking.

to social influence, however, which may be a strong assumption in many

parameter to be a function of individual attributes and/or of local network
topological features. We derive an approximation of the posterior distribution
in a general framework that is applicable to the Durbin, network effects,
network disturbances, or network moving average autocorrelation models. The
proposed approach can also be applied to investigating determinants of social
influence in the context of egocentric network data. We apply our method to a
data set collected via mobile phones in which we determine the effect of social
influence on physical activity levels, as well as classroom data in which we
investigate peer influence on student defiance. With this last data set, we
also investigate the performance of the proposed egocentric network model.

agencies to explore the development of scenarios over differing timeframes. For
example, how would the reduction in cost of renewable energy impact investments
in gas power plants or what would be an optimum strategy for carbon tax or
subsidies? Cost optimization based solutions are the dominant approach for
understanding different long-term energy scenarios. However, these types of
models have certain limitations such as the need to be interpreted in a
normative manner, and the assumption that the electricity market remains in
equilibrium throughout. Through this work, we show that agent-based models are
a viable technique to simulate decentralised electricity markets. The aim of
this paper is to validate an agent-based modelling framework to increase
confidence in its ability to be used in policy and decision making. Our
framework can model heterogeneous agents with imperfect information. The model
uses a rules-based approach to approximate the underlying dynamics of a real
world, decentralised electricity market. We use the UK as a case study,
however, our framework is generalisable to other countries. We increase the
temporal granularity of the model by selecting representative days of
electricity demand and weather using a $k$-means clustering approach. We show
that our framework can model the transition from coal to gas observed in the UK
between 2013 and 2018. We are also able to simulate a future scenario to 2035
which is similar to the UK Government, Department for Business and Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) projections. We show a more realistic increase in nuclear power
over this time period. This is due to the fact that with current nuclear
technology, electricity is generated almost instantaneously and has a low
short-run marginal cost \cite{Department2016}.

learning models by arbitrarily modifying pixels within a restricted region of
an image. Such attacks can be realized in the physical world by attaching the
adversarial patch to the object to be misclassified, and defending against such
attacks is an unsolved/open problem. In this paper, we propose a general
defense framework called PatchGuard that can achieve high provable robustness
while maintaining high clean accuracy against localized adversarial patches.
The cornerstone of PatchGuard involves the use of CNNs with small receptive
fields to impose a bound on the number of features corrupted by an adversarial
patch. Given a bounded number of corrupted features, the problem of designing
an adversarial patch defense reduces to that of designing a secure feature
aggregation mechanism. Towards this end, we present our robust masking defense
that robustly detects and masks corrupted features to recover the correct
prediction. Notably, we can prove the robustness of our defense against any
adversary within our threat model. Our extensive evaluation on ImageNet,
ImageNette (a 10-class subset of ImageNet), and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrates
that our defense achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
provable robust accuracy and clean accuracy.

representations of the molecules. One promising route is to exploit the
molecular graph structure through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well
known that both atoms and bonds significantly affect the chemical properties of
a molecule, so an expressive model shall be able to exploit both node (atom)
and edge (bond) information simultaneously. Guided by this observation, we
present Multi-View Graph Neural Network (MV-GNN), a multi-view message passing
architecture to enable more accurate predictions of molecular properties. In
MV-GNN, we introduce a shared self-attentive readout component and disagreement
loss to stabilize the training process. This readout component also renders the
whole architecture interpretable. We further boost the expressive power of
MV-GNN by proposing a cross-dependent message passing scheme that enhances
information communication of the two views, which results in the MV-GNN^cross
variant. Lastly, we theoretically justify the expressiveness of the two
proposed models in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphism graphs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MV-GNN models achieve remarkably superior
performance over the state-of-the-art models on a variety of challenging

efficiency on neuromorphic processors like the Intel Loihi research chip, and
fed by event-based sensors, such as DVS cameras. However, DNNs with many layers
can achieve relatively high accuracy on image classification and recognition
tasks, as the research on learning rules for SNNs for real-world applications
is still not mature. The accuracy results for SNNs are typically obtained
either by converting the trained DNNs into SNNs, or by directly designing and
training SNNs in the spiking domain. Towards the conversion from a DNN to an
SNN, we perform a comprehensive analysis of such process, specifically designed
for Intel Loihi, showing our methodology for the design of an SNN that achieves
nearly the same accuracy results as its corresponding DNN. Towards the usage of
the event-based sensors, we design a pre-processing method, evaluated for the
DvsGesture dataset, which makes it possible to be used in the DNN domain.
Hence, based on the outcome of the first analysis, we train a DNN for the
pre-processed DvsGesture dataset, and convert it into the spike domain for its
deployment on Intel Loihi, which enables real-time gesture recognition. The
