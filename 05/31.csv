  //github.com/JianqiangWan/Super-BPD",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image segmentation is a fundamental vision task and a crucial step for many
applications. In this paper, we propose a fast image segmentation method based
on a novel super boundary-to-pixel direction (super-BPD) and a customized
segmentation algorithm with super-BPD. Precisely, we define BPD on each pixel
as a two-dimensional unit vector pointing from its nearest boundary to the
pixel. In the BPD, nearby pixels from different regions have opposite
directions departing from each other, and adjacent pixels in the same region
have directions pointing to the other or each other (i.e., around medial
points). We make use of such property to partition an image into super-BPDs,
which are novel informative superpixels with robust direction similarity for
fast grouping into segmentation regions. Extensive experimental results on
BSDS500 and Pascal Context demonstrate the accuracy and efficency of the
proposed super-BPD in segmenting images. In practice, the proposed super-BPD
achieves comparable or superior performance with MCG while running at ~25fps
vs. 0.07fps. Super-BPD also exhibits a noteworthy transferability to unseen
scenes. The code is publicly available at

cancer across the globe. With the popularity of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable
attention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence,
these can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However,
the development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the
non-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the
malignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper
discusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep
learning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The
proposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet$^{\theta}$ is a 2-module framework
that utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel
SVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses
features through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the
auxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved
quantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB
images. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers
for decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class
labels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released
public dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the
validity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level
variability. A weighted F1 score of 94.8$\%$ is obtained that is best so far on
this challenging dataset.

GNN-Explainer, they assume access to the gradients of the model to learn

non-differentiable relational models and practicality. In this work, we develop
RelEx, a model-agnostic relational explainer to explain black-box relational

$0.59~M_{\odot}$, and reveals a shoulder from relatively massive white dwarfs
with $M=0.7$-$0.9~M_{\odot}$. Comparing this distribution with binary
population synthesis models, we find that the contribution from single stars

dwarfs. In addition, the mass distribution of cool DAs shows a near absence of
$M>1~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs. The pile-up of 0.7-$0.9~M_{\odot}$ and the
disappearance of $M>1~M_{\odot}$ white dwarfs is consistent with the effects of
core crystallization. Even though the evolutionary models predict the location
of the pile-up correctly, the delay from the latent heat of crystallization by
itself is insufficient to create a significant pile-up, and additional cooling
delays from related effects like phase separation are necessary. We also

predictor and an outcome when the relation is known to be monotone or otherwise
constrained due to the physical processes involved. We consider one such
application--inferring time-resolved aerosol concentration from a low-cost
differential pressure sensor. The objective is to estimate a monotone function
and make inference on the scaled first derivative of the function. We proposed
Bayesian nonparametric monotone regression which uses a Bernstein polynomial
basis to construct the regression function and puts a Dirichlet process prior
on the regression coefficients. The base measure of the Dirichlet process is a
finite mixture of a mass point at zero and a truncated normal. This
construction imposes monotonicity while clustering the basis functions.
Clustering the basis functions reduces the parameter space and allows the
estimated regression function to be linear. With the proposed approach we can
make closed-formed inference on the derivative of the estimated function
including full quantification of uncertainty. In a simulation study the
proposed method performs similar to other monotone regression approaches when
the true function is wavy but performs better when the true function is linear.
We apply the method to estimate time-resolved aerosol concentration with a
newly-developed portable aerosol monitor. The R package bnmr is made available
to implement the method.

using statistical mechanics approaches for decades, the coupled response under
deformation and electrical field has largely been modeled only
phenomenologically at the continuum scale. In this work, we examine the physics
of the coupled deformation and electrical response of an
electrically-responsive polymer chain using statistical mechanics. We begin
with a simple anisotropic model for the electrostatic dipole response to
electric field of a single monomer, and use a separation of energy scales
between the electrostatic field energy and the induced dipole field energy to
reduce the nonlocal and infinite-dimensional statistical averaging to a simpler
local finite-dimensional averaging. In this simplified setting, we derive the
equations of the most likely monomer orientation density using the maximum term
approximation, and a chain free energy is derived using this approximation.
These equations are investigated numerically and the results provide insight
into the physics of electro-mechanically coupled elastomer chains. Closed-form
approximations are also developed in the limit of small electrical energy with
respect to thermal energy; in the limit of small mechanical tension force
acting on the chain; and using asymptotic matching for general chain
conditions.

randomized trials comparing standard care with care augmented by experimental
drugs. The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects
are imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may
find it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs.
Whatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that
random variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal
treatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an
innovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect
is positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard
care as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of
near-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of
decision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the
empirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed
average patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and
ongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields
treatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by
prevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.

successive measurement of two observables $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$, with
eigenvalues $a_n$ and $b_m$, respectively, performed on the same system. We use
an extension of the von Neumann model of measurement, in which two probes
interact with the same system proper at two successive times, so we can exhibit
how the disturbing effect of the first interaction affects the second
measurement. Detecting the statistical properties of the second {\em probe}
variable $Q_2$ conditioned on the first {\em probe} measurement yielding $Q_1$
we obtain information on the statistical distribution of the {\em system}
variable $b_m$ conditioned on having found the system variable $a_n$ in the
interval $\delta a$ around $a^{(n)}$. The width of this statistical
distribution as function of $\delta a$ constitutes an {\em uncertainty
relation}. We find a general connection of this uncertainty relation with the
commutator of the two observables that have been measured successively. We
illustrate this relation for the successive measurement of position and
momentum in the discrete and in the continuous cases and, within a model, for
the successive measurement of a more general class of observables.

superconducting layers and of superconducting proximity at both
superconductor/ferromagnet interfaces a massive shift of the ferromagnetic
resonance to higher frequencies emerges. The phenomenon is robust and
essentially long-range: it has been observed for a set of samples with the
thickness of ferromagnetic layer in the range from tens up to hundreds of
nanometers. The resonance frequency shift is characterized by proximity-induced
magnetic anisotropies: by the positive in-plane uniaxial anisotropy and by the
drop of magnetization. The shift and the corresponding uniaxial anisotropy grow
with the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer. For instance, the anisotropy
reaches 0.27~T in experiment for a sample with 350~nm thick ferromagnetic
layer, and about 0.4~T in predictions, which makes it a ferromagnetic film
structure with the highest anisotropy and the highest natural resonance
frequency ever reported. Various scenarios for the superconductivity-induced
magnetic anisotropy are discussed. As a result, the origin of the phenomenon
remains unclear. Application of the proximity-induced anisotropies in
superconducting magnonics is proposed as a way for manipulations with a

ZnTe(en)0.5 - a hybrid superlattice, and applying an array of optical,
structural, surface, thermal, and electrical characterization techniques in
conjunction with density-functional theory calculations, we have performed a
comprehensive and correlative study of the crystalline quality, structural
degradation, electronic, optical, and transport properties on samples from over
15-years old to the recently synthesized. The findings show that not only do
they exhibit an exceptionally high level of crystallinity in both macroscopic

greatly enhanced material properties, compared to those of the inorganic

structure and property as freshly made ones. This study reveals (1) what level
of structural perfectness is achievable in a complex organic-inorganic hybrid

make periodically stacked heterostructures with abrupt interfaces; and (2) how
the stability of a hybrid material is affected differently by its intrinsic
attributes, primarily formation energy, and extrinsic factors, such as surface

we study the role of transfer learning for training fully convolutional
networks (FCNs) for medical image segmentation. Our experiments show that
although transfer learning reduces the training time on the target task, the
improvement in segmentation accuracy is highly task/data-dependent. Larger
improvements in accuracy are observed when the segmentation task is more
challenging and the target training data is smaller. We observe that
convolutional filters of an FCN change little during training for medical image
segmentation, and still look random at convergence. We further show that quite
accurate FCNs can be built by freezing the encoder section of the network at
random values and only training the decoder section. At least for medical image
segmentation, this finding challenges the common belief that the encoder
section needs to learn data/task-specific representations. We examine the
evolution of FCN representations to gain a better insight into the effects of
transfer learning on the training dynamics. Our analysis shows that although
FCNs trained via transfer learning learn different representations than FCNs
trained with random initialization, the variability among FCNs trained via
transfer learning can be as high as that among FCNs trained with random
initialization. Moreover, feature reuse is not restricted to the early encoder
layers; rather, it can be more significant in deeper layers. These findings
offer new insights and suggest alternative ways of training FCNs for medical

percolation to multiplex networks, the mutually connected clusters, which
requires an interconnecting path within each layer between any two vertices in
the giant mutually connected component. We study the emergence of a giant
connected component of active nodes under the weak percolation rule, finding
several non-typical phenomena. In two layers, the giant component emerges with
a continuos phase transition, but with quadratic growth above the critical
threshold. In three or more layers, a discontinuous hybrid transition occurs,
similar to that found in the giant mutually connected component. In networks
with asymptotically powerlaw degree distributions, defined by the decay
exponent $\gamma$, the discontinuity vanishes but at $\gamma=1.5$ in three
layers, more generally at $\gamma = 1+ 1/(M-1)$ in $M$ layers.

efficient coupling of a plasmonic antenna to hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in

remarkable device performance featuring room temperature high sensitivity (NEP

changes in global societies, forcing many citizens to re-skill themselves to
(re)gain employment. Learners therefore need to be equipped with skills to be
autonomous and strategic about their own skill development. Subsequently,
high-quality, on-line, personalized educational content and services are also
essential to serve this high demand for learning content. Open Educational
Resources (OERs) have high potential to contribute to the mitigation of these
problems, as they are available in a wide range of learning and occupational
contexts globally. However, their applicability has been limited, due to low
metadata quality and complex quality control. These issues resulted in a lack
of personalised OER functions, like recommendation and search. Therefore, we
suggest a novel, personalised OER recommendation method to match skill
development targets with open learning content. This is done by: 1) using an
OER quality prediction model based on metadata, OER properties, and content; 2)
supporting learners to set individual skill targets based on actual labour
market information, and 3) building a personalized OER recommender to help
learners to master their skill targets. Accordingly, we built a prototype
focusing on Data Science related jobs, and evaluated this prototype with 23
data scientists in different expertise levels. Pilot participants used our
prototype for at least 30 minutes and commented on each of the recommended
OERs. As a result, more than 400 recommendations were generated and 80.9% of
the recommendations were reported as useful.

that the expected length $L_{n}$ of its LIS scales with the length $n$ of the

far as the behavior of the LIS is concerned the ultra-fat tailed distribution
can be thought of as equivalent to a very heavy tailed $\alpha$-stable

universal, in agreement with results obtained for other heavy tailed random

connections in surprising places. The Milnor-Wood inequality is for circle
bundles over surfaces, whereas the Mather-Thurston Theorem is about cobording
general manifold bundles to ones admitting a flat connection. The surprise
comes from the close encounter with obstructions from Chern-Weyl theory and
other smooth obstructions such as the Bott classes and the Godbillion-Vey
invariant. Contradiction is avoided because the structure groups for the
positive results are larger than required for the obstructions, e.g.\
$\operatorname{PSL}(2,\R)$ versus $\operatorname{U}(1)$ in the former case and
$C^1$ versus $C^2$ in the latter. This paper adds two types of control
strengthening the positive results: In many cases we are able to (1) refine the
Mather-Thurston cobordism to a semi-$s$-cobordism (ssc) and (2) provide detail
about how, and to what extent, transition functions must wander from an
initial, small, structure group into a larger one.
  The motivation is to lay mathematical foundations for a physical program. The
philosophy is that living in the IR we cannot expect to know, for a given
bundle, if it has curvature or is flat, because we can't resolve the fine scale
topology which may be present in the base, introduced by a ssc, nor minute
symmetry violating distortions of the fiber. Small scale, UV, ""distortions"" of
the base topology and structure group allow flat connections to simulate
curvature at larger scales. The goal is to find a duality under which curvature
terms, such as Maxwell's $F \wedge F^\ast$ and Hilbert's $\int R\ dvol$ are
replaced by an action which measures such ""distortions."" In this view,
curvature results from renormalizing a discrete, group theoretic, structure.

Recent work of [ASWB20] has initiated the study of delayed hits: a phenomenon
in caches that occurs when the latency between the cache and backing store is
much larger than the time between new requests. We present two results for the
delayed hits caching model.
  (1) Competitive ratio lower bound. We prove that the competitive ratio of the
algorithm in [ASWB20], and more generally of any deterministic online algorithm

delay parameter.
  (2) Antimonotonicity of the delayed hits latency. Antimonotonicity is a
naturally desirable property of cache latency: having a cache hit instead of a
cache miss should result in lower overall latency. We prove that the latency of
the delayed hits model is not antimonotone by exhibiting a scenario where
having a cache hit instead of a miss results in an increase in overall latency.
We additionally present a modification of the delayed hits model that makes the
latency antimonotone.

online scheduling. The goal is to assign a sequence of jobs to $m$ identical
parallel machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job.
Already in the 1960s, Graham showed that Greedy is $(2-1/m)$-competitive. The
best deterministic online algorithm currently known achieves a competitive
ratio of 1.9201. No deterministic online strategy can obtain a competitiveness
smaller than 1.88.
  In this paper, we study online makespan minimization in the popular
random-order model, where the jobs of a given input arrive as a random
permutation. It is known that Greedy does not attain a competitive factor
asymptotically smaller than 2 in this setting. We present the first improved
performance guarantees. Specifically, we develop a deterministic online
algorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 1.8478. The result relies on a
new analysis approach. We identify a set of properties that a random
permutation of the input jobs satisfies with high probability. Then we conduct
a worst-case analysis of our algorithm, for the respective class of
permutations. The analysis implies that the stated competitiveness holds not
only in expectation but with high probability. Moreover, it provides
mathematical evidence that job sequences leading to higher performance ratios
are extremely rare, pathological inputs. We complement the results by lower
bounds, for the random-order model. We show that no deterministic online
algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than 4/3. Moreover, no
deterministic online algorithm can attain a competitiveness smaller than 3/2
with high probability.

mobility pattern and dynamically varying computational requirements of
associated mobile devices, cloudlets at different parts of the network become
either overloaded or under-loaded. Hence, load balancing among neighboring
cloudlets appears to be an essential research problem. Nonetheless, the
existing load balancing frameworks are unsuitable for low-latency applications.
Thus, in this paper, we propose an economic and non-cooperative load balancing
game for low-latency applications among federated neighboring cloudlets from
the same as well as different service providers and heterogeneous classes of
job requests. Firstly, we propose a centralized incentive mechanism to compute
the pure strategy Nash equilibrium load balancing strategies of the cloudlets
under the supervision of a neutral mediator. With this mechanism, we ensure
that the truthful revelation of private information to the mediator is a
weakly-dominant strategy for all the federated cloudlets. Secondly, we propose
a continuous-action reinforcement learning automata-based algorithm, which
allows each cloudlet to independently compute the Nash equilibrium in a
completely distributed network setting. We critically study the convergence
properties of the designed learning algorithm, scaffolding our understanding of
the underlying load balancing game for faster convergence. Furthermore, through
extensive simulations, we study the impacts of exploration and exploitation on
learning accuracy. This is the first study to show the effectiveness of
reinforcement learning algorithms for load balancing games among neighboring

see how the under-damping effect influences the structure of the Euler system.
Different from the traditional view that the stronger damping usually makes the
solutions decaying faster, here surprisingly we recognize that the weaker
damping with $0\le\lambda<1$ enhances the faster decay for the solutions. The
adopted approach is the technical Fourier analysis and the Green function
method. The main difficulties caused by the time-dependent damping lie in
twofold: non-commutativity of the Fourier transform of the linearized operator
precludes explicit expression of the fundamental solution; time-dependent
evolution implies that the Green matrix $G(t,s)$ is not translation invariant,
i.e., $G(t,s)\ne G(t-s,0)$. We formulate the exact decay behavior of the Green

matrix by the Gaussian kernel with pairwise distances, and to follow with a
certain normalization (e.g. the row-stochastic normalization or its symmetric
variant). We demonstrate that the doubly-stochastic normalization of the
Gaussian kernel with zero main diagonal (i.e., no self loops) is robust to
heteroskedastic noise. That is, the doubly-stochastic normalization is
advantageous in that it automatically accounts for observations with different
noise variances. Specifically, we prove that in a suitable high-dimensional
setting where heteroskedastic noise does not concentrate too much in any

matrix converges to its clean counterpart with rate $m^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is

unfavorably under heteroskedastic noise. Furthermore, we provide examples of
simulated and experimental single-cell RNA sequence data with intrinsic
heteroskedasticity, where the advantage of the doubly-stochastic normalization

existence of an independent vertex set in the graph and also show that complex
behavior cannot emerge in $2 \times 2$ games. This links a property of the
dynamical system with a combinatorial graph property. We contrast this by
showing that ordinary rock-paper-scissors (RPS) exhibits chaos on the 3-cycle
and that on general graphs with $\geq 3$ vertices the network replicator with
RPS is a generalized Hamiltonian system. This stands in stark contrast to the
established fact that RPS does not exhibit chaos in the standard replicator
dynamics or the bimatrix replicator dynamics, which is equivalent to the
network replicator on a graph with one edge and two vertices ($K_2$).

Dansgaard-Oeschger events. In the model these abrupt climate changes are not
triggered by external perturbations but rather emerge in a dynamic
self-consistent model through complex interactions of the ocean, the atmosphere
and an intermittent process. The abrupt climate changes are caused in our model
by intermittencies in the sea-ice cover. The ocean is represented by a Stommel
two-box model, the atmosphere by a Lorenz-84 model and the sea-ice cover by a
deterministic approximation of correlated additive and multiplicative noise
(CAM) process. The key dynamical ingredients of the model are given by
stochastic limits of deterministic multi-scale systems and recent results in
deterministic homogenisation theory. The deterministic model reproduces
statistical features of actual ice-core data such as non-Gaussian
$\alpha$-stable behaviour. The proposed mechanism for abrupt millenial-scale
climate change only relies on the existence of a quantity, which exhibits
intermittent dynamics on an intermediate time scale. We consider as a
particular mechanism intermittent sea-ice cover where the intermittency is
generated by emergent atmospheric noise. However, other mechanisms such as
freshwater influxes may also be formulated within the proposed framework.

categories by aligning the visual and semantic information in a joint embedding
space. There exist four kinds of domain biases in Transductive ZSL, i.e.,
visual bias and semantic bias between two domains and two visual-semantic
biases in respective seen and unseen domains, but existing work only focuses on
the part of them, which leads to severe semantic ambiguity during the knowledge
transfer. To solve the above problem, we propose a novel Attribute-Induced Bias
Eliminating (AIBE) module for Transductive ZSL. Specifically, for the visual
bias between two domains, the Mean-Teacher module is first leveraged to bridge
the visual representation discrepancy between two domains with unsupervised
learning and unlabelled images. Then, an attentional graph attribute embedding
is proposed to reduce the semantic bias between seen and unseen categories,
which utilizes the graph operation to capture the semantic relationship between
categories. Besides, to reduce the semantic-visual bias in the seen domain, we
align the visual center of each category, instead of the individual visual data
point, with the corresponding semantic attributes, which further preserves the
semantic relationship in the embedding space. Finally, for the semantic-visual
bias in the unseen domain, an unseen semantic alignment constraint is designed
to align visual and semantic space in an unsupervised manner. The evaluations

used to characterize the quality of electron microscopes, photon sources and
particle beams. Emittance growth in high intensity charged particle beams is a
particularly challenging non-equilibrium statistical physics problem in which
effects such as disordered-induced heating and charge reorganization can lead
to very rapid degradation of emittance and beam quality. The concepts of free
energy and entropy have been utilized to improve conceptual understanding of
emittance dynamics. Here we develop a theory based on the second order cumulant
of particle distributions and use this formulation to exactly solve several one
dimensional problems. These solutions are important extensions of the existing
results for the free expansion dynamics of pancake bunches used in ultrafast
electron microscopy, which at short times are known to expand quadratically
with time[1-3]. Here we show that the squared emittance of a strictly planar
expanding bunch increases as a quadratic polynomial of time. We compare
theories based on individual particle trajectories with theories based on
distributions and expand the foundations of theories based on individual
particle trajectories, which we call the ""sample picture"". Our later work uses
this formulation to derive generalized envelope equations which capture
emittance growth effects in two and three dimensional systems.

reduces memory requirement and enables usage of simple algorithms like median

some or all iterations of the improved SGMs. In this paper, we propose a new
SGM, named PStorm, for solving nonconvex nonsmooth stochastic problems. With a
momentum-based variance reduction technique, PStorm can achieve the optimal
complexity result $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$ to produce a stochastic
$\varepsilon$-stationary solution, if a mean-squared smoothness condition
holds. Different from existing optimal methods, PStorm can achieve the
${O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ result by using only one or $O(1)$ samples in every
update. With this property, PStorm can be applied to online learning problems
that favor real-time decisions based on one or $O(1)$ new observations. In
addition, for large-scale machine learning problems, PStorm can generalize
better by small-batch training than other optimal methods that require
large-batch training and the vanilla SGM, as we demonstrate on training a
sparse fully-connected neural network and a sparse convolutional neural
network.

analysis with high-dimensional data. In the past decade, three types of test
statistics have been studied in the literature: quadratic form statistics,
maximum form statistics, and their weighted combination. It is known that
quadratic form statistics would suffer from low power against sparse
alternatives and maximum form statistics would suffer from low power against
dense alternatives. The weighted combination methods were introduced to enhance
the power of quadratic form statistics or maximum form statistics when the
weights are appropriately chosen. In this paper, we provide a new perspective
to exploit the full potential of quadratic form statistics and maximum form
statistics for testing high-dimensional covariance matrices. We propose a
scale-invariant power enhancement test based on Fisher's method to combine the
p-values of quadratic form statistics and maximum form statistics. After
carefully studying the asymptotic joint distribution of quadratic form
statistics and maximum form statistics, we prove that the proposed combination
method retains the correct asymptotic size and boosts the power against more
general alternatives. Moreover, we demonstrate the finite-sample performance in
simulation studies and a real application.

sequences in $\ell_2(\mathbb{Z})$ which are strictly bandlimited to a frequency

The timelimited DPSSs (sometimes referred to as the Slepian basis) are an
orthonormal set of vectors in $\mathbb{C}^N$ whose discrete time Fourier
transform (DTFT) is maximally concentrated in a frequency band $[-W,W]$. Due to
these properties, DPSSs have a wide variety of signal processing applications.
The DPSSs are the eigensequences of a timelimit-then-bandlimit operator and the
Slepian basis vectors are the eigenvectors of the so-called prolate matrix. The
eigenvalues in both cases are the same, and they exhibit a particular
clustering behavior -- slightly fewer than $2NW$ eigenvalues are very close to
$1$, slightly fewer than $N-2NW$ eigenvalues are very close to $0$, and very
few eigenvalues are not near $1$ or $0$. This eigenvalue behavior is critical
in many of the applications in which DPSSs are used. There are many asymptotic
characterizations of the number of eigenvalues not near $0$ or $1$. In
contrast, there are very few non-asymptotic results, and these don't fully
characterize the clustering behavior of the DPSS eigenvalues. In this work, we
establish two novel non-asymptotic bounds on the number of DPSS eigenvalues
between $\epsilon$ and $1-\epsilon$. Also, we obtain bounds detailing how close
the first $\approx 2NW$ eigenvalues are to $1$ and how close the last $\approx
N-2NW$ eigenvalues are to $0$. Furthermore, we extend these results to the
eigenvalues of the prolate spheroidal wave functions (PSWFs), which are the
continuous-time version of the DPSSs. Finally, we present numerical experiments

vanishes on an interval, (b) the spectral density $f(\lambda)$ has a very high

primordial black holes in early universe. Moreover, our nonequilibrium model
can resolve the inconsistency issue of the black hole back reaction under zero

Bose-Bose mixtures, by generalizing the conventional Bogoliubov theory to
include the bosonic pairing arising from the interspecies attraction. Our
pairing theory is fully equivalent to a variational approach and hence gives an
upper bound for the energy of quantum droplets. In three dimensions, we predict
the existence of a strongly interacting Bose droplet at the crossover from
Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) to Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS)
superfluids and map out the bosonic BEC-BCS crossover phase diagram. In one

eigenvalues are asymptotically close to the quantiles of a fixed parametric
distribution. This motivates us to propose a two-step method: the first step
uses bulk eigenvalues to estimate parameters of this distribution, and the
second step leverages these parameters to assist the estimation of $K$. The
resulting estimator $\hat{K}$ aggregates information in a large number of bulk
eigenvalues. We show the consistency of $\hat{K}$ under a standard spiked

extensive simulation studies show that the proposed method is robust and
outperforms the existing methods in a range of scenarios. We apply the proposed

loops with low string tension clump in the Galaxy due to slow loop decay and
low gravitational recoil, resulting in great enhancement to loop abundance in
the Galaxy. With an average separation of down to just a fraction of a kpc, and
the total power of gravitational wave (GW) emission dominated by harmonic modes
spanning a wide angular scale, resolved loops located in proximity are
powerful, persistent, and highly monochromatic sources of GW with a harmonic
signature not replicated by any other sources, making them prime targets for
direct detection by the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA),
whose frequency range is well-matched. Unlike detection of bursts where the
detection rate scales with loop abundance, the detection rate for harmonic
signal is the result of a complex interplay between the strength of GW
emission, loop abundance, and other sources of noise, and is most suitably
studied through numerical simulations. We develop a robust and flexible
framework for simulating loops in the Galaxy for predicting direct detection of
harmonic signal from resolved loops by LISA. Our simulation reveals that the
most accessible region in the parameter space consists of large loops
$\alpha=0.1$ with low tension $10^{-21}\lesssim G\mu\lesssim 10^{-19}$. Direct
detection of field theory cosmic strings is unlikely, with the detection

  Points to Lower Diagnostic Sensitivity for Common Mutations and Increased
  Incidence of Uncommon Mutations in Clinical Strains of Mycobacterium
  tuberculosis",,,,,"q-bio.GN q-bio.PE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Molecular testing is rapidly becoming integral to the global tuberculosis
(TB) control effort. Uncommon mechanisms of resistance can escape detection by
these platforms and lead to the development of Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR)
strains. This article is a systematic review of published articles that
reported isoniazid (INH) resistance-conferring mutations between September-2013
and December-2019. The aims were to catalogue mutations associated with INH
resistance, estimate their global prevalence and co-occurrence, and their
utility in molecular diagnostics. The genes commonly associated with INH
resistance, katG, inhA, fabG1, and the intergenic region oxyR-ahpC were
considered in this review. In total, 52 articles were included describing 5,632
INHR clinical isolates from 31 countries. The three most frequently mutated
loci continue to be katG315 (4,100), inhA-15 (786), and inhA-8 (105). However,
the diagnostic value of inhA-8 is far lower than previously thought, only
appearing in 25 (0.4%) INHR isolates that lacked a mutation at the first two
loci. Importantly, of the four katG loci recommended by the previous systematic
review for diagnostics, only katG315 was observed in our INHR isolates. This
indicates continued evolution and regional differences in INH resistance. We
have identified 58 loci (common to both systematic reviews) in three genomic
regions as a reliable basis for molecular diagnostics. We also report 49 new
loci associated with INH resistance. Including all observed mutations provides
a cumulative sensitivity of 85.1%. The most disconcerting is the remaining
14.9% of isolates that harbor an unknown mechanism of resistance, will escape
molecular detection, and likely convert to MDR-TB, further complicating
treatment. Integrating the information cataloged in this and other similar
studies into current diagnostic tools is essential for combating the emergence
of MDR-TB.

Such tools can be made more useful via data mining algorithms that select the
""actionable"" warnings; i.e. the warnings that are usually not ignored.
  In this paper, we look for actionable warnings within a sample of 5,675
actionable warnings seen in 31,058 static code warnings from FindBugs. We find
that data mining algorithms can find actionable warnings with remarkable ease.
Specifically, a range of data mining methods (deep learners, random forests,
decision tree learners, and support vector machines) all achieved very good
results (recalls and AUC (TRN, TPR) measures usually over 95% and false alarms
usually under 5%).
  Given that all these learners succeeded so easily, it is appropriate to ask
if there is something about this task that is inherently easy. We report that
while our data sets have up to 58 raw features, those features can be
approximated by less than two underlying dimensions. For such intrinsically
simple data, many different kinds of learners can generate useful models with
similar performance.
  Based on the above, we conclude that learning to recognize actionable static
code warnings is easy, using a wide range of learning algorithms, since the
underlying data is intrinsically simple. If we had to pick one particular
learner for this task, we would suggest linear SVMs (since, at least in our
sample, that learner ran relatively quickly and achieved the best median
performance) and we would not recommend deep learning (since this data is
intrinsically very simple).

may degrade in the presence of sharp gradients, as a result of the inability of
the network to capture the solution behavior globally. We posit that this
shortcoming may be remedied by introducing long-range (nonlocal) interactions
into the network's input, in addition to the short-range (local) space and time
variables. Following this ansatz, here we develop a nonlocal PINN approach
using the Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO)---a numerical method which
incorporates long-range interactions and removes spatial derivatives in the
governing equations. Because the PDDO functions can be readily incorporated in
the neural network architecture, the nonlocality does not degrade the
performance of modern deep-learning algorithms. We apply nonlocal PDDO-PINN to
the solution and identification of material parameters in solid mechanics and,
specifically, to elastoplastic deformation in a domain subjected to indentation
by a rigid punch, for which the mixed displacement--traction boundary condition
leads to localized deformation and sharp gradients in the solution. We document
the superior behavior of nonlocal PINN with respect to local PINN in both
solution accuracy and parameter inference, illustrating its potential for
simulation and discovery of partial differential equations whose solution
develops sharp gradients.

To protect themselves until rehydration, the grains undergo characteristic
infolding with the help of special structures in the grain
wall---apertures---where the otherwise thick exine shell is absent or reduced
in thickness. Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of
apertures for the elastic response and the folding of the grain. Experimental
observations show that different pollen grains sharing the same number and type
of apertures can nonetheless fold in quite diverse fashion. Using thin-shell
theory of elasticity, we show how both the absolute elastic properties of the
pollen wall as well as the relative elastic differences between the exine wall
and the apertures play an important role in determining pollen folding upon
desiccation. Focusing primarily on colpate pollen, we delineate the regions of
pollen elastic parameters where desiccation leads to a regular, complete
closing of all apertures and thus to an infolding which protects the grain
against water loss. Phase diagrams of pollen folding pathways indicate that an
increase in the number of apertures leads to a reduction of the region of
elastic parameters where the apertures close in a regular fashion. The
infolding also depends on the details of the aperture shape and size, and our
study explains how the features of the mechanical design of apertures influence
the pollen folding patterns. Understanding the mechanical principles behind
pollen folding pathways should also prove useful for the design of the elastic
response of artificial inhomogeneous shells.

extends our previous studies of such a phase crystal within the quasiclassical

fast oscillations on the scale of the Fermi wavelength. Effects of size

quantitative differences in for instance the value of $T^*$ between the

give a further study on the construction of MDS Euclidean self-dual codes via
generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes and their extended codes. The main idea of

currently a candidate material for HPB. However, a crucial issue for
{\alpha}-Al2O3 is that its permeability reduction factor (PRF) will
dramatically drop after ion or neutron irradiations. At present, little is
known about the relevant mechanism. In order to shed light on this issue, the
kinetics and energetic changes of hydrogen on defected {\alpha}-Al2O3 surfaces
in comparison with perfect {\alpha}-Al2O3 surfaces were studied by density
functional theory. For perfect {\alpha}-Al2O3 surfaces, the results show that
the barrier for hydrogen migration from the outermost layer into the subsurface
layer is the highest, making this migration step to be a rate limiting process.
In contrast, surface point defects dramatically reduce this maximum barrier.
Consequently, hydrogen can preferentially permeate into the interior of the
material through surface defects. The findings can help explain the possible
mechanism of significant decrease of PRF under radiation.

in recent years demonstrated, empirically and theoretically, that significant

work with implicit and large set of positive training examples that are

communication. In the zero-error regime, entanglement can increase the one-shot
zero-error capacity of a family of classical channels following the strategy of
Cubitt et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 104, 230503 (2010). This strategy uses the
Kochen-Specker theorem which is applicable only to projective measurements. As
such, in the regime of noisy states and/or measurements, this strategy cannot
increase the capacity. To accommodate generically noisy situations, we examine
the one-shot success probability of sending a fixed number of classical
messages. We show that preparation contextuality powers the quantum advantage
in this task, increasing the one-shot success probability beyond its classical
maximum. Our treatment extends beyond Cubitt et al. and includes, for example,
the experimentally implemented protocol of Prevedel et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.
106, 110505 (2011). We then show a mapping between this communication task and
a corresponding nonlocal game. This mapping generalizes the connection with
pseudotelepathy games previously noted in the zero-error case. Finally, after
motivating a constraint we term context-independent guessing, we show that
contextuality witnessed by noise-robust noncontextuality inequalities obtained
in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 4, 219 (2020), is sufficient for enhancing the one-shot
success probability. This provides an operational meaning to these inequalities
and the associated hypergraph invariant, the weighted max-predictability,
introduced in R. Kunjwal, Quantum 3, 184 (2019). Our results show that the task
of entanglement-assisted one-shot classical communication provides a fertile

in which a divisible, heterogeneous resource (modeled as a cake) needs to be
partitioned among agents with distinct preferences. We focus on a standard
formulation of cake cutting wherein each agent must receive a contiguous piece
of the cake. While multiple hardness results exist in this setup for finding
fair/efficient cake divisions, we show that, if the value densities of the
agents satisfy the monotone likelihood ratio property (MLRP), then strong
algorithmic results hold for various notions of fairness and economic
efficiency.
  Addressing cake-cutting instances with MLRP, first we develop an algorithm
that finds cake divisions (with connected pieces) that are envy-free, up to an
arbitrary precision. The time complexity of our algorithm is polynomial in the
number of agents and the bit complexity of an underlying Lipschitz constant. We
obtain similar positive results for maximizing social (utilitarian) and
egalitarian welfare. In addition, we show that, under MLRP, the problem of
maximizing Nash social welfare admits a fully polynomial-time approximation
scheme (FPTAS).
  Many distribution families bear MLRP. In particular, this property holds if
all the value densities belong to any one of the following families: Gaussian
(with the same variance), linear, binomial, Poisson, and exponential

of this paper is to quantify the effects of detection and isolation in formal

the basic reproduction ratio. We show that an effective detection and isolation

widely supported by many players in the automotive field. Scenarios captured
from real-world data can be used to define the scenarios for the assessment and
to estimate their relevance. Therefore, different techniques are proposed for
capturing scenarios from real-world data. In this paper, we propose a new
method to capture scenarios from real-world data using a two-step approach. The
first step consists in automatically labeling the data with tags. Second, we
mine the scenarios, represented by a combination of tags, based on the labeled
tags. One of the benefits of our approach is that the tags can be used to
identify characteristics of a scenario that are shared among different type of
scenarios. In this way, these characteristics need to be identified only once.
Furthermore, the method is not specific for one type of scenario and,
therefore, it can be applied to a large variety of scenarios. We provide two
examples to illustrate the method. This paper is concluded with some promising
future possibilities for our approach, such as automatic generation of
scenarios for the assessment of automated vehicles.

magnetar SGR 1935+2154 offers important implications for the physical processes
responsible for the fast radio burst (FRB) phenomena. By assuming that the XRB
emission is produced in the magnetosphere, we investigate the possibility that
the FRB emission is produced by shock-powered synchrotron maser (SM), which is
phenomenologically described with a plenty of free parameters. The
observational constraints on the model parameters indicate that the model can
in principle be consistent with the FRB 200428 observations, if the ejecta
lunched by magnetar activities can have appropriate ingredients and structures
and the shock processes occur on the line of sight. To be specific, a complete
burst ejecta should consist of an ultra-relativistic and extremely highly
collimated $e^{\pm}$ component and a sub-relativistic and wide-spreading
baryonic component. The internal shocks producing the FRB emission arise from a
collision between the $e^{\pm}$ ejecta and the remnant of a previous baryonic
ejecta at the same direction. The parameter constraints are still dependent on
the uncertain spectrum and efficiency of the SM emission. While the spectrum is
tentatively described by a spectral index of $-2$, we estimate the emission
efficiency to be around $10^{-4}$ by requiring that the synchrotron emission of
the shocked material cannot be much brighter than the magnetosphere XRB
emission.

Therefore, this new insight challenges the belief on the requirement of a prior

sub-compositional data in conformity with the taxonomic hierarchy of bacteria.
Motivated by a study for identifying the microbes in the gut microbiome of
preterm infants that impact their later neurobehavioral outcomes, we formulate
a constrained integrative multi-view regression, where the neurobehavioral
scores form multivariate response, the sub-compositional microbiome data form
multi-view feature matrices, and a set of linear constraints on their
corresponding sub-coefficient matrices ensures the conformity to the simplex
geometry. To enable joint selection and inference of sub-compositions/views, we
assume all the sub-coefficient matrices are possibly of low-rank, i.e., the
outcomes are associated with the microbiome through different sets of latent
sub-compositional factors from different taxa. We propose a scaled composite
nuclear norm penalization approach for model estimation and develop a
hypothesis testing procedure through de-biasing to assess the significance of
different views. Simulation studies confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
procedure. In the preterm infant study, the identified microbes are mostly
consistent with existing studies and biological understandings. Our approach
supports that stressful early life experiences imprint gut microbiome through

arithmetic, rounding is a necessary step in many computations. Although
rounding methods can be tailored for different applications, round-off errors
are generally unavoidable. When a sequence of computations is implemented,
round-off errors may be magnified or accumulated. The magnification of
round-off errors may cause serious failures. Stochastic rounding (SR) was
introduced as an unbiased rounding method, which is widely employed in, for
instance, the training of neural networks (NNs), showing a promising training
result even in low-precision computations. Although the employment of SR in
training NNs is consistently increasing, the error analysis of SR is still to
be improved. Additionally, the unbiased rounding results of SR are always
accompanied by large variances. In this study, some general properties of SR
are stated and proven. Furthermore, an upper bound of rounding variance is
introduced and validated. Two new probability distributions of SR are proposed
to study the trade-off between variance and bias, by solving a multiple
objective optimization problem. In the simulation study, the rounding variance,
bias, and relative errors of SR are studied for different operations, such as
summation, square root calculation through Newton iteration and inner product
computation, with specific rounding precision.

between conversational sentiment analysis and single sentence sentiment
analysis is the existence of context information which may influence the
sentiment of an utterance in a dialogue. How to effectively encode contextual
information in dialogues, however, remains a challenge. Existing approaches
employ complicated deep learning structures to distinguish different parties in
a conversation and then model the context information. In this paper, we
propose a fast, compact and parameter-efficient party-ignorant framework named
bidirectional emotional recurrent unit for conversational sentiment analysis.
In our system, a generalized neural tensor block followed by a two-channel
classifier is designed to perform context compositionality and sentiment
classification, respectively. Extensive experiments on three standard datasets
demonstrate that our model outperforms the state of the art in most cases.

radiobiology. The technologies demonstrated in LhARA, which have wide
application, will be developed to allow particle-beam therapy to be delivered
in a completely new regime, combining a variety of ion species in a single
treatment fraction and exploiting ultra-high dose rates. LhARA will be a hybrid
accelerator system in which laser interactions drive the creation of a large
flux of protons or light ions that are captured using a plasma (Gabor) lens and
formed into a beam. The laser-driven source allows protons and ions to be
captured at energies significantly above those that pertain in conventional
facilities, thus evading the current space-charge limit on the instantaneous
dose rate that can be delivered. The laser-hybrid approach, therefore, will
allow the vast ``terra incognita'' of the radiobiology that determines the
response of tissue to ionising radiation to be studied with protons and light
ions using a wide variety of time structures, spectral distributions, and
spatial configurations at instantaneous dose rates up to and significantly
beyond the ultra-high dose-rate `FLASH' regime.
  It is proposed that LhARA be developed in two stages. In the first stage, a
programme of in vitro radiobiology will be served with proton beams with
energies between 10MeV and 15MeV. In stage two, the beam will be accelerated
using a fixed-field accelerator (FFA). This will allow experiments to be
carried out in vitro and in vivo with proton beam energies of up to 127MeV. In
addition, ion beams with energies up to 33.4MeV per nucleon will be available
for in vitro and in vivo experiments. This paper presents the conceptual design
for LhARA and the R&D programme by which the LhARA consortium seeks to
establish the facility.

Applying HE to the client-cloud model allows cloud services to perform

Cheetah proposes HE-parameter tuning optimization and operator scheduling

To achieve full utilization of renewables, battery energy storage systems

general type of network-side controller, has also been verified to enhance the

the value of PFR in helping BESSs for renewable power accommodation. The
performance of PFR is evaluated with the minimum BESS capacity required for
zero renewable power curtailment with and without PFRs. The operational
constraints of BESSs and the terminal voltage property of PFRs are considered
in a multi-period optimization model. The proposed model is tested through
numerical simulations on a modified IEEE 30-bus subtransmission system and a
remarkable result shows that 15% reduction of BESS capacity can be achieved by
installing PFRs on a single line.

information from observations is analyzed with the aid of the concept of the
degrees of freedom for signal (DFS). A simple mathematical argument shows that
DFS for EnKF is bounded from above by the ensemble size, which entails that
assimilating much more observations than the ensemble size automatically leads
to DFS underestimation. Since DFS is a trace of the posterior error covariance
mapped onto the normalized observation space, underestimated DFS implies
overconfidence (underdispersion) in the analysis spread, which, in a cycled
context, requires covariance inflation to be applied. The theory is then
extended to cases where covariance localization schemes (either B-localization
or R-localization) are applied to show how they alleviate the DFS
underestimation issue. These findings from mathematical argument are
demonstrated with a simple one-dimensional covariance model. Finally, the DFS
concept is used to form speculative arguments about how to interpret several
puzzling features of LETKF previously reported in the literature such as why
using less observations can lead to better performance, when optimal
localization scales tend to occur, and why covariance inflation methods based
on relaxation to prior information approach are particularly successful when
observations are inhomogeneously distributed. A presumably first application of

have implications for speech technology applications. The acoustic
characteristics of creaky voice are, however, rather distinct from modal

spectral boundary separating periodic and aperiodic components during the
production of voiced sounds. Recent studies have shown that its proper
estimation and modeling enhance the quality of statistical parametric speech
synthesizers. Contrastingly, these same methods of MVF estimation have been
reported to degrade the performance of singing voice synthesizers. This paper
proposes a new approach for MVF estimation which exploits both amplitude and
phase spectra. It is shown that phase conveys relevant information about the
harmonicity of the voice signal, and that it can be jointly used with features
derived from the amplitude spectrum. This information is further integrated
into a maximum likelihood criterion which provides a decision about the MVF
estimate. The proposed technique is compared to two state-of-the-art methods,
and shows a superior performance in both objective and subjective evaluations.
Perceptual tests indicate a drastic improvement in high-pitched voices.

the stringent interventions were delayed by 2 days or mild interventions were
implemented instead, the expected number of cumulative confirmed cases would
have been nearly 2 times or 5 times of the actual number. The effects of
stringent interventions are significant in mitigating the epidemic situation of

frequency is above the cutoff value. Different theories provide different
cutoff values. We developed an alternative method to derive the cutoff
frequency in several standard solar models, including various quiet-Sun and
umbral atmospheres. We performed numerical simulations of wave propagation in
the solar atmosphere. The cutoff frequency is determined from the inspection of
phase difference spectra computed between the velocity signal at two
atmospheric heights. The process is performed by choosing pairs of heights
across all the layers between the photosphere and the chromosphere, to derive
the vertical stratification of the cutoff in the solar models. The cutoff
frequency predicted by the theoretical calculations departs significantly from
our measurements. In quiet-Sun atmospheres, the cutoff shows a strong
dependence on the magnetic field for adiabatic wave propagation. When radiative
losses are taken into account, the cutoff frequency is greatly reduced and the
variation of the cutoff with the strength of the magnetic field is lower. The
effect of the radiative losses in the cutoff is necessary to understand recent
quiet-Sun and sunspot observations. In the presence of inclined magnetic
fields, our numerical calculations confirm the reduction of the cutoff
frequency due to the reduced gravity experienced by waves propagating along
field lines. An additional reduction is also found in regions with significant
changes in the temperature, due to the lower temperature gradient along the
path of field-guided waves. Our results show that the cutoff values are not
correctly captured by theoretical estimates. In addition, most of the
widely-used analytical cutoff formulae neglect the impact of magnetic fields
and radiative losses, whose role is critical to determine the evanescent or

small, isolated classical system [Sci. Rep. 9, 14169]: after a slow cyclic
sweep of a control parameter, the probability that a microcanonical ensemble
returns to the neighborhood of its initial energy is significantly below one. A
similar phenomenon has recently been confirmed in a corresponding quantum
system for not too small particle number $N$. Quantum-classical correspondence
has been found to be non-trivial in this case, however; the rate at which the
control parameter changes must not be extremely slow and the initial
distribution of energies must not be too narrow. In this paper we directly
compare the quantum and classical forms of probabilistic hysteresis by making
use of the Husimi quantum phase space formalism. In particular we demonstrate
that the classical ergodization mechanism, which is a key ingredient in
classical probabilistic hysteresis, can lead to a breakdown of
quantum-classical correspondence rather than to quantum ergodization. As a
result strong quantum effects in the long-term evolution are present, even
though the quantum corrections in the equations of motion are proportional to
$1/N$ and therefore would naively seem to be small. We also show, however, that
quantum ergodization is restored by averaging over energies, so that for
sufficient initial energy width and not-too-slow sweep rate the classical
results are recovered after all. Finally we show that the formal
incommutability of the classical and adiabatic limits in our system, leading to
the breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in the quasi-static limit, is
due to macroscopic quantum tunneling through a large energetic barrier. This
explains the extremely slow sweep rates needed to reach the quantum adiabatic
limit that were reported in our previous work.

SELM for OPF is not tractable due to the complicated relationship between the
system operating status and the OPF solutions. To this end, a data-driven OPF
regression framework is developed that decomposes the OPF model features into
three stages. This not only reduces the learning complexity but also helps
correct the learning bias. A sample pre-classification strategy based on active
constraint identification is also developed to achieve enhanced feature
attractions. Numerical results carried out on IEEE and Polish benchmark systems
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other alternatives. It is also
shown that the proposed method can be easily extended to address different test

groups. Pairwise comparisons have become popular in the theory and practice of
preference modelling and quantification. We focus on decision problems where
the set of pairwise comparisons can be chosen, i.e., it is not given a priori.
The objective of this paper is to provide recommendations for filling patterns
of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices (PCMs) based on their graph
representation. Regularity means that each item is compared to others for the
same number of times, resulting in a kind of symmetry. A graph on an odd number
of vertices is called quasi-regular, if the degree of every vertex is the same
odd number, except for one vertex whose degree is larger by one. If there is a
pair of items such that their shortest connecting path is very long, the
comparison between these two items relies on many intermediate comparisons, and
is possibly biased by all of their errors. Such an example was previously
found, where the graph generated from the table tennis players' matches
included a long shortest path between two vertices (players), and the
calculated result appeared to be misleading. If the diameter of the graph of
comparisons is low as possible (among the graphs of the same number of edges),
we can avoid, or, at least decrease, such cumulated errors. The aim of our
research is to find graphs, among regular and quasi-regular ones, with minimal
diameter. Both theorists and practitioners can use the results, given in
several formats in the appendix: graph, adjacency matrix, list of edges.

parameter, as well as the neutrino energy and the particle mass. We find that
there is a possibility of spin oscillations of ultrarelativistic neutrinos
scattering off a rotating BH. Then, considering the neutrino scattering off BH
surrounded by background matter, we derive the effective Schrodinger equation
for spin oscillations. The numerical solution of this equation is obtained in
the case of a supermassive BH with a realistic accretion disk. Spin effects
turn out to be negligible in the neutrino scattering in the Schwarzschild

decade, with many new classification approaches published each year. Prior
research has mostly focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of
classifiers, with interpretability being somewhat neglected. This aspect of
classifiers has become critical for many application domains and the
introduction of the EU GDPR legislation in 2018 is likely to further emphasize
the importance of interpretable learning algorithms. Currently,
state-of-the-art classification accuracy is achieved with very complex models
based on large ensembles (COTE) or deep neural networks (FCN). These approaches
are not efficient with regard to either time or space, are difficult to
interpret and cannot be applied to variable-length time series, requiring
pre-processing of the original series to a set fixed-length. In this paper we
propose new time series classification algorithms to address these gaps. Our
approach is based on symbolic representations of time series, efficient
sequence mining algorithms and linear classification models. Our linear models
are as accurate as deep learning models but are more efficient regarding
running time and memory, can work with variable-length time series and can be
interpreted by highlighting the discriminative symbolic features on the
original time series. We show that our multi-resolution multi-domain linear
classifier (mtSS-SEQL+LR) achieves a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art
COTE ensemble, and to recent deep learning methods (FCN, ResNet), but uses a
fraction of the time and memory required by either COTE or deep models. To
further analyse the interpretability of our classifier, we present a case study
on a human motion dataset collected by the authors. We release all the results,

  $$\prod_{j=1}^n\prod_{k=1}^{p-1}(1-q^{pj-k})^s,$$ where $p$ is an odd prime
and $n, s$ are positive integers. Let us denote by $a_i$ the coefficient of
$q^i$ in the above polynomial and suppose that $b$ is an integer. We prove that
  $$\Big|\sum_{i\equiv b\ \text{mod}\ 2pn}a_i-\frac{v(b)p^{sn}}{2pn}\Big|\leq
p^{sn/2},$$ where $v(b)=p-1$ if $b$ divisible by $p$ and $v(b)=-1$ otherwise.
This improves a recent result of Goswami and Pantangi.

  Science 2020",,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inspired by a recent experimental and theoretical study [Yang et al., 2017],
wherein protrusions in graphene have been proposed as an effective strategy to
enhance the performance of sodium ion batteries, a comprehensive study of the
effects of phosphorus doping in graphene on adsorption and diffusion behaviour
of Li is carried out by using density functional theory. We find that
protrusion introduced by P-dopant in graphene enhances the adsorption of a
single Li atom onto the anode due to an additional partial covalent bonding
character between Li and carbon atoms of the substrate. However, with increase
in concentration of Li atoms, they tend to form clusters which may lead to
dendrite growth and hence battery failure. Finite density of states at Fermi
level ensures the electronic conductivity of the P-doped graphene before and
after the adsorption of a Li atom. No momentous variation in DOS is observed
except a small up shift in Fermi level with increased Li concentration. The
presence of such protrusions acts as trapping centres for Li and hinders their
migration over the substrate, leading to poor cycling performance of anode.
This atomic level study will act as a useful guideline for further development
of anode materials for novel battery technologies.

``evolution + selection'' and the idea that the current state is a local
equilibrium state of many bodies with self-organization and evolution processes
driven by the temperature and gravity in our universe, in this work, we
describe an artificial intelligence system called the ``Synergetic Learning
Systems''. The system is composed of two or more subsystems (models, agents or
virtual bodies), and it is an open complex giant system. Inspired by natural
intelligence, the system achieves intelligent information processing and
decision-making in a given environment through cooperative/competitive
synergetic learning. The intelligence evolved by the natural law of ``it is not
the strongest of the species that survives, but the one most responsive to
change,'' while an artificial intelligence system should adopt the law of
``human selection'' in the evolution process. Therefore, we expect that the
proposed system architecture can also be adapted in human-machine synergy or
multi-agent synergetic systems. It is also expected that under our design
criteria, the proposed system will eventually achieve artificial general
intelligence through long term coevolution.

recorded in complex natural and social systems, the results will be biased if
we use multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DXA) without
considering these common factors. Based on multifractal temporally weighted
detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-TWXDFA) proposed by our group and
multifractal partial cross-correlation analysis (MF-DPXA) proposed by Qian et
al., we propose a new method---multifractal temporally weighted detrended
partial cross-correlation analysis (MF-TWDPCCA) to quantify intrinsic power-law
cross-correlation of two non-stationary time series affected by common external
factors in this paper. We use MF-TWDPCCA to characterize the intrinsic
cross-correlations between the two simultaneously recorded time series by
removing the effects of other potential time series. To test the performance of
MF-TWDPCCA, we apply it, MF-TWXDFA and MF-DPXA on simulated series. Numerical
tests on artificially simulated series demonstrate that MF-TWDPCCA can
accurately detect the intrinsic cross-correlations for two simultaneously
recorded series. To further show the utility of MF-TWDPCCA, we apply it on time
series from stock markets and find that there exists significantly multifractal
power-law cross-correlation between stock returns. A new partial
cross-correlation coefficient is defined to quantify the level of intrinsic
cross-correlation between two time series.

methods are computationally expensive as exhaustive search are used for optimal
thresholds to optimize the objective functions. To overcome this problem,
population-based metaheuristic algorithms are widely used to improve the
searching capacity. In this paper, we improve a popular metaheuristic called
cuckoo search using a ring topology based fully informed strategy. In this
strategy, each individual in the population learns from its neighborhoods to
improve the cooperation of the population and the learning efficiency. Best
solution or best fitness value can be obtained from the initial random
threshold values, whose quality is evaluated by the correlation function.
Experimental results have been examined on various numbers of thresholds. The
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more accurate and efficient
than other four popular methods.

the local deformation around 15 landmark points, and combining the results with
three linear distances between landmark points, a total of 1218 information
