provides a continuous interpolation between the Clifford and Heisenberg

to all values of $N$. After listing the properties of this Hilbert space, we
study the generalized coherent states that result when $\xi^N=0$, for $N \ge

generalized versions of the Hermite polynomials for general $N$. Some remarks

To mitigate catastrophic forgetting during incremental learning, we design a
novel explainability-based knowledge distillation for ASR models, which is
combined with a response-based knowledge distillation to maintain the original
model's predictions and the ""reason"" for the predictions. Our method works
without access to the training data of original tasks, which addresses the
cases where the previous data is no longer available or joint training is
costly. Results on a multi-stage sequential training task show that our method
outperforms existing ones in mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, in two
practical scenarios, compared to the target-reference joint training method,
the performance drop of our method is 0.02% Character Error Rate (CER), which
is 97% smaller than the drops of the baseline methods.

infectious disease through a population using compartmentalized differential

susceptibility distribution. These joint dynamics influence the force of
infection and are, in turn, influenced by the shape of the initial variability.
Intriguingly, we find that certain susceptibility distributions (the
exponential and the gamma) are unchanged through the course of the outbreak,
and lead naturally to power-law behavior in the force of infection; other
distributions often tend towards these ""eigen-distributions"" through the
process of contagion. The power-law behavior fundamentally alters predictions
of the long-term infection rate, and suggests that first-order epidemic models
that are parameterized in the exponential-like phase may systematically and
significantly over-estimate the final severity of the outbreak.

of the total weighted transmit power of the network under constraints on the
minimum quality-of-service regarding the number of computed URLLC user bits
within the maximum allowable computing time, i.e., the end-to-end delay of a

However, this usually requires a priori knowledge of the environmental model,
which is not available in most cases. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
based algorithm for cognitive multi-target detection in the presence of unknown
disturbance statistics. The radar acts as an agent that continuously senses the
unknown environment (i.e., targets and disturbance) and consequently optimizes
transmitted waveforms in order to maximize the probability of detection
($P_\mathsf{D}$) by focusing the energy in specific range-angle cells (i.e.,
beamforming). Furthermore, we propose a solution to the beamforming
optimization problem with less complexity than the existing methods. Numerical
simulations are performed to assess the performance of the proposed RL-based
algorithm in both stationary and dynamic environments. The RL based beamforming
is compared to the conventional omnidirectional approach with equal power
allocation and to adaptive beamforming with no RL. As highlighted by the
proposed numerical results, our RL-based beamformer outperforms both approaches
in terms of target detection performance. The performance improvement is even
particularly remarkable under environmentally harsh conditions such as low SNR,
heavy-tailed disturbance and rapidly changing scenarios.

form local Cooper pairs, with a superfluid $d-$wave pseudogap $\Delta_{PG}$,
due to an effective, short range attractive interaction of $d_{x^2-y^2}$
character. Phase coherent, bulk superconductivity, with a $d-$wave gap
$\Delta$, is stabilized when the oscillator network is asymptotically entangled
in a nearly decoherence-free environment. Phase coherence will in turn be
destroyed, at $T_c$, when the thermal noise becomes comparable to the coupling

population-level quantities in the power function with what is observed in
external studies. Many authors and practitioners view this as an assumed value
of power and offer the Bayesian quantity probability of success or assurance as
an alternative. The claim is by averaging over a prior or posterior
distribution, probability of success transcends power by capturing the
uncertainty around the unknown true treatment effect and any other
population-level parameters. We use p-value functions to frame both the
probability of success calculation and the typical power calculation as merely
producing two different point estimates of power. We demonstrate that Go/No-Go
decisions based on either point estimate of power do not adequately quantify
and control the risk involved, and instead we argue for Go/No-Go decisions that
utilize inference on power for better risk management and decision making.

data-level and model-level debiasing methods to robustify models against
lexical dataset biases. First, we debias the dataset through data augmentation

remove the label bias at the embedding level. The second approach employs a
bag-of-words sub-model to capture the features that are likely to exploit the

forcing orthogonality between these two sub-models. We performed evaluations on

distribution of the time it takes for a susceptible vertex to get infected in
terms of a solution of a non-linear integral equation under broad assumptions
on the model parameters. Namely, infection rates are assumed to be
time-dependent, and recovery times are given by random variables with a fairly
arbitrary distribution. We then study the behavior of the model in the limit
when the tree vertex degree tends to infinity, and infection rates are
appropriately scaled. We show that in this limit the integral equation of the
discrete model implies an equation for the susceptible population compartment.
This is a master equation in the sense that both the infectious and the
recovered compartments can be explicitly expressed in terms of its solution. In
other words, the master equation implies a continuous SIR model for the joint
time evolution of all three population compartments.

propose a manner to extend some $\Lambda(t)$-CDM models to the inflationary

space-time manifold, regarding a non-compact extra space-like coor\-dinate. In
this formalism we achieve also a geometrical unification of inflation and the
present acce\-le\-rating epoch. In this approach inflation is generated by a
pre-inflationary quantum vacuum energy that maintains the 5D classical vacuum
on cosmological scales. We obtain from geometrical conditions that we can model
the presence of the pre-inflationary vacuum energy in 4D as a dynamical
cosmological constant. The 4D inflationary period results to be governed by a
power law expansion and for certain values of some parameters of the model we
obtain an spectral index satisfying $0.9607\leq n_s\leq 0.9691$ and a scalar to
tensor ratio $r=0.098$, values that fit well according to Planck 2018 results.
The 4D inflationary potential is induced for the 5D geometry and the 4D
pre-inflationary potential is determined by the model. We show thatin this
theoretical framework the present acceleration in the expansion of the universe
can be explained due to a remanent of this pre-inflationary vacuum energy
scaled to the present epoch and that its description can be done with the same
$\Lambda(t)$. In this period we obtain a deceleration parameter in agreement
with Planck 2018 data under certain restrictions of the parameters of the
model. From the geometrical point of view $\Lambda(t)$ is depending on the
dynamical foliation of the 5D space-time manifold.

non-volatile memory (NVM) to combine the best properties of both memory
technologies, achieving low latency, high reliability, and high density. A
prominent characteristic of DRAM-NVM hybrid memory is that it has NVM access
latency much higher than DRAM access latency. We call this inter-memory
asymmetry. We observe that parasitic components on a long bitline are a major
source of high latency in both DRAM and NVM, and a significant factor
contributing to high-voltage operations in NVM, which impact their reliability.
We propose an architectural change, where each long bitline in DRAM and NVM is
split into two segments by an isolation transistor. One segment can be accessed
with lower latency and operating voltage than the other. By introducing tiers,
we enable non-uniform accesses within each memory type (which we call
intra-memory asymmetry), leading to performance and reliability trade-offs in
DRAM-NVM hybrid memory. We extend existing NVM-DRAM OS in three ways. First, we
exploit both inter- and intra-memory asymmetries to allocate and migrate memory
pages between the tiers in DRAM and NVM. Second, we improve the OS's page
allocation decisions by predicting the access intensity of a newly-referenced
memory page in a program and placing it to a matching tier during its initial
allocation. This minimizes page migrations during program execution, lowering
the performance overhead. Third, we propose a solution to migrate pages between
the tiers of the same memory without transferring data over the memory channel,
minimizing channel occupancy and improving performance. Our overall approach,
which we call MNEME, to enable and exploit asymmetries in DRAM-NVM hybrid
tiered memory improves both performance and reliability for both single-core
and multi-programmed workloads.

fields. This includes biology where they are used to describe processes such as
protein-protein interaction and gene regulatory networks. As such networks
increase in size and complexity, detailed dynamical models become cumbersome,
making them difficult to explore and decipher. This necessitates the
application of simplifying and coarse graining techniques in order to derive
explanatory insight. Here we demonstrate that Zwanzig-Mori projection methods
can be used to arbitrarily reduce the dimensionality of dynamical networks
while retaining their dynamical properties. We show that a systematic expansion
around the quasi-steady state approximation allows an explicit solution for
memory functions without prior knowledge of the dynamics. The approach not only
preserves the same steady states but also replicates the transients of the
original system. The method also correctly predicts the dynamics of multistable
systems as well as networks producing sustained and damped oscillations.
Applying the approach to a gene regulatory network from the vertebrate neural
tube, a well characterised developmental transcriptional network, identifies
features of the regulatory network responsible dfor its characteristic
transient behaviour. Taken together, our analysis shows that this method is
broadly applicable to multistable dynamical systems and offers a powerful and
efficient approach for understanding their behaviour.

that its latency and energy are sensitive to the data to be written as well as
the content that is overwritten. We observe that overwriting unknown memory
content can incur significantly higher latency and energy compared to
overwriting known all-zeros or all-ones content. This is because all-zeros or
all-ones content is overwritten by programming the PCM cells only in one
direction, i.e., using either SET or RESET operations, not both. In this paper,
we propose data content aware PCM writes (DATACON), a new mechanism that
reduces the latency and energy of PCM writes by redirecting these requests to
overwrite memory locations containing all-zeros or all-ones. DATACON operates
in three steps. First, it estimates how much a PCM write access would benefit
from overwriting known content (e.g., all-zeros, or all-ones) by
comprehensively considering the number of set bits in the data to be written,
and the energy-latency trade-offs for SET and RESET operations in PCM. Second,
it translates the write address to a physical address within memory that
contains the best type of content to overwrite, and records this translation in
a table for future accesses. We exploit data access locality in workloads to
minimize the address translation overhead. Third, it re-initializes unused
memory locations with known all-zeros or all-ones content in a manner that does
not interfere with regular read and write accesses. DATACON overwrites unknown
content only when it is absolutely necessary to do so. We evaluate DATACON with
workloads from state-of-the-art machine learning applications, SPEC CPU2017,
and NAS Parallel Benchmarks. Results demonstrate that DATACON significantly
improves system performance and memory system energy consumption compared to

The turbulent flow is modelled by the synthetic $d$-dimensional anisotropic

381 (1990)] with finite correlation time. The Hwa-Kardar model with
time-independent (spatially quenched) random noise is considered alongside the
original model with the white noise. The aim of the present paper is to explore
fixed points of RG equations which determine the possible types of universality
classes (regimes of critical behavior of the system) and critical dimensions of
the measurable quantities. Our calculations demonstrate that influence of the
type of the random noise is extremely large: in contrast to the case of the
white noise where the system possess three fixed points, the case of the
spatially quenched noise involves four fixed points with overlapping stability
regions. This means that in the latter case the critical behavior of the system
depends not only on the global parameters of the system which is the usual
case, but also on the initial values of the charges (coupling constants) of the
system. These initial conditions determine the specific fixed point which will
be reached by RG flow. Since now the critical properties of the system are not
defined strictly by its parameters the situation may be interpreted as
universality violation. Such systems are not forbidden but they are very rare.
It is especially interesting that the same model without turbulent motion of
the environment does not predict this nonuniversal behavior and demonstrates
the ""usual"" one with prescribed universality classes instead [J.~Stat. Phys.

find sources that overlapped in angular position with the cluster in the last
~10 Myr. We find ~17,000 runaway/walkaway candidates satisfy this 2D traceback
condition. Most of these are expected to be contaminants, e.g., caused by
Galactic streaming motions of stars at different distances. We thus examine six
further tests to help identify real runaways, namely: (1) possessing young
stellar object (YSO) colors and magnitudes based on Gaia optical photometry;
(2) having IR excess consistent with YSOs based on 2MASS and WISE photometry;
(3) having a high degree of optical variability; (4) having closest approach
distances well constrained to within the cluster half-mass radius; (5) having
ejection directions that avoid the main Galactic streaming contamination zone;
and (6) having a required radial velocity (RV) for 3D overlap of reasonable
magnitude (or, for the 7% of candidates with measured RVs, satisfying 3D
traceback). Thirteen sources, not previously noted as Orion members, pass all
these tests, while another twelve are similarly promising, except they are in
the main Galactic streaming contamination zone. Among these 25 ejection
candidates, ten with measured RVs pass the most restrictive 3D traceback
condition. We present full lists of runaway/walkaway candidates, estimate the
high-velocity population ejected from the ONC and discuss its implications for
cluster formation theories via comparison with numerical simulations.

optimization: the problem of minimizing the population loss given i.i.d.
samples from a distribution over convex loss functions. A recent work of
Bassily et al. (2019) has established the optimal bound on the excess
population loss achievable given $n$ samples. Unfortunately, their algorithm
achieving this bound is relatively inefficient: it requires $O(\min\{n^{3/2},
n^{5/2}/d\})$ gradient computations, where $d$ is the dimension of the
optimization problem.
  We describe two new techniques for deriving DP convex optimization algorithms
both achieving the optimal bound on excess loss and using $O(\min\{n, n^2/d\})$
gradient computations. In particular, the algorithms match the running time of
the optimal non-private algorithms. The first approach relies on the use of
variable batch sizes and is analyzed using the privacy amplification by
iteration technique of Feldman et al. (2018). The second approach is based on a
general reduction to the problem of localizing an approximately optimal
solution with differential privacy. Such localization, in turn, can be achieved
using existing (non-private) uniformly stable optimization algorithms. As in
the earlier work, our algorithms require a mild smoothness assumption. We also
give a linear-time algorithm achieving the optimal bound on the excess loss for
the strongly convex case, as well as a faster algorithm for the non-smooth

radio jets on the ISM by tracing molecular gas at high spatial resolution using
ALMA. The radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) studied show recently born radio
jets. In this stage, the plasma jets can have the largest impact on the ISM, as
also predicted by state-of-the-art simulations. The two targets have quite
different ages, allowing us to get snapshots of the effects of radio jets as
they grow. Interestingly, both also host powerful quasar emission. The largest
mass outflow rate of molecular gas is found in a radio galaxy hosting a newly
born radio jet emerging from an obscuring cocoon of gas and dust. Although the
mass outflow rate is high (few hundred Msun/yr), the outflow is limited to the
inner few hundred pc region. In a second object, the jet is larger (a few kpc)
and is in a more advanced evolutionary phase. In this object, the distribution
of the molecular gas is reminiscent of what is seen, on larger scales, in
cool-core clusters hosting radio galaxies. Gas deviating from quiescent
kinematics is not very prominent, limited only to the very inner region, and
has a low mass outflow rate. Instead, on kpc scales, the radio lobes appear
associated with depressions in the distribution of the molecular gas,
suggesting they have broken out from the dense nuclear region. The AGN does not
appear to be able at present to stop the star formation observed in this
galaxy. These results suggest that the effects of the radio source start in the
first phases by producing outflows which, however, tend to be limited to the
kpc region. After that, the effects turn into producing large-scale bubbles
which could, in the long term, prevent the surrounding gas from cooling. Our
results characterise the effect of radio jets in different phases of their
evolution, bridging the studies done for radio galaxies in clusters.

are affine-invariant analogues of the classical intrinsic volumes from the
Brunn-Minkowski theory, and thus constitute a central pillar of affine convex
geometry. They were introduced in the 1980's by E. Lutwak, who conjectured that
among all convex bodies of a given volume, the $k$-th affine quermassintegral
is minimized precisely on the family of ellipsoids. The known cases $k=1$ and
$k=n-1$ correspond to the classical Blaschke-Santal\'o and Petty projection
inequalities, respectively. In this work we confirm Lutwak's conjecture,
including characterization of the equality cases, for all values of
$k=1,\ldots,n-1$, in a single unified framework. In fact, it turns out that
ellipsoids are the only local minimizers with respect to the Hausdorff
topology.
  For the proof, we introduce a number of new ingredients, including a novel
construction of the Projection Rolodex of a convex body. In particular, from
this new view point, Petty's inequality is interpreted as an integrated form of
a generalized Blaschke--Santal\'o inequality for a new family of polar bodies
encoded by the Projection Rolodex. We extend these results to more general
$L^p$-moment quermassintegrals, and interpret the case $p=0$ as a sharp
averaged Loomis--Whitney isoperimetric inequality.

the equations to propagate changes in texture similarity through the rational

framework relies on FEniCS domain-specific language and the representation of
material strength criteria and their corresponding support function in the
conic programming setting. Various choices of finite element discretization,
including discontinuous Galerkin interpolations, are offered by FEniCS,
enabling to formulate lower bound equilibrium elements or upper bound elements
including discontinuities for instance. The numerical resolution of the
corresponding optimization problem is carried out by the interior-point solver
\texttt{Mosek} which takes advantage of the conic representation for yield
criteria. Through various illustrative examples ranging from classical
continuum limit analysis problems to generalized mechanical models such as
plates, shells, strain gradient or Cosserat continua, we show that limit

in a very simple manner and solved extremely efficiently. This paper is

410 K), $P$2$_1$/$m$ (between $\sim$ 300 K and $\sim$ 410 K), and the polar
group $Pm$ (below $\sim$ 300 K), respectively. The newly observed structural
distortions exist in the bulk structure consistent with the expectation of
previous photoluminescence and Raman measurements. High-pressure measurements
reveal multiple low-pressure phases, one of which exists as a metastable phase
at ambient pressure. This work should help guide research in the perovskite
photovoltaic community to better control the structure under operational
conditions and further improve transport and optical properties.

construction method of linear codes. The main results of this paper are stated
below. We first construct several three-weight and four-weight linear codes
with flexible parameters from weakly regular plateaued balanced functions. It
is worth noting that the (almost) optimal codes may be obtained from these

thereby they can be directly employed to construct secret sharing schemes with
high democracy. Finally, the democratic secret sharing schemes are obtained
from the dual codes of our minimal codes.

DistPre customizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with an appropriate

efficient and applicable for large-scale transportation networks, DistPre
conducts LSTM customization on a cluster of computation nodes and allows any
trained LSTM model to be shared between different detectors. If a detector
observes a similar traffic pattern to another one, DistPre directly shares the
existing LSTM model between the two detectors rather than customizing an LSTM
model per detector. Experiments based on traffic data collected from freeway
I5-N in California are conducted to evaluate the performance of DistPre. The
results demonstrate that DistPre provides time-efficient LSTM customization and
accurate fine-grained traffic-speed prediction for large-scale transportation

It runs in time $O(2^{0.804n})$ for $d = 2$ and $O(2^{(1 - 1/(2.7d))n})$ for $d
> 2$.
  In this paper, we devise a worst-case algorithm that improves the one by
Bj\""{o}rklund et al. It runs in time $O(2^{0.6943n})$ (or $O(1.6181^n)$) for $d
= 2$ and $O(2^{(1 - 1/(2d))n})$ for $d > 2$. Our algorithm thus outperforms all
known worst-case algorithms, as well as ones analyzed for random equation
systems. We also devise a second algorithm that outputs all solutions to a
polynomial system and has similar complexity to the first (provided that the
number of solutions is not too large).
  A central idea in the work of Bj\""{o}rklund et al. was to reduce the problem
of finding a solution to a polynomial system over $\mathbb{F}_2$ to the problem
of counting the parity of all solutions. A parity-counting instance was then
reduced to many smaller parity-counting instances. Our main observation is that
these smaller instances are related and can be solved more efficiently by a new
algorithm to a problem which we call multiple parity-counting.

however, that holds the promise to allow up to three orders of magnitude higher
speed [1] has not been able to provide a viable alternative because approaches
that had been tried were either not scalable, not energy efficient or did not
show a significant speed benefit. Whereas essential all-optical transistor
functionalities have been already demonstrated across a range of platforms
[2-4], using them to implement the complete Boolean logic gate set and in
particular negation - switching off an optical signal with another optical
signal - poses a major challenge [5]. Here, we realize a universal NOR logic
gate by introducing the concept of non-ground-state dynamic exciton-polariton
condensation in an organic semiconductor microcavity under non-resonant pulsed
excitation. In the presence of either of the input signals inserted at opposite
in-plane momenta, non-ground state dynamic condensation supersedes spontaneous
ground-state condensation, resulting in a NOR-operator output signal within
less than a picosecond. An additional optical transistor, fed by the output of
the NOR gate, is then used to regenerate the output signal such that it is
usable as input for cascading gates, a prerequisite for scale up. Our results
constitute an essential step towards the realization of more complex logic
optical circuitry that could boost future information processing applications.

angular sectors or spatial oversampling to shape the quantization noise away
from desired directions of arrival. While reducing the antenna spacing
alleviates the adverse impact of quantization noise, it can potentially
deteriorate the performance of the massive array due to excessive mutual
coupling. In this paper, we analyze the impact of mutual coupling on the uplink
spectral efficiency of a spatial one-bit Sigma-Delta massive MIMO architecture,
and compare the resulting performance degradation to standard one-bit

show that the one-bit Sigma-Delta array is particularly advantageous in

one-loop power spectrum of galaxies in redshift space in the Effective Field
Theory of Large-Scale Structure. The dark matter density perturbations and
velocity divergence are treated with exact time dependence. Splitting the
density perturbation into its different temporal evolutions naturally gives
rise to an irreducible basis of biases. While, as in the EdS approximation, at
each time this basis spans a seven-dimensional space, this space is a slightly
different one, and the difference is captured by a single calculable time- and
$\vec k$-dependent function. We then compute the redshift-space galaxy one-loop
power spectrum with the EdS approximation ($P^{\text{EdS-approx}}$) and without
($P^{\text{Exact}}$). For the monopole we find
$P_{\text{0}}^{\text{Exact}}/P_{\text{0}}^{\text{EdS-approx}}\sim 1.003$ and
for the quadrupole
$P_{\text{2}}^{\text{Exact}}/P_{\text{2}}^{\text{EdS-approx}}\sim 1.007$ at
$z=0.57$, and sharply increasing at lower redshifts. Finally, we show that a
substantial fraction of the effect remains even after allowing the bias
coefficients to shift within a physically allowed range. This suggests that the
EdS approximation can only fit the data to a level of precision that is roughly
comparable to the precision of the next generation of cosmological surveys.
Furthermore, we find that implementing the exact time dependence formalism is
not demanding and is easily applicable to data. Both of these points motivate a
direct study of this effect on the cosmological parameters.

degeneracy under a magnetic field. In addition, the intra- and inter-valley

Dam-downstream environment and ecosystems have been severely affected by

mitigate this issue. However, its cost-effective implementation has not been
considered from a theoretical side. This paper presents a tractable new
stochastic control model to deal with this issue. The sediment dynamics in the
river environment follow non-smooth and continuous-time piecewise deterministic
dynamics. The model assumes that the observation of the sediment dynamics is
carried out only randomly and discretely, and that the sediment can be
replenished at each observation time with cost. This partial observation
assumption is consistent with the fact that continuously obtaining the
environmental information is difficult in applications. The performance index
to penalize the sediment depletion has a non-smooth term as well. We
demonstrate that these non-smoothness factors harmonize with a dynamic
programming principle, and derive the optimality equation in a degenerate
elliptic form governing the most cost-efficient sediment replenishment policy.
We analytically derive and verify an exact solution under a simplified
condition for a discounted case, an Ergodic case, and a complete information
case. A more realistic case is handled using a high-resolution finite

subclasses are often considered. The class of weighted marked graphs with
relaxed place constraint (WMG=< for short), in which each place has at most one
input and one output, and the larger class of choice-free (CF) nets, in which
each place has at most one output, have been extensively studied to this end,
with various applications.
  In this work, we develop new properties related to the fundamental and
intractable problems of reachability, liveness and reversibility in weighted
Petri nets. We focus mainly on the homogeneous Petri nets with a single shared
place (H1S nets for short), which extend the expressiveness of CF nets by
allowing one shared place (i.e. a place with at least two outputs and possibly
several inputs) under the homogeneity constraint (i.e. all the output weights
of the shared place are equal). Indeed, this simple generalization already
yields new challenging problems and is expressive enough for modeling existing
use-cases, justifying a dedicated study.
  One of our central results is the first characterization of liveness in a
subclass of H1S nets more expressive than WMG=< that is expressed by the
infeasibility of an integer linear program (ILP) of polynomial size. This trims
down the complexity to co-NP, contrasting with the known EXPSPACE-hardness of
liveness in the more general case of weighted Petri nets. In the same subclass,
we obtain a new reachability property related to the live markings, which is a
variant of the well-known Keller's theorem. Another central result is a new
reversibility characterization for the live H1S class, simplifying its
checking. Finally, we apply our results to use-cases, highlight their
scalability and discuss their extensibility to more expressive classes.

detected at subsets of possible input and output channels. Immanants are
mathematical constructs that interpolate between the permanent and determinant;
contrary to determinants and permanents, which have meaningful physical
applications, immanants are devoid of physical meaning classically but here are
shown to be meaningful in a quantum setting. Our quadratic form of immanants is
sampled by injecting vacuum and single photons into interferometer input ports
such that the photon arrival times are entangled, in contrast to previous

quantumness is the first step towards constructing a useful quantum computer.
There are currently three approaches for exhibiting proofs of quantumness: (i)
Inverting a classically-hard one-way function (e.g. using Shor's algorithm).
This seems technologically out of reach. (ii) Sampling from a
classically-hard-to-sample distribution (e.g. BosonSampling). This may be
within reach of near-term experiments, but for all such tasks known
verification requires exponential time. (iii) Interactive protocols based on
cryptographic assumptions. The use of a trapdoor scheme allows for efficient
verification, and implementation seems to require much less resources than (i),
yet still more than (ii).
  In this work we propose a significant simplification to approach (iii) by
employing the random oracle heuristic. (We note that we do not apply the
Fiat-Shamir paradigm.) We give a two-message (challenge-response) proof of
quantumness based on any trapdoor claw-free function. In contrast to earlier
proposals we do not need an adaptive hard-core bit property. This allows the

agnostic Gaussian Process (GP) bandit interpretation in which an appropriately

confidence bound (UCB) algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm
(\texttt{LP-GP-UCB}) where the usual GP surrogate model is augmented with Local
Polynomial (LP) estimators of the H\""older smooth function $f$ to construct a
multi-scale UCB guiding the search for the optimizer. We analyze this algorithm
and derive high probability bounds on its simple and cumulative regret. We then
prove that the elements of many common RKHS are H\""older smooth and obtain the
corresponding H\""older smoothness parameters, and hence, specialize our regret
bounds for several commonly used kernels. When specialized to the Squared

while for the case of Mat\'ern kernels $(K_{\nu})_{\nu>0}$, it results in
uniformly tighter regret bounds for all values of the smoothness parameter

near-optimal bounds on simple and cumulative regrets, matching the
algorithm-independent lower bounds up to polylog factors, and thus closing the
large gap between the existing upper and lower bounds for these values of
$\nu$. Additionally, our analysis provides the first explicit regret bounds, in

starts to increase. While many explanations have been offered to explain this
anomaly, none have provided a satisfactory answer. We present the first
experimental results that demonstrate that the anomaly is not real, but is
instead an artifact arising from an insufficient annealing time at the low

time-series data even in the presence of large noise. We further apply the
ODENet to real actin aggregation data, which shows an impressive performance as

heuristics that enable the tight coupling of different components. One of the
core components is phase selection, wherein the solver, during branching,
decides the polarity of the branch to be explored for a given variable. Most of
the state-of-the-art CDCL SAT solvers employ phase-saving as a phase selection
heuristic, which was proposed to address the potential inefficiencies arising
from far-backtracking. In light of the emergence of chronological backtracking
in CDCL solvers, we re-examine the efficiency of phase saving. Our empirical
evaluation leads to a surprising conclusion: The usage of phase saving and
random selection of polarity during chronological backtracking leads to
indistinguishable runtime performance in terms of instances solved and PAR-2
score.
  We introduce Decaying Polarity Score (DPS) to capture the trend of the
polarities attained by the variable, and upon observing lack of performance
improvement due to DPS, we turn to a more sophisticated heuristic seeking to
capture the activity of literals and the trend of polarities: Literal State
Independent Decaying Sum (LSIDS). We find the 2019 winning SAT solver,

  anisotropy: theory and simulations","10 pages, 2 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Skyrmion is a topologically protected spin texture excited in magnetic thin
films. The radii of skyrmions are typically 10-100 nm. Because of the size, the
skyrmion is expected to be a candidate for memory and novel-device usages. To
realize the futuristic devices that will be using the skyrmion circuit, the
tracks which guide the motion of skyrmions are needed. The tracks patterned
with differences in the magnetic-anisotropy energy are well-paved without a
potential pocket, whereas the tracks carved out of magnetic films have the
potential pockets at corners due to the demagnetizing field. Therefore, the
tracks patterned with the magnetic anisotropy plays a key role in making the
skyrmion circuits. The experiment along this idea has been conducted for the
hub and bent tracks. However, we have little known the motion of skyrmions in
these tracks. This work aims to identify the forces acting between skyrmions
and walls of the tracks. The static force on a skyrmion can be expressed as
minus the gradient of the potential energy caused by the magnetic-anisotropy
undulation. The potential can be estimated numerically, modeling the shape of
skyrmions with their radii and domain wall widths. We find that the forces
depend not only on the distance from the wall but also on the shape of
skyrmions. We have also performed micromagnetic simulations where the Magnus
force and the acceleration by the magnetic-anisotropy gradient are taken into
account as well as the force by the walls. The simulation results show good
agreement with those calculated from the modeled skyrmions.

for the inhomogeneous metallicity distribution of the thin-disk stars with

decreasing trends of velocity dispersions with increasing [Fe/H]. The

electronic converters due to their high efficiency and flexibility.
Nevertheless, controlling MSGs is a challenging task due to highest

profound ways. Various evidence has implicated the adhesome, a body of adhesion
associated proteins, in several cell fate decisions, including differentiation
and proliferation. Furthermore, recent work has demonstrated that substrate
topography can modulate the epigenetic state of fibroblasts, facilitate cell
reprogramming, and temper inflammation. However, the effectors responsible for
such phenomena remain poorly understood. Here we explore the effect of
biomaterial design, adhesion, and intracellular forces of the epigenetic and
transcriptional regulation of cell state during macrophage activation and

heterogeneous across people, and noisy. These challenges demand the development
of computational tools that are tailored both for the neuroscience questions

algorithms in various domains of fMRI research: fMRI in naturalistic tasks,
analyzing full-brain functional connectivity, pattern classification, inferring
representational similarity and modeling structured residuals. These algorithms
all tackle the challenges in fMRI similarly: they start by making clear
statements of assumptions about neural data and existing domain knowledge,
incorporating those assumptions and domain knowledge into probabilistic
graphical models, and using those models to estimate properties of interest or
latent structures in the data. Such approaches can avoid erroneous findings,
reduce the impact of noise, better utilize known properties of the data, and
better aggregate data across groups of subjects. With these successful cases,
we advocate wider adoption of explicit model construction in cognitive
neuroscience. Although we focus on fMRI, the principle illustrated here is
generally applicable to brain data of other modalities.

from the star-forming to the quiescent phases. To investigate the role of the
environment in quenching star formation, we use the wide-field data from the
Hyper Suprime-Cam Strategic Subaru Proposal survey to quantify the frequency of
green valley galaxies in different environments and their redshift evolution.
We find that the green valley fraction, in general, is less than 20% in any
redshift and environment. The green valley fraction, when normalized to the
total population, is higher in the field than that in groups or clusters and
decreases with a decreasing redshift and increasing mass. The lower fraction of
transitional galaxies in denser environments could be a consequence of the lack
of star-forming galaxies, which could be the progenitors of green valley
galaxies. To assess the effect of the environment on star formation quenching,
we define the effective green valley fraction as the ratio of the number of
green valley galaxies to that of nonquiescent galaxies only. The effective
green valley fraction for field galaxies is lower than that for group or
cluster galaxies, which reveals a strong positive mass dependence and mild
redshift evolution. Moreover, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) is
reduced by 0.1-0.3 dex in groups or clusters. Our results thus imply that an
ongoing slow quenching process has been acting in the dense environment since

are presented, all being direct, that is non-iterative. The resulting bounds
range from crude but simple estimates to accurate but sophisticated estimates
that make limited use of information from the solution of the Riemann problem.
Through a carefully chosen suite of test problems we asses our wave speed
estimates against exact solutions and against previously proposed wave speed
estimates. The results confirm that the derived theoretical bounds are actually
so, from below and above, for minimal and maximal wave speeds respectively. The
results also show that popular previously proposed estimates do not bound the
true wave speeds in general. Applications in mind, but not pursued here,
include (i) reliable implementation of the Courant condition to determine a
stable time step in all explicit methods for hyperbolic equations; (ii) use in
local time stepping algorithms and (iii) construction of HLL-type numerical
fluxes for hyperbolic equations.

four MR images (T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and

gravitational waves. To study these events in the cosmological context we need
to trace the large-scale structure and cosmic evolution of a statistical
population of galaxies, from dim dwarfs to bright galaxies. To cover such a
large range of galaxy masses, we analyse two complementary simulations:
Horizon-AGN with a large volume and low resolution which tracks the high-mass
(> 1e7 Msun) MBH population, and NewHorizon with a smaller volume but higher
resolution that traces the low-mass (< 1e7 Msun) MBH population. While
Horizon-AGN can be used to estimate the rate of inspirals for Pulsar Timing
Arrays, NewHorizon can investigate MBH mergers in a statistical sample of dwarf
galaxies for LISA, which is sensitive to low-mass MBHs. We use the same method
to analyse the two simulations, post-processing MBH dynamics to account for
time delays mostly determined by dynamical friction and stellar hardening. In
both simulations, MBHs typically merge long after the galaxies do, so that the
galaxy morphology at the time of the MBH merger is no longer determined by the
galaxy merger from which the MBH merger originated. These time delays cause a
loss of high-z MBH coalescences, shifting the peak of the MBH merger rate to
z~1-2. This study shows how tracking MBH mergers in low-mass galaxies is
crucial to probing the MBH merger rate for LISA and investigate the properties
of the host galaxies.

significant performance improvements on several retrieval benchmarks. When the
items being retrieved are documents, the time and memory cost of employing
Transformers over a full sequence of document terms can be prohibitive. A
popular strategy involves considering only the first n terms of the document.
This can, however, result in a biased system that under retrieves longer
documents. In this work, we propose a local self-attention which considers a
moving window over the document terms and for each term attends only to other
terms in the same window. This local attention incurs a fraction of the compute
and memory cost of attention over the whole document. The windowed approach
also leads to more compact packing of padded documents in minibatches resulting
in additional savings. We also employ a learned saturation function and a
two-staged pooling strategy to identify relevant regions of the document. The
Transformer-Kernel pooling model with these changes can efficiently elicit
relevance information from documents with thousands of tokens. We benchmark our

as a reinforcement learning (RL), problem where the reward depends on the
agent's uncertainty. For example, the reward can be the negative entropy of the
agent's belief over an unknown (or hidden) variable. Typically, the rewards of
an RL agent are defined as a function of the state-action pairs and not as a
function of the belief of the agent; this hinders the direct application of
deep RL methods for such tasks. This paper tackles the challenge of using
belief-based rewards for a deep RL agent, by offering a simple insight that
maximizing any convex function of the belief of the agent can be approximated
by instead maximizing a prediction reward: a reward based on prediction
accuracy. In particular, we derive the exact error between negative entropy and
the expected prediction reward. This insight provides theoretical motivation
for several fields using prediction rewards---namely visual attention, question
answering systems, and intrinsic motivation---and highlights their connection
to the usually distinct fields of active perception, active sensing, and sensor
placement. Based on this insight we present deep anticipatory networks (DANs),
which enables an agent to take actions to reduce its uncertainty without
performing explicit belief inference. We present two applications of DANs:
building a sensor selection system for tracking people in a shopping mall and
learning discrete models of attention on fashion MNIST and MNIST digit

extracted from an image by rounding output features from a CNN, which is
trained on a supervised binary similar/ dissimilar task. Drawbacks of this
approach are: (i) resulting codes do not necessarily capture semantic
similarity of the input data (ii) rounding results in information loss,
manifesting as decreased retrieval performance and (iii) Using only class-wise
similarity as a target can lead to trivial solutions, simply encoding
classifier outputs rather than learning more intricate relations, which is not
detected by most performance metrics. We overcome (i) via a novel loss function
encouraging the relative hash code distances of learned features to match those
derived from their targets. We address (ii) via a differentiable estimate of
the KL divergence between network outputs and a binary target distribution,
resulting in minimal information loss when the features are rounded to binary.
Finally, we resolve (iii) by focusing on a hierarchical precision metric.

  We prove that $f$ is smooth, which yields convergence rate proportional to
$1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the desired approximation accuracy. To
complete the analysis, we provide upper bounds on the norm of the optimal
solution which depend on new parameters measuring ""the degeneracy"" in our
input. We believe that our parameters capture degeneracy better than other,
seemingly weaker, parameters used in previous works.
  We next analyze the strong convexity of $f$, and present two worst-case lower
bounds on the smallest eigenvalue of its Hessian. This gives another worst-case
bound on the convergence rate of another variant of gradient decent that
depends only logarithmically on $1/\epsilon$.

set $\lbrace \neg,\vee,\wedge,\rightarrow,\leftrightarrow\rbrace$. The
verification for the functional incompleteness highly relies on constructive
proofs. The judgement with a large untested operator set can be inefficient.
Given with a mass of potential operators proposed in various logic systems, a
general verification method for their functional completeness is demanded. This
paper offers an universal verification for the functional completeness.
Firstly, we propose two abstract operators $\widehat{R}$ and $\breve{R}$, both
of which have no fixed form and are only defined by several weak constraints.
Specially, $\widehat{R}_{\geq}$ and $\breve{R}_{\geq}$ are the abstract
operators defined with the total order relation $\geq$. Then, we prove that any
operator set $\mathfrak{R}$ is functionally complete if and only if it can
represent the composite operator $\widehat{R}_{\geq}\circ\breve{R}_{\geq}$ or
$\breve{R}_{\geq}\circ\widehat{R}_{\geq}$. Otherwise $\mathfrak{R}$ is
determined to be functionally incomplete. This theory can be generally applied
to any untested operator set to determine whether it is functionally complete.

temperature can be simulated in models when a fraction of the surface radiation
is deposited deeper in the interior. Meanwhile migration theories suggest that
hot Jupiters formed further away from their host-star and migrated inward. We
incorporate disk migration in simulations of the evolving interior of hot
Jupiters to determine whether migration has a long lasting effect on the
inflation of planets. We quantify the difference between the radius of a
migrated planet and the radius of a planet that formed in situ as the radius
discrepancy. We remain agnostic about the physical mechanism behind interior
heating, but assume it scales with the received stellar flux by a certain
fraction. We find that the change in irradiation received from the host-star
while the planet is migrating can affect the inflation and final radius of the
planet. Models with a high fraction of energy deposited in the interior ( > 5%)
show a significant radius discrepancy when the deposit is at higher pressures
than P=1 bar. For a smaller fraction of 1%, there is no radius discrepancy for
any deposit depth. We show that a uniform heating mechanism can cause different
rates of inflation, depending on the migration history. If the forthcoming
observations on mean densities and atmospheres of gas giants give a better
indication of a potential heating mechanism, this could help to constrain the
prior migration of such planets.

In these contexts, fine-grained application performance can be based on
accurate modeling of streaming operators. This is especially beneficial for
computationally expensive operators like adaptive stream joins that, being very
sensitive to rate-varying data streams, would otherwise require costly frequent
monitoring.
  We propose a dynamic model for the processing throughput and latency of
adaptive stream joins that run with different parallelism degrees. The model is
presented with progressive complexity, from a centralized non-deterministic up
to a deterministic parallel stream join, describing how throughput and latency
dynamics are influenced by various configuration parameters. The model is
catalytic for understanding the behavior of stream joins against different
system deployments, as we show with our model-based autoscaling methodology to
change the parallelism degree of stream joins during the execution. Our
thorough evaluation, for a broad spectrum of parameter, confirms the model can
reliably predict throughput and latency metrics with a fairly high accuracy,
with the median error in estimation ranging from approximately 0.1% to 6.5%,
even for an overloaded system. Furthermore, we show that our model allows to
efficiently control adaptive stream joins by estimating the needed resources
solely based on the observed input load. In particular, we show it can be
employed to enable efficient autoscaling, even when big changes in the input
load happen frequently (in the realm of seconds).

Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke (GSF) instability in differentially rotating
radiation zones. This instability may be a key player in transporting angular
momentum in stars and giant planets, but its nonlinear evolution remains mostly
unexplored. In a previous paper we considered the equatorial instability,
whereas here we simulate the instability at a general latitude for the first
time. We adopt a local Cartesian Boussinesq model in a modified shearing box
for most of our simulations, but we also perform some simulations with
stress-free, impenetrable, radial boundaries. We first revisit the linear
instability and derive some new results, before studying its nonlinear
evolution. The instability is found to behave very differently compared with
its behaviour at the equator. In particular, here we observe the development of
strong zonal jets (""layering"" in the angular momentum), which can considerably
enhance angular momentum transport, particularly in axisymmetric simulations.
The jets are, in general, tilted with respect to the local gravity by an angle
that corresponds initially with that of the linear modes, but which evolves
with time and depends on the strength of the flow. The instability transports
angular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it
does at the equator, and we estimate that the GSF instability could contribute
to the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and
subgiant stars. It could also play a role in the long-term evolution of the
solar tachocline and the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters.

Face2Face and Deepfake, more fake face images are spreading over the internet,
which brings serious challenges to public confidence. Face image forgery
detection has made considerable progresses in exposing specific FIM, but it is
still in scarcity of a robust fake face detector to expose face image forgeries
under complex scenarios such as with further compression, blurring, scaling,
etc. Due to the relatively fixed structure, convolutional neural network (CNN)
tends to learn image content representations. However, CNN should learn subtle
manipulation traces for image forensics tasks. Thus, we propose an adaptive
manipulation traces extraction network (AMTEN), which serves as pre-processing
to suppress image content and highlight manipulation traces. AMTEN exploits an
adaptive convolution layer to predict manipulation traces in the image, which
are reused in subsequent layers to maximize manipulation artifacts by updating
weights during the back-propagation pass. A fake face detector, namely
AMTENnet, is constructed by integrating AMTEN with CNN. Experimental results
prove that the proposed AMTEN achieves desirable pre-processing. When detecting
fake face images generated by various FIM techniques, AMTENnet achieves an
average accuracy up to 98.52%, which outperforms the state-of-the-art works.
When detecting face images with unknown post-processing operations, the
detector also achieves an average accuracy of 95.17%.

unachievable with classical resources. However, losses on the communication
channel preclude the direct long-distance transmission of quantum information
in many relevant scenarios. In principle quantum repeaters allow one to
overcome losses. However, realistic hardware parameters make long-distance
quantum communication a challenge in practice. For instance, in many protocols
an entangled pair is generated that needs to wait in quantum memory until the
generation of an additional pair. During this waiting time the first pair
decoheres, impacting the quality of the final entanglement produced. At the
cost of a lower rate, this effect can be mitigated by imposing a cut-off
condition. For instance, a maximum storage time for entanglement after which it
is discarded. In this work, we optimize the cut-offs for quantum repeater
chains. First, we develop an algorithm for computing the probability
distribution of the waiting time and fidelity of entanglement produced by
repeater chain protocols which include a cut-off. Then, we use the algorithm to
optimize cut-offs in order to maximize secret-key rate between the end nodes of
the repeater chain. We find that the use of the optimal cut-off extends the
parameter regime for which secret key can be generated and moreover
significantly increases the secret-key rate for a large range of parameters.

corresponding neighbors on the individuals by converting the opinion

effectively explain the formation of bi-polarization during opinion evolution

we first encode multiple relationships among stocks into graphs based on

fluctuating field remains at a particular state for a certain amount of time,
before being switched to another state. The concept of persistence has been
found to have many diverse practical applications, ranging from non-equilibrium
statistical mechanics to financial dynamics to distribution of time scales in
turbulent flows and many more. In this study, we carry out a detailed analysis
of the statistical characteristics of the persistence probability density
functions (PDFs) of velocity and temperature fluctuations in the surface layer
of a convective boundary layer, using a field-experimental dataset. Our results
demonstrate that for the time scales smaller than the integral scales, the
persistence PDFs of turbulent velocity and temperature fluctuations display a
clear power-law behaviour, associated with self-similar eddy cascading
mechanism. Moreover, we also show that the effects of non-Gaussian temperature
fluctuations act only at those scales which are larger than the integral
scales, where the persistence PDFs deviate from the power-law and drop
exponentially. Furthermore, the mean time scales of the negative temperature
fluctuation events persisting longer than the integral scales are found to be
approximately equal to twice the integral scale in highly convective
conditions. However, with stability this mean time scale gradually decreases to
almost being equal to the integral scale in the near neutral conditions.
Contrarily, for the long positive temperature fluctuation events, the mean time
scales remain roughly equal to the integral scales, irrespective of stability.

topological spaces, admit natural constructions in the framework of simplicial
sets. The existence of similar spaces for the intersection cohomology groups of
a stratified space is a long-standing open problem asked by M. Goresky and R.
MacPherson. One feature of this work is a construction of such simplicial sets.
From works of R. MacPherson, J. Lurie and others, it is now commonly accepted
that the simplicial set of singular simplices associated to a topological space
has to be replaced by the simplicial set of singular simplices that respect the
stratification. This is encoded in the category of simplicial sets over the
nerve of the poset of strata. For each perversity, we define a functor from it,
with values in the category of cochain complexes over a commutative ring. This
construction is based upon a simplicial blow up and the associated cohomology
is the intersection cohomology as it was defined by M. Goresky and R.
MacPherson in terms of hypercohomology of Delignes's sheaves. This functor
admits an adjoint and we use it to get classifying spaces for intersection
cohomology. Natural intersection cohomology operations are understood in terms
of intersection cohomology of these classifying spaces. As in the classical
case, they form infinite loop spaces. In the last section, we examine the depth
one case of stratified spaces with only one singular stratum. We observe that
the classifying spaces are Joyal's projective cones over classical
Eilenberg-MacLane spaces. We establish some of their properties and conjecture
that, for Goresky and MacPherson perversities, all intersection cohomology
operations are induced by classical ones.

geometry modifies the evolution of the curvature perturbations, the scalar
modes may also indirectly affect the cosmic backgrounds of relic gravitons by
inducing higher-order corrections that are only superficially gauge-invariant.
This spurious gauge-invariance gets manifest when the effective anisotropic
stresses, computed in different coordinate systems, are preliminarily expressed
in a form that only depends on the curvature inhomogeneities defined on
comoving orthogonal hypersurfaces and on their corresponding time derivatives.
Using this observation we demonstrate in general terms that the higher-order
contributions derived in diverse coordinate systems coincide when the
wavelengths are smaller than the sound horizon defining the evolution of the
curvature inhomogeneities but they lead to sharply different results in the
opposite limit. A similar drawback arises when the energy density of the relic
gravitons is derived from competing energy-momentum pseudo-tensors and should
be consistently taken into account in the related phenomenological discussions.

non-vanishing Berry curvature in Mn$_3$Ge can be continuously tuned by
application of hydrostatic pressure. At room temperature, the Hall signal
changes sign as a function of pressure and vanishes completely at $p=1.53$ GPa.
Even though the Hall conductivity changes sign upon increasing pressure, the
room-temperature saturation value of 23 ${\rm \Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}}$ at 2.85 GPa
is remarkably high and comparable to the saturation value at ambient pressure
of about 40 ${\rm \Omega^{-1}cm^{-1}}$. The change in the Hall conductivity can
be directly linked to a gradual change of the size of the in-plane components
of the Mn moments in the non-collinear triangular magnetic structure. Our
findings, therefore, provide a route for tuning of the AHE in the chiral

CuBe body centred cubic (bcc, CsCl -- type) semi-coherent particles with the
{220} Cu // {200} CuBe crystallographic orientation relationship. These
particles created significant internal stress fields and became obstacles for
dislocation glide that resulted in a change in the hardness from 95 Vickers
hardness (HV) for the solubilized alloy to 400 HV for the aged one. The severe
plastic deformation led to the formation of a single-phase nanograined
microstructure with an average grain size of 20 nm and 390 HV. It was found
that this grain size was slightly driven by grain boundary segregation. Further
aging of the nanocrystalline alloy led to the discontinuous formation of
precipitates on the former Cu grain boundaries and skipping of metastable
phases. Significant age hardening with a maximum hardness of 466 HV for the
aged nanostructured alloy was observed. Mechanical tests result revealed a
strong influence of microstructure and further aging on strength capability of
the alloy for both coarse-grained and nanostructured alloy. A good thermal
stability in the nanostructured alloy was also noticed. Theoretical
calculations of the hardness value for the CuBe phase are provided. It was
shown that Be as a light alloying elements could be used for direct change of
microstructure of severely deformed copper alloys.

from a paucity of downhill directions, to energy barriers that govern the
escape from local minima at long times. The insights gained are used to
rationalize the relaxation of the energy after a quench from high $T$, as well

autonomous vehicle technologies, we need to understand how these interactions
are likely to present themselves, and what their implications might be. This
paper looks into the impact of autonomous vehicles with differing controllers,
focusing specifically on the effects of changing the mean and heterogeneity of
controller parameters on three key performance metrics: throughput, passenger
safety and comfort. Towards this end, we develop a method for systematically
sampling vehicle controllers as a function of parameter heterogeneity. In
addition to evaluating the impact of heterogeneity on performance, we quantify
the relative impacts of controller input parameters on the output performance
metrics by means of sensitivity analyses. The MovSim traffic simulator was used
to simulate a realistic traffic system, whilst recording maximum throughput, as
well as lane change frequencies and mean absolute accelerations as proxies for
safety and comfort. Our results reveal that traffic performance is primarily
affected by the heterogeneity of vehicle target velocities, as well as by the
mean values of a very small subset of the parameters, of which the target
velocity is by far the most significant.

spin-orbital-coupled fermions near both $s$- and $p$-wave resonances using
effective field theory. Since the spin-orbital coupling mixes different partial
waves, a contact matrix is introduced to capture the non-trivial correlation
between dimers. We find the signature of the spin-orbital coupling appears at
the leading order for the off-diagonal components of the momentum distribution
matrix, which is proportional to $1/q^{3}$ ($q$ is the relative momentum). We
further derive the large frequency behavior of the Raman spectroscopy, which
serves as an independent measurable quantity for contacts. Finally, we give an
explicit example of contacts by considering a two-body problem.

sensing overtones of the three thickness eigen-modes of the so-called SC-cut,
since all three modes, two shear mode and one extensional mode, can be
electrically probed with such a crystal cut. From quality-factor measurements,
the mechanical losses of the adhesive graphene monolayer are assessed to be
about 8 x 10-4 at 4 K in the best case. They are therefore significantly
greater than those already reported for suspended membranes but also for
adherent layers on SiO2/Si substrates operating in torsional modes. In fact,
results reveal that surface scattering occurs due to a roughness degradation of
a factor 7. In addition, the mechanical losses presented here are also placed
in the context of a device submitted to thermomechanical stresses, but which
are not the only ones existing. Some of them could be intrinsic ones related to
the deposition process of the graphene layer. Based on a force-frequency theory
applied to the three thickness modes which react differently to stresses, it is
demonstrated that this stress effect actually entangled with that of mass

GHz is also detected showing a mixture of thermal and maser emission. Moreover,
the H$_2$O masers are distributed in a region ~0.25"" shifted from G25.82-W1.
The CH$_3$OH 22$_{4}$-21$_{5}$ E line shows a compact ring-like structure at
the position of G25.82-W1 with a velocity gradient, indicating a rotating disk
or envelope. Assuming Keplerian rotation, the dynamical mass of G25.82-W1 is
estimated to be $>$25 M$_{\odot}$ and the total mass of 20 M$_\odot$-84
M$_\odot$ is derived from the 1.3 mm continuum emission. The driving source of
the N-S SiO outflow is G25.82-W1 while that of the SE-NW SiO outflow is
uncertain. Detection of multiple high-mass starless$/$protostellar cores and
candidates without low-mass cores implies that HM-YSOs could form in individual
high-mass cores as predicted by the turbulent core accretion model. If this is
the case, the high-mass star formation process in G25.82 would be consistent
with a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation.

examination of LQU developed among four qubits and also shed some light on its

to its decay from cavities. For four qubits, we propose how to compute LQU such
that the method is intuitive and conformable to the observation. We find that
among four qubits LQU starts growing from zero to maximum value and then decays
again to zero as the asymptotic state of cavities is completely transferred to

e.g. lassos. We show that the GLN method is a significantly faster technique to
detect entanglement in lasso proteins in comparison with other methods. Based
on the GLN technique, we conduct comprehensive analysis of all proteins
deposited in the PDB and compare it to the statistical properties of the
polymers. We found that there are significantly more lassos with negative
crossings than those with positive ones in proteins, the average value of
maxGLN (maximal GLN between loop and pieces of tail) depends logarithmically on
the length of a tail similarly as in the polymers. Next, we show the how high

unfolding routes. Finally, we discuss how the GLN method can be applied to
study entanglement between two structures none of which are closed loops. Since
this approach is much faster than other linking invariants, the next step will

minimizing CO2 emissions from related electrical power generation. The control
is using weather and CO2 emission forecasts as input to a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) - a multivariate control algorithm using a dynamic process model,
constraints and a cost function to be minimized. In a simulation study the
control was applied using weather and power grid conditions during a full year
period in 2017-2018 for the power bidding zone DK2 (East, Denmark). Two
scenarios were studied; one with a family house and one with an office
building. The buildings were dimensioned on the basis of standards and building
codes. The main results are measured as the CO2 emission savings relative to a
classical thermostatic control. Note that this only measures the gain achieved
using the MPC control, i.e. the energy flexibility, not the absolute savings.
The results show that around 16% savings could have been achieved during the
period in well insulated new buildings with floor heating.
  Further, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the effect of
various building properties, e.g. level of insulation and thermal capacity.
Danish building codes from 1977 and forward was used as benchmarks for
insulation levels. It was shown that both insulation and thermal mass influence
the achievable flexibility savings, especially for floor heating. Buildings
that comply with codes later than 1979 could provide flexibility emission
savings of around 10%, while buildings that comply with earlier codes provided
savings in the range of 0-5% depending on the heating system and thermal mass.

restore missing musical audio data with a duration ranging between hundreds of
milliseconds to a few seconds, i.e., to perform long-gap audio inpainting.
While previous work either addressed shorter gaps or relied on exemplars by
copying available information from other signal parts, GACELA addresses the
inpainting of long gaps in two aspects. First, it considers various time scales
of audio information by relying on five parallel discriminators with increasing
resolution of receptive fields. Second, it is conditioned not only on the
available information surrounding the gap, i.e., the context, but also on the
latent variable of the conditional GAN. This addresses the inherent
multi-modality of audio inpainting at such long gaps and provides the option of
user-defined inpainting. GACELA was tested in listening tests on music signals
of varying complexity and gap durations ranging from 375~ms to 1500~ms. While
our subjects were often able to detect the inpaintings, the severity of the
artifacts decreased from unacceptable to mildly disturbing. GACELA represents a
framework capable to integrate future improvements such as processing of more
auditory-related features or more explicit musical features.

frame-by-frame signal reception and processing. A paramount feature of the
proposed method is that the same LSTM is used across frequencies, which
drastically reduces the number of network parameters, the amount of training
data and the computational burden. Training is performed in a subband manner:
the input consists of one frequency, together with a few context frequencies.
The network learns a speech-to-noise discriminative function relying on the
signal stationarity and on the local spectral pattern, based on which it
predicts a clean-speech mask at each frequency. To exploit future information,
i.e. look-ahead, we propose an output-delayed subband architecture, which
allows the unidirectional forward network to process a few future frames in
addition to the current frame. We leverage the proposed method to participate
to the DNS real-time speech enhancement challenge. Experiments with the DNS
dataset show that the proposed method achieves better performance-measuring
scores than the DNS baseline method, which learns the full-band spectra using a

study the relation of both models when Hubbard interactions are added, using
the density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. To this end, we express the
fermionic Hofstadter model in a hybrid-space representation, and define a
family of interactions, which connects 1d Hubbard charge pumps to 2d Hubbard
Chern insulators. We study a three-band model at particle density $\rho=2/3$,
where the topological quantization of the 1d charge pump changes from Chern
number $C=2$ to $C=-1$ as the interaction strength increases. We find that the
$C=-1$ phase is robust when varying the interaction terms on narrow-width
cylinders. However, this phase does not extend to the limit of the 2d
Hofstadter-Hubbard model, which remains in the $C=2$ phase. We discuss the
existence of both topological phases for the largest cylinder circumferences
that we can access numerically. We note the appearance of a ferromagnetic
ground state between the strongly interacting 1d and 2d models. For this
ferromagnetic state, one can understand the $C=-1$ phase from a bandstructure
argument. Our method for measuring the Hall conductivity could similarly be
realized in experiments: We compute the current response to a weak, linear

channel properties. In our considered scenarios, these typically have a time
constant that is far larger than the coherence time of the channel. We
developed both an optimal and an approximation algorithm to partition users

results show that both algorithms, despite using only these directional channel
properties, achieve similar performance in terms of the minimum
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio for any user, compared with a reference
method using full channel knowledge. In particular, we demonstrate that
grouping nodes with related directional properties is to be avoided. We hence
realise a simple partitioning method requiring minimal information to be

eruptions. They are observed as (interplanetary) coronal mass ejections (ICMEs
or CMEs) with coronal and heliospheric imagers. A fraction of them are observed
insitu as magnetic clouds (MCs). Fitting these structures properly with a model
requires a better understanding of their evolution. In situ measurements are
done locally when the spacecraft trajectory crosses the magnetic configuration.
These observations are taken for different elements of plasma and at different
times, and are therefore biased by the expansion of the magnetic configuration.
This aging effect leads to stronger magnetic fields measured at the front than
at the rear of MCs, an asymmetry often present in MC data. However, can the
observed asymmetry be explained quantitatively only from the expansion? Based
on self-similar expansion, we derive a method to estimate the expansion rate
from observed plasma velocity. We next correct for the aging effect both the
observed magnetic field and the spatial coordinate along the spacecraft
trajectory. This provides corrected data as if the MC internal structure was
observed at the same time. We apply the method to 90 best observed MCs near
Earth (1995-2012). The aging effect is the main source of the observed magnetic
asymmetry only for 28\% of MCs. After correcting the aging effect, the
asymmetry is almost symmetrically distributed between MCs with a stronger
magnetic field at the front and those at the rear of MCs. The proposed method
can efficiently remove the aging bias within insitu data of MCs, and more
generally of ICMEs. This allows one to analyse the data with a spatial
coordinate, such as in models or remote sensing observations.

reference frame and continuously updated using projective geometry to follow
the tissue motion and control the movement of the robotic arm. The advantage of
the proposed method is that it does not require the learning of the tissue
motion prior to scanning and can deal with free-form deformation. We deployed
this framework on the da Vinci surgical robot using the da Vinci Research Kit
(dVRK) for Ultrasound tissue scanning. Since the framework does not rely on
information from the Ultrasound data, it can be easily extended to other
probe-based imaging modalities.

as an old (~2 Gyr) and metal-rich ([Fe/H]~0.2) nearby moving group that has a
dissolving cluster origin. The existence of such old and metal-rich groups in
the solar vicinity is quite unexpected since the vast majority of nearby moving
groups are known to be young. In the light of new and significantly larger data
sets we aim to re-investigate the properties and origin of the HR 1614 moving
group.
  To identify and characterise the HR 1614 moving group we use astrometric data
from Gaia DR2; distances, extinction, and reddening corrections from the
StarHorse code; elemental abundances from the GALAH and APOGEE spectroscopic
surveys; and photometric metallicities from the SkyMapper survey. Bayesian ages
were estimated for the SkyMapper stars. Since the Hercules stream is the
closest kinematical structure to the HR 1614 moving group in velocity space, we
use it for comparison purposes. Stars that are likely to be members of the two
groups were selected based on their space velocities.
  The HR 1614 moving group is located mainly at negative U velocities, does not
form an arch of constant energy in the U-V space and is tilted in V. The
overdensity is not chemically homogeneous but that its stars exist at a wide
range of both metallicities, ages, and elemental abundance ratios. They are
essentially similar to what is observed in the Galactic thin and thick disks, a
younger population (~3 Gyr) that is metal-rich (-0.2<[Fe/H]<0.4) and
alpha-poor. It should therefore not be considered as a dissolving open cluster,
or an accreted population. We suggest that HR 1614 has a complex origin that
could be explained by combining several different mechanisms such as resonances
with the Galactic bar and spiral structure, phase-mixing of dissolving spiral
structure, and phase-mixing due to an external perturbation.

To appear in Synthese",,"10.1007/s11229-019-02382-8",,"physics.hist-ph gr-qc hep-th","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Must a theory of quantum gravity have some truth to it if it can recover
general relativity in some limit of the theory? This paper answers this
question in the negative by indicating that general relativity is multiply
realizable in quantum gravity. The argument is inspired by spacetime
functionalism - multiple realizability being a central tenet of functionalism -
and proceeds via three case studies: induced gravity, thermodynamic gravity,
and entanglement gravity. In these, general relativity in the form of the
Einstein field equations can be recovered from elements that are either
manifestly multiply realizable or at least of the generic nature that is
suggestive of functions. If general relativity, as argued here, can inherit
this multiple realizability, then a theory of quantum gravity can recover
general relativity while being completely wrong about the posited
microstructure. As a consequence, the recovery of general relativity cannot
serve as the ultimate arbiter that decides which theory of quantum gravity that
is worthy of pursuit, even though it is of course not irrelevant either qua
quantum gravity. Thus, the recovery of general relativity in string theory, for
instance, does not guarantee that the stringy account of the world is on the
right track; despite sentiments to the contrary among string theorists.

systematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept
of super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to
disease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic
framework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport

we are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our
results reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that
counterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than
crowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore,

therefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective

  Selection for BI-RADS Classification of Breast Masses in Mammograms",,,"10.1155/2020/7695207",,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mammography remains the most prevalent imaging tool for early breast cancer
screening. The language used to describe abnormalities in mammographic reports
is based on the breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Assigning a
correct BI-RADS category to each examined mammogram is a strenuous and
challenging task for even experts. This paper proposes a new and effective
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to classify mammographic masses into four
assessment categories in BI-RADS. The mass regions are first enhanced by means
of histogram equalization and then semiautomatically segmented based on the
region growing technique. A total of 130 handcrafted BI-RADS features are then
extrcated from the shape, margin, and density of each mass, together with the
mass size and the patient's age, as mentioned in BI-RADS mammography. Then, a
modified feature selection method based on the genetic algorithm (GA) is
proposed to select the most clinically significant BI-RADS features. Finally, a
back-propagation neural network (BPN) is employed for classification, and its
accuracy is used as the fitness in GA. A set of 500 mammogram images from the
digital database of screening mammography (DDSM) is used for evaluation. Our
system achieves classification accuracy, positive predictive value, negative
predictive value, and Matthews correlation coefficient of 84.5%, 84.4%, 94.8%,
and 79.3%, respectively. To our best knowledge, this is the best current result
for BI-RADS classification of breast masses in mammography, which makes the
proposed system promising to support radiologists for deciding proper patient
management based on the automatically assigned BI-RADS categories.

possibility of steady gap acceleration around the null surface of a rotating
black hole magnetosphere. We employ a simplified (1D) description along with
the general relativistic expression of Gauss's law, and we assume that the gap
is embedded in the radiation field of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow.
The model is used to derive expressions for the radial distribution of the
parallel electric field component, the electron and positron charge density,
the particle Lorentz factor, and the number density of $\gamma$-ray photons. We
integrate the set of equations numerically, imposing suitable boundary
conditions. The results show that the existence of a steady gap solution for a
relative high value of the global current is in principle possible if charge
injection of both species is allowed at the boundaries. We present gap
solutions for different choices of the global current and the accretion rate.
When put in context, our results suggest that the variable very high energy
$\gamma$-ray emission in M87 could be compatible with a magnetospheric origin.

announcement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing
functionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in
many countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to
decide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end
isolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact
tracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not
possible so each phone must use its own ""risk model"" to inform decisions.
Ideally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course
of action given the test results of the user and those of other users. Here we
present a decentralised algorithm that estimates the Bayesian posterior
probability of viral transmission events and evaluates when a user should be
notified, tested or released from isolation while preserving user privacy. The
algorithm also allows the disease models on the phones to learn from everyone's
contact-tracing data and will allow Epidemiologists to better understand the

belief propagation, so each smart-phone can be used to execute a small part of

In this article, we demonstrate the experimental implementation of an advanced
anti-light shift interrogation protocol onto a continuous-wave (CW) microcell
atomic clock based on coherent population trapping (CPT). The method, inspired
by the Auto-Balanced Ramsey (ABR) spectroscopy technique demonstrated in pulsed
atomic clocks, consists in the extraction of atomic-based information from two
successive light-shifted clock frequencies obtained at two different laser
power values. Two error signals, computed from the linear combination of
signals acquired along a symmetric sequence, are managed in a dual-loop
configuration to generate a clock frequency free from light-shift. Using this
method, the sensitivity of the clock frequency to both laser power and
microwave power variations can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude
compared to normal operation. In the present experiment, the consideration of
the non-linear light-shift dependence allowed to enhance light-shift
mitigation. The implemented technique allows a clear improvement of the clock
Allan deviation for time scales higher than 1000 s. This method could be
applied in various kinds of atomic clocks such as CPT-based atomic clocks,
double-resonance Rb clocks, or cell-stabilized lasers.

generation model targeting to high-quality text-to-speech. Specifically, we
improve the original MelGAN by the following aspects. First, we increase the
receptive field of the generator, which is proven to be beneficial to speech
generation. Second, we substitute the feature matching loss with the
multi-resolution STFT loss to better measure the difference between fake and
real speech. Together with pre-training, this improvement leads to both better
quality and better training stability. More importantly, we extend MelGAN with
multi-band processing: the generator takes mel-spectrograms as input and
produces sub-band signals which are subsequently summed back to full-band
signals as discriminator input. The proposed multi-band MelGAN has achieved
high MOS of 4.34 and 4.22 in waveform generation and TTS, respectively. With
only 1.91M parameters, our model effectively reduces the total computational
complexity of the original MelGAN from 5.85 to 0.95 GFLOPS. Our Pytorch
implementation, which will be open-resourced shortly, can achieve a real-time

attributed to the increasing availability of data. However, inconsistency and
incomplete information are ubiquitous in real-world datasets, and their impact
on ML applications remains elusive. In this paper, we present a formal study of
this impact by extending the notion of Certain Answers for Codd tables, which
has been explored by the database research community for decades, into the
field of machine learning. Specifically, we focus on classification problems
and propose the notion of ""Certain Predictions"" (CP) -- a test data example can
be certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of
all possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same
prediction.
  We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines
whether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the
number of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given
that general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without
assumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the
context of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP
queries can be developed -- we show that it is possible to answer both queries
in linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds.
  We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of
""data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML)."" We show that our proposed
CPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing

determined self-consistently. By focusing on models with soft disordered
$p$-spin interactions, we show how to incorporate the mean-field theory of
aging within dynamical mean-field theory. We study cases with only one slow
time-scale, corresponding statically to the one-step replica symmetry breaking
(1RSB) phase, and cases with an infinite number of slow time-scales,
corresponding statically to the full replica symmetry breaking (FRSB) phase.
For the former, we show that the effective temperature of the slow degrees of
freedom is fixed by requiring critical dynamical behavior on short time-scales,
i.e. marginality. For the latter, we find that aging on an infinite number of
slow time-scales is governed by a stochastic equation where the clock for
dynamical evolution is fixed by the change of effective temperature, hence
obtaining a dynamical derivation of the stochastic equation at the basis of the
FRSB phase. Our results extend the realm of the mean-field theory of aging to
all situations where DMFT holds.

Crump-Mode-Jagers branching processes) counted with a general characteristic.
The martingale terminal value $W$ figures in the limits of his results.
  We investigate the rate at which the martingale, now called Nerman's
martingale, converges to its limit $W$. More precisely, assuming the existence
of a Malthusian parameter $\alpha > 0$ and $W_0\in L^2$, we prove a functional
central limit theorem for $(W-W_{t+s})_{s\in\mathbb{R}}$, properly normalized,
as $t\to\infty$. The weak limit is a randomly scaled time-changed Brownian
motion. Under an additional technical assumption, we prove a law of the

State-of-the-art approaches often include a localization step designed to help
a classification network by localizing the relevant parts of the input images.
However, this usually requires multiple iterations or passes through a full
classification network or complex training schedules. In this work we present
an efficient localization module that can be fused with a classification

removes $N_A$ particles from both $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^P$ and $\{y_i\}_{i=1}^M$
simultaneously, yielding another empirical signed measure $\nu$ such that $\int
f d \nu$ approximates to $\int f d \mu$ within an acceptable accuracy for
suitable test functions $f$. Such annihilation of particles carrying opposite
importance weights has been extensively utilized for alleviating the numerical
sign problem in particle simulations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm
for PA in high-dimensional Euclidean space based on hybrid of clustering and
matching, dubbed the Sequential-clustering Particle Annihilation via
Discrepancy Estimation (SPADE). It consists of two steps: Adaptive clustering
of particles via controlling their number-theoretic discrepancies, and
independent random matching among positive and negative particles in each
cluster. Both deterministic error bounds by the Koksma-Hlawka inequality and
non-asymptotic random error bounds by concentration inequalities are proved to
be affected by two factors. One factor measures the irregularity of point
distributions and reflects their discrete nature. The other relies on the
variation of test function and is influenced by the continuity. Only the latter
implicitly depends on dimensionality $d$, implying that SPADE can be immune to
the curse of dimensionality for a wide class of test functions. Numerical
experiments up to $d=1080$ validate our theoretical discoveries.

accurate is an unresolved challenge for many pattern recognition problems. In
general, rule-based and linear models lack accuracy, while deep learning
interpretability is based on rough approximations of the underlying inference.
Using a linear combination of conjunctive clauses in propositional logic,
Tsetlin Machines (TMs) have shown competitive performance on diverse
benchmarks. However, to do so, many clauses are needed, which impacts
interpretability. Here, we address the accuracy-interpretability challenge in
machine learning by equipping the TM clauses with integer weights. The
resulting Integer Weighted TM (IWTM) deals with the problem of learning which
clauses are inaccurate and thus must team up to obtain high accuracy as a team
(low weight clauses), and which clauses are sufficiently accurate to operate
more independently (high weight clauses). Since each TM clause is formed
adaptively by a team of Tsetlin Automata, identifying effective weights becomes
a challenging online learning problem. We address this problem by extending
each team of Tsetlin Automata with a stochastic searching on the line (SSL)
automaton. In our novel scheme, the SSL automaton learns the weight of its
clause in interaction with the corresponding Tsetlin Automata team, which, in
turn, adapts the composition of the clause by the adjusting weight. We evaluate
IWTM empirically using five datasets, including a study of interpetability. On
average, IWTM uses 6.5 times fewer literals than the vanilla TM and 120 times
fewer literals than a TM with real-valued weights. Furthermore, in terms of
average F1-Score, IWTM outperforms simple Multi-Layered Artificial Neural
Networks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random
Forest, XGBoost, Explainable Boosting Machines, and standard and real-value
weighted TMs.

circumplanetary disk (CPD) surrounding Jupiter. When it reached a critical
mass, Jupiter opened an annular gap in the solar protoplanetary disk (PPD) that
might have exposed the CPD to radiation from the young Sun or from the stellar
cluster in which the Solar System formed. Aims: We investigate the radiation
field to which the Jovian CPD was exposed during the process of satellite
formation. The resulting photoevaporation of the CPD is studied in this context
to constrain possible formation scenarios for the Galilean satellites and
explain architectural features of the Galilean system. Methods: We constructed
a model for the stellar birth cluster to determine the intracluster
far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field. We employed analytical annular gap
profiles informed by hydrodynamical simulations to investigate a range of
plausible geometries for the Jovian gap. We used the radiation thermochemical
code ProDiMo to evaluate the incident radiation field in the Jovian gap and the
photoevaporation of an embedded 2D axisymmetric CPD. Results: We derive the
time-dependent intracluster FUV radiation field for the solar birth cluster
over 10 Myr. We find that intracluster photoevaporation can cause significant
truncation of the Jovian CPD. We determine steady-state truncation radii for
possible CPDs, finding that the outer radius is proportional to the accretion
rate $\dot{M}^{0.4}$. For CPD accretion rates $\dot M < 10^{-12} M_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, photoevaporative truncation explains the lack of additional
satellites outside the orbit of Callisto. For CPDs of mass $M_{\rm CPD} <
10^{-6.2 M_{\odot}}$ , photoevaporation can disperse the disk before Callisto
is able to migrate into the Laplace resonance. This explains why Callisto is
the only massive satellite that is excluded from the resonance.

large broadening in the decay width. In the asymmetric strange hadronic matter,
the study of the $\phi$ mesons can be relevant for the compressed strange

In principle, energy-resolved and phase-resolved Fourier analysis of these

stating that the latter is flawed and misleading. Yet, mechanical approach is
more intuitive for students than free energy minimization, and does not require
any knowledge of thermodynamics. In this paper we show that capillary phenomena
can be unmistakably described using the mechanical approach, as long as the
system on which the forces act is properly defined. After reminding the
microscopic origin of a tangential tensile force at the interface, we derive
the Young-Dupr{\'e} equation, emphasizing that this relation should be
interpreted as an interface condition at the contact line, rather than a force
balance equation. This correct interpretation avoids misidentification of
capillary forces acting on a given system. Moreover, we show that a reliable
method to correctly identify the acting forces is to define a control volume
that does not embed any contact line on its surface. Finally, as an
illustration of this method, we apply the mechanical approach in a variety of
ways on a classic example: the derivation of the equilibrium height of

equivalent to the statement that $\Lambda \leq 0$, and Newman's conjecture
states that $\Lambda \geq 0$.
  In this paper we give a new proof of Newman's conjecture which avoids many of
the complications in the proof of Rodgers and Tao. Unlike the previous best
methods for bounding $\Lambda$, our approach does not require any information
about the zeros of the zeta function, and it can be readily be applied to a
wide variety of $L$-functions. In particular, we establish that any
$L$-function in the extended Selberg class has an associated de Bruijn-Newman
constant and that all of these constants are nonnegative.
  Stated in the Riemann xi function case, our argument proceeds by showing that
for every $t < 0$ the function $\xi_t$ can be approximated in terms of a
Dirichlet series $\zeta_t(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\exp(\frac{t}{4} \log^2
n)n^{-s}$ whose zeros then provide infinitely many zeros of $\xi_t$ off the

$X$ whose entries are homogeneous linear polynomials, compute
$g(\partial/\partial x_1, \ldots, \partial/\partial x_n) \det X$. By
considering special cases of this problem we obtain faster parameterized
algorithms for several problems, including the matroid $k$-parity and
$k$-matroid intersection problems, faster \emph{deterministic} algorithms for
testing if a linear space of matrices contains an invertible matrix (Edmonds's
problem) and detecting $k$-internal outbranchings, and more. We also match the
runtime of the fastest known deterministic algorithm for detecting subgraphs of
bounded pathwidth, while using a new approach.
  Our approach raises questions in algebraic complexity related to Waring rank
and the exponent of matrix multiplication $\omega$. In particular, we study a
new complexity measure on the space of homogeneous polynomials, namely the
bilinear complexity of a polynomial's apolar algebra. Our algorithmic
improvements are reflective of the fact that for the degree-$n$ determinant
polynomial this quantity is at most $O(n 2^{\omega n})$, whereas all known
upper bounds on the Waring rank of this polynomial exceed $n!$.

grism, and the Spitzer Space Telescope (Spitzer) at 3.6 $\mu$m, in addition to
a Spitzer 4.5 $\mu$m secondary eclipse. The precise HST transmission spectrum
notably reveals a low-amplitude water feature with an unusual shape. Based on
free retrieval analyses with varying molecular abundances, we find strong
evidence for water absorption. Depending on model assumptions, we also find
tentative evidence for other absorbers (HCN, TiO, and AlO). The retrieved water
abundance is generally $\lesssim 0.1\times$ solar (0.001--0.7$\times$ solar
over a range of model assumptions), several orders of magnitude lower than
expected from planet formation models based on the solar system metallicity
trend. We also consider chemical equilibrium and self-consistent 1D
radiative-convective equilibrium model fits and find they too prefer low
metallicities ($[M/H] \lesssim -2$, consistent with the free retrieval
results). However, all the retrievals should be interpreted with some caution
since they either require additional absorbers that are far out of chemical
equilibrium to explain the shape of the spectrum or are simply poor fits to the
data. Finally, we find the Spitzer secondary eclipse is indicative of full heat
redistribution from KELT-11b's dayside to nightside, assuming a clear dayside.
These potentially unusual results for KELT-11b's composition are suggestive of
new challenges on the horizon for atmosphere and formation models in the face
of increasingly precise measurements of exoplanet spectra.

changes in a response with quantitative covariates. It is typically done
through the conditional mean in the exponential family using generalized
additive models with an indirect impact on other conditional moments. Another
common strategy consists in focussing on several low-order conditional moments,
leaving the complete conditional distribution unspecified. Alternatively, a
multi-parameter distribution could be assumed for the response with several of
its parameters jointly regressed on covariates using additive expressions.
  Our work can be connected to the latter proposal for a right- or
interval-censored continuous response with a highly flexible and smooth
nonparametric density. We focus on location-scale models with additive terms in
the conditional mean and standard deviation. Starting from recent results in
the Bayesian framework, we propose a quickly converging algorithm to select
penalty parameters from their marginal posteriors. It relies on Laplace
approximations to the conditional posterior of the spline parameters.
Simulations suggest that the so-obtained estimators own excellent frequentist
properties and increase efficiency as compared to approaches with a working
Gaussian hypothesis. We illustrate the methodology with the analysis of
imprecisely measured income data.

bias of about 1800 Oe at room temperature. The thermal stability of those
trilayer systems is limited by nitrogen diffusion that occurs during annealing
processes. Most of the nitrogen diffuses into the Ta buffer layer, which is
necessary for good crystal growth of MnN and thus a crucial component of the
exchange bias system. In order to improve the thermal stability, we prepared
exchange bias stacks where we varied the Ta thickness to look for an optimum
value that guarantees stable and high exchange over a broad temperature range.
Our findings show that thin layers of 2-5 nm Ta indeed support stable exchange
bias up to annealing temperatures of more than $550^{\circ}$C. Furthermore, we
found that the introduction of a TaN$_{\text{x}}$ layer between MnN and Ta,

involve correlations of the observable with coarse grained path weights. The
time symmetric part of these weights depends on the paths and perturbation

slicing of the coarse-grained path integral. We show that these difficulties
can be overcome and the response function can be expressed in terms of path
weights corresponding to a single-step perturbation. This formalism thus leads
to an extrapolation scheme where measuring linear responses of coarse-grained

optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off, we have to estimate the change in
performance of the Ising computing machine depending on the number of bits

focusing on the Hopfield model with discrete coupling. The Hopfield model is a
canonical Ising computing model. Previous studies have analyzed the effect of a
few nonlinear functions (e.g. sign) for mapping the coupling strength on the
Hopfield model with statistical mechanics methods, but not the effect of
discretization of the coupling strength in detail. Here, we derived the order

well-suited for complex regions, including sources with shell-like
morphologies. As an alternative and complementary approach, we have
investigated blind search methods for VHE gamma-ray source detection based on
well-known and widely used image processing and pattern recognition techniques.
Our goal is to build in a short amount of computational time a list of
potentially valuable objects without prior case-specific morphological
assumptions. We aim to classify and rank the detected objects in order to
identify only the most promising source candidates for further
multi-wavelength-association searches, dedicated analyses, or deeper

structural information from the significance maps using a edge detection
operator. We then apply a Hough circle transform and detect a collection of
objects as local maxima in the Hough space. On the basis of morphological
parameters we can characterize different object classes. Classification can be
used to identify valuable source candidates sharing the characteristics of
well-known sources. We show that using these pattern recognition techniques we
can detect objects with partial circular symmetry irrespective of a
morphological template (e.g. point-like, Gaussian-like, or shell-like). All the
shell-type supernova remnants (SNRs) catalogued in the HGPS are associated with
at least one detected object. Catalogue cross-matches indicate that several
detected objects not catalogued in the HGPS are spatially coincident with
multi-wavelength counterparts. Further investigation on the most promising
candidates will be conducted in dedicated follow-up analyses.

extracted evidence. Despite the importance of evidence labels for training the
evidence extractor, they are not cheaply accessible, particularly in many
non-extractive MRC tasks such as YES/NO question answering and multi-choice

  To address this problem, we present a Self-Training method (STM), which
supervises the evidence extractor with auto-generated evidence labels in an
iterative process. At each iteration, a base MRC model is trained with golden
answers and noisy evidence labels. The trained model will predict pseudo
evidence labels as extra supervision in the next iteration. We evaluate STM on
seven datasets over three MRC tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the
improvement on existing MRC models, and we also analyze how and why such a

emerging path-aware Internet architectures. The model enables us to
characterize the impact of different degrees of congestion information that

selfish routing, not only on users, but also on network operators. Based on our

generally overestimated during the storm periods with the exception of IRI-P,
which matched (with an offset of about 3-5 TECU) with the enhancement observed
on September 7, 2017 (during the strong storm of September 2017), from stations

symmetry on the electromagnetic field distribution as well as on its degrees of
freedom (the set of resonant modes) is examined. It is shown that in the case
of angularly symmetric cavity, regardless of its radial non-uniformity, the set
of resonator modes is, as anticipated, a superposition of TE and TM
oscillations which can be described in terms of a single scalar function
independently of each other. The spectrum is basically determined through the
introduction of effective ``dynamic'' potentials which encode the infill
inhomogeneity. The violation of polar symmetry in the infill dielectric
properties, the azimuthal symmetry being simultaneously preserved, suppresses
all azimuthally non-uniform modes of electric-type (TM) oscillations. In the
absence of angular symmetry of both electric and magnetic properties of the
resonator infill, only azimuthally uniform distribution of both TM and TE
fields is expected to occur in the resonator. The comparison is made of the
results obtained through the proposed method and of the test problem solution
obtained with use of commercial solvers. The method appears to be efficient for
computational complex algorithms for solving spectral problems, including those
for studying the chaotic properties of electrodynamic systems' spectra.

the conduction proceeds through a mechanism reminiscent of Onsager's Wien

transmitter may attempt a frame transmission on one channel at a time, where
each frame includes a packet if one is in the queue. For each channel, an
attempted transmission is successful with an unknown probability. The
transmitter's objective is to quickly identify the best channel to minimize the
number of packets in the queue over $T$ time slots. To analyze system
performance, we introduce queue length regret, which is the expected difference
between the total queue length of a learning policy and a controller that knows
the rates, a priori. One approach to designing a transmission policy would be
to apply algorithms from the literature that solve the closely-related
stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. These policies would focus on maximizing
the number of successful frame transmissions over time. However, we show that
these methods have $\Omega(\log{T})$ queue length regret. On the other hand, we
show that there exists a set of queue-length based policies that can obtain

already-colored reference image. Colorizing a sketch image is in high demand in
comics, animation, and other content creation applications, but it suffers from
information scarcity of a sketch image. To address this, a reference image can
render the colorization process in a reliable and user-driven manner. However,
it is difficult to prepare for a training data set that has a sufficient amount
of semantically meaningful pairs of images as well as the ground truth for a
colored image reflecting a given reference (e.g., coloring a sketch of an
originally blue car given a reference green car). To tackle this challenge, we
propose to utilize the identical image with geometric distortion as a virtual
reference, which makes it possible to secure the ground truth for a colored
output image. Furthermore, it naturally provides the ground truth for dense
semantic correspondence, which we utilize in our internal attention mechanism
for color transfer from reference to sketch input. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in various types of sketch image colorization via
quantitative as well as qualitative evaluation against existing methods.

important example of generalized electrodynamics, is proposed and investigated.
Second gradient electrodynamics is a gradient field theory with up to
second-order derivatives of the electromagnetic field strengths in the
Lagrangian density. Second gradient electrodynamics possesses a weak
nonlocality in space and time. In the framework of second gradient
electrodynamics, the retarded Green functions, first-order derivatives of the
retarded Green functions, retarded potentials, retarded electromagnetic field
strengths, generalized Lienard-Wiechert potentials and the corresponding
electromagnetic field strengths are derived for three, two and one spatial
dimensions. The behaviour of the electromagnetic fields is investigated on the
light cone. In particular, the retarded Green functions and their first-order
derivatives show oscillations around the classical solutions inside the forward
light cone and it is shown that they are singularity-free and regular on the
light cone in three, two and one spatial dimensions. In second gradient
electrodynamics, the self-force and the energy release rate are calculated and
the equation of motion of a charged point particle, which is an
integro-differential equation where the infamous third-order time-derivative of
the position does not appear, is determined.

learning-based wireless signal classifiers. There is a transmitter that
transmits signals with different modulation types. A deep neural network is
used at each receiver to classify its over-the-air received signals to
modulation types. In the meantime, an adversary transmits an adversarial
perturbation (subject to a power budget) to fool receivers into making errors
in classifying signals that are received as superpositions of transmitted
signals and adversarial perturbations. First, these evasion attacks are shown
to fail when channels are not considered in designing adversarial
perturbations. Then, realistic attacks are presented by considering channel
effects from the adversary to each receiver. After showing that a channel-aware
attack is selective (i.e., it affects only the receiver whose channel is
considered in the perturbation design), a broadcast adversarial attack is
presented by crafting a common adversarial perturbation to simultaneously fool
classifiers at different receivers. The major vulnerability of modulation
classifiers to over-the-air adversarial attacks is shown by accounting for
different levels of information available about the channel, the transmitter
input, and the classifier model. Finally, a certified defense based on
randomized smoothing that augments training data with noise is introduced to
make the modulation classifier robust to adversarial perturbations.

sequence analysis, where realtime performance is often in demand. However, RNNs
suffer from heavy computational workload as the model often comes with large
weight matrices. Pruning schemes have been proposed for RNNs to eliminate the
redundant (close-to-zero) weight values. On one hand, the non-structured
pruning methods achieve a high pruning rate but introducing computation
irregularity (random sparsity), which is unfriendly to parallel hardware. On
the other hand, hardware-oriented structured pruning suffers from low pruning
rate due to restricted constraints on allowable pruning structure. This paper
presents CSB-RNN, an optimized full-stack RNN framework with a novel compressed
structured block (CSB) pruning technique. The CSB pruned RNN model comes with
both fine pruning granularity that facilitates a high pruning rate and regular
structure that benefits the hardware parallelism. To address the challenges in
parallelizing the CSB pruned model inference with fine-grained structural
sparsity, we propose a novel hardware architecture with a dedicated compiler.
Gaining from the architecture-compilation co-design, the hardware not only
supports various RNN cell types, but is also able to address the challenging
workload imbalance issue and therefore significantly improves the hardware
efficiency.

Adiabatic pumping in the post-quench system are then examined both
theoretically and numerically, in which the interband coherence is shown to
play an important role and can hence be observed experimentally. By choosing
adiabatic protocols with different switching-on speeds, we also show that the

further proposed that the interband coherence induced correction to Thouless

rotating the triangular scatterers in each unit-cell. In the nontrivial phase,
the sonic crystal realizes the topological spin Hall effect in a higher-order

environment, which will be used for navigation. Inspired by this biological
phenomenon, researchers have recently proposed to generate graph representation
for Markov decision process (MDP) and use such graphs for planning in
reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing graph generation methods suffer
from many drawbacks. One drawback is that existing methods do not learn an
abstraction for graphs, which results in high memory and computation cost. This
drawback also makes generated graph non-robust, which degrades the planning
performance. Another drawback is that existing methods cannot be used for
facilitating exploration which is important in RL. In this paper, we propose a
new method, called topological map abstraction (TOMA), for graph generation.
TOMA can generate an abstract graph representation for MDP, which costs much
less memory and computation cost than existing methods. Furthermore, TOMA can
be used for facilitating exploration. In particular, we propose planning to
explore, in which TOMA is used to accelerate exploration by guiding the agent
towards unexplored states. A novel experience replay module called vertex
memory is also proposed to improve exploration performance. Experimental
results show that TOMA can outperform existing methods to achieve the
state-of-the-art performance.

Today, in the
age of cheap information --cheap to produce, to manipulate, to disseminate--,
this cognitive bottleneck translates into hypercompetition for visibility among
actors (individuals, institutions, etc). The same social communication
incentive --visibility-- pushes actors to mutualistically interact with
specific memes, seeking the virality of their messages. In turn, contents are
driven by selective pressure, i.e. the chances to persist and reach widely are
tightly subject to changes in the communication environment. In spite of all
this complexity, here we show that the underlying architecture of the
users-memes interaction in information ecosystems, apparently chaotic and
noisy, actually evolves towards emergent patterns, reminiscent of those found
in natural ecosystems. In particular we show, through the analysis of
empirical, large data streams, that communication networks are structurally
elastic, i.e. fluctuating from modular to nested architecture as a response to
environmental perturbations (e.g. extraordinary events). We then propose an
ecology-inspired modelling framework, bringing to light the precise mechanisms
causing the observed dynamical reorganisation. Finally, from numerical
simulations, the model predicts --and the data confirm-- that the users'
struggle for visibility induces a re-equilibration of the network towards a
very constrained organisation: the emergence of self-similar nested

solidification and its rupture in stenosed arteries. The interaction between
the blood flow and an existing stenosis in the arterial wall is modeled as a
three dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem. The blood is assumed to
be a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid with a time-dependent viscosity that
obeys a modified Carreau's model and the flow dynamics is described by the
Navier-Stokes equations. Whereas, the arterial wall is considered a
hyperelastic material whose displacement satisfies the quasi-static equilibrium
equations. Numerical simulations are performed using FreeFem++ on a two
dimensional domain. We investigate the behavior of the viscosity of blood, its
speed and the maximum shear stress. From the numerical results, blood
recirculation zones have been identified. Moreover, a zone of the blood of high
viscosity and low speed has been observed directly after the stenosis in the
flow direction. This zone may correspond to a blood accumulation and then
solidification zone that is subjected to shear stress by the blood flow and to
forces exerted by the artery wall deformation. Therefore, this zone is thought
to break and then to release a blood clot that leads to the occlusion of small
arterioles.
