quantum ground state in 2020 [1], macroscopic quantum sensors are seemingly on
the horizon. The nanosphere's large mass as compared to other quantum systems
enhances the susceptibility of the nanoparticle to gravitational and inertial
forces. In this viewpoint we describe the features of experiments with
optically levitated nanoparticles [2] and their proposed utility for
acceleration sensing. Unique to the levitated nanoparticle platform is the
ability to implement not only quantum noise limited transduction, predicted by
quantum metrology to reach sensitivities on the order of $10^{-15}$ms$^{-2}$
[3], but also long-lived quantum spatial superpositions for enhanced
gravimetry. This follows a global trend in developing sensors, such as
cold-atom interferometers, that exploit superposition or entanglement. Thanks
to significant commercial development of these existing quantum technologies,
we discuss the feasibility of translating levitated nanoparticle research into
applications.

vectors are first extracted using an English Bert model and then used either to
directly compute sentence embeddings or to feed a bidirectional LSTM-RNNs with
attention. Finally, an SVM classifier with linear kernel is used for the
individual evaluation of the three systems. Our best system, based on the
combination of linguistic and acoustic information, attained a classification
accuracy of 81.25%. Results have shown the importance of linguistic features in
the classification of Alzheimer's Disease, which outperforms the acoustic ones
in terms of accuracy. Early stage features fusion did not provide additional

strongly affect the stability, topology, and transport properties of active

low-Reynolds-number locomotion of a self-propelled microswimmer moving inside a
clean viscous drop or a drop covered with a homogeneously distributed
surfactant, is theoretically examined. The interfacial viscous stresses induced
by the surfactant are described by the well-established Boussinesq-Scriven
constitutive rheological model. Moreover, the active agent is represented by a
force dipole and the resulting fluid-mediated hydrodynamic couplings between
the swimmer and the confining drop are investigated. We find that the presence
of the surfactant significantly alters the dynamics of the encapsulated swimmer
by enhancing its reorientation. Exact solutions for the velocity images for the
Stokeslet and dipolar flow singularities inside the drop are introduced and
expressed in terms of infinite series of harmonic components. Our results offer
useful insights into guiding principles for the control of confined active
matter systems and support the objective of utilizing synthetic microswimmers

  Incremental Conversation Sentences",,,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed representation of words has improved the performance for many
natural language tasks. In many methods, however, only one meaning is
considered for one label of a word, and multiple meanings of polysemous words
depending on the context are rarely handled. Although research works have dealt
with polysemous words, they determine the meanings of such words according to a
batch of large documents. Hence, there are two problems with applying these
methods to sequential sentences, as in a conversation that contains ambiguous
expressions. The first problem is that the methods cannot sequentially deal
with the interdependence between context and word interpretation, in which
context is decided by word interpretations and the word interpretations are
decided by the context. Context estimation must thus be performed in parallel
to pursue multiple interpretations. The second problem is that the previous
methods use large-scale sets of sentences for offline learning of new
interpretations, and the steps of learning and inference are clearly separated.
Such methods using offline learning cannot obtain new interpretations during a
conversation. Hence, to dynamically estimate the conversation context and
interpretations of polysemous words in sequential sentences, we propose a
method of Simultaneous Contextualization And INterpreting (SCAIN) based on the
traditional Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. By using
the SCAIN algorithm, we can sequentially optimize the interdependence between
context and word interpretation while obtaining new interpretations online. For
experimental evaluation, we created two datasets: one from Wikipedia's
disambiguation pages and the other from real conversations. For both datasets,
the results confirmed that SCAIN could effectively achieve sequential
optimization of the interdependence and acquisition of new interpretations.

Results showed that more active stars, younger and fast rotators, tend to have
larger activity variations. There is a tendency of anti-correlation between
temporal variations in TiO2 and EW H{\alpha} . Also, appreciable
anti-correlation in the rotational phase between H{\alpha} emission and K2

abbrev. R.c., iff (if and only if) $\sum_{q=1}^{\infty}G(q)c_q(a)$ converges in
all $a\in $N; given $F:$N $\rightarrow $C, we call $<F>$, the set of its R.c.s,
the Ramanujan cloud of $F$. Our Main Theorem in arxiv:1910.14640, for Ramanujan
expansions and finite Euler products, implies a complete Classification for
multiplicative Ramanujan coefficients of $0$. Ramanujan's $G_R(q):=1/q$ is a
normal arithmetic function $G$, i.e., multiplicative with $G(p)\neq 1$ on all
primes $p$; while Hardy's $G_H(q):=1/\varphi(q)$ is a sporadic $G$, namely
multiplicative, $G(p)=1$ for a finite set of $p$, but there's no $p$ with
$G(p^K)=1$ on all integers $K\ge 0$ (Hardy's has $G_H(p)=1$ iff $p=2$). The
$G:$N $\rightarrow $C multiplicative, such that there's at least a prime $p$
with $G(p^K)=1$, on all $K\ge 0$, are defined to be exotic. This definition
completes the cases for multiplicative $0-$Ramanujan coefficients. The exotic
ones are a kind of new phenomenon in the $0-$cloud (i.e., $<0>$): exotic
Ramanujan coefficients represent $0$ only with a convergence hypothesis. The
not exotic, apart from the convergence hypothesis, require in addition
$\sum_{q=1}^{\infty}G(q)\mu(q)=0$ for normal $G\in <0>$, while sporadic $G\in
<0>$ need $\sum_{(q,P(G))=1}G(q)\mu(q)=0$, $P(G):=$product of all $p$ making
$G(p)=1$. We give many examples of R.c.s $G\in <0>$; we also prove that the
only $G\in <0>$ with absolute convergence are the exotic ones; actually, these
generalize to the weakly exotic, not necessarily multiplicative.

Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs), located at SNOLAB (Sudbury,

result was used to place an upper bound on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent,
isoscalar cross section. This study reinterprets this result within a
Non-Relativistic Effective Field Theory framework, and further examines how
various possible substructures in the local dark matter halo may affect these
constraints. Such substructures are hinted at by kinematic structures in the
local stellar distribution observed by the Gaia satellite and other recent
astronomical surveys. These include the Gaia Sausage (or Enceladus), as well as
a number of distinct streams identified in recent studies. Limits are presented
for the coupling strength of the effective contact interaction operators
$\mathcal{O}_1$, $\mathcal{O}_3$, $\mathcal{O}_5$, $\mathcal{O}_8$, and
$\mathcal{O}_{11}$, considering isoscalar, isovector, and xenonphobic
scenarios, as well as the specific operators corresponding to millicharge,
magnetic dipole, electric dipole, and anapole interactions. The effects of halo
substructures on each of these operators are explored as well, showing that the
$\mathcal{O}_5$ and $\mathcal{O}_8$ operators are particularly sensitive to the
velocity distribution, even at dark matter masses above 100 GeV/$c^2$.

reduction based on the energy distance which is a special case of the maximum

especially in comparison to the popular Wasserstein distance which is
dominating the scenario reduction literature. The energy distance is a metric
between probability measures that allows for powerful tests for equality of
arbitrary multivariate distributions or independence. Thanks to the latter, it
is a suitable candidate for ensemble and scenario reduction problems. The
theoretical properties and considered examples indicate clearly that the
reduced scenario sets tend to exhibit better statistical properties for the
energy distance than a corresponding reduction with respect to the Wasserstein
distance. We show applications to a Bernoulli random walk and two real data

re-compute Kepler planet radii and incident fluxes and investigate their
distributions with stellar mass and age. We measure the stellar mass dependence
of the planet radius valley to be $d \log R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$d \log M_\star =
0.26^{+0.21}_{-0.16}$, consistent with the slope predicted by a planet mass
dependence on stellar mass ($0.24-0.35$) and core-powered mass-loss (0.33). We
also find first evidence of a stellar age dependence of the planet populations
straddling the radius valley. Specifically, we determine that the fraction of
super-Earths ($1-1.8 \mathrm{R_\oplus}$) to sub-Neptunes ($1.8-3.5
\mathrm{R_\oplus}$) increases from $0.61 \pm 0.09$ at young ages (< 1 Gyr) to
$1.00 \pm 0.10$ at old ages (> 1 Gyr), consistent with the prediction by
core-powered mass-loss that the mechanism shaping the radius valley operates
over Gyr timescales. Additionally, we find a tentative decrease in the radii of
relatively cool ($F_{\mathrm{p}} < 150 \mathrm{F_\oplus}$) sub-Neptunes over
Gyr timescales, which suggests that these planets may possess H/He envelopes

of planets within the hot sub-Neptunian ""desert"" ($2.2 < R_{\mathrm{p}} < 3.8

these planets are preferentially orbiting more evolved stars compared to other

cool ($F_{\mathrm{p}} < 20 \mathrm{F_\oplus}$) inflated Jupiters, present a

challenges of cryptocurrencies. However, design tradeoffs of offchain networks
are still not well-understood today. In particular, offchain networks typically
rely on fees-based incentives and hence require mechanisms for the efficient
discovery of ``good routes'': routes with low fees (cost efficiency) and a high
success rate of the transaction routing (effectiveness). Furthermore, the route
discovery should be confidential (privacy), and e.g., not reveal information
about who transacts with whom or about the transaction value. This paper
provides an analysis of the ``search friction'' of route discovery, i.e., the
costs and tradeoffs of route discovery in large-scale offchain networks in
which nodes behave strategically. As a case study, we consider the Lighning
network and the route discovery service provided by the trampoline nodes,
evaluating the tradeoff in different scenarios also empirically. Finally, we

In the presence of local Primordial Non- Gaussianities (PNG), in addition to
the super-sample matter density and tidal fluctuations, the large-scale
gravitational potential also induces a modulation of the observed power
spectrum. In this work we investigate this modulation by computing for the
first time the response of the redshift-space galaxy power spectrum to the
presence of a long wavelength gravitational potential, fully accounting for the
stochastic contributions. For biased tracers new response functions arise due
to couplings between the small-scale fluctuations in the density, velocity and
gravitational fields, the latter through scale dependent bias operators, and
the large-scale gravitational potential. We study the impact of the
super-sample modes on the measurement of the amplitude of the primordial
bispectrum of the local-shape, $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, accounting for
modulations of both the signal and the covariance of the galaxy power spectrum
by the long modes. Considering DESI-like survey specifications, we show that in
most cases super-sample modes cause little or no degradation of the

difficulty of finding isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. However,
SIDH and related cryptosystems also reveal additional information: the
restriction of a secret isogeny to a subgroup of the curve (torsion point
information). Petit (2017) was the first to demonstrate that torsion point
information could noticeably lower the difficulty of finding secret isogenies.
In particular, Petit showed that ""overstretched"" parameterizations of SIDH
could be broken in polynomial time. However, this did not impact the security
of any cryptosystems proposed in the literature. The contribution of this paper
is twofold: First, we strengthen the techniques of Petit by exploiting
additional information coming from a dual and a Frobenius isogeny. This extends
the impact of torsion point attacks considerably. In particular, our techniques
yield a classical attack that completely breaks the n-party group key exchange
of Azarderakhsh et al. for 6 parties or more, and a quantum attack for 3
parties or more that improves on the best known asymptotic complexity. We also
provide a Magma implementation of our attack for 6 parties. We give the full
range of parameters for which our attacks apply. Second, we construct SIDH
variants designed to be weak against our attacks; this includes backdoor
choices of starting curve, as well as backdoor choices of base-field prime. We
stress that our results do not degrade the security of, or reveal any weakness
in, the NIST submission SIKE.

utilizes spatial neighborhood relationships to determine edges among nodes.
During the SGN's propagation, each node and its spatial neighbors on an SG are
aggregated to the next SG. On the next SG, each aggregated node is re-weighted
with a learnable parameter to find the significance at the corresponding
location. Secondly, a novel pyramidal graph network (PGN) is designed to
comprehensively explore the spatial significance of feature maps at multiple
scales. The PGN organizes multiple SGNs in a pyramidal manner and makes each
SGN handles feature maps of a specific scale. Finally, a hybrid pyramidal graph

Examples
include collaboration, organisational affiliations, and trade-blocs. The study
of such systems is commonly approached through network analysis. Multilayer
networks extend the representation of network analysis to include more
information through increased dimensionality. Thus, they are able to more
accurately represent the systems they are modelling. However, multilayer
networks are often represented by rank-4 adjacency tensors, resulting in a N2M2
solution space. Single-affiliation systems are unable to occupy the full extent
of this space leading to sparse data where it is difficult to attain
statistical confidence through subsequent analysis. To overcome these
limitations, this paper presents a rank-3 tensor representation for
single-affiliation systems. The representations is able to maintain full
information of single-affiliation networks in directionless networks, maintain
near full information in directed networks, reduce the solution space it
resides in (N2M) leading to statistically significant findings, and maintain
the analytical capability of multilayer approaches. This is shown through a
comparison of the rank-3 and rank-4 representations which is performed on two
datasets: the University of Bath departmental journal co-authorship 2000-2017
and an Erdos-Renyi network with random single-affiliation. The results
demonstrate that the structure of the network is maintained through both
representations, while the rank-3 representation provides greater statistical
confidence in node-based measures, and can readily show inter- and
intra-affiliation dynamics.

the resonant interaction between inertial-gravity waves and the eccentric mode
in the disc. We present 3D global hydrodynamical simulations of inviscid
circumbinary discs that form an inner cavity and become eccentric through
interaction with the central binary. The parametric instability grows and
generates turbulence that transports angular momentum with stress parameter
$\alpha \sim 5 \times 10^{-3}$ at distances $\lesssim 7 \;a_{bin} $, where
$a_{bin}$ is the binary semi-major axis. Vertical turbulent diffusion occurs at
a rate corresponding to $\alpha_{diff}\sim 1-2\times 10^{-3}$. We examine the
impact of turbulent diffusion on the vertical settling of pebbles, and on the
rate of pebble accretion by embedded planets. In steady state, dust particles
with Stokes numbers ${\it St} \lesssim 0.1$ form a layer of finite thickness
$H_d \gtrsim 0.1 H$, where $H$ is the gas scale height. Pebble accretion
efficiency is then reduced by a factor $r_{acc}/H_d$, where $r_{acc}$ is the
accretion radius, compared to the rate in a laminar disc. For accreting core
masses with $m_p \lesssim 0.1\; M_\oplus$, pebble accretion for particles with
${\it St} \gtrsim 0.5$ is also reduced because of velocity kicks induced by the
turbulence. These effects combine to make the time needed by a Ceres-mass
object to grow to the pebble isolation mass, when significant gas accretion can
occur, longer than typical disc lifetimes. Hence, the origins of circumbinary
planets orbiting close to their central binary systems, as discovered by the
Kepler mission, are difficult to explain using an in situ model that invokes a
combination of the streaming instability and pebble accretion.

sparse and noisy intraoperative data, real-time requirements and many unknowns
- such as tissue properties and boundary conditions. Furthermore, establishing
correspondences between pre- and intraoperative data can be extremely difficult
since the liver usually lacks distinct surface features and the used imaging
modalities suffer from very different types of noise. In this work, we train a
convolutional neural network to perform both the search for surface
correspondences as well as the non-rigid registration in one step. The network
is trained on physically accurate biomechanical simulations of randomly
generated, deforming organ-like structures. This enables the network to
immediately generalize to a new patient organ without the need to re-train. We
add various amounts of noise to the intraoperative surfaces during training,
making the network robust to noisy intraoperative data. During inference, the
network outputs the displacement field which matches the preoperative volume to
the partial intraoperative surface. In multiple experiments, we show that the
network translates well to real data while maintaining a high inference speed.

calibration-free protocols and approaching the precision of the quantum

same functionality as the input circuit, such that for any two circuits of the
same size that compute the same function, the outputs of the
indistinguishability obfuscator are indistinguishable. Here, we study schemes
for indistinguishability obfuscation for quantum circuits. We present two
definitions for indistinguishability obfuscation: in our first definition (qiO)
the outputs of the obfuscator are required to be indistinguishable if the input
circuits are perfectly equivalent, while in our second definition (qiOD), the
outputs are required to be indistinguishable as long as the input circuits are
approximately equivalent with respect to a pseudo-distance D. Our main results
provide (1) a computationally-secure scheme for qiO where the size of the
output of the obfuscator is exponential in the number of non-Clifford (T
gates), which means that the construction is efficient as long as the number of
T gates is logarithmic in the circuit size and (2)a statistically-secure qiOD,
for circuits that are close to the kth level of the Gottesman-Chuang hierarchy
(with respect to D); this construction is efficient as long as k is small and
fixed.

second derivatives of the interface height. We consider the model in dimension
$\mathsf{d}\ge4$ under the influence of $\delta$-pinning of strength
$\varepsilon$. It is known that this pinning potential manages to localize the
interface for any $\varepsilon>0$. We refine this result by establishing the
$\varepsilon$-dependence of the variance and of the exponential decay rate of
the covariances for small $\varepsilon$ (similar to the corresponding results
for the discrete Gaussian free field by Bolthausen-Velenik). We also show the
existence of a thermodynamic limit of the field. These conclusions improve upon
earlier works by Bolthausen-Cipriani-Kurt and by Sakagawa.
  The problem has similarities to the homogenization of elliptic operators in
randomly perforated domains, and our proof takes inspiration from this
connection. The main new ideas are a correlation inequality for the set of
pinned points, and a probabilistic Widman hole filler argument which relies on
a discrete multipolar Hardy-Rellich inequality and on a multi-scale argument to
construct suitable test functions.

studies to generate the map of the observable universe. These swarms have to be
coordinated with respect to various desired observations. Such coordination are
so complicated that distributed swarm controllers cannot always coordinate
enough astrobots to fulfill the minimum data desired to be obtained in the
course of observations. Thus, a convergence verification is necessary to check
the suitability of a coordination before its execution. However, a formal
verification method does not exist for this purpose. In this paper, we instead
use machine learning to predict the convergence of astrobots swarm. In
particular, we propose a weighted $k$-NN-based algorithm which requires the
initial status of a swarm as well as its observational targets to predict its
convergence. Our algorithm learns to predict based on the coordination data
obtained from previous coordination of the desired swarm. This method first
generates a convergence probability for each astrobot based on a distance
metric. Then, these probabilities are transformed to either a complete or an
incomplete categorical result. The method is applied to two typical swarms
including 116 and 487 astrobots. It turns out that the correct prediction of
successful coordination may be up to 80% of overall predictions. Thus, these

diffraction evidences that the nanowires crystallize in the wurtzite phase,
elongate along the c-axis, and are randomly oriented in plane. The luminescence
of the ZnO nanowires, investigated by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence
spectroscopies, is characterized by two bands, the nearband-edge emission and
the characteristic defect-related green luminescence of ZnO. The
cross-correlation of scanning electron micrographs and monochromatic
cathodoluminescence intensity maps reveals that: (i) coalescence joints act as
a source of non-radiative recombination, and (ii) the luminescence of ZnO
nanowires is inhomogeneously distributed at the single nanowire level.
Specifically, the near-band-edge emission arises from the nanowire cores, while
the defect-related green luminescence originates from the volume close to the
nanowire sidewalls. Two-dimensional simulations of the optical guided modes
supported by ZnO nanowires allow us to exclude waveguiding effects as the
underlying reason for the luminescence inhomogeneities. We thus attribute this
observation to the formation of a core-shell structure in which the shell is
characterized by a high concentration of green-emitting radiative point defects
with respect to the core.

of massive neutrinos increases this effect. On the contrary large neutrinos
mass can compensate the modifications induced by Ho\v{r}ava gravity in the
lensing, matter and primordial B-mode power spectra. Another degeneracy is
found, at theoretical level, between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and massive
neutrinos as well as with the model's parameters. We analyze these effects
using CMB, supernovae type Ia (SNIa), galaxy clustering and weak gravitational
lensing measurements and we show how such degeneracies are removed. We find
that the model's parameters are constrained to be very close to their General
Relativity limits and we get a two orders of magnitude improved upper bound,

integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for

directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language,
Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional
acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence.
The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large telephone

indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating
the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects
on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic
prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that
predictability is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that the lexical
representation of a word includes phonetic details associated with its average
prosodic prominence in discourse. In other words, the lexicon absorbs prosodic

2008]. Previous work by Gupta et al. [2010] gave a differentially private
algorithm for the CPP problem. We extend this work by designing differentially
private algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone decomposable submodular
maximization under general matroid constraints, with competitive utility
guarantees. We complement our theoretical bounds with experiments demonstrating
empirical performance, which improves over the differentially private
algorithms for the general case of submodular maximization and is close to the
performance of non-private algorithms.

nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, serving as an atomic-sized

ambient conditions. Despite the enormous progress in spatial resolution, the
current megahertz spectral resolution is still insufficient to resolve key
heterogeneous molecular information. A major challenge is the short coherence
times of the sample electron spins. Here, we address this challenge by
employing a magnetic noise-insensitive transition between states of different
symmetry. We demonstrate a 27-fold narrower spectrum of single substitutional
nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond with linewidth of several kilohertz, and then
some weak couplings can be resolved. Those results show both spatial and
spectral advances of NV center-based EPR, and provide a route towards
analytical (EPR) spectroscopy at single-molecule level.

the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) campaign in early April 2017. A high degree
($\sim 20$ per cent) of linear polarisation (P$_{\rm lin}$) is detected in the
bright jet knots resolved at $\sim 10\, \rm{arcsec}$ to $23\, \rm{arcsec}$
($0.8$-$1.8\, \rm{kpc}$) from the centre, whereas the nucleus and inner jet
show P$_{\rm lin} \lesssim 5$ per cent. The position angle of the linear
polarisation shifts by $\sim 90$ degrees from each knot to the adjacent ones,
with the core angle perpendicular to the first knot. The nucleus was in a low
level of activity (P$_{\rm lin} \sim 2$-$3$ per cent), and no emission was
detected from HST-1. No circular polarisation was detected either in the
nucleus or the jet above a $3\sigma$ level of P$_{\rm circ} \leq 1.5$ per cent,
discarding the conversion of P$_{\rm lin}$ into P$_{\rm circ}$. A disordered
magnetic field configuration or a mix of unresolved knots polarised along axes
with different orientations could explain the low P$_{\rm lin}$. The latter
implies a smaller size of the core knots, in line with current interferometric
observations. Polarimetry with EHT can probe this scenario in the future. A
steep increase of both P$_{\rm lin}$ and P$_{\rm circ}$ with increasing
frequency is expected for the optically-thin domain, above the turnover point.

life-related processes. However, established computational methodologies, like
molecular dynamics, are still mostly constrained to closed systems and
timescales too small to be relevant for life processes. Alternatively,
particle-based reaction-diffusion models are currently the most accurate and
computationally feasible approach at these scales. Their efficiency lies in
modeling entire molecules as particles that can diffuse and interact with each
other. In this work, we develop modeling and numerical schemes for
particle-based reaction-diffusion in an open setting, where the reservoirs are
mediated by reaction-diffusion PDEs. We derive two important theoretical
results. The first one is the mean-field for open systems of diffusing
particles; the second one is the mean-field for a particle-based
reaction-diffusion system with second-order reactions. We employ these two
results to develop a numerical scheme that consistently couples particle-based
reaction-diffusion processes with reaction-diffusion PDEs. This allows modeling
open biochemical systems in contact with reservoirs that are time-dependent and
spatially inhomogeneous, as in many relevant real-world applications.

density profiles of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) affect their subsequent
evolution. We find that the star formation duration and integrated star
formation efficiency of the whole clouds are not sensitive to the choice of
different profiles but are mainly controlled by the interplay between
gravitational collapse and stellar feedback. Despite this similarity, GMCs with
different profiles show dramatically different modes of star formation. For
shallower profiles, GMCs first fragment into many self-gravitation cores and
form sub-clusters that distributed throughout the entire clouds. These
sub-clusters are later assembled ``hierarchically'' to central clusters. In
contrast, for steeper profiles, a massive cluster is quickly formed at the
center of the cloud and then gradually grows its mass via gas accretion.
Consequently, central clusters that emerged from clouds with shallower profiles
are less massive and show less rotation than those with the steeper profiles.
This is because 1) a significant fraction of mass and angular momentum in
shallower profiles is stored in the orbital motion of the sub-clusters that are
not able to merge into the central clusters 2) frequent hierarchical mergers in
the shallower profiles lead to further losses of mass and angular momentum via
violent relaxation and tidal disruption. Encouragingly, the degree of cluster
rotations in steeper profiles is consistent with recent observations of young
and intermediate-age clusters. We speculate that rotating globular clusters are
likely formed via an ``accretion'' mode from centrally-concentrated clouds in
the early Universe.

here we focus on a method based on Householder reflections that adapts well in
the case of sparse isometries. We show how to use this method to decompose an
arbitrary isometry before illustrating that the method can lead to significant
improvements in the case of sparse isometries. We also discuss the classical

functioning, and this requires concentrations (at their steady-state levels) to
be stable to fluctuations. Since gene expression is regulated by proteins such
as transcription factors (TFs), the full set of proteins within the cell
constitutes a large system of interacting components. Here, we explore factors
affecting the stability of this system by coupling the dynamics of mRNAs and
protein concentrations in a growing cell. We find that it is possible for
protein concentrations to become unstable if the regulation strengths or system
size becomes too large, and that other global structural features of the
networks can dramatically enhance the stability of the system. In particular,
given the same number of proteins, TFs, number of interactions, and regulation
strengths, a network that resembles a bipartite graph with a lower fraction of
interactions that target TFs has a higher chance of being stable. By scrambling
the $\textit{E. coli.}$ transcription network, we find that the randomized
network with the same number of regulatory interactions is much more likely to
be unstable than the real network. These findings suggest that constraints
imposed by system stability could have played a role in shaping the existing
regulatory network during the evolutionary process. We also find that contrary
to what one might expect from random matrix theory and what has been argued in
the literature, the degradation rate of mRNA does not affect whether the system
is stable.

revealed significant variations in average disk mass between some regions. For
instance, disks in the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC) and Corona Australis (CrA)
are on average smaller than disks observed in Lupus, Taurus, Chamaeleon I or
Ophiuchus. In contrast to previous models that study truncation of disks at a
late stage of their evolution, we investigate whether disks may already be born
with systematically smaller disk sizes in more massive star-forming regions as
a consequence of enhanced ionization rates. Assuming various cosmic-ray
ionization rates, we compute the resistivities for ambipolar diffusion and
Ohmic dissipation with a chemical network, and perform 2D non-ideal
magnetohydrodynamical protostellar collapse simulations. A higher ionization
rate leads to stronger magnetic braking, and hence to the formation of smaller
disks. Accounting for recent findings that protostars act as forges of cosmic
rays and considering only mild attenuation during the collapse phase, we show
that a high average cosmic-ray ionization rate in star-forming regions like the
ONC or CrA can explain the detection of smaller disks in these regions. Our
results show that on average a higher ionization rate leads to the formation of
smaller disks. Therefore, smaller disks in regions of similar age can be the
consequence of different levels of ionization, and may not exclusively be
caused by disk truncation via external photoevaporation. We strongly encourage
observations that allow measuring the cosmic-ray ionization degrees in
different star-forming regions to test our hypothesis.

redshift universe are more narrowly collimated than those at lower redshifts.
This implies that we detect relatively fewer long GRB progenitor systems (i.e.
massive stars) at high redshifts, because a greater fraction of GRBs have their
jets pointed away from us. As a result, estimates of the star formation rate
(from the GRB rate) at high redshifts may be diminished if this effect is not
taken into account. In this paper, we estimate the star formation rate (SFR)
using the observed GRB rate, accounting for an evolving jet opening angle. We
find that the SFR in the early universe (z > 3) can be up to an order of
magnitude higher than the canonical estimates, depending on the severity of
beaming angle evolution and the fraction of stars that make long gamma-ray
bursts. Additionally, we find an excess in the SFR at low redshifts, although
this lessens when accounting for evolution of the beaming angle. Finally, under
the assumption that GRBs do in fact trace canonical forms of the cosmic SFR, we
constrain the resulting fraction of stars that must produce GRBs, again
accounting for jet beaming-angle evolution. We find this assumption suggests a
high fraction of stars in the early universe producing GRBs - a result that
may, in fact, support our initial assertion that GRBs do not trace canonical
estimates of the SFR.

CSI-based and CSI-free multi-antenna WET schemes in a setup with WET in the
downlink, and periodic or Poisson-traffic Wireless Information Transfer (WIT)
in the uplink. When CSI is available, we show that a maximum ratio transmission
beamformer is close to optimum whenever the farthest node experiences at least

although the adopted CSI-free mechanism is not capable of providing average
harvesting gains, it does provide greater WET/WIT diversity with lower energy
requirements when compared with the CSI-based scheme. Our numerical results
evidence that the CSI-free scheme performs favorably under periodic traffic
conditions, but it may be deficient in case of Poisson traffic, specially if
the setup is not optimally configured. Finally, we show the prominent
performance results when the uplink transmissions are periodic, while
highlighting the need of a minimum mean square error equalizer rather than

  using Progressively-Growing AmbientGANs","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It has been advocated that medical imaging systems and reconstruction
algorithms should be assessed and optimized by use of objective measures of
image quality that quantify the performance of an observer at specific
diagnostic tasks. One important source of variability that can significantly
limit observer performance is variation in the objects to-be-imaged. This
source of variability can be described by stochastic object models (SOMs). A
SOM is a generative model that can be employed to establish an ensemble of
to-be-imaged objects with prescribed statistical properties. In order to
accurately model variations in anatomical structures and object textures, it is
desirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging measurements acquired by
use of a well-characterized imaging system. Deep generative neural networks,
such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold great potential for this
task. However, conventional GANs are typically trained by use of reconstructed
images that are influenced by the effects of measurement noise and the
reconstruction process. To circumvent this, an AmbientGAN has been proposed
that augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original
AmbientGAN could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures, such
as progressive growing, which limited its ability to be applied to
realistically sized medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a new
Progressive Growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) strategy is developed for
establishing SOMs from medical imaging measurements. Stylized numerical studies
corresponding to common medical imaging modalities are conducted to demonstrate
and validate the proposed method for establishing SOMs.

deriving the bounded-from-below (BFB) conditions in multi-Higgs models with
softly broken global symmetries. Namely, necessary and sufficient BFB
conditions derived for the case with an exact symmetry can be ruined by
introducing soft symmetry breaking terms. Using $S_4$ and $A_4$-symmetric
three-Higgs-doublet models as an example, we argue that all published necessary
and sufficient BFB conditions, even those which are correct for the exactly
symmetric case, are no longer sufficient if soft symmetry breaking is added.
Using the geometric formalism, we derive the exact necessary and sufficient BFB
conditions for the 3HDM with the symmetry group $S_4$, either exact or softly
broken, and review the situation for the $A_4$-symmetric case.

numerical, not categorical data. We briefly describe the advantages and
disadvantages of common encoding schemes. For example, one-hot encoding is
commonly used for attributes with a few unrelated categories and word
embeddings for attributes with many related categories (e.g., words). Neither
is suitable for encoding attributes with many unrelated categories, such as
diagnosis codes in healthcare applications. Application of one-hot encoding for
diagnosis codes, for example, can result in extremely high dimensionality with
low sample size problems or artificially induce machine learning artifacts, not
to mention the explosion of computing resources needed. Quasi-orthonormal
encoding (QOE) fills the gap. We briefly show how QOE compares to one-hot
encoding. We provide example code of how to implement QOE using popular ML
libraries such as Tensorflow and PyTorch and a demonstration of QOE to MNIST

graph of a graph $G$, $KB(G)$, defined as the intersection graph of the
bicliques of $G$, was introduced and characterized in 2010. However, this
characterization does not lead to polynomial time recognition algorithms. The
time complexity of its recognition problem remains open. There are some works
on this problem when restricted to some classes. In this work we give a
characterization of the biclique graph of a $K_3$-free graph $G$. We prove that
$KB(G)$ is the square graph of a particular graph which we call Mutually

of biclique graphs (restricted to $K_3$-free graphs) using known properties of
square graphs. For instance we generalize a property about induced ${P_3}'$s in
biclique graphs to a property about stars and proved a conjecture posted by
Groshaus and Montero, when restricted to $K_3$-free graphs. Also we
characterize the class of biclique graphs of bipartite graphs. We prove that

offload job management, life cycle tracking, address translation, fault

Kubernetes' eventing system as its own. We use four design patterns to
implement our system: controllers, conductors, coordinators and causal chains.
Composing controllers, conductors and coordinators allows us to build
deterministic state machines out of an asynchronous distributed system. The
resulting implementation eliminates 75% of the original platform code. Our

a random network. The coupled dynamics of the states of the nodes and the links
produces by itself an absorbing phase transition which is shown to be robust
against the link rewiring mechanism. However, the dynamics of the network gives
rise to significant physical changes, specially in the limit in which some
links do not change state but are always rewired: First a network fragmentation
occurs at the critical line of the absorbing transition, and only at this line,
so that fragmentation is a manifestation of criticality. Secondly, in the
active phase of the absorbing transition, finite-size fluctuations take the
system to a single network component consensus phase, while other

diseases, poses unique challenges for researchers. Behaviors of and
interactions between viruses, vectors, hosts, and the environment each play a
part in determining the transmission of a disease. Public health surveillance
systems and other sources provide valuable data that can be used to accurately
forecast disease incidence. However, many aspects of common infectious disease
surveillance data are imperfect: cases may be reported with a delay or in some
cases not at all, data on vectors may not be available, and case data may not
be available at high geographical or temporal resolution. In the face of these
challenges, researchers must make assumptions to either account for these
underlying processes in a mechanistic model or to justify their exclusion
altogether in a statistical model. Whether a model is mechanistic or
statistical, researchers should evaluate their model using accepted best
practices from the emerging field of infectious disease forecasting while
adopting conventions from other fields that have been developing forecasting
methods for decades. Accounting for assumptions and properly evaluating models
will allow researchers to generate forecasts that have the potential to provide
valuable insights for public health officials. This chapter provides a
background to the practice of forecasting in general, discusses the biological

technical details about making and evaluating forecasting models, and explores

for this photo-induced anomalous Hall effect in undoped TMDs irradiated by a
strong coherent laser field. The strong field renormalizes the equilibrium
bands and opens up a dynamical energy gap where single-photon resonance occurs.
The resulting photon dressed states, or Floquet states, are treated within the
rotating wave approximation. A quantum kinetic equation approach is developed
to study the non-equilibrium density matrix and time-averaged transport
currents under the simultaneous influence of the strong a.c. pump field and the
weak d.c. probe field. Dissipative effects are taken into account in the
kinetic equation that captures relaxation and dephasing. The photo-induced
longitudinal and Hall conductivities display notable resonant signatures when
the pump field frequency reaches the spin-split interband transition energies.
Rather than valley polarization, we find that the anomalous Hall current is
mainly driven by the intraband response of photon-dressed electron populations
near the dynamical gap at both valleys, accompanied by a smaller contribution
due to interband coherences. These findings highlight the importance of
photon-dressed bands and non-equilibrium distribution functions in achieving a

machine learning applications to healthcare. Breast cancer classification in
mammography exemplifies these challenges, with a malignancy rate of around 0.5%
in a screening population, which is compounded by the relatively small size of
lesions (~1% of the image) in malignant cases. Simultaneously, the prevalence
of screening mammography creates a potential abundance of non-cancer exams to
use for training. Altogether, these characteristics lead to overfitting on
cancer cases, while under-utilizing non-cancer data. Here, we present a novel
generative adversarial network (GAN) model for data augmentation that can
realistically synthesize and remove lesions on mammograms. With self-attention
and semi-supervised learning components, the U-net-based architecture can
generate high resolution (256x256px) outputs, as necessary for mammography.
When augmenting the original training set with the GAN-generated samples, we
find a significant improvement in malignancy classification performance on a

algorithm and the relevance to other medical imaging paradigms point to
potentially fruitful further applications.

transformation of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian, linking DeepWalk to
extensive prior work in spectral graph embeddings. Further, we show that by a
applying a simple nonlinear entrywise transformation to this pseudoinverse, we
recover a good approximation of the finite-T objective and embeddings that are
competitive with those from DeepWalk and other skip-gram methods in multi-label

advancement of recent methods is a nonlinearity on top of the classical

enabling an early overview of the system to be implemented in practice,
reducing the waste of resources and in less time. In project optimization,
these models play a fundamental role, allowing to obtain parameters and
attributes capable of enhancing product performance, reducing costs and
operating time. These enhancements depend on several factors, including an
accurate computational modeling of the inherent characteristics of the system.
In general, such models include uncertainties in their mathematical
formulations, which affect the feasibility of the results and their practical
implementation. In this work, two different approaches capable of quantifying
uncertainties during the optimization of mathematical models are considered. In
the first, robust optimization, the sensitivity of decision variables in
relation to deviations caused by external factors is evaluated. Robust
solutions tend to reduce deviations due to possible system changes. The second
approach, reliability-based optimization, measures the probability of system
failure and obtains model parameters that ensures an established level of
reliability. Overall, the fundamental objective is to formulate a
multi-objective optimization problem capable of handling robust and
reliability-based optimizations, to obtain solutions that are least sensitive
to external noise and that satisfy prescribed reliability levels. The proposed
formulation is analyzed by solving benchmark and chemical engineering problems.
The results show the influence of both methodologies for the analysis of
uncertainties, the multi-objective approach provides a variety of feasible

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mathematical formulations of real world optimization studies frequently
present characteristics such as non-linearity, discontinuity and high
complexity. This class of problems may also exhibit a high number of global
minimum/maximum points, especially for optimization problems arising from
nonlinear algebraic systems (where null minima correspond to the solutions of
the original algebraic system). Due to the multimodal nature of these
functions, multipopulation methods have been employed in order to obtain the
highest number of points of global minimum/maximum. In this work, two new
approaches were analyzed, employing an iterative penalization technique and a
multipopulation procedure---together with the Differential Evolution
algorithm---devoted to obtain the full set of solutions for multimodal
optimization problems. The first method proposed is the Multipopulation
Differential Evolution with iterative technique of modification of the
objective function, MDE-ITMF, and the second method proposed is the
Differential Evolution with Initialization, DEwI. In this second proposal, the
MDE-ITMF method is used as an initializer of the initial populations and from a
given moment the Differential Evolution is used to solve the problem at hand.
In both approaches, subpopulations evolve simultaneously throughout the
iterative process. MDE-ITMF and DEwI methods were applied in a set of ten
multimodal benchmark functions. Based on the results obtained, we can conclude
that MDE-ITMF and DEwI are suitable and promising tools for multimodal
optimization.

distribution and a standard normal distribution; it can be used for density
estimation and statistical inference. Computing the flow follows the change of
variables formula and thus requires invertibility of the mapping and an
efficient way to compute the determinant of its Jacobian. To satisfy these
requirements, normalizing flows typically consist of carefully chosen
components. Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are mappings obtained by
solving a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). The neural ODE's
dynamics can be chosen almost arbitrarily while ensuring invertibility.
Moreover, the log-determinant of the flow's Jacobian can be obtained by
integrating the trace of the dynamics' Jacobian along the flow. Our proposed
OT-Flow approach tackles two critical computational challenges that limit a
more widespread use of CNFs. First, OT-Flow leverages optimal transport (OT)
theory to regularize the CNF and enforce straight trajectories that are easier
to integrate. Second, OT-Flow features exact trace computation with time
complexity equal to trace estimators used in existing CNFs. On five
high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling tasks, OT-Flow
performs competitively to state-of-the-art CNFs while on average requiring
one-fourth of the number of weights with an 8x speedup in training time and 24x
speedup in inference.

flap, hinged at the separation location of the section, is calculated through
iteration to ensure that the lift and moment coefficients of the section match

enabled fundamental questions about movement to be tackled, leading to the
development of the movement ecology framework (MEF), considered a milestone in
the field [1]. The MEF introduced an integrative theory of organismal movement,
linking internal state, motion capacity and navigation capacity to external
factors. Here, a decade later, we investigated the current state of research in
the field. Using a text mining approach on >8000 peer-reviewed papers in
movement ecology, we explored the main research topics, evaluated the impact of
the MEF, and assessed changes in the use of technological devices, software and
statistical methods. The number of publications has increased considerably and
there have been major technological changes in the past decade (i.e.~increased
use of GPS devices, accelerometers and video cameras, and a convergence towards
R), yet we found that research focuses on the same questions, specifically, on
the effect of environmental factors on movement and behavior. In practice, it
appears that movement ecology research does not reflect the MEF. We call on
researchers to transform the field from technology-driven to embrace
interdisciplinary collaboration, in order to reveal key processes underlying
movement (e.g.~navigation), as well as evolutionary, physiological and
life-history consequences of particular strategies.

objective measures of image quality (IQ). The Ideal Observer (IO) performance
has been advocated to provide a figure-of-merit for use in assessing and
optimizing imaging systems because the IO sets an upper performance limit among
all observers. When joint signal detection and localization tasks are
considered, the IO that employs a modified generalized likelihood ratio test
maximizes observer performance as characterized by the localization receiver
operating characteristic (LROC) curve. Computations of likelihood ratios are
analytically intractable in the majority of cases. Therefore, sampling-based
methods that employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been
developed to approximate the likelihood ratios. However, the applications of
MCMC methods have been limited to relatively simple object models. Supervised
learning-based methods that employ convolutional neural networks have been
recently developed to approximate the IO for binary signal detection tasks. In
this paper, the ability of supervised learning-based methods to approximate the
IO for joint signal detection and localization tasks is explored. Both
background-known-exactly and background-known-statistically signal detection
and localization tasks are considered. The considered object models include a
lumpy object model and a clustered lumpy model, and the considered measurement
noise models include Laplacian noise, Gaussian noise, and mixed
Poisson-Gaussian noise. The LROC curves produced by the supervised
learning-based method are compared to those produced by the MCMC approach or
analytical computation when feasible. The potential utility of the proposed
method for computing objective measures of IQ for optimizing imaging system
performance is explored.

difficult to assemble, as it requires convincingly associating evolved massive
stars with Hii regions that, in turn, would need to present signs of active
star formation. We present observational evidence for triggered star formation
relating three generations of stars in the neighbourhood of the star LS II +26
8. We carried out new spectroscopic observations of LS II +26 8, revealing that
it is a B0 III-type star. We note that LS II +26 8 is located exactly at the
geometric centre of a semi-shell-like Hii region complex. The most conspicuous
component of this complex is the Hii region Sh2-90, which is probably
triggering a new generation of stars. The distances to LS II +26 8 and to
Sh2-90 are in agreement (between 2.6 and 3 kpc). Analysis of the interstellar
medium on a larger spatial scale shows that Hii region complex lies on the
northwestern border of an extended H2 shell. The radius of this molecular shell
is about 13 pc, which is in agreement with what an O9V star (the probable
initial spectral type of LS II +26 8 as inferred from evolutive tracks) can
generate through its winds in the molecular environment. In conclusion, the
spatial and temporal correspondences derived in our analysis enable us to
propose a probable triggered star formation scenario initiated by the evolved
massive star LS II +26 8 during its main sequence stage, followed by stars
exciting the Hii region complex formed in the molecular shell, and culminating
in the birth of YSOs around Sh2-90.

cytoskeleton and their transmission to an extracellular substrate through
specific adhesion molecules. Crawling cells show many features of excitable
systems, such as spontaneous symmetry breaking and crawling in the absence of
external cues, and periodic and propagating waves of activity. Mechanical
instabilities in the active cytoskeleton network and feedback loops in the
biochemical network of activators and repressors of cytoskeleton dynamics have
been invoked to explain these dynamical features. Here, we show that the
interplay between the dynamics of cell-substrate adhesion and linear cellular
mechanics is sufficient to reproduce many non-linear dynamical patterns
observed in spreading and crawling cells. Using an analytical formalism of the
molecular clutch model of cell adhesion, regulated by local mechanical forces,
we show that cellular traction forces exhibit a stick-slip dynamics resulting
in periodic waves of protrusion/retraction and propagating waves along the cell
edge. This can explain spontaneous symmetry breaking and polarisation of
spreading cells, leading to steady crawling or bipedal motion, and bistability,
where persistent cell motion requires a sufficiently strong transient external
stimulus. The model also highlight the role of membrane tension in providing
the long-range mechanical communication across the cell required for symmetry
breaking.

closed elite writing to incorporating democratic mechanisms. Yet, little is
known about democratic participation in deliberative constitution-making
processes. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process held by the
Chilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest
level of citizen participation in the world ($204,402$ people, i.e., $1.3\%$ of
the population) for such a process and covered $98\%$ of the national
territory. In its participatory phase, people gathered in self-convoked groups
of 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote
down an argument on why the new constitution should include those social
rights. To understand the citizen participation drivers in this volunteer
process, we first identify the determinants at the municipality level. We find
the educational level, engagement in politics, support for the (left-wing)
government, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast,
population density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased
participation. Moreover, we do not find evidence of political manipulation on
citizen participation. In light of those determinants, we analyze the
collective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the
deliberative phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities,
proxied using education levels and main economic activity, facilitates

Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa1448",,"astro-ph.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the {\Lambda}-CDM paradigm of cosmology, anisotropies larger than 260 Mpc
shouldn't exist. However, the existence of the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great
Wall (HCB) is purported to challenge this principle by some with an estimated
size exceeding 2000 Mpc. Recently, some have challenged the assertion of the
existence of the HCB, attributing the anisotropy to sky exposure effects. It
has never been explained why the original methods purporting the existence of
the HCB produce anisotropies, even if sky-exposure effects are taken into
account. In this paper, I apply the methods of the original papers purporting
the existence of the HCB in various Monte-Carlo simulations that assume
isotropy to analyze the empirical meaning of the significance levels of the
original tests used. I find that, although the statistical tests at first
glance show significant anisotropies present in the suspect sample, Monte-Carlo
simulations can easily reproduce the sample in most cases, and if not, the
differences can be accounted for by other statistical considerations. An
updated sample raises the probability of drawing the observed clustering from
an isotropic sample ten-fold in some cases. Thus the statistical tests used in
prior studies overestimate the significance of the observed anisotropy, and an
updated sample returns even less significant probabilities. Given the ability
to reproduce the observed anisotropy in Monte-Carlo simulations, the new,
higher probabilities of being drawn from isotropy for an updated sample, and
the work of previous papers attributing anisotropies to sky-selection effects,
the existence of the HCB must be treated as doubtful at best.

autonomous mobile robots. Most of the existing solutions are typically based on
single condition constraint and cannot incorporate sensor data in a real-time
manner, which often fail to respond to unexpected moving obstacles in dynamic
unknown environments. In this paper, a novel real-time multi-constraints
obstacle avoidance method using Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) is proposed,
which is able to, based on the latest estimation of the robot pose and
environment, find the sub-goal defined by a multi-constraints function within
the explored region and plan a corresponding optimal trajectory at each time
step iteratively, so that the robot approaches the goal over time. Meanwhile,
at each time step, the improved Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) algorithm is also
used to re-plan optimal paths from the latest robot pose to the latest defined
sub-goal position. While ensuring convergence, planning in this method is done
by repeated local optimizations, so that the latest sensor data from LiDAR and
derived environment information can be fully utilized at each step until the
robot reaches the desired position. This method facilitates real-time
performance, also has little requirement on memory space or computational power
due to its nature, thus our method has huge potentials to benefit small
low-cost autonomous platforms. The method is evaluated against several existing
technologies in both simulation and real-world experiments.

persons reunite with their families. In this work, the challenging problem is
progressively addressed in two respects. First, we propose a deep siamese
network to quantify the relative similarity between two individuals. When given
two input face images, the deep siamese network extracts the features from them
and fuses these features by combining and concatenating. Then, the fused
features are fed into a fully-connected network to obtain the similarity score
between two faces, which is used to verify the kinship. To improve the
performance, a jury system is also employed for multi-model fusion. Second, two
deep siamese networks are integrated into a deep triplet network for
tri-subject (i.e., father, mother and child) kinship verification, which is
intended to decide whether a child is related to a pair of parents or not.
Specifically, the obtained similarity scores of father-child and mother-child
are weighted to generate the parent-child similarity score for kinship
verification. Recognizing Families In the Wild (RFIW) is a challenging kinship
recognition task with multiple tracks, which is based on Families in the Wild

azimuthal flows, which raises the question of how different neighboring spirals
interact with each other in spiral chaos, and the role of hydrodynamics in this
regime. Far from the core, we show that spiral rotations lead to an azimuthal
body force that is irrotational and of magnitude proportional to the
topological index of the spiral and its angular frequency. The force, although
irrotational, cannot be included in the pressure field as it would lead to a
nonphysical, multivalued pressure. We calculate the asymptotic dependence of
the resulting flow, and show that it leads to a logarithmic dependence of the
azimuthal velocity on distance r away from the spiral core in the limit of
negligible damping coefficient. This solution dampens to approximately $1/r$
when accounting for no-slip boundary conditions for the convection cell's
plate. This flow component can provide additional hydrodynamic interactions
among spirals including those observed in spiral defect chaos. We show that the
analytic prediction for the azimuthal velocity agrees with numerical results
obtained from both two-dimensional generalized Swift-Hohenberg and
three-dimensional Boussinesq models, and find that the velocity field is
affected by the size and charges of neighboring spirals. Numerically, we
identify a correlation between the appearance of spiral defect chaos and the
balancing between the mean-flow advection and the diffusive dynamics related to
roll unwinding.

the approach is extended to obtain coding scheme based on discrete inputs for

person matching. However, the existing methods based on the Detection-Matching
framework ignore the person objectness and repulsion (OR) which are both
beneficial to reduce the effect of distractor images. In this paper, we propose
an OR similarity by jointly considering the objectness and repulsion
information. Besides the traditional visual similarity term, the OR similarity
also contains an objectness term and a repulsion term. The objectness term can
reduce the similarity of distractor images that not contain a person and boost
the performance of person search by improving the ranking of positive samples.
Because the probe person has a different person ID with its \emph{neighbors},
the gallery images having a higher similarity with the \emph{neighbors of
probe} should have a lower similarity with the probe person. Based on this
repulsion constraint, the repulsion term is proposed to reduce the similarity
of distractor images that are not most similar to the probe person. Treating
the Faster R-CNN as the person detector, the OR similarity is evaluated on PRW
and CUHK-SYSU datasets by the Detection-Matching framework with six description
models. The extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed OR similarity
can effectively reduce the similarity of distractor samples and further boost
the performance of person search, e.g., improve the mAP from 92.32% to 93.23%

leverage effects clearly influence the modeling of realized volatility models.
Leverage effects exist for both the spot and futures markets in the Nikkei 225.
Although realized semivariance aids better modeling, the estimations of RSV
models depend on whether these models have leverage effects. Asymmetric jump
components do not have a clear influence on realized volatility models. While
leverage effects and realized semivariance also improve the out-of-sample
forecast performance of volatility models, asymmetric jumps are not useful for
predictive ability. The empirical results of this study indicate that

one at a time. An alternative approach, which is referred to as quantile
regression coefficients modeling (QRCM), is to model quantile regression
coefficients as parametric functions of the order of the quantile. In this
paper, we describe how the QRCM paradigm can be applied to longitudinal data.
We introduce a two-level quantile function, in which two different quantile
regression models are used to describe the (conditional) distribution of the
within-subject response and that of the individual effects. We propose a novel
type of penalized fixed-effects estimator, and discuss its advantages over
standard methods based on $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ penalization. We provide model
identifiability conditions, derive asymptotic properties, describe
goodness-of-fit measures and model selection criteria, present simulation
results, and discuss an application. The proposed method has been implemented
in the R package qrcm.

image of an object by correlating a series of known illumination patterns with
the total reflected (or transmitted) intensity. We here demonstrate a scheme
which can remove the basic requirement of knowing the incident patterns on the
object, enabling GI to non-invasively image objects through turbid media. As an
experimental proof, we project a set of patterns towards an object hidden
inside turbid media that scramble the illumination, making the patterns falling

Cyber-Physical System (CPS) design. Traditional risk assessment considers only
physical failures. For modern CPS, failures caused by cyber attacks are on the
rise. The focus of latest research effort is on safety-security lifecycle
integration and the expansion of modeling formalisms for risk assessment to
incorporate security failures. The interaction between safety and security
lifecycles and its impact on the overall system design, as well as the
reliability loss resulting from ignoring security failures are some of the
overlooked research questions. This paper addresses these research questions by
presenting a new safety design method named Cyber Layer Of Protection Analysis
(CLOPA) that extends existing LOPA framework to include failures caused by
cyber attacks. The proposed method provides a rigorous mathematical formulation
that expresses quantitatively the trade-off between designing a highly-reliable

that integrates the safety and security risk assessment processes. We evaluate
the proposed CLOPA approach and the integrated lifecycle on a practical case
study of a process reactor controlled by an industrial control testbed, and
provide a comparison between the proposed CLOPA and current LOPA risk
assessment practice.

where traditional designs mostly rely on intuitions and experience. More
specifically, we propose to learn an initializer for the conjugate gradient
(CG) algorithm that involved in one of the subproblems of the backbone model.
Other components, such as image priors and hyperparameters, are kept as the
original design. Since a hypernetwork is introduced to inference on the
initialization of the CG module, it makes the proposed model a certain
meta-learning model. Therefore, we shall call the proposed model the
meta-inversion network (MetaInv-Net). The proposed MetaInv-Net can be designed
with much less trainable parameters while still preserves its superior image
reconstruction performance than some state-of-the-art deep models in CT

and can be generalized beyond the training setting, i.e., to other scanning
settings, noise levels, and data sets.

the intestinal crypt. Growth and deformation of the crypt, idealised as a line
of cells on a substrate, are modelled using morphoelastic rod theory.
Alternating between Lagrangian and Eulerian mechanical descriptions enables us
precisely to characterise the dynamic nature of tissue homeostasis, whereby the
proliferative structure and morphology are static in the Eulerian frame, but
there is active migration of Lagrangian material points out of the crypt.
Assuming mechanochemical growth, we identify the necessary conditions for
homeostasis, reducing the full, time-dependent system to a static boundary
value problem characterising a spatially heterogeneous ""treadmilling"" state. We
extract essential features of crypt homeostasis, such as the morphology, the
proliferative structure, the migration velocity, and the sloughing rate. We
also derive closed-form solutions for growth and sloughing dynamics in
homeostasis, and show that mechanochemical growth is sufficient to generate the
observed proliferative structure of the crypt. Key to this is the concept of
threshold-dependent mechanical feedback, that regulates an established Wnt
signal for biochemical growth. Numerical solutions demonstrate the importance
of crypt morphology on homeostatic growth, migration, and sloughing, and
highlight the value of this framework as a foundation for studying the role of
mechanics in homeostasis.

applying software engineering activities, such as version control, to maintain
IaC scripts. Without the application of these activities, defects that can have
serious consequences may be introduced in IaC scripts. A systematic
investigation of the development anti-patterns for IaC scripts can guide
practitioners in identifying activities to avoid defects in IaC scripts.
Development anti-patterns are recurring development activities that relate with
defective IaC scripts. Goal: The goal of this paper is to help practitioners
improve the quality of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by identifying
development activities that relate with defective IaC scripts. Methodology: We
identify development anti-patterns by adopting a mixed-methods approach, where
we apply quantitative analysis with 2,138 open source IaC scripts and conduct a
survey with 51 practitioners. Findings: We observe five development activities
to be related with defective IaC scripts from our quantitative analysis. We
identify five development anti-patterns namely, 'boss is not around', 'many
cooks spoil', 'minors are spoiler', 'silos', and 'unfocused contribution'.
Conclusion: Our identified development anti-patterns suggest the importance of
'as code' activities in IaC because these activities are related to quality of
IaC scripts.

condition is considered to be incorrect in the photosphere. We examine direct
measurements of the chromospheric magnetic field in two active regions through
spectropolarimetric observations at He I 10830 A, which are compared with the
potential fields and NLFFFs extrapolated from the photosphere. The comparisons
allow quantitative estimation of the uncertainty in the NLFFF extrapolation

field may have larger non-potentiality compared to the photospheric magnetic
field. Moreover, the large non-potentiality in the chromospheric height may not
be reproduced by the NLFFF extrapolation from the photospheric magnetic field.
The magnitude of the underestimation of the non-potentiality at chromospheric
heights may reach 30-40 degree in shear signed angle in some locations. This
deviation may be caused by the non-force-freeness in the photosphere. Our study
suggests the importance of the inclusion of measured chromospheric magnetic

carrier transport time across a quantum structure in an active region of solar

quantum-well probe inserted under the quantum structure at forward bias, the
carrier transport time can be efficiently determined at room temperature. The
averaged drift velocity shows linear dependence on the internal field, allowing
us to estimate the quantum structure as a quasi-bulk material with low
effective mobility containing the information of carrier dynamics. We show that
this direct and real-time observation is more sensitive to carrier transport
than other conventional techniques, providing better insights into microscopic
carrier transport dynamics to overcome a device design difficulty.

motions caused by the laser ``pulling'' on the electrons, which forms an
electron density tide (EDT). However, the strong field processes in solids are
always explained by the single-active-electron (SAE) model and the fluctuation
of background electrons is neglected previously. Here, we demonstrate the
strong field induced EDT effect and propose a model for revealing its role in
high harmoinc generation (HHG) from solids. We show that the EDT effect induces
an additional polarization current beyond the SAE approximation. It gives a new
mechanism for HHG and leads to new anisotropic structures, which are
experimentally observed with MgO. Our experiment indicates that the EDT effect
becomes more obvious with increasing the laser intensity. Our work establishes
the bridge between the HHG and the microscopic EDT in solids induced by the
strong laser field, which paves the way to probe the ultrafast electron

anisotropic porous materials have the potential to reduce skin friction in
turbulent flows through a similar mechanism to riblets. This paper reports
particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements made in turbulent boundary layers
at $Re_\tau \approx 360$ over 3D-printed porous substrates exhibiting such
streamwise-preferential permeability. The porous material has normalized
streamwise permeability $\sqrt{K_{xx}^+}\approx 3.0$ and wall-normal and
spanwise permeabilities $\sqrt{K_{yy}^+} = \sqrt{K_{zz}^+} \approx 1.1$. This
material is flush-mounted into a cutout in the downstream half of a flat-plate
boundary layer setup in a water channel facility. Measurements made at several
locations along the porous substrate provide insight into boundary layer
development. For fully-developed conditions, the mean profiles show the
presence of a logarithmic region over the porous material with similar
constants to those found over a smooth wall. A technique that estimates the
mean profile at single-pixel resolution from the particle images suggests the
presence of an interfacial slip velocity of $U_s^+ \approx \sqrt{K_{xx}^+}$
over the porous substrate. Friction velocity estimates obtained from outer
layer fits to the mean profile suggest a marginal increase in drag over the
porous substrate. PIV measurements show a decrease in the intensity of
streamwise velocity fluctuations in the near-wall region and an increase in the
intensity of wall-normal velocity fluctuations. These observations are
consistent with simulation results, which suggest that materials with
$\sqrt{K_{yy}^+} > 0.4$ are susceptible to the emergence of spanwise rollers
similar to Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices that degrade drag reduction performance.
Velocity spectra indicate that such structures emerge in the experiments as
well.

well as spatial variations of the fundamental constants in the vicinity of
dense bodies such as Earth due to the formation of a ""bubble-like"" defect
structure surrounding the dense body. In sufficiently dense environments,
spontaneous symmetry breaking may be inhibited altogether for $\phi^2$

defects. We derive bounds on non-transient variations of the fundamental
constants from torsion-pendulum experiments that search for
equivalence-principle-violating forces, experiments comparing the frequencies
of ground- and space-based atomic clocks, as well as ground-based clocks at

using the point-to-plane cost, which aims to jointly optimize depth sensor
poses and plane parameters for 3D reconstruction. We call this least-squares
problem \textbf{Planar Bundle Adjustment} (PBA), due to the similarity between
this problem and the original Bundle Adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction.
As planes ubiquitously exist in the man-made environment, they are generally
used as landmarks in SLAM algorithms for various depth sensors. PBA is
important to reduce drift and improve the quality of the map. However, directly
adopting the well-established BA framework in visual reconstruction will result
in a very inefficient solution for PBA. This is because a 3D point only has one
observation at a camera pose. In contrast, a depth sensor can record hundreds
of points in a plane at a time, which results in a very large nonlinear
least-squares problem even for a small-scale space. Fortunately, we find that
there exist a special structure of the PBA problem. We introduce a reduced
Jacobian matrix and a reduced residual vector, and prove that they can replace
the original Jacobian matrix and residual vector in the generally adopted
Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm. This significantly reduces the
computational cost. Besides, when planes are combined with other features for
3D reconstruction, the reduced Jacobian matrix and residual vector can also
replace the corresponding parts derived from planes. Our experimental results
verify that our algorithm can significantly reduce the computational time
compared to the solution using the traditional BA framework. Besides, our
algorithm is faster, more accuracy, and more robust to initialization errors

all known infinite antichains with respect to the topological containment,
subdivisions of a graph obtained from an arbitrarily long path by duplicating
each edge can be found. In the 1980's Robertson conjectured that this is the
only obstruction. Formally, he conjectured that for every positive integer $k$,
graphs that do not contain the graph obtained from a path of length $k$ by
duplicating each edge as a topological minor are well-quasi-ordered by the
topological minor relation. The case $k=1$ implies Kruskal's Tree Theorem, and

Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems as intelligent approaches to learn optimal
control policies directly from smart agents' interactions with the environment.
Objectives: In a model-free RL method with continuous state-space, typically,
the value function of the states needs to be approximated. In this regard, Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) provide an attractive modeling mechanism to approximate
the value function using sample transitions. DNN-based solutions, however,
suffer from high sensitivity to parameter selection, are prone to overfitting,
and are not very sample efficient. A Kalman-based methodology, on the other
hand, could be used as an efficient alternative. Such an approach, however,
commonly requires a-priori information about the system (such as noise
statistics) to perform efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to
address this issue. Methods: As a remedy to the aforementioned problems, this
paper proposes an innovative Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Difference (MM-KTD)
framework, which adapts the parameters of the filter using the observed states
and rewards. Moreover, an active learning method is proposed to enhance the
sampling efficiency of the system. More specifically, the estimated uncertainty
of the value functions are exploited to form the behaviour policy leading to
more visits to less certain values, therefore, improving the overall learning
sample efficiency. As a result, the proposed MM-KTD framework can learn the
optimal policy with significantly reduced number of samples as compared to its
DNN-based counterparts. Results: To evaluate performance of the proposed MM-KTD
framework, we have performed a comprehensive set of experiments based on three
RL benchmarks. Experimental results show superiority of the MM-KTD framework in
comparison to its state-of-the-art counterparts.

representation of retinal images that further helps to improve the performance
of DR recognition models. To extract optimal representation, features extracted
from multiple pre-trained ConvNet models are blended using proposed multi-modal
fusion module. These final representations are used to train a Deep Neural
Network (DNN) used for DR identification and severity level prediction. As each
ConvNet extracts different features, fusing them using 1D pooling and cross
pooling leads to better representation than using features extracted from a
single ConvNet. Experimental studies on benchmark Kaggle APTOS 2019 contest
dataset reveals that the model trained on proposed blended feature
representations is superior to the existing methods. In addition, we notice
that cross average pooling based fusion of features from Xception and VGG16 is
the most appropriate for DR recognition. With the proposed model, we achieve an
accuracy of 97.41%, and a kappa statistic of 94.82 for DR identification and an
accuracy of 81.7% and a kappa statistic of 71.1% for severity level prediction.
Another interesting observation is that DNN with dropout at input layer

diagnose endocrine and metabolic disorders during child development. Existing
deep learning based methods for classifying bone age use the global image as
input, or exploit local information by annotating extra bounding boxes or key
points. However, training with the global image underutilizes discriminative
local information, while providing extra annotations is expensive and
subjective. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided approach to
automatically localize the discriminative regions for BAA without any extra
annotations. Specifically, we first train a classification model to learn the
attention maps of the discriminative regions, finding the hand region, the most
discriminative region (the carpal bones), and the next most discriminative
region (the metacarpal bones). Guided by those attention maps, we then crop the
informative local regions from the original image and aggregate different
regions for BAA. Instead of taking BAA as a general regression task, which is
suboptimal due to the label ambiguity problem in the age label space, we
propose using joint age distribution learning and expectation regression, which
makes use of the ordinal relationship among hand images with different
individual ages and leads to more robust age estimation. Extensive experiments
are conducted on the RSNA pediatric bone age data set. Using no training
annotations, our method achieves competitive results compared with existing
state-of-the-art semi-automatic deep learning-based methods that require manual

information geometry perspective, where a quantum state is depicted with a
point in the projective Hilbert space. By taking quantum Fisher information
(QFI) as the metric of projective Hilbert spaces, estimating a small parameter
shift is equivalent to distinguishing neighboring quantum states along a given
curve. Henceforth, information geometry plays a significant role in the single
parameter estimation. However, the absence of high dimensional measures limits
its applications in studying the multi-parameter systems. In this paper, we
will discuss the physical implications of the volume element of QFI. It
measures the intrinsic density of quantum states (IDQS) in projective Hilbert
spaces, which is, then, a measure to define the (over) completeness relation of
a class of quantum states. As an application, IDQS can be used in quantum
measurement and multi-parameter estimation. We find the density of
distinguishable states (DDS) for a set of efficient estimators is measured by
the invariant volume of the classical Fisher information, which is the
classical counterpart of QFI and serves as the metric of statistical manifolds.
Correspondingly, a determinant form of quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao inequality is
proposed to quantify the ability to infer the IDQS via quantum measurement. As
a result, we find a gap between IDQS and maximal DDS over the measurements. The
gap has tight connections with the uncertainty relationship. Exemplified with
the three-level system with two parameters, we find the maximal DDS attained
via the \emph{vertex measurements} (MvDDS) equals the square root of the
quantum geometric tensor's determinant. It indicates the square gap between
IDQS and MvDDS is proportional to the square of Berry curvature.

invariant is constructed by adding a deformation term to the well-known
parametric oscillator invariant. Such a deformation depends explicitly on time
through the solutions of the Ermakov equation, which ensures the regularity of
the new time-dependent potential of the Hamiltonian at each time. On the other
hand, with the aid of the proper reparametrization, the fourth Painlev\'e
equation appears, the parameters of which dictate the spectral behavior of the
quantum invariant. In particular, the eigenfunctions of the third-order ladder
operators lead to several sequences of solutions to the Schr\""odinger equation,
determined in terms of the solutions of a Riccati equation, Okamoto
polynomials, or nonlinear bound states of the derivative nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation. Remarkably, it is noticed that the solutions in terms

are not necessarily optimal for any particular speech application.
Consequently, with greater or lesser success, optimal filterbank learning has
been studied for different speech processing tasks. In this paper, we fill in a
gap by exploring filterbank learning for keyword spotting (KWS). Two approaches
are examined: filterbank matrix learning in the power spectral domain and
parameter learning of a psychoacoustically-motivated gammachirp filterbank.
Filterbank parameters are optimized jointly with a modern deep residual neural
network-based KWS back-end. Our experimental results reveal that, in general,
there are no statistically significant differences, in terms of KWS accuracy,
between using a learned filterbank and handcrafted speech features. Thus, while
we conclude that the latter are still a wise choice when using modern KWS
back-ends, we also hypothesize that this could be a symptom of information
redundancy, which opens up new research possibilities in the field of
small-footprint KWS.

properties of the signature, a well-known path-transform from stochastic

Furthermore, we our approach enables to consistently calibrate under the

machine learning, speech recognition and signal processing, and kNN searches
with Bregman distances have become increasingly important with the rapid
advances of multimedia applications. Data in multimedia applications such as
images and videos are commonly transformed into space of hundreds of
dimensions. Such high-dimensional space has posed significant challenges for
existing kNN search algorithms with Bregman distances, which could only handle
data of medium dimensionality (typically less than 100). This paper addresses
the urgent problem of high-dimensional kNN search with Bregman distances. We
propose a novel partition-filter-refinement framework. Specifically, we propose
an optimized dimensionality partitioning scheme to solve several non-trivial
issues. First, an effective bound from each partitioned subspace to obtain
exact kNN results is derived. Second, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
optimized number of partitions and devise an effective strategy for
partitioning. Third, we design an efficient integrated index structure for all
the subspaces together to accelerate the search processing. Moreover, we extend
our exact solution to an approximate version by a trade-off between the
accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results on four real-world datasets and
two synthetic datasets show the clear advantage of our method in comparison to

$f(R,T)$ gravity via the gravitational collapse of a massive star. The star is
modelled by the Vaidya spacetime which is time dependent in nature. The
coupling of matter with curvature is the key feature of $f(R,T)$ theory and
here we have investigated its effects on a collapsing scenario. Two different
types of models, one involving minimal and the other involving non-minimal
coupling between matter and curvature are considered for our study. Power law
and exponential functionalities are considered as examples to check the outcome
of the gravitational collapse. Our prime objective is to explore the nature of
singularities (black hole or naked singularity) that form as an end state of
the collapse. Existence of outgoing radial null geodesics from the central
singularity was probed and such existence implied the formation of naked
singularities thus defying the cosmic censorship hypothesis. The absence of
such outgoing null geodesics would imply the formation of an event horizon and
the singularity formed becomes a black hole. Conditions under which such
possibilities occur are derived for all the models and sub-models.
Gravitational strength of the singularity is also investigated and the
conditions under which we can get a strong or a weak singularity is derived.
The results obtained are very interesting and may be attributed to the coupling
between curvature and matter. It is seen that for non-minimal coupling there is
a possibility of a globally naked singularity, whereas for a minimal coupling
scenario local nakedness is the only option. It is also found that the
singularity formed can be sufficiently weak in nature, which is cosmologically
desirable.

the parameters, drives the two-spin system toward a maximally entangled state.
In this paper, effects on the quantum dynamics of the two qudits, stemming from
the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and dipole-dipole (d-d) interactions, are
investigated qualitatively and quantitatively. The enriched Hamiltonian model
of the two spins, shares with the previous microscopic one the same C2-symmetry
which once more brings about an exact treatment of the new quantum dynamical
problem. This paper transparently reveals that the DM and d-d interactions
generate independent, enhancing or hindering, modifications in the dynamical
behaviour predicted for the two spins coupled exclusively by the exchange
interaction. It is worthy noticing that, on the basis of the theory here
developed, the measurement of the time evolution of the magnetization in a
controlled LMSZ scenario, can furnish information on the relative weights of
the three kinds of couplings describing the spin system. This possibility is
very important since it allows in principle to legitimate the choice of the
microscopic model to be adopted in a given physical scenario.

traditional bandwise total variation, we use the SSTV regularization to

parameter $\Gamma$ of the Yukawa potential. Upon increasing the screening

distance, slightly less than the Debye length. While this secondary peak grows,
the primary peak near contact decreases. The secondary peak is attributed to
the competition between the advecting (attractive-like) action of the flow in
the compressions sector, and the repulsion due to the electrostatics. In the
extensional sectors, a depletion layer (where the pair-correlation function is
identically zero) near contact is predicted, the width of which increases upon

dark matter in the Universe than ordinary baryonic matter, with an even larger
amount of the Universe's energy content due to dark energy. So far, the
microscopic properties of these dark components have remained shrouded in
mystery. In addition, even the five percent of ordinary matter in our Universe
has yet to be understood, since the Standard Model of particle physics lacks
any consistent explanation for the predominance of matter over antimatter.
Inspired by these central problems of modern physics, we present here a direct
search for interactions of antimatter with dark matter, and place direct
constraints on the interaction of ultra-light axion-like particles $-$ one of
the dark-matter candidates $-$ and antiprotons. If antiprotons exhibit a
stronger coupling to these dark-matter particles than protons, such a CPT-odd
coupling could provide a link between dark matter and the baryon asymmetry in
the Universe. We analyse spin-flip resonance data acquired with a single
antiproton in a Penning trap [Smorra et al., Nature 550, 371 (2017)] in the
frequency domain to search for spin-precession effects from ultra-light axions
with a characteristic frequency governed by the mass of the underlying
particle. Our analysis constrains the axion-antiproton interaction parameter
$f_a/C_{\overline{p}}$ to values greater than $0.1$ to $0.6$ GeV in the mass
range from $2 \times 10^{-23}$ to $4 \times 10^{-17}\,$eV/$c^2$, improving over
astrophysical antiproton bounds by up to five orders of magnitude. In addition,

variables) in order to work also with the Hopfield model (i.e., a pairwise
mean-field neural-network whose couplings are drawn according to Hebb's
learning rule): this is accomplished by grafting Guerra's telescopic averages
on the transport equation technique, recently developed by some of the Authors.
As an overture, we apply the technique to solve the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick
model with i.i.d. Gaussian couplings centered at $J_0$ and with finite variance
$J$; the mean $J_0$ plays the role of a signal to be detected in a noisy
environment tuned by $J$, hence making this model a natural test-case to be
investigated before addressing the Hopfield model. For both the models, an
explicit expression of their quenched free energy in terms of their natural
order parameters is obtained at the K-th step (K arbitrary, but finite) of
replica-symmetry-breaking. In particular, for the Hopfield model, by assuming

  We begin by characterizing the key access structures that make private index
coding feasible. We also give conditions to check if a given linear scheme is a
valid private index code. For up to three users, we characterize the rate
region of feasible server transmission and key rates, and show that all
feasible rates can be achieved using scalar linear coding and time sharing; we

of users and seen as a generalized version of the well-known polymatroidal
bounds for the standard non-private index coding. We also show that the
presence of common randomness and private randomness does not change the rate
region. Furthermore, we study the case where no keys are shared among the users
and provide some necessary and sufficient conditions for feasibility in this
setting under a weaker notion of privacy. If the server has the ability to
multicast to any subset of users, we demonstrate how this flexibility can be
used to provide privacy and characterize the minimum number of server
multicasts required.

analyzing the angular momentum geometry of the collective rotor,

the conclusion that the rotor angular momentum is $R\simeq 2$. Furthermore, the

parallel to each other. The negative values of the static quadrupole moment
over the entire spin region are caused by an alignment of the total angular

between the wobbling and yrast band originate from a wobbling excitation with

widely applied to study the spatial accessibility of workers to job
opportunities in cities. However, gravity-based measures often suffer from
three main limitations: (1) they are sensitive to the spatial configuration and
scale of the units of analysis, which are not specifically designed for
capturing job accessibility patterns and are often too coarse; (2) they omit
the temporal dynamics of job opportunities and workers in the calculation,
instead assuming that they remain stable over time; and (3) they do not lend
themselves to dynamic geovisualization techniques. In this paper, a new
methodological framework for measuring and visualizing place-based job
accessibility in space and time is presented that overcomes these three
limitations. First, discretization and dasymetric mapping approaches are used
to disaggregate counts of jobs and workers over specific time intervals to a
fine-scale grid. Second, Shen (1998) gravity-based accessibility measure is
modified to account for temporal fluctuations in the spatial distributions of
the supply of jobs and the demand of workers and is used to estimate hourly job
accessibility at each cell. Third, a four-dimensional volumetric rendering
approach is employed to integrate the hourly job access estimates into a
space-time cube environment, which enables the users to interactively visualize
the space-time job accessibility patterns. The integrated framework is
demonstrated in the context of a case study of the Tampa Bay region of Florida.
The findings demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology in job

computer vision applications, which have made progress with deep CNNs. Most of

an independent input and fuse the features with RGB information. Taking the
advantages of RGB and RGBD methods, we propose a novel depth-aware salient

takes the depth information as training data while only relies on RGB
information in the testing phase. 2) It comprehensively optimizes SOD features
with multi-level depth-aware regularizations. 3) The depth information also
serves as error-weighted map to correct the segmentation process. With these
insightful designs combined, we make the first attempt in realizing an unified
depth-aware framework with only RGB information as input for inference, which
not only surpasses the state-of-the-art performances on five public RGB SOD

highly affected by transportation network closures that occur during and after

coupled with infrastructure vulnerability models to explore how spatial
accessibility to goods and services shifts after a hurricane. Models that
explore spatial accessibility to health services are particularly lacking. This
study provides a framework to examine how the disruption of transportation
networks during and after a hurricane can impact a residents ability to access
health services over time. Two different bridge closure conditions, inundation
and structural failure, along with roadway inundation are used to quantify
post-hurricane accessibility at short- and long-term temporal scales.
Inundation may close a bridge for hours or days, but a structural failure may
close a route for weeks or months. Both forms of closure are incorporated using
probabilistic vulnerability models coupled with GIS-based models to assess
spatial accessibility in the aftermath of a coastal hazard. Harris County, an
area in Southeastern Texas prone to coastal hazards, is used as a case study.
The results indicate changes in the accessibility scores of specific areas

revealing the populations most likely to suffer from lack of accessibility.
Overall, the presented framework helps to understand how both short-term

with the variations in size of the lesion make the quantitation even more
difficult. One of the ways to improve the quantitation is via post

Filter (BF) and Nonlinear Diffusion Filter (NDF) are the alternatives to GF
that can improve the SNR without degrading the image resolution. However, the
performance of these edge preserving methods are only optimum for high count

nonlinear diffusion filter (GVOF) is proposed in this paper that is insensitive
to statistical fluctuations (e. g., SNR, contrast, size etc.). GVOF method
applied on the PET images collected with the NEMA phantom with varying levels
of contrast and noise reveals that the GVOF method provides the highest SNR,
CNR (contrast-to-noise ratio) and resolution compared to the original and other
filtered images. The percentage bias in estimating the maximum activity
representing SUVmax (Maximum Standardized Uptake Value) for the spheres with
diameter > 2cm where the partial volume effects (PVE) is negligible is the
lowest for the GVOF method. The GVOF method also improves the maximum intensity
reproducibility. Robustness of the GVOF against variation in sizes, contrast
levels and SNR makes it a suitable post filtering method for both accurate

accurate quantitative measurements irrespective of the SNR, it can also be

a novel sample data set partition strategy is first adopted, which is the basis

matrix theory, the Lagrangian multipliers are proved to be piecewise linear

Finally, eight kinds of events are defined to seek for the starting event for
the next iteration. Extensive experimental results on nine UCI data sets show

statistical models, rate-optimal estimators balance squared bias and variance.
Although this balancing is widely observed, little is known whether methods
exist that could avoid the trade-off between bias and variance. We propose a
general strategy to obtain lower bounds on the variance of any estimator with
bias smaller than a prespecified bound. This shows to which extent the
bias-variance trade-off is unavoidable and allows to quantify the loss of
performance for methods that do not obey it. The approach is based on a number
of abstract lower bounds for the variance involving the change of expectation
with respect to different probability measures as well as information measures
such as the Kullback-Leibler or $\chi^2$-divergence. In a second part of the
article, the abstract lower bounds are applied to several statistical models
including the Gaussian white noise model, a boundary estimation problem, the
Gaussian sequence model and the high-dimensional linear regression model. For
these specific statistical applications, different types of bias-variance
trade-offs occur that vary considerably in their strength. For the trade-off
between integrated squared bias and integrated variance in the Gaussian white
noise model, we propose to combine the general strategy for lower bounds with a
reduction technique. This allows us to reduce the original problem to a lower
bound on the bias-variance trade-off for estimators with additional symmetry
properties in a simpler statistical model. In the Gaussian sequence model,
different phase transitions of the bias-variance trade-off occur. Although
there is a non-trivial interplay between bias and variance, the rate of the
squared bias and the variance do not have to be balanced in order to achieve
the minimax estimation rate.

both for national security and broader societal well bring. COVID19 has
presented a test to the current system, as well as means by which to explore
whether the UK's food supply chain will be resilient to future disruptions. In
the face of a growing need to ensure that food supply is more environmentally
sustainable and socially just, COVOD19 also represents an opportunity to
consider the ability of the system to innovative, and its capacity for change.
The purpose of this case based study is to explore the response and resilience
of the UK fruit and vegetable food supply chain to COVID19, and to assess this
empirical evidence in the context of a resilience framework based on the
adaptive cycle. To achieve this we reviewed secondary data associated with
changes to retail demand, conducted interviews with 23 organisations associated
with supply to this market, and conducted four video workshops with 80
organisations representing half of the UK fresh produce community. The results
highlight that, despite significant disruption, the retail dominated fresh food
supply chain has demonstrated a high degree of resilience. In the context of
the adaptive cycle, the system has shown signs of being stuck in a rigidity
trap, as yet unable to exploit more radical innovations that may also assist in
addressing other drivers for change. This has highlighted the significant role
that innovation and R&D communities will need to play in enabling the supply
chain to imagine and implement alternative future states post COVID.

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 had been sequenced and structurally annotated, yet
little is known of the intrinsic organization and evolution of the genome. To
this end, we present a mathematical method for the genomic spectrum, a kind of

constructed according to the periodic distributions of nucleotides, and
therefore reflects the unique characteristics of the genome. The results
demonstrate that coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 exhibits dinucleotide TT islands in the

regions suggests that the dinucleotide repeats are increased during evolution
and may confer the evolutionary fitness of the virus. The special dinucleotide

increase either continuously or by jumps, and will contribute towards the
investor's overall impatience when breaching the investor's private tolerance
level. We investigate the unusual reactions of investors when aiming to sell an
asset under such adverse market conditions. Mathematically, we study the
optimal stopping of the utility of an asset sale with a random discounting that
captures the investor's overall impatience. The random discounting is given by
the cumulative amount of time spent by the drawdowns in an undesirable high
region, fine tuned by the investor's personal tolerance and anxiety about
drawdowns. We prove that in addition to the traditional take-profit sales, the
real-life employed stop-loss orders and trailing stops may become part of the

three different approaches for manipulating the distribution of data collected

durations of the episodes in which they were originally experienced. Secondly,
Prioritized Experience Replay is applied within the ExIt framework, to
prioritise sampling experience from which we expect to obtain valuable training
signals. Thirdly, a trained exploratory policy is used to diversify the
trajectories experienced in self-play. This paper summarises the effects of
these manipulations on training performance evaluated in fourteen different

improves the energy efficiency and decreases greenhouse gas emission. However,
several studies over the world imply that the result was in the opposite way

availability and load. Under the situation, coal power plants are forced to
cycle while they are not designed to do so. To prevent this unwanted result
from occurring, a unit commitment decision should include the use of fuel and
the emission rate during the ramp up/down process. This paper proposes a new
unit commitment decision process to accommodate the economic and the
environmental costs associated with the ramping process. The costs are, in
general, not convex because there is positive cost if a generator output
changes significantly regardless of directions. As a result, the problem might
be nonconvex. A piece-wise linear cost curve is introduced to model the impact
of ramping processes. With the curve, a convex linear programming is
formulated, and the impact of a governmental policy is discussed.

information, termed status updates, to their corresponding destinations in a
time-slotted fashion. We employ Age of information (AoI) for quantifying the
freshness of the status updates measured at the destination nodes for two
different queuing disciplines, namely Type I and II queues. Type I queue is
assumed to transmit the status updates in a first-come-first-served (FCFS)
fashion with no storage facility. However, Type I queue may not necessarily
minimize AoI because a new update will not be allowed to enter a server until
the current update has been successfully transmitted. To overcome this
shortcoming, we consider Type II queue in which the most recent status update
available at a given transmission slot is transmitted in order to minimize the
AoI. As the update delivery rate for a given link is a function of the
interference field seen from the receiver, the temporal mean AoI can be treated
as a random variable over space. Our goal in this paper is to characterize the
spatial distribution of the mean AoI observed by the SD pairs by modeling them
as a Poisson bipolar process. Towards this objective, we first derive accurate
bounds on the moments of success probability while efficiently capturing the
interference-induced coupling in the activities of the SD pairs. Using this
result, we then derive tight bounds on the moments as well as the spatial
distribution of peak AoI. Our numerical results verify our analytical findings

structures that vary in period and orientation so that rays obey Bragg's law
over the entire lens aperture and give rise to constructive interference at the
focus. Here the analysis method of ray-tracing of thick diffractive optical
elements is applied to such lenses to optimise their designs and to investigate
their operating and manufacturing tolerances. Expressions are provided of the
fourth-order series expansions of the wavefront aberrations and transmissions
of both axi-symmetric lenses and pairs of crossed lenses that each focuses in
only one dimension like a cylindrical lens. We find that aplanatic zone-plate
designs, whereby aberrations are corrected over a large field of view, can be
achieved by axi-symmetric lenses but not the crossed lenses. We investigate the
performance of 1 nm-resolution lenses with focal lengths of about 1 mm and show
their fields of view are mainly limited by the acceptance angle of Bragg
diffraction, and that aberrations can limit the performance of lenses with
longer focal lengths. We apply the ray-tracing formalism for a tolerancing
analysis of imperfect lenses and examine some strategies for the correction of
their aberrations.

Exploiting the reconfigurable property of district heating networks (DHNs)
provides a cost-effective solution to enhance the flexibility of the power

considering combined electricity and reconfigurable heating network (UC-CERHN)
is proposed to coordinate the day-ahead scheduling of power system and DHS. The
DHS is formulated as a nonlinear and mixed-integer model with considering the
reconfigurable DHN. Also, an auxiliary energy flow variable is introduced in
the formed DHS model to make the commitment problem tractable, where the
computational burdens are significantly reduced. Extensive case studies are
presented to validate the effectiveness of the approximated model and

calculated the radiative correction to the Casimir energy for massive and
massless Lorentz-violating scalar field constrained with Dirichlet boundary
condition between two parallel plates in d spatial dimensions. In the
calculation procedure, to remove infinities appearing in the vacuum energies,
the box subtraction scheme supplemented by the cutoff regularization technique
and analytic continuation technique were employed. Normally, in the box
subtraction scheme, two similar configurations are defined and their vacuum
energies are subtracted from each other in the appropriate limits. Our final
results regarding all spatial dimensions were convergent and consistent with
the expected physical basis. We further plotted the Casimir energy density for
the time-like and space-like Lorentz-violating systems in a number of odd and
even dimensions; multiple aspects of the obtained results were ultimately

policies by approximating the mappings from environmental parameters to

are hard to obtain, unsupervised deep learning has been proposed to solve
functional optimization problems with statistical constraints recently.
However, most existing problems in wireless communications are variable
optimizations, and many problems are with instantaneous constraints. In this
paper, we establish a unified framework of using unsupervised deep learning to
solve both kinds of problems with both instantaneous and statistic constraints.
For a constrained variable optimization, we first convert it into an equivalent
functional optimization problem with instantaneous constraints. Then, to ensure
the instantaneous constraints in the functional optimization problems, we use
DNN to approximate the Lagrange multiplier functions, which is trained together
with a DNN to approximate the policy. We take two resource allocation problems
in ultra-reliable and low-latency communications as examples to illustrate how
to guarantee the complex and stringent quality-of-service (QoS) constraints

outperforms supervised learning in terms of QoS violation probability and
approximation accuracy of the optimal policy, and can converge rapidly with

for the design and simulation of these devices. Indeed, accurate and efficient
modeling of multiphysics processes and intricate device geometries of
nanostructured PCDs is challenging due to the high computational cost resulting
from multiple characteristic scales in time and space. In this work, a
discontinuous Galerkin (DG)-based unit-cell scheme for efficient simulation of
PCDs with periodic nanostructures is proposed. The scheme considers two
physical stages of the device and models them using two coupled systems: a
system of Poisson and drift-diffusion equations describing the nonequilibrium
steady state, and a system of Maxwell and drift-diffusion equations describing
the transient stage. A ""potential-drop"" boundary condition is enforced on the
opposing boundaries of the unit cell to mimic the effect of the bias voltage.
Periodic boundary conditions are used for carrier densities and electromagnetic
fields. The unit-cell model described by these coupled equations and boundary
conditions is discretized using DG methods. Numerical results demonstrate that
the proposed DG-based unit-cell scheme has the same accuracy in predicting the
THz photocurrent as the DG framework that takes into account the whole device,

existence of pair-instability supernovae (PISN). We argue that ground-based GW
detectors will be sensitive to BBHs with masses above this gap,
$\gtrsim120\,M_\odot$. With no detections, two years at upgraded sensitivity
(A+) would constrain the local merger rate of these BBHs on the ""far side"" of

Alternatively, with a few tens of events we could constrain the location of the
upper edge of the gap to the percent level. We consider the potential impact of
""interloper"" black holes within the PISN mass gap on this measurement. Far side
BBHs would also be observed by future instruments such as Cosmic Explorer (CE),
Einstein Telescope (ET) and LISA, and may dominate the fraction of multi-band
events. We show that by comparing observations from ground and space it is
possible to constrain the merger rate history. Moreover, we find that the upper
edge of the PISN mass gap leaves an imprint on the spectral shape of the
stochastic background of unresolved binaries, which may be accessible with A+
sensitivity. Finally, we show that by exploiting the upper edge of the gap,
these high-mass BBHs can be used as standard sirens to constrain the cosmic

upscaled by way of the so-called cell functions. In an effort to demonstrate

across neighborhoods of different income levels, this research analyzes
commuting variability (in both distance and time) across wage groups as well as
stability over time using the CTPP data 1990-2010 in Baton Rouge. In comparison
to previous work, commuting distance is estimated more accurately by Monte
Carlo simulation of individual trips to mitigate aggregation error and scale
effect. The results based on neighborhoods mean wage rate indicate that
commuting behaviors vary across areas of different wage rates and such
variability is captured by a convex shape. Affluent neighborhoods tended to
commute more but highest-wage neighborhoods retreated for less commuting. This
trend remains relatively stable over time despite an overall transportation
improvement in general. A complementary analysis based on the distribution of
wage groups is conducted to gain more detailed insights and uncovers the

by modeling dependencies in transactional data. Generally, two kinds of
dependencies considered are intra-transaction dependency and inter-transaction
dependency. Most existing TBRSs recommend next item by only modeling the
intra-transaction dependency within the current transaction while ignoring
inter-transaction dependency with recent transactions that may also affect the
next item. However, as not all recent transactions are relevant to the current
and next items, the relevant ones should be identified and prioritized. In this
paper, we propose a novel hierarchical attentive transaction embedding (HATE)
model to tackle these issues. Specifically, a two-level attention mechanism
integrates both item embedding and transaction embedding to build an attentive
context representation that incorporates both intraand inter-transaction
dependencies. With the learned context representation, HATE then recommends the
next item. Experimental evaluations on two real-world transaction datasets show
that HATE significantly outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods in terms of
recommendation accuracy.

component in developing large-scale conversational agent systems serving the
needs of real users. An widely used approach to tackle this is to collect human
annotation data and use them for evaluation or modeling. Human annotation based
approaches are easier to control, but hard to scale. A novel alternative
approach is to collect user's direct feedback via a feedback elicitation system
embedded to the conversational agent system, and use the collected user
feedback to train a machine-learned model for generalization. User feedback is
the best proxy for user satisfaction, but is not available for some ineligible
intents and certain situations. Thus, these two types of approaches are
complementary to each other. In this work, we tackle the user satisfaction
assessment problem with a hybrid approach that fuses explicit user feedback,
user satisfaction predictions inferred by two machine-learned models, one
trained on user feedback data and the other human annotation data. The hybrid
approach is based on a waterfall policy, and the experimental results with
Amazon Alexa's large-scale datasets show significant improvements in inferring
user satisfaction. A detailed hybrid architecture, an in-depth analysis on user
feedback data, and an algorithm that generates data sets to properly simulate

replication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by the fact
that the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various
antiviral activities and the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc.

accurate descriptions of the energy as a function of atomic coordinates. Here
we outline a new paradigm for deriving energy functions of hyperdimensional
molecular systems, which involves generating data for low-dimensional systems
in virtual reality (VR) to then efficiently train atomic neural networks
(ANNs). This generates high quality data for specific areas of interest within
the hyperdimensional space that characterizes a molecule's potential energy
surface (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this approach by gathering data
within VR to train ANNs on chemical reactions involving fewer than 8 heavy
atoms. This strategy enables us to predict the energies of much
higher-dimensional systems, e.g. containing nearly 100 atoms. Training on
datasets containing only 15K geometries, this approach generates mean absolute
errors around 2 kcal/mol. This represents one of the first times that an
ANN-PES for a large reactive radical has been generated using such a small
dataset. Our results suggest VR enables the intelligent curation of
high-quality data, which accelerates the learning process.
