reflected from a rough surface. It is due to light reflected from the surface's
many nooks and crannies accumulating vastly-discrepant time delays, spanning
much more than an optical period, en route to an observation point. Although
speckle with continuous-wave (cw) illumination is well understood, the emerging
interest in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging using coherent light has created
the need to understand the higher-order speckle that results from multiple
rough-surface reflections, viz., speckled speckle and speckled speckled
speckle. Moreover, the recent introduction of phasor-field
($\mathcal{P}$-field) NLoS imaging---which relies on amplitude-modulated
coherent illumination---requires pushing beyond cw scenarios for speckle and
higher-order speckle. In this paper, we take first steps in addressing the
foregoing needs using a three-diffuser transmissive geometry that is a proxy
for three-bounce NLoS imaging. In the small-diffusers limit, we show that the
irradiance variances of cw and modulated $n$th-order speckle coincide and are
$(2^n-1)$-times those of ordinary (first-order) speckle. The more important
case for NLoS imaging, however, involves extended diffuse reflectors. For our
transmissive geometry with extended diffusers, we treat third-order cw speckle
and first-order modulated speckle. Our results there imply that speckle is
unlikely to impede successful operation of coherent-illumination cw imagers,
and they suggest that the same might be true for $\mathcal{P}$-field imagers.

high-resolution numerical simulations of gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence that span
the proton-electron range of scales, in a straight magnetic guide field
geometry. Accounting for the averaged effect of the particles' fast gyro-motion
on the slow plasma fluctuations, the GK approximation captures the dominant
energy redistribution mechanisms in strongly magnetised plasma turbulence.
Here, the GK system is coarse-grained with respect to a cut-off scale,
separating in real space the contributions to the nonlinear interactions from
the coarse-grid-scales and the sub-grid-scales (SGS). We concentrate on the
analysis of nonlinear SGS effects. Not only that this allows us to investigate
the flux of free energy across the scales, but also to now analyse its spatial
density. We find that the net value of scale flux is an order of magnitude
smaller than both the positive and negative flux density contributions. The
dependence of the results on the filter type is also analysed. Moreover, we
investigate the advection of energy in position space. This rather novel
approach for GK turbulence can help in the development of SGS models that
account for advective unstable structures for space and fusion plasmas, and
with the analysis of the turbulent transport saturation.

moduli directions are ubiquitous in string theory, and could plausibly source

motivated by string theory, including single-field K\""ahler potentials for bulk
and local moduli, and leading superpotentials of the form $W = W_0 + A e^{-a

supergravity are very restrictive, ruling out e.g. quintessence with
$K=-n\ln(\Phi+\bar{\Phi})$ and $W = W_0+A \Phi^p$. Out of the examples
considered, one can simultaneously satisfy $V>0$ and $\epsilon_V<1$ only for a
deformation-like modulus with $K = k_0 + \frac{|\Phi|^{2n}}{k1}$ and a blow-up
like modulus with $K=k_0 +\frac{(\Phi+\bar{\Phi})^{2n}}{k_1}$ when the leading
order in the perturbative superpotential, $p$, is equal to $n$. We also review
the scenario of Thermal Dark Energy, where thermal effects in a light hidden
sector hold a scalar field up away from the minimum of its zero-temperature
potential. This provides a viable model of Dark Energy with $w=-1$, consistent
with known swampland conjectures, and motivates further early Thermal Dark

important research problem. While a number of studies proposed novel methods of
representing expertise within individual projects, these methods are difficult
to apply at an ecosystem level. However, with the focus of software development
shifting from monolithic to modular, a method of representing developers'
expertise in the context of the entire OSS development becomes necessary when,
for example, a project tries to find new maintainers and look for developers
with relevant skills. Aim: We aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing
and constructing the Skill Space where each API, developer, and project is
represented and postulate how the topology of this space should reflect what
developers know (and projects need). Method: we use the World of Code
infrastructure to extract the complete set of APIs in the files changed by open
source developers and, based on that data, employ Doc2Vec embeddings for vector
representations of APIs, developers, and projects. We then evaluate if these
embeddings reflect the postulated topology of the Skill Space by predicting
what new APIs/projects developers use/join, and whether or not their pull
requests get accepted. We also check how the developers' representations in the
Skill Space align with their self-reported API expertise. Result: Our results
suggest that the proposed embeddings in the Skill Space appear to satisfy the
postulated topology and we hope that such representations may aid in the
construction of signals that increase trust (and efficiency) of open source
ecosystems at large and may aid investigations of other phenomena related to
developer proficiency and learning.

the HOM dip, which would have been obtained through a standard delay-scanning,

in-gap edge states in pseudospin-1 materials without the conventional need of
band-inversion topological phase transitions or introducing magnetism via an
external magnetic type of interactions. In particular, we find that, in
two-dimensional gapped (insulating) Dirac systems of massive spin-1
quasiparticles, in-gap edge modes can emerge through only an {\em electrostatic
potential} applied to a finite domain. Associated with these unconventional
edge modes are spontaneous formation of pronounced domain-wall spin textures,
which exhibit the feature of out-of-plane spin-angular momentum locking on both
sides of the domain boundary and are quite robust against boundary deformations
and impurities despite a lack of an explicit topological origin. The in-gap
modes are formally three-component evanescent wave solutions, akin to the
Jackiw-Rebbi type of bound states. Such modes belong to a distinct class due to
the following physical reasons: three-component spinor wave function, unusual
boundary conditions, and a shifted flat band induced by the external scalar
potential. Not only is the finding of fundamental importance, but it also paves
the way for generating highly controllable in-gap edge states with emergent
spin textures using the traditional semiconductor gate technology. Results are
validated using analytic calculations of a continuum Dirac-Weyl model and
tight-binding simulations of realistic materials through characterizations of

  In this paper, we present a principle that we call Feature Purification,

accumulation of certain small dense mixtures in the hidden weights during the
training process of a neural network; and more importantly, one of the goals of
adversarial training is to remove such mixtures to purify hidden weights. We
present both experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle,

training a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly

to small adversarial perturbations of some radius. (2) Adversarial training,
even with an empirical perturbation algorithm such as FGM, can in fact be
provably robust against ANY perturbations of the same radius. Finally, we also

resulting predictions. In this context, we argue that non-oscillating power
spectra are optimal to gain observational access to those regimes near the
bounce where Loop Quantum Cosmology effects are non-negligible. In addition, we
show that non-oscillatory spectra can indeed be consistently obtained when the
evolution of the perturbations is ruled by the hyperbolic equations derived in
the hybrid loop quantization approach. Moreover, in the ultraviolet regime of
short wavelength scales we prove that there exists a unique asymptotic
expansion of the power spectrum that displays no scale-dependent oscillations
over time. This expansion would pick out the natural Poincar\'e and Bunch
Davies vacua in Minkowski and de Sitter spacetimes, respectively, and provides
an appealing candidate for the choice of a vacuum for the perturbations in Loop
Quantum Cosmology based on physical motivations.

the drag force is obtained using the standard load cell method, another type
where the drag force is estimated by measuring the pressure difference between
windward and the leeward facades. Results show that the drag force is nearly
uniformly distributed for lower lambdap (0.028 and 0.0625), it decreases up to
50% at the second row for lambdap=0.11, and it sharply decreases for larger
lambdap (from 0.25 to 0.69) where the force mostly acts on the first row. It
follows that for the lowest lambdap the drag force typically formulated as a
drag area corresponds to the total frontal area of the array, whereas for large
lambdap the drag area corresponds to the area of the first row. By assessing
the driving pressure for ventilation from the drag force, the analysis is

for graphs. However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to
carefully-crafted perturbations, called adversarial attacks. Adversarial
attacks can easily fool GNNs in making predictions for downstream tasks. The
vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised increasing concerns for
applying GNNs in safety-critical applications. Therefore, developing robust
algorithms to defend adversarial attacks is of great significance. A natural
idea to defend adversarial attacks is to clean the perturbed graph. It is
evident that real-world graphs share some intrinsic properties. For example,
many real-world graphs are low-rank and sparse, and the features of two
adjacent nodes tend to be similar. In fact, we find that adversarial attacks
are likely to violate these graph properties. Therefore, in this paper, we
explore these properties to defend adversarial attacks on graphs. In
particular, we propose a general framework Pro-GNN, which can jointly learn a
structural graph and a robust graph neural network model from the perturbed
graph guided by these properties. Extensive experiments on real-world graphs
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves significantly better
performance compared with the state-of-the-art defense methods, even when the
graph is heavily perturbed. We release the implementation of Pro-GNN to our

of the cosmological parameters inferred from these objects are affected by the

scaling relations, and the theoretical description of their mass and redshift
distribution, modelled by the mass function. In this work, we forecast the
impact of different modelling of these ingredients for clusters detected by
future optical and near-IR surveys. We consider the standard cosmological
scenario and the case with a time-dependent equation of state for dark energy.
We analyse the effect of increasing accuracy on the scaling relation
calibration, finding improved constraints on the cosmological parameters. This
higher accuracy exposes the impact of the mass function evaluation, which is a
subdominant source of systematics for current data. We compare two different
evaluations for the mass function. In both cosmological scenarios, the use of
different mass functions leads to biases in the parameter constraints. For the
$\Lambda$CDM model, we find a $1.6 \, \sigma$ shift in the
$(\Omega_m,\sigma_8)$ parameter plane and a discrepancy of $\sim 7 \, \sigma$
for the redshift evolution of the scatter of the scaling relations. For the
scenario with a time-evolving dark energy equation of state, the assumption of
different mass functions results in a $\sim 8 \, \sigma$ tension in the $w_0$
parameter. These results show the impact, and the necessity for a precise
modelling, of the interplay between the redshift evolution of the mass function
and of the scaling relations in the cosmological analysis of galaxy clusters.

analyze algorithms which are able to approximately compute solutions of

particular, it is very hard to develop approximation algorithms which do not
suffer under the curse of dimensionality in the sense that the number of
computational operations needed by the algorithm to compute an approximation of
accuracy $\epsilon > 0$ grows at most polynomially in both the reciprocal
$1/\epsilon$ of the required accuracy and the dimension $d \in \mathbb{N}$ of
the PDE. Recently, a new approximation method, the so-called full history
recursive multilevel Picard (MLP) approximation method, has been introduced
and, until today, this approximation scheme is the only approximation method in
the scientific literature which has been proven to overcome the curse of
dimensionality in the numerical approximation of semilinear PDEs with general
time horizons. It is a key contribution of this article to extend the MLP
approximation method to systems of semilinear PDEs and to numerically test it
on several example PDEs. More specifically, we apply the proposed MLP
approximation method in the case of Allen-Cahn PDEs, Sine-Gordon-type PDEs,
systems of coupled semilinear heat PDEs, and semilinear Black-Scholes PDEs in
up to 1000 dimensions. The presented numerical simulation results suggest in
the case of each of these example PDEs that the proposed MLP approximation
method produces very accurate results in short runtimes and, in particular, the

around a newly-formed black hole, involving accretion and rotation, via general
relativistic hydrodynamics simulations aimed at studying the conditions under
which infalling material can accrete without forming a centrifugally supported
structure and, as a result, generate no effective feedback. If the feedback
from the black hole is, on the other hand, significant, the collapse would be
halted and we suggest that the event is likely to be followed by a bright
transient. We find that feedback is only efficient if the specific angular
momentum of the infalling material at the innermost stable circular orbit
exceeds that of geodesic circular flow at that radius by at least $\approx
20\%$. We use the results of our simulations to constrain the maximal stellar
rotation rates of the disappearing massive progenitors PHL293B-LBV and

The key contribution of this article is the creation of a distributed
graph-SLAM map-building architecture responsive to bandwidth and computational
needs of the robotic platform. Responsiveness is afforded by the integration of
a 3D point cloud to plane cloud compression algorithm that approximates dense
3D point cloud using local planar patches. Compute bound platforms may restrict
the computational duration of the compression algorithm and low-bandwidth
platforms can restrict the size of the compression result. The backbone of the
approach is an ultra-fast adaptive 3D compression algorithm that transforms
swaths of 3D planar surface data into planar patches attributed with image
textures. Our approach uses DVO SLAM, a leading algorithm for 3D mapping, and
extends it by computationally isolating map integration tasks from local
Guidance, Navigation, and Control tasks and includes an addition of a network
protocol to share the compressed plane clouds. The joint effect of these
contributions allows agents with 3D sensing capabilities to calculate and
communicate compressed map information commensurate with their onboard
computational resources and communication channel capacities. This opens SLAM
mapping to new categories of robotic platforms that may have computational and
memory limits that prohibit other SLAM solutions.

quite general, we consider operators defined by partial differential equations

discretization, the model inherits several desirable attributes from this
infinite-dimensional viewpoint, including mesh-invariant approximation error
with respect to the true PDE solution map and the capability to be trained at
one mesh resolution and then deployed at different mesh resolutions. We view
the random feature model as a non-intrusive data-driven emulator, provide a
mathematical framework for its interpretation, and demonstrate its ability to
efficiently and accurately approximate the nonlinear parameter-to-solution maps

inversion between bands of opposite parity is accompanied by a spin
reorientation in the spin-texture along the contour of band crossing
surrounding the $\Gamma$ point and leads to a Chern insulator with $C$=-1, also
confirmed by the single edge state. Moreover, this Chern insulating phase shows
promising thermoelectric properties, e.g. a Seebeck coefficient between 400 and

i) the observed present time MNS rate in our Galaxy is well reproduced either
with a constant time delay or a distribution function $\propto t^{-1}$. The
[Eu/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation in the Milky Way can be well reproduced with only
MNS, if the time delay is short and constant. If the distribution function of

spirals are the main contributors to it. iii) The spirals are the major
contributors to the cosmic MNS at all redshifts in hierarchical scenarios. In
the pure luminosity evolution scenario, the spirals are the major contributors
locally, whereas at high redshift ellipticals dominate. iv) The predicted
cosmic MNS rate well agrees with the cosmic rate of short Gamma Ray Bursts if

(ISOs), observable by the future wide-field National Science Foundation Vera C.
Rubin Observatory (VRO). We generate synthetic population of ISOs and simulate
their ephemerides over a period of 10 years, in order to select those which may
be observed by the VRO, based on the nominal characteristics of this survey. We
find that the population of the observable ISOs should be significantly biased
in favor of retrograde objects. The intensity of this bias is correlated with
the slope of the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the population, as well
as with the perihelion distances. Steeper SFD slopes lead to an increased
fraction of the retrograde orbits, and also of the median orbital inclination.
On the other hand, larger perihelion distances result in more symmetric
distribution of orbital inclinations. We believe that this is a result of the
Holetschek effects, which is already suggested to cause observational bias in
orbital distribution of long period comets. The most important implication of
our findings is that an excess of retrograde orbits depends on the sizes and
the perihelion distances. Therefore, the prograde/retrograde orbits ratio and
the median inclination of the discovered population could, in turn, be used to
estimate the SFD of the underlying true population of ISOs.

X-ray observations of the host star with Chandra and ROSAT to measure the

the stellar activity evolution together with exoplanetary mass loss to estimate
the possible evolution of the planets. We find that V1298 Tau is X-ray bright

9$ MK. This places the star amongst the more X-ray luminous ones at this

find that it depends sensitively on the possible evolutionary spin-down tracks
of the star as well as on the current planetary densities. Assuming the planets
are of low density due to their youth, we find that the innermost two planets
can lose significant parts of their gaseous envelopes, and could be evaporated
down to their rocky cores depending on the stellar spin evolution. However, if
the planets are heavier and follow the mass-radius relation of older planets,
then even in the highest XUV irradiation scenario none of the planets is
expected to cross the radius gap into the rocky regime until the system reaches

Empirically, we introduce an optimizable metric to quantify each property.
Extensive experiments on standard vision and language datasets confirm the

mild proliferation of the associated violation. Furthermore, we characterize
the influence of immobile and mobile defects by monitoring the spread of
entanglement entropy. Overall, our results indicate that the aforementioned

The TESS light curve shows two different photometric periods. The variability
is dominated by a sinusoidal signal with a period of 11.98 hr, presumably
caused by stellar rotation. Also present is a 10.76 hr signal consisting of a
not-quite sinusoid interrupted by hour-long dips, the type of signal previously

to be detected by pulsar timing arrays in the next few years. While they are a
promising source for multimessenger observations as binary AGN, few convincing
candidates have been identified in electromagnetic surveys. One approach to
identifying candidates has been through spectroscopic surveys searching for
offsets or time-dependent offsets of broad emission lines (BLs), which may be
characteristic of Doppler shifts from binary orbital motion. In this study, we
predict the parameter space of MBH binaries that should be kinematically
detectable. There is a delicate trade-off between requiring binary separations
to be large enough for BL regions to remain attached to one of the AGN, but
also small enough such that their orbital velocity is detectable. We find that
kinematic signatures are only observable for the lower-mass secondary AGN, for
binaries with total-masses above about $10^8 M_\odot$, and separations between
0.1 and 1 pc. We motivate our usage of a kinematic-offset sensitivity of $10^3$
km/s, and a sensitivity to changing offsets of $10^2$ km/s. With these
parameters, and an Eddington ratio of 0.1, we find that 0.5% of binaries have
detectable offsets, and only 0.03% have detectable velocity changes. Overall,
kinematic binary signatures should be expected in fewer than one in $10^4$ AGN.
Better characterizing the intrinsic variability of BLs is crucial to
understanding and vetting MBH binary candidates. This requires multi-epoch
spectroscopy of large populations of AGN over a variety of timescales.

axion wind coupling to the electron spin), can cover the difficult-to-reach

or magnon modes that can couple to the axion field is crucial, suggesting a
program to search for a range of materials with different resonant energies and
excitation selection rules; we outline the rules and discuss a few candidate
targets, leaving a more exhaustive search for future work. Ongoing development
of single photon, phonon and magnon detectors will provide the key for
experimentally realizing the ideas presented here.

Krylov space time evolution technique, we calculate these two different norms
of such commutators for the spin 1/2 Heisenberg chain with interactions
decaying as a power law $1/r^\alpha$ with distance $r$. Our numerical analysis
shows that both norms (operator norm and normalized Frobenius norm) exhibit the
same asymptotic behavior, namely a linear growth in time at short times and a
power law decay in space at long distance, leading asymptotically to power law
light cones for $\alpha<1$ and to linear light cones for $\alpha>1$. The
asymptotic form of the tails of $C(r,t)\propto t/r^\alpha$ is described by
short time perturbation theory which is valid at short times and long

chiral spiral includes only one mode, characterized by a momentum $k_0
\hat{z}$, then in perturbation theory at nonzero temperature the propagator for
the static mode has a double pole when $\vec{k}^2 = k_0^2$. We conjecture that
since chiral spirals spontaneously break both global and spacetime symmetries,
that such double poles are a universal property of their static transverse
modes. Fluctuations from double poles generate linear infrared divergences in
any number of spatial dimensions and disorder the condensate of chiral spirals,
analogous to a type of quantum spin liquid. The characteristic feature of this
region is that over large spatial distances the two point function is the usual
exponential times an oscillatory function. We prove this at large $N$ and

galaxy evolution, as any contribution of recycling to galaxy growth is largely
degenerate with the inflow rates of first-time infalling material, and the
rates with which outflowing gas and metals are driven from galaxies. We present
measurements of the efficiency of wind recycling from the EAGLE cosmological
simulation project, leveraging the statistical power of large-volume
simulations that reproduce a realistic galaxy population. We study wind
recycling at the halo scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected beyond the halo
virial radius, and at the galaxy scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected from the
ISM to at least $\approx 10 \, \%$ of the virial radius (thus excluding
smaller-scale galactic fountains). Galaxy-scale wind recycling is generally
inefficient, with a characteristic return timescale that is comparable or
longer than a Hubble time, and with an efficiency that clearly peaks at the
characteristic halo mass of $M_{200} = 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$.
Correspondingly, the majority of gas being accreted onto galaxies in EAGLE is
infalling for the first time. At the halo scale, the efficiency of recycling
onto haloes differs by orders of magnitude from values assumed by semi-analytic
galaxy formation models. Differences in the efficiency of wind recycling with
other hydrodynamical simulations are currently difficult to assess, but are
likely smaller. We are able to show that the fractional contribution of wind
recycling to galaxy growth is smaller in EAGLE than in some other simulations.
We find that cumulative first-time gas accretion rates at the virial radius are
reduced relative to the expectation from dark matter accretion for haloes with
mass, $M_{200} < 10^{12} \, \mathrm{M_\odot}$, indicating efficient
preventative feedback on halo scales.

`main cluster'; (ii) the remnant of an older merger in the east of the cluster
with a ~ 600 kpc long tail; (iii) a bright, bullet-like, low-entropy infalling
system, with a large line-of-sight velocity component. The low-entropy system
displays a 250 kpc long cold front with a break and an intriguing surface
brightness decrement. Interestingly, the infalling gas is not co-spatial with
bright galaxies and the radio loud brightest cluster galaxy of the infalling
group appears dissociated from the low entropy plasma by 50 kpc in projection,
to the south of the eastern edge of the cold front. Assuming that the dark
matter follows the galaxy distribution, we predict that it is also
significantly offset from the low-entropy gas. Part of the low frequency radio
emission near the cold front might be revived by magnetic field amplification
due to differential gas motions. Using analytical models and numerical
simulations, we investigate the possibility that the supersonic infall of the
subcluster generates a large scale shock along our line-of-sight, which can be
detected in the X-ray temperature map but is not associated with any clear
features in the surface brightness distribution.

quantized invariants of (2+1)D Abelian topological orders with symmetry group
$G = U(1) \times G_{\text{space}}$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ consists of
orientation-preserving space group symmetries on the lattice. We show how
discrete rotational and translational symmetry fractionalization can be
characterized by a discrete spin vector, a discrete torsion vector which has no
analog in the continuum or in the absence of lattice rotation symmetry, and an
area vector, which also has no analog in the continuum. The discrete torsion
vector implies a type of crystal momentum fractionalization that is only
non-trivial for $2$, $3$, and $4$-fold rotation symmetry. The quantized
topological response theory includes a discrete version of the shift, which
binds fractional charge to disclinations and corners, a fractionally quantized
angular momentum of disclinations, rotationally symmetric fractional charge
polarization and its angular momentum counterpart, constraints on charge and
angular momentum per unit cell, and quantized momentum bound to dislocations
and units of area. The fractionally quantized charge polarization, which is
non-trivial only on a lattice with $2$, $3$, and $4$-fold rotation symmetry,
implies a fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and a fractional
charge per unit length along the boundary. An important role is played by a
finite group grading on Burgers vectors, which depends on the point group

efficacy of supervised learning may be limited by the size of the human
annotated dataset. This limitation is particularly notable for image
segmentation tasks, where the expense of human annotation is especially large,
yet large amounts of unlabeled data may exist. In this work, we ask if we may
leverage semi-supervised learning in unlabeled video sequences and extra images
to improve the performance on urban scene segmentation, simultaneously tackling
semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The goal of this work is to
avoid the construction of sophisticated, learned architectures specific to
label propagation (e.g., patch matching and optical flow). Instead, we simply
predict pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and train subsequent models with
both human-annotated and pseudo-labeled data. The procedure is iterated for
several times. As a result, our Naive-Student model, trained with such simple
yet effective iterative semi-supervised learning, attains state-of-the-art
results at all three Cityscapes benchmarks, reaching the performance of 67.8%

the fact that, for a given value of the dimensionless black-hole electric

the critical existence-line of the composed black-hole-massive-field system, a

magnetic fields naturally play a part in shaping the evolution of galaxies.
Galactic magnetic fields can originate from strong primordial magnetic fields
provided these latter remain below current observational upper limits. To
understand how such magnetic fields would affect the global morphological and
dynamical properties of galaxies, we use a suite of high-resolution constrained
transport magneto-hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations where we vary the
initial magnetic field strength and configuration along with the prescription
for stellar feedback. We find that strong primordial magnetic fields delay the
onset of star formation and drain the rotational support of the galaxy,
diminishing the radial size of the galactic disk and driving a higher amount of
gas towards the centre. This is also reflected in mock UVJ observations by an
increase in the light profile concentration of the galaxy. We explore the
possible mechanisms behind such a reduction in angular momentum, focusing on
magnetic braking. Finally, noticing that the effects of primordial magnetic
fields are amplified in the presence of stellar feedback, we briefly discuss
whether the changes we measure would also be expected for galactic magnetic
fields of non-primordial origin.

an intrinsic ratio $^{13}$C/$^{18}$O = 8.4, from a combination of selective
photodissociation and enhancement of \coth. The observations are understandable

which the observed \coth\ forms via endothermic carbon isotope exchange with
$^{13}$C\p. \WCS/\WCO\ increases abruptly for \WCO\ $\ga 10$ K-\kms\ and
\WCS/\Whcop\ is bimodal, showing two branches having N(CS)/N(\hcop) $\approx 5$

between \hcop\ and ambient electrons, comparison of the CO and \hcop\ emission
shows that the CO hotspots are small regions of enhanced N(CO) occupying only a
small fraction of the column density of the medium in which they are embedded.
\hcop/CO and HCN/CO brightness ratios are 1-2\% with obvious implications for

spectral signatures from structures at cosmological redshifts, particularly of
neutral Hydrogen using its characteristic 21 cm spectral line. Due to the very
high dynamic range needed to isolate these faint spectral fluctuations from the
very bright foregrounds, spectral systematics from the instrument or the
analysis, rather than thermal noise, are currently limiting their sensitivity.
Failure to achieve a spectral calibration with fractional inaccuracy $\lesssim
10^{-5}$ will make the detection of the critical cosmic signal unlikely. The
bispectrum phase from interferometric measurements is largely immune to this
calibration issue. We present a basis to explore the nature of bispectrum phase
in the limit of small spectral fluctuations. We establish that they measure the
intrinsic dissimilarity in the transverse structure of the cosmic signal
relative to the foregrounds, expressed as rotations in the underlying phase
angle. Their magnitude is related to the strength of the cosmic signal relative
to the foregrounds. Using a range of sky models, we detail the behavior of
bispectrum phase fluctuations using standard Fourier-domain techniques and find
it comparable to existing approaches, with a few key differences. Mode-mixed
foreground contamination is more pronounced than in existing approaches because
the bispectrum phase is a product of three individual interferometric phases.
The multiplicative coupling of foregrounds in the bispectrum phase fluctuations
results in the mixing of foreground signatures with that of the cosmic signal.
We briefly outline a variation of this approach to avoid extensive mode-mixing.
Despite its limitations, the interpretation of results using bispectrum phase
is possible with forward-modeling. Importantly, it is an independent and a
viable alternative to existing approaches.

redshifted 21 cm line of neutral Hydrogen (HI) is critical to modern
astrophysics and cosmology, and thus a key science goal of many current and
planned low-frequency radio telescopes. The primary challenge to detecting this
signal is the overwhelmingly bright foreground emission at these frequencies,
placing stringent requirements on the knowledge of the instruments and
inaccuracies in analyses. Results from these experiments have largely been
limited not by thermal sensitivity but by systematics, particularly caused by
the inability to calibrate the instrument to high accuracy. The interferometric
bispectrum phase is immune to antenna-based calibration and errors therein, and
presents an independent alternative to detect the EoR HI fluctuations while
largely avoiding calibration systematics. Here, we provide a demonstration of
this technique on a subset of data from the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization
Array (HERA) to place approximate constraints on the brightness temperature of
the intergalactic medium (IGM). From this limited data, at $z=7.7$ we infer
""$1\sigma$"" upper limits on the IGM brightness temperature to be $\le 316$
""pseudo"" mK at $\kappa_\parallel=0.33$ ""pseudo"" $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (data-limited)
and $\le 1000$ ""pseudo"" mK at $\kappa_\parallel=0.875$ ""pseudo"" $h$ Mpc$^{-1}$
(noise-limited). The ""pseudo"" units denote only an approximate and not an exact
correspondence to the actual distance scales and brightness temperatures. By
propagating models in parallel to the data analysis, we confirm that the
dynamic range required to separate the cosmic HI signal from the foregrounds is
similar to that in standard approaches, and the power spectrum of the
bispectrum phase is still data-limited (at $\gtrsim 10^6$ dynamic range)
indicating scope for further improvement in sensitivity as the array build-out
continues.

muonium-antimuonium oscillations. This process violates muon lepton number by
two units and could be sensitive to the types of BSM physics that are not

However, in the Standard-Model (SM) this process is also known to suffer from
very large irreducible backgrounds from other Higgs production channels,
notably gluon-fusion ($gg$F). In this paper we calculate for the first time the
so-called QCD and electroweak complete-NLO predictions for $H b \bar b$

the rates of these backgrounds are very large with respect to the ""genuine"" and
$y_b$-dependent $H b \bar b$ production mode. In particular, no suppression
occurs at the differential level and therefore backgrounds survive typical
analysis cuts. This fact further jeopardises the chances of measuring at the
LHC the $y_b$-dependent component of $H b \bar b$ production in the SM.
Especially, unless $y_b$ is significantly enlarged by new physics, even for

non-perturbative effects, if sufficiently large, can introduce steep cliffs and
gentle plateaus onto the underlying scalar potential. During inflation, the
motion of a spectator axion $\sigma$ on this potential becomes temporarily
fast, leading to localized amplification of one helicity state of gauge fields.
In this model, the tensor and scalar correlators sourced by the vector fields
exhibit localized peak(s) in momentum space corresponding to the modes that
exit the horizon while the roll of $\sigma$ is fast. Thanks to the
gravitational coupling of gauge fields with the visible sector and the
localized nature of particle production, this model can generate observable
gravitational waves (GWs) at CMB scales while satisfying the current limits on
scalar perturbations. The resulting GW signal breaks parity and exhibit
sizeable non-Gaussianity that can be probed by future CMB B-mode missions.
Depending on the initial conditions and model parameters, the roll of the
spectator axion can also generate an observably large GW signature at
interferometer scales while respecting the bounds on the scalar fluctuations
from primordial black hole limits. In our analysis, we carefully investigate
bounds on the model parameters that arise through back-reaction and
perturbativity considerations to show that these limits are satisfied by the

translation (NMT) systems. Hypotheses explaining these mostly suggest there is
something fundamentally wrong with NMT as a model or its training algorithm,
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Most of this evidence was gathered using
maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoding, a decision rule aimed at identifying the
highest-scoring translation, i.e. the mode. We argue that the evidence
corroborates the inadequacy of MAP decoding more than casts doubt on the model
and its training algorithm. In this work, we show that translation
distributions do reproduce various statistics of the data well, but that beam
search strays from such statistics. We show that some of the known pathologies
and biases of NMT are due to MAP decoding and not to NMT's statistical
assumptions nor MLE. In particular, we show that the most likely translations
under the model accumulate so little probability mass that the mode can be
considered essentially arbitrary. We therefore advocate for the use of decision
rules that take into account the translation distribution holistically. We show
that an approximation to minimum Bayes risk decoding gives competitive results
confirming that NMT models do capture important aspects of translation well in
expectation.

three main issues. First, due to computational time, standard SA techniques
cannot be directly applied on the simulator. Second, the output is infinite
dimensional, or at least high dimensional if the output is discretized. Third,
the spatial output is non-stationary and exhibits strong local variations. We
show that all these issues can be addressed all together by using functional
PCA (FPCA). We first specify a functional basis, such as wavelets or B-splines,
designed to handle local variations. Secondly, we select the most influential
basis terms, either with an energy criterion after basis orthonormalization, or
directly on the original basis with a penalized regression approach. Then FPCA
further reduces dimension by doing PCA on the most influential basis
coefficients, with an ad-hoc metric. Finally, fast-to-evaluate metamodels are
built on the few selected principal components. They provide a proxy on which
SA can be done. As a by-product, we obtain analytical formulas for

currently limits the sensitivity of all the gravitational wave observatories at

vacuum states of light at the GEO\,600 observatory and demonstrate for the
first time a reduction of quantum noise up to $6.03 \pm 0.02$ dB in a
kilometer-scale interferometer. This is equivalent at high frequencies to
increasing the laser power circulating in the interferometer by a factor of
four. Achieving this milestone, a key goal for the upgrades of the advanced
detectors, required a better understanding of the noise sources and losses, and
implementation of robust control schemes to mitigate their contributions. In
particular, we address the optical losses from beam propagation, phase noise
from the squeezing ellipse, and backscattered light from the squeezed light

insight towards the implementation of 10 dB of squeezing envisioned for
third-generation gravitational wave detectors.

maintaining data privacy, aka Privacy-preserving Machine Learning~(PPML), is an
emergent field of research. Recently, PPML has seen a visible shift towards the
adoption of the Secure Outsourced Computation~(SOC) paradigm due to the heavy
computation that it entails. In the SOC paradigm, computation is outsourced to
a set of powerful and specially equipped servers that provide service on a
pay-per-use basis. In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for
a range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the
users irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable
feature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service.
  At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure,
three-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output
delivery (GOD) in the honest-majority setting. To the best of our knowledge,
SWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting.
SWIFT is as fast as (and is strictly better in some cases than) the best-known
3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al. NDSS'20), which only achieves fairness. We
extend our 3PC framework for four parties (4PC). In this regime, SWIFT is as
fast as the best known fair 4PC framework Trident (Chaudhari et al. NDSS'20)
and twice faster than the best-known robust 4PC framework FLASH (Byali et al.
PETS'20).
  We demonstrate our framework's practical relevance by benchmarking popular ML
algorithms such as Logistic Regression and deep Neural Networks such as VGG16
and LeNet, both over a 64-bit ring in a WAN setting. For deep NN, our results
testify to our claims that we provide improved security guarantee while
incurring no additional overhead for 3PC and obtaining 2x improvement for 4PC.

computation requirements for successful training. One proposed solution to this
problem is training on a distributed network of computational devices, thus
distributing the computational and data storage loads. This strategy has
already seen some adoption by the likes of Google and other companies. In this
paper we propose a new method of distributed, decentralized learning that
allows a network of computation nodes to coordinate their training using
asynchronous updates over an unreliable network while only having access to a
local dataset. This is achieved by taking inspiration from Distributed
Averaging Consensus algorithms to coordinate the various nodes. Sharing the
internal model instead of the training data allows the original raw data to
remain with the computation node. The asynchronous nature and lack of
centralized coordination allows this paradigm to function with limited
communication requirements. We demonstrate our method on the MNIST, Fashion
MNIST, and CIFAR10 datasets. We show that our coordination method allows models
to be learned on highly biased datasets, and in the presence of intermittent

a classical SDBD driven by a tailored Fast-Rise-Slow-Decay (FRSD) voltage
waveform. The plasma channel formation and charge production process in the
voltage rising stage are studied at different slopes using a classical 2D fluid
model, the thrust generated in the voltage decaying stage is studied based on
an analytical approach taking 2D model results as the input. A thrust pulse is
generated in the trailing edge of the voltage waveform and reaches maximum when
the voltage decreases by approximately the value of cathode voltage
fall~($\approx$600~V). The time duration of the rising and trailing edge, the
decay rate and the amplitude of applied voltage are the main factors affecting
the performance of the actuator. Analytical expressions are formulated for the
value and time moment of peak thrust, the upper limit of thrust is also
estimated. Higher voltage rising rate leads to higher charge density in the
voltage rising stage thus higher thrust. Shorter voltage trailing edge, in
general, results in higher value and earlier appearance of the peak thrust. The
detailed profile of the trailing edge also affects the performance. Results in
this work allow us to flexibly design the FRSD waveforms for an SDBD actuator
according to the requirements of active flow control in different application

case where the new deformation exponent $\Delta$ is the sole model parameter,
and we show that although the standard value $\Delta=0$, which corresponds to
zero deformation, lies within the 1$\sigma$ region, a deviation is favored. In
the case where we let both $\Delta$ and the second model parameter to be free
we find that a deviation from standard holographic dark energy is preferred.
Additionally, applying the Akaike, Bayesian and Deviance Information Criteria,
we conclude that the one-parameter model is statistically compatible with

Finally, concerning the present value of the Hubble parameter we find that it
is close to the Planck value.

mapping of large-scale, near-ground, underground, or indoor spaces via a novel
integration framework for locally-dense agent map data. The effort targets
limited Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) agents with an emphasis on limiting
required communications and redundant processing. The approach uses a unique
organization of batch optimization engines to enable a highly efficient
two-tier optimization structure. Tier I consist of agents that create and
potentially share local maplets (local maps, limited in size) which are
generated using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) map-building
software and then marginalized to a more compact parameterization. Maplets are
generated in an overlapping manner and used to estimate the transform and
uncertainty between those overlapping maplets, providing accurate and compact
odometry or delta-pose representation between maplet's local frames. The delta
poses can be shared between agents, and in cases where maplets have salient
features (for loop closures), the compact representation of the maplet can also
be shared.
  The second optimization tier consists of a global optimizer that seeks to
optimize those maplet-to-maplet transformations, including any loop closures
identified. This can provide an accurate global ""skeleton""' of the traversed

luminosity, mass, and age can be determined independently is of utter
importance to test and calibrate the evolutionary models due to uncertainties
in their formation mechanisms. HD 19467 is a bright and nearby star hosting a
cool brown dwarf companion detected with RV and imaging, making it a valuable
object for such studies. Aims. We aim to further characterize the orbital,
spectral, and physical properties of the HD 19467 system. Methods. We present
new high-contrast imaging data with the SPHERE and NaCo instruments. We also
analyze archival data from HARPS, NaCo, HIRES, UVES, and ASAS. We also use
proper motion data of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia. Results. We refine the
properties of the host star and derive an age of 8.0$^{+2.0}_{-1.0}$ Gyr based
on isochrones, gyrochronology, and chemical and kinematic arguments. This
estimate is slightly younger than previous estimates of ~9-11 Gyr. No orbital
curvature is seen in the current imaging, RV, and astrometric data. From a
joint fit of the data, we refine the orbital parameters for HD 19467B: period
398$^{+95}_{-93}$ yr, inclination 129.8$^{+8.1}_{-5.1}$ deg, eccentricity
0.56$\pm$0.09, longitude of the ascending node 134.8$\pm$4.5 deg, and argument
of the periastron 64.2$^{+5.5}_{-6.3}$ deg. We assess a dynamical mass of
74$^{+12}_{-9}$ MJ. The fit with atmospheric models of the spectrophotometric
data of HD 19467B indicates an atmosphere without clouds or with very thin
clouds, an effective temperature of 1042$^{+77}_{-71}$ K, and a large surface
gravity of 5.34$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ dex. The comparison to model predictions of
the bolometric luminosity and dynamical mass of HD 19467B, assuming our system
age estimate, indicates a better agreement with the Burrows et al. models;
whereas the other evolutionary models used tend to underestimate its cooling
rate.

with the circum-stellar medium (CSM). The shocked CSM and the jet material are
assumed to be in an infinitely thin surface, so the original 2D problem is
effectively reduced to 1D. From general conservation laws, we derive the
equation of motion for each fluid element along this surface, taking into
account the deceleration along the surface normal due to newly swept-up mass
and lateral expansion due to pressure gradient in the tangential direction. The
pressure and energy density of the shocked CSM are given by the jump conditions
at the forward shock. The method is implemented with a finite-differencing
numerical scheme, along with calculation of synchrotron emission and absorption
from shock-accelerated electrons, in a new code $\mathtt{Jedi}$ (for ""jet
dynamics""). We present a number of test cases, including top-hat jet, power-law
structured jet, ""boosted fireball"" profile, and CSM with density jump at the
wind termination shock. Based on the agreement with other analytical and
numerical calculations, we conclude that our simplified method provides a good
approximation for the hydrodynamics and afterglow emission for a wide variety
of jet structures and CSM density profiles. Efficient modeling of the afterglow
from e.g., neutron star mergers, will provide important information on the jet
energetics, CSM properties, and the viewing angle.

algorithms are essential in many applications that require fast and accurate
estimation of the maximizing sequence probability. These applications include

interesting theoretical twists that must be overcome in order to present
efficient sequential algorithms. Here, we focus on universal compression for
memoryless sources, and present precise analysis for the maximal minimax and
the average minimax for constrained distributions. We show that our sequential
algorithm based on modified Krichevsky-Trofimov (KT) estimator is

enormous bursts and flares of X-rays and gamma-rays. Of the approximately
thirty magnetars currently known in our Galaxy and Magellanic Clouds, five have
exhibited transient radio pulsations. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are
millisecond-duration bursts of radio waves arriving from cosmological
distances. Some have been seen to repeat. A leading model for repeating FRBs is
that they are extragalactic magnetars, powered by their intense magnetic
fields. However, a challenge to this model has been that FRBs must have radio
luminosities many orders of magnitude larger than those seen from known
Galactic magnetars. Here we report the detection of an extremely intense radio
burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154 using the Canadian Hydrogen
Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) FRB project. The fluence of this
two-component bright radio burst and the estimated distance to SGR 1935+2154
together imply a 400-800 MHz burst energy of $\sim 3 \times 10^{34}$ erg, which
is three orders of magnitude brighter than those of any radio-emitting magnetar
detected thus far. Such a burst coming from a nearby galaxy would be
indistinguishable from a typical FRB. This event thus bridges a large fraction
of the radio energy gap between the population of Galactic magnetars and FRBs,
strongly supporting the notion that magnetars are the origin of at least some
FRBs.

Deep learning (DL) methods for classification and detection have shown great
potential, but often require large amounts of training data that are hard to
collect, and annotate. For many cancer types, the scarceness of data creates
barriers for training DL models. One such scenario relates to detecting tumor
metastasis in lymph node tissue, where the low ratio of tumor to non-tumor
cells makes the diagnostic task hard and time-consuming. DL-based tools can
allow faster diagnosis, with potentially increased quality. Unfortunately, due
to the sparsity of tumor cells, annotating this type of data demands a high
level of effort from pathologists. Using weak annotations from slide-level
images have shown great potential, but demand access to a substantial amount of
data as well. In this study, we investigate mitigation strategies for limited
data access scenarios. Particularly, we address whether it is possible to
exploit mutual structure between tissues to develop general techniques, wherein
data from one type of cancer in a particular tissue could have diagnostic value
for other cancers in other tissues. Our case is exemplified by a DL model for
metastatic colon cancer detection in lymph nodes. Could such a model be trained
with little or even no lymph node data? As alternative data sources, we
investigate 1) tumor cells taken from the primary colon tumor tissue, and 2)
cancer data from a different organ (breast), either as is or transformed to the
target domain (colon) using Cycle-GANs. We show that the suggested approaches
make it possible to detect cancer metastasis with no or very little lymph node
data, opening up for the possibility that existing, annotated histopathology
data could generalize to other domains.

give a lower and an upper bound, respectively, on the number of constraints
that must be satisfied by each edge. The produced feasibility problem is
denoted by \texttt{G-DCST}, while the optimization problem is denoted by
\texttt{G-DCMST}. We show that \texttt{G-DCST} is NP-complete even under strong
assumptions on the structures of $G$ and $D$, as well as on functions $\ell$

\texttt{G-DCST} and another for \texttt{G-DCMST}, and also give a simple
exponential-time algorithm along with a proof that it is asymptotically optimal
under the \ETH. Finally, we prove that other previously studied constrained
spanning tree (\textsc{CST}) problems can be modeled within our framework,

(a) introducing a discriminator to perform bi-directional translation

This is regularlycarried out by software-based defenses such as Address Space
Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Kernel ASLR(KASLR). They play pronounced roles
when the security of sandboxed applications such as Web-browser are
considered.Armed with arbitrary write access in the kernel memory, if these
protections are bypassed, an adversary could find a suitable where to write in
order to get an elevation of privilege or code execution in ring 0. In this
paper, we introduce a reliable method based on Transactional Synchronization
Extensions (TSX) side-channel leakage to reveal the address of the Global
Descriptor Table (GDT) and Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT). We indicate that
by detecting these addresses, one could execute instructions to sidestep the
Intels User-Mode InstructionPrevention (UMIP) and the Hypervisor-based

successfully performed after the most recent patches for Meltdown and Spectre.
Moreover, the implementation of the proposed approach on different platforms,
including the latest releases of Microsoft Windows, Linux, and, Mac OSX with
the latest 9th generation of Intel processors, shows that the proposed
mechanism is independent from the Operating System implementation. We
demonstrate that a combinationof this method with call-gate mechanism
(available in modernprocessors) in a chain of events will eventually lead toa
system compromise despite the limitations of a super-secure sandboxed

the particularly bright and extended Western hotspot in the nearest powerful
(FR II-type) radio galaxy, Pictor A, based on data obtained with the Chandra
X-ray Observatory. The hotspot marks the position where the relativistic jet,
that originates in the active nucleus of the system, interacts with the
intergalactic medium, at hundreds-of-kiloparsec distances from the host galaxy,
forming a termination shock that converts jet bulk kinetic energy to internal
energy of the plasma. The hotspot is bright in X-rays due to the synchrotron
emission of electrons accelerated to ultra-relativistic energies at the shock
front. In our analysis, we make use of several Chandra observations targeting
the hotspot over the last decades with various exposures and off-axis angles.
For each pointing, we study in detail the PSF, which allows us to perform the
image deconvolution, and to resolve the hotspot structure. In particular, the
brightest segment of the X-ray hotspot is observed to be extended in the
direction perpendicular to the jet, forming a thin, $\sim$3 kpc-long, feature
that we identify with the front of the reverse shock. The position of this
feature agrees well with the position of the optical intensity peak of the
hotspot, but is clearly off-set from the position of the radio intensity peak,
located $\sim$1 kpc further downstream. In addition, we measure the net count
rate on the deconvolved images, finding a gradual flux decrease by about 30%
over the 15-year timescale of the monitoring.

whose components can be modeled based on set theory and first-order logic. The
thinging machine (TM) is a diagram-based model establishes three levels of
representation: (1) a static structural description, which is constructed upon
the flow of things in five generic operations (activities; i.e., create,
process, release, transfer, and receive); (2) a dynamic representation, which
identifies hierarchies of events based on five generic events; and (3) a
behavioral representation according to the chronology of events. This paper is
an exercise in contrasting the formal Event-B to the diagrammatic TM. The
purpose is to further understand modeling in computer science. This is
motivated by the claim that computer scientists should not invent specific
languages to do the modeling. Important notions such as events and behavior are
contrasted, and a case study system of traffic on a bridge is modeled in
Event-B and TM. The results seem to indicate the need for both modeling
approaches.

these datasets provide tracks for people, vehicles, and animals, ignoring the
vast majority of objects in the world. By contrast, in the related field of
object detection, the introduction of large-scale, diverse datasets (e.g.,
COCO) have fostered significant progress in developing highly robust solutions.
To bridge this gap, we introduce a similarly diverse dataset for Tracking Any
Object (TAO). It consists of 2,907 high resolution videos, captured in diverse
environments, which are half a minute long on average. Importantly, we adopt a
bottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an
order of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask
annotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names
to them post factum. Our vocabulary is both significantly larger and
qualitatively different from existing tracking datasets. To ensure scalability
of annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on
labeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move).
We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a
number of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an
open-world. In particular, we show that existing single- and multi-object
trackers struggle when applied to this scenario in the wild, and that
detection-based, multi-object trackers are in fact competitive with
user-initialized ones. We hope that our dataset and analysis will boost further
progress in the tracking community.

previous papers that the spectral evolution in X-ray and radio during the
2010-2011 outburst of GX339-4 can be recovered. We now investigate the presence
of low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) during an X-ray outburst,
and address the possible correlation between the frequencies of these LFQPOs
and the transition radius between the two flows, rJ. We select X-ray and radio
data form 3 outbursts of GX339-4. We use the method detailed in paper IV to
obtain $r_J(t)$ and $\dot{m}_{in}(t)$ for each outburst to reproduce the
correlated evolution of the X-ray spectra and the radio emission for 3
different activity cycles of GX339-4. We also independently search and report
the detection of 7 new LFQPOs in addition to the literature. We show that the
frequency of Type C QPOs can be linked to the dynamical JED-SAD transition
radius rJ, rather than the radius of optically thin-thick transition. The
scaling factor q such that $\nu_{QPO} \simeq \nu_K (r_J) / q$ is $q \simeq
70-140$, consistent during the 4 cycles and similar to previous studies. The
JED-SAD hybrid disk configuration not only provides a successful paradigm
allowing us to describe XrB cycles, but also matches the QPO frequencies
evolution. QPOs provide an indirect way to probe the JED-SAD transition radius,
where an undetermined process produces secular variability. The demonstrated
relation between the transition radius links Type C QPOs to the transition
between the two flows, tying it to the inner magnetized structure of the jets.
This direct connection between the jets' structure and the process responsible
for Type C QPOs could naturally explain their puzzling multi-wavelength
behavior.

strain and refraction. The model is initialized with a horizontally-uniform
($\boldsymbol{k}=0$) surface-confined near-inertial wave which then evolves
according to the phase-averaged model of Young and Ben Jelloul. A steady
barotropic vortex dipole is first considered. Nearly monochromatic shear bands
appear in the jet region as wave energy propagate downwards and towards
anticyclone. As a result of refraction, both horizontal and vertical
wavenumbers grow linearly with the time $t$ elapsed since generation such that
their ratio, the slope of wave bands, is time-indepedent. Analogy with passive
scalar dynamics suggests that strain should result in the exponential growth of
$|\boldsymbol{k}|$. Here instead, strain is ineffective not only at the jet
center, but also at its confluent and diffluent regions. Low modes rapidly
escape below the anticyclonic core such that the weakly-dispersive high modes
are dominant in the mixed layer. In the weakly-dispersive limit,
$\boldsymbol{k}=- t \nabla \zeta(x,y,t)/2$ provided that (i) the eddy vertical
vorticity $\zeta$ evolves according to the barotropic quasi-geostrophic
equation; and (ii) $\boldsymbol{k}=0$ initially, as is typically assumed for
near-inertial waves generated by large-scale atmospheric storms. In steady
flows, strain is ineffective because $\boldsymbol{k}$ is always perpendicular
to the flow. In unsteady flows, straining modifies the vorticity gradient and
hence $\boldsymbol{k}$, and may account for significant energy transfers.

implies that at least one of two intuitive beliefs must be false: that effects
propagating at infinite velocity do not exist, and that natural phenomena occur
independently of being observed. Giving up any one of these two beliefs
(usually known together as Local Realism) is controversial. Many theories have
been proposed to reconcile the violation of Bell's inequalities with Local
Realism, but none has been fully successful. In this paper, it is recalled that
any theory aimed to violate Bell's inequalities must start by giving up Boolean
logic. The problem is split in two: the ""soft"" problem is to explain the
violation of Bell's inequalities within (non-Boolean) Local Realism. The ""hard""
problem is to predict the time values when single particles are detected. A
simple hidden variables model is introduced, which solves the soft problem.
This is possible thanks to the use of vectors as the hidden variables and the
operation projection, which do not hold to Boolean logic. This model reconciles
the violation of Bell's inequalities with Local Realism and should end decades
of controversy. Regarding the hard problem, the introduced model is as
incomplete as Quantum Mechanics is. It is argued that solving the hard problem
involves devising a new kind of quantum computer, which should be able to

however the central stars (CSPNe) are relatively faint and therefore pertinent
information is merely available for <20% of the Galactic sample. Consequently,
the literature was surveyed to construct a new catalogue of 620 CSPNe featuring
important spectral classifications and information. The catalogue supersedes
the existing iteration by 25%, and includes physical parameters such as
luminosity, surface gravity, temperature, magnitude estimates, and references
for published spectra. The marked statistical improvement enabled the following
pertinent conclusions to be determined: the H-rich/H-poor ratio is 2:1, there
is a deficiency of CSPNe with types [WC 5-6], and nearly 80% of binary central
stars belong to the H-rich group. The last finding suggests that evolutionary
scenarios leading to the formation of binary central stars interfere with the
conditions required for the formation of H-poor CSPN. Approximately 50% of the
sample with derived values of log L, log Teff, and log g, exhibit masses and
ages consistent with single stellar evolutionary models. The implication is
that single stars are indeed able to form planetary nebulae. Moreover, it is
shown that H-poor CSPNe are formed by higher mass progenitors. The catalogue is
available through the Vizier database.

while a large fraction of the narrow components have subsonic line widths. The
supersonic turbulence inferred from the global line profiles is consistent with
the velocity dispersion of the individual narrow components, i.e. the global
profiles likely arise from the combined contribution of discrete gas clouds. We
confirm the presence of very extended (400 - 1200 km/s) low-intensity line
components in three bright star-forming cores in NGC 5471, possibly
representing kinematic signatures of supernova remnants. For one of these, the
known supernova remnant host NGC 5471 B, we find a significantly reduced [O

presence of a radiative shock at low metallicity. We explore the systematic
width discrepancy between H I and [O III] lines, present in both global and

superimposed on longer-term trends. In contrast, little is known about the
variability of FUors at longer wavelengths. To explore this further, we
observed six FUor objects using the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA)

NOEMA and the Lowell Discovery Telescope (LDT). In combination with previously

absence of significant optical variability, we discount the possibility that
the mm flux density changed as a result of irradiation from the central disk.
In addition, a change in the dust mass due to infall is highly unlikely. A
plausible explanation for the change in 2.7 mm flux density is variability in
free-free emission due to changes in the object's jet/wind. Thus, it may be
that free-free emission in some FUor objects is significant at $\sim$3 mm and
must be considered when deriving disk masses in order to help constrain the

super-resolution sequences for both datasets. The statistical properties of the
generated ensemble are analyzed using rank statistics, a method adapted from
ensemble weather forecasting; these analyses indicate that the GAN produces
close to the correct amount of variability in its outputs. As the GAN generator
is fully convolutional, it can be applied after training to input images larger
than the images used to train it. It is also able to generate time series much
longer than the training sequences, as demonstrated by applying the generator

better monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give
timely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the
extended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the
phenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of
locations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present
informative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or
computationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a
real-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of
city-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in
forward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed
parameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the
causal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible
sequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the
forward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance
matrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a
concrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this
scheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms
and other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper
relies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states,
and experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good
performance when applied to precise data-driven models.

critical point. The corresponding effective field theory is a double-frequency
sine-Gordon (DSG) model which involves two perturbations at the Gaussian fixed
point: the deviation from criticality and Umklapp scattering processes. A
topological distinction between thermodynamically equivalent phases becomes
only feasible when nonlocal fermionic fields, parity and string order
parameter, are included into consideration. We prove that a noninteracting
fermionic staggered SSH ladder is exactly equivalent to a O(2)-symmetric model
of two decoupled Kitaev-Majorana chains, or two 1D p-wave superconductors.
Close to the Gaussian fixed point the SSH ladder maps to an Ashkin-Teller like
system when interactions are included. Thus, the topological order in the SSH
ladder is related to broken-symmetry phases of the associated quantum
spin-chain degrees of freedom. The obtained phase diagram includes a
Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid state which, due to Umklapp processes, can become
unstable against either spontaneous dimerization or the onset of a
charge-density wave (CDW). In these gapped phases elementary bulk excitations
are quantum kinks carrying the charge QF = 1/2. For sufficiently strong,
long-range interactions, the phase diagram of the model exhibits a bifurcation
of the Gaussian critical point into two outgoing Ising criticalities. The
latter sandwich a mixed phase in which dimerization coexists with a
site-diagonal CDW. In this phase elementary bulk excitations are represented by
two types of topological solitons carrying different fermionic charges, which
continuously interpolate between 0 and 1. This phase has also mixed topological
properties with coexisting parity and string order parameters.

statistical errors in cosmological parameters is of crucial importance.
However, widely used approximations in galaxy surveys analyses can lead to
parameter uncertainties that are grossly mis-estimated, even in a regime where
the theory is well understood (e.g., linear scales). These approximations can
be introduced at three different levels: in the form of the likelihood, in the
theoretical modelling of the observable and in the numerical computation of the
observable. Their consequences are important both in data analysis through
e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter inference, and when survey instrument
and strategy are designed and their constraining power on cosmological
parameters is forecasted, for instance using Fisher matrix analyses. In this
work, considering the galaxy angular power spectrum as the target observable,
we report one example of approximation for each of such three categories:
neglecting off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, neglecting cosmic
magnification and using the Limber approximation on large scales. We show that
these commonly used approximations affect the robustness of the analysis and
lead, perhaps counter-intuitively, to unacceptably large mis-estimates of
parameters errors (from few~$10\%$ up to few~$100\%$) and correlations.
Furthermore, these approximations might even spoil the benefits of the nascent
multi-tracer and multi-messenger cosmology. Hence we recommend that the type of
analysis presented here should be repeated for every approximation adopted in
survey design or data analysis, to quantify how it may affect the results. To
this aim, we have developed \texttt{Multi\_CLASS}, a new extension of

for realizing large-scale quantum photonic processors. Negatively charged
tin-vacancy (SnV$^-$) centers in diamond have emerged as promising candidates
for quantum emitters because of their excellent optical and spin properties
including narrow-linewidth emission and long spin coherence times. SnV$^-$
centers need to be incorporated in optical waveguides for efficient on-chip
routing of the photons they generate. However, such integration has yet to be
realized. In this Letter, we demonstrate the coupling of SnV$^-$ centers to a
nanophotonic waveguide. We realize this device by leveraging our recently
developed shallow ion implantation and growth method for generation of
high-quality SnV$^-$ centers and the advanced quasi-isotropic diamond
fabrication technique. We confirm the compatibility and robustness of these
techniques through successful coupling of narrow-linewidth SnV$^-$ centers (as
narrow as $36\pm2$ MHz) to the diamond waveguide. Furthermore, we investigate
the stability of waveguide-coupled SnV$^-$ centers under resonant excitation.
Our results are an important step toward SnV$^-$-based on-chip spin-photon
interfaces, single-photon nonlinearity, and photon-mediated spin interactions.

does not require manually annotated and complicated linguistic features such as

must be carefully designed and well optimized so that it can implicitly extract
useful linguistic features from the input features. In this paper we
investigate under what conditions the neural sequence-to-sequence TTS can work
well in Japanese and English along with comparisons with deep neural network
(DNN) based pipeline TTS systems. Unlike past comparative studies, the pipeline
systems also use autoregressive probabilistic modeling and a neural vocoder. We
investigated systems from three aspects: a) model architecture, b) model
parameter size, and c) language. For the model architecture aspect, we adopt
modified Tacotron systems that we previously proposed and their variants using
an encoder from Tacotron or Tacotron2. For the model parameter size aspect, we
investigate two model parameter sizes. For the language aspect, we conduct
listening tests in both Japanese and English to see if our findings can be
generalized across languages. Our experiments suggest that a) a neural
sequence-to-sequence TTS system should have a sufficient number of model
parameters to produce high quality speech, b) it should also use a powerful
encoder when it takes characters as inputs, and c) the encoder still has a room
for improvement and needs to have an improved architecture to learn
supra-segmental features more appropriately.

related, in fact drastically distinct, questions via computational data-driven
algorithms: 1) how to precisely achieve the big task of differentiating gait
signatures of many individuals? 2) how to reconstruct an individual's complex
gait dynamics in full? Our brains can ""effortlessly"" resolve the first
question, but will definitely fail in the second one. Since many fine temporal
scale gait patterns surely escape our eyes. Based on accelerometers' 3D gait
time series databases, we link the answers toward both questions via multiscale
structural dependency within gait dynamics of our musculoskeletal system. Two
types of dependency manifestations are explored. We first develop simple
algorithmic computing called Principle System-State Analysis (PSSA) for the
coarse dependency in implicit forms. PSSA is shown to be able to efficiently
classifying among many subjects. We then develop a multiscale
Local-1st-Global-2nd (L1G2) Coding Algorithm and a landmark computing
algorithm. With both algorithms, we can precisely dissect rhythmic gait cycles,
and then decompose each cycle into a series of cyclic gait phases. With proper
color-coding and stacking, we reconstruct and represent an individual's gait
dynamics via a 3D cylinder to collectively reveal universal deterministic and
stochastic structural patterns on centisecond (10 milliseconds) scale across
all rhythmic cycles. This 3D cylinder can serve as ""passtensor"" for
authentication purposes related to clinical diagnoses and cybersecurity.

functions of a scalar composite operator. The equation is derived starting from
the Polchinski ERG equation for the fundamental scalar field. As described in

written in the form of a functional integral, with a $D+1$ dimensional scalar

only has a kinetic term and therefore looks quite different from Holographic RG
where there are potential terms. But in the composite operator case discussed
in this paper, the ERG equation and consequently the $D+1$ dimensional action
contains higher order potential terms for the scalar field and is therefore
very similar to the case of Holographic RG. Furthermore this action can be
mapped to a scalar field action in $AdS_{D+1}$ using the techniques of

mapping is frequently ignored as an explicit optimization step since the system
typically offers a default mapping, users may lack awareness of their
applications' communication behavior, and the opportunities for improving
performance through mapping are often unclear. This work studies the impact of
application process mapping on several processor topologies. We propose a
workflow that renders mapping as an explicit optimization step for parallel
applications. We apply the workflow to a set of four applications, twelve
mapping algorithms, and three direct network topologies. We assess the
mappings' quality in terms of volume, frequency, and distance of exchanges
using metrics such as dilation (measured in hop$\cdot$Byte). With a parallel
trace-based simulator, we predict the applications' execution on the three
topologies using the twelve mappings. We evaluate the impact of process mapping
on the applications' simulated performance in terms of execution and
communication times and identify the mappings that achieve the highest
performance in both cases. To ensure the correctness of the simulations, we
compare the pre- and post-simulation results. This work emphasizes the

studied the algorithmic trade-off between latency and accuracy, there has not
been a clear metric to compare different methods along the Pareto optimal
latency-accuracy curve. We point out a discrepancy between standard offline
evaluation and real-time applications: by the time an algorithm finishes
processing a particular frame, the surrounding world has changed. To these
ends, we present an approach that coherently integrates latency and accuracy
into a single metric for real-time online perception, which we refer to as
""streaming accuracy"". The key insight behind this metric is to jointly evaluate
the output of the entire perception stack at every time instant, forcing the
stack to consider the amount of streaming data that should be ignored while
computation is occurring. More broadly, building upon this metric, we introduce
a meta-benchmark that systematically converts any single-frame task into a
streaming perception task. We focus on the illustrative tasks of object
detection and instance segmentation in urban video streams, and contribute a
novel dataset with high-quality and temporally-dense annotations. Our proposed
solutions and their empirical analysis demonstrate a number of surprising
conclusions: (1) there exists an optimal ""sweet spot"" that maximizes streaming
accuracy along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve, (2) asynchronous
tracking and future forecasting naturally emerge as internal representations
that enable streaming perception, and (3) dynamic scheduling can be used to
overcome temporal aliasing, yielding the paradoxical result that latency is

those solutions as the compensated/uncompensated strings. The compensated
string is similar to the conventional cosmic string in the
Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen (ANO) string, around which only the would-be
Nambu-Goldstone (NG) boson winds. Around the uncompensated string, on the other
hand, the physical NG boson also winds, where the physical NG boson is
associated with the spontaneous breaking of the enhanced symmetry. Our previous
simulation in the 2+1 dimensional spacetime confirmed that both the
compensated/uncompensated strings are formed at the phase transition of the
symmetry breaking. Non-trivial winding of the physical NG boson around the
strings potentially causes the so-called axion domain-wall problem when the
model is applied to the axion model. In this paper, we perform simulation in
the 3+1 dimensional spacetime to discuss the fate of the uncompensated strings.
We observe that the evolution of the string-network is highly complicated in
the 3+1 dimensional simulation compared with that seen in the previous
simulation. Despite such complications, we find that the number of the
uncompensated strings which could cause can be highly suppressed at late times.
Our observation suggests that the present setup can be applied to the axion

quasars as distance indicators, extending the coverage to encompass the
redshift range of strong lensing systems. We provide a novel and improved
method of determining $H_0$ and $\Omega_{K}$ simultaneously. By applying this
technique to the time-delay measurements of seven strong lensing systems and
the known ultraviolet versus X-ray luminosity correlation of quasars, we
constrain the possible values of both $H_0$ and $\Omega_{K}$, and find that
$H_0=75.3^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_{K}=-0.01^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$. The measured $\Omega_{K}$ is consistent
with zero spatial curvature, indicating that there is no significant deviation
from a flat universe. If we use flatness as a prior, we infer that
$H_0=75.3^{+1.9}_{-1.9}$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm Mpc^{-1}$, representing a
precision of 2.5\%. If we further combine these data with the 1048 current
Pantheon SNe Ia, our model-independent constraints can be further improved to
$H_0=75.3^{+3.0}_{-2.9}$ km $\rm s^{-1}$ $\rm Mpc^{-1}$ and
$\Omega_{K}=0.05^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$. In every case, we find that the Hubble

most epidemiological forecasts. Limited testing is cited as the key driver
behind minimal information on the COVID-19 pandemic. While expanded testing is
laudable, measurement error and selection bias are the two greatest problems
limiting our understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic; neither can be fully
addressed by increased testing capacity. In this paper, we demonstrate their
impact on estimation of point prevalence and the effective reproduction number.
We show that estimates based on the millions of molecular tests in the US has
the same mean square error as a small simple random sample. To address this, a
procedure is presented that combines case-count data and random samples over
time to estimate selection propensities based on key covariate information. We
then combine these selection propensities with epidemiological forecast models
to construct a \emph{doubly robust} estimation method that accounts for both
measurement-error and selection bias. This method is then applied to estimate
Indiana's active infection prevalence using case-count, hospitalization, and
death data with demographic information, a statewide random molecular sample
collected from April 25--29th, and Delphi's COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey.
We end with a series of recommendations based on the proposed methodology.

topologically-protected FR is achieved by coupling the valley-dependent
topological edge states (TESs) with one double-degenerate cavity. The
$\delta$-type photonic transport theory we build reveals that this topological
FR dates from the interference of the two transmissions that are attributed to
the parity-odd cavity mode and the parity-even one. We confirm that the induced
Fano line shape of the transmission spectra is robust against the bending
domain walls and disorders. Our work may provoke exciting frontiers for
manipulating the valley transport and pave a way for the topologically

derive optimal Poisson subsampling probabilities in the context of
quasi-likelihood estimation under the A- and L-optimality criteria. For a

smaller partitions of the full data. Asymptotic properties of the resultant

formation of a Pop III star cluster of 500 $\rm M_{\odot}$ in the close

as the specificities of different tasks are inevitably ignored. By contrast, we
solve them by a hierarchically-fused U-Net structure, namely HF-UNet. The

includes not only data that developers can suppose (supposable data) but also
data they cannot suppose (unsupposable data). To confirm the behavior of the

to generate unsupposable data. The unsupposable data is generated by acquiring
latent values with low occurrence probability in the prior distribution of the
VAE and inputting the acquired latent values into the decoder. If unsupposable
data is included in the data generated by the decoder, the developer can
recognize new unsupposable features by referring to the data. On the basis of
those unsupposable features, the developer will be able to create other

show that quantum asymptotic dimension behaves well with respect to metric
quotients and direct sums, and is preserved under quantum coarse embeddings.
Moreover, we prove that a quantum metric space that equi-coarsely contains a
sequence of reflexive quantum expanders must have infinite asymptotic
dimension. This is done by proving a quantum version of a vertex-isoperimetric
inequality for expanders, based upon a previously known edge-isoperimetric one
due to Temme, Kastoryano, Ruskai, Wolf, and Verstraete.

time of arrival of radio packets to multiple receivers (base stations).
Time-of-arrival estimation of wideband radio signals is computationally
expensive, especially in acquisition mode (when the time of transmission is not
known, not even approximately). These computations are a bottleneck that limits
the throughput of the system. We developed a sequential high-performance CPU
implementation of the computations a few years back, and more recencely a GPU
implementation. Both strive to balance performance with simplicity,
maintainability, and development effort, as most real-world codes do. The paper
reports on the two implementations and carefully evaluates their performance.
The evaluations indicates that the GPU implementation dramatically improves
performance and power-performance relative to the sequential CPU implementation
running on a desktop CPU typical of the computers in current base stations.
Performance improves by more than 50X on a high-end GPU and more than 4X with a
GPU platform that consumes almost 5 times less power than the CPU platform.
Performance-per-Watt ratios also improve (by more than 16X), and so do the
price-performance ratios.

outgassing from comet nuclei by radiative torques (RATs). We find that
composite grains could be rapidly disrupted into small fragments by the
Radiative Torque Disruption (RATD) mechanism. We then study rotational
desorption of ice grains by RATs and find that icy grains could be desorbed
from large heliocentric distances, beyond the sublimation radius of water at
$R_{\rm sub}(\H_{2}\O)\sim 3\AU$. We also calculate the production rate of
water vapor versus the heliocentric distance of comets due to rotational
desorption. Our results could explain the variation of dust properties and the
presence of small grains frequently observed from cometary comae. Finally, we
suggest that the activity of distant comets could be triggered by rotational
disruption of grains and desorption of water ice grains at large heliocentric

network parameters, making the deployments of DNNs on platforms with limited
resources extremely difficult. Therefore, various pruning methods have been
developed to compress the deep network architectures and accelerate the
inference process. Most of the existing channel pruning methods discard the
less important filters according to well-designed filter ranking criteria.
However, due to the limited interpretability of deep learning models, designing
an appropriate ranking criterion to distinguish redundant filters is difficult.
To address such a challenging issue, we propose a new technique of Channel
Pruning via Optimal Transport, dubbed CPOT. Specifically, we locate the
Wasserstein barycenter for channels of each layer in the deep models, which is
the mean of a set of probability distributions under the optimal transport
metric. Then, we prune the redundant information located by Wasserstein
barycenters. At last, we empirically demonstrate that, for classification
tasks, CPOT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on pruning ResNet-20,
ResNet-32, ResNet-56, and ResNet-110. Furthermore, we show that the proposed
CPOT technique is good at compressing the StarGAN models by pruning in the more

collisions of phonons with electrons sensitive to their chirality, which is
opposite in two valleys. As a result of collisions with phonons, electrons of
the different valleys deviate in opposite directions. Breaking the spatial
inversion symmetry is not needed for a valley-dependent deviation of the
quasiparticle current. The effect exists both in pristine graphene or bilayer

weak coherent pulses to perform quantum key distribution (QKD) in the

performing coherent-state CV-QKD via the satellite-to-ground channel. We use
numerical methods to simulate atmospheric turbulence and compare the results
with ground-based experimental data so as to confirm the validity of our
approach. We find the results obtained from the numerical simulations agree
well with the experimental data and represent an improvement over the
state-of-the-art analytical models. Using the simulation results we then derive
QKD key rates and find that useful non-zero key rates can be found over a
limited range of zenith angles. Determination of QKD key rates using
experimentally validated simulations of low-zenith-angle atmospheric channels
represents an important step towards proving the feasibility of real-world
satellite-to-Earth CV-QKD.

in nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS) are analyzed in the framework of the
generalized master equation. In our simulations each turnstile cycle allows the
pumping of up to two interacting electrons across a biased mesoscopic subsystem
which is electrostatically coupled to the vibrational mode of a nanoresonator.
The time-dependent mean vibron number is very sensitive to the turnstile
driving, rapidly increasing/decreasing along the charging/discharging
sequences. This sequence of heating and cooling cycles experienced by the
nanoresonator is due to specific vibron-assisted sequential tunneling processes
along a turnstile period. At the end of each charging/discharging cycle the
nanoresonator is described by a linear combination of vibron-dressed states
$s_{\nu}$ associated to an electronic configuration $\nu$. If the turnstile
operation leads to complete electronic depletion the nanoresonator returns to
its equilibrium position, i.e.\,its displacement vanishes. It turns out that a
suitable bias applied on the NEMS leads to a slow but complete cooling at the
end of the turnstile cycle. Our calculations show that the quantum turnstile
regime switches the dynamics of the NEMS between vibron-dressed subspaces with
different electronic occupation numbers. We predict that the turnstile control
of the electron-vibron interaction induces measurable changes on the input and
output transient currents.

in the infinite key limit, the simplest-to-deploy QKD protocols, the coherent

detection in the pragmatic setting of finite keys, where complete security
against general attacks is known. We pay particular attention to the relevant
noise terms in the satellite-to-Earth channel and their impact on the secret
key rates. In system set-ups where diffraction dominates losses, we find that
the main components of the total excess noise are the intensity fluctuations

Historically, cross-domain co-clustering methods have successfully leveraged
shared users and items across dense and sparse domains to improve inference

sparse target domains (i.e., the one-to-many transfer setting). This, combined
with the increasing adoption of neural recommender architectures, motivates us
to develop scalable neural layer-transfer approaches for cross-domain learning.
Our key intuition is to guide neural collaborative filtering with
domain-invariant components shared across the dense and sparse domains,
improving the user and item representations learned in the sparse domains. We
leverage contextual invariances across domains to develop these shared modules,
and demonstrate that with user-item interaction context, we can learn-to-learn

the effectiveness and scalability of our approach on two public datasets and a
massive transaction dataset from Visa, a global payments technology company

time-domain, in which the propagation of GWs is a well-posed ""initial-value""
problem for the hyperbolic equations with rigorous rooting in mathematics and
physics. Based on these simulations, we investigate for the first time in
realistic 3-D space how the wave nature of GWs affects the speed and waveform
of GWs in a potential well. We find that GWs travel faster than the prediction
of the Shapiro time-delay in the geometric limit due to the effects of
diffraction and wavefront geometry. As the wave speed of GWs is closely related
to the locality and wavefront geometry of GWs, which are inherently difficult
to be addressed in the frequency-domain, our analyses in the time-domain,
therefore, provide the first robust analyses to date on this issue based on
solid physics. Moreover, we also investigate, for the first time, the
interference between the incident and the scattered waves (the ""echoes"" of the
incident waves). We find that such interference makes the total lensed
waveforms dramatically different from those of the original incident ones not
only in the amplitude but also in the phase and pattern, especially for signals
near the merger of the two back holes.

resource-intensive task that often involves third-party servers, which can be
accessed by adversaries with malicious intent. Biometric information delivered

significant privacy leak (i.e. uncontrolled information release) as biometrics

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving technique for ""controlled
information release"", where we disguise an original face image and prevent
leakage of the biometric features while identifying a person. We introduce a
new privacy-preserving face recognition protocol named PEEP (Privacy using
EigEnface Perturbation) that utilizes local differential privacy. PEEP applies
perturbation to Eigenfaces utilizing differential privacy and stores only the
perturbed data in the third-party servers to run a standard Eigenface

Our experiments show that PEEP exhibits a classification accuracy of around 70%

treatments to individual patients. It requires to identify a subset of patients
with the best response to treatment. The subset can be defined by a biomarker
(e.g. expression of a gene) and its cutoff value. Topics on subset
identification have received massive attention. There are over 2 million hits
by keyword searches on Google Scholar. However, how to properly incorporate the
identified subsets/biomarkers to design clinical trials is not trivial and
rarely discussed in the literature, which leads to a gap between research
results and real-world drug development.
  To fill in this gap, we formulate the problem of clinical trial design into
an optimization problem involving high-dimensional integration, and propose a
novel computational solution based on Monte-Carlo and smoothing methods. Our
method utilizes the modern techniques of General-Purpose computing on Graphics
Processing Units for large-scale parallel computing. Compared to the standard
method in three-dimensional problems, our approach is more accurate and 133
times faster. This advantage increases when dimensionality increases. Our
method is scalable to higher-dimensional problems since the precision bound is
a finite number not affected by dimensionality.
  Our software will be available on GitHub and CRAN, which can be applied to
guide the design of clinical trials to incorporate the biomarker better.
Although our research is motivated by the design of clinical trials, the method
can be used widely to solve other optimization problems involving
high-dimensional integration.

charging CVA at trade inception results in an expected loss. Furthermore,
hedging CVA market risk is crucial to end up with a stable trading strategy. In

spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) bring
forth the challenges of exploratory and subsequently physics-based analysis of
multidimensional data sets. The (by now common) multivariate unsupervised
linear unmixing methods and their nonlinear analogs generally explore
similarities in the energy dimension but ignore correlations in the spatial
domain. At the same time, Gaussian process (GP) methods that explicitly
incorporate spatial correlations in the form of kernel functions tend to be
extremely computationally intensive, while the use of inducing point-based
sparse methods often leads to reconstruction artefacts. Here, we suggest and
implement a parallel GP method operating on the full spatial domain and reduced
representations in the energy domain. In this parallel GP, the information
between the components is shared via a common spatial kernel structure while
allowing for variability in the relative noise magnitude or image morphology.
We explore the role of common spatial structures and kernel constraints on the
quality of the reconstruction and suggest an approach for estimating these
factors from the experimental data. Application of this method to an example
EELS dataset demonstrates that spatial information contained in higher-order
components can be reconstructed and spatially localized. This approach can be
further applied to other hyperspectral and multimodal imaging modes. The

understanding. Under unsupervised conditions, different images and instances
always have variable expressions, which make it difficult to achieve stable
segmentation performance based on fixed rules or single type of feature. In
order to solve this problem, the research proposes an unsupervised foreground
segmentation method based on semantic-apparent feature fusion (SAFF). Here, we
found that key regions of foreground object can be accurately responded via
semantic features, while apparent features (represented by saliency and edge)
provide richer detailed expression. To combine the advantages of the two type
of features, an encoding method for unary region features and binary context
features is established, which realizes a comprehensive description of the two
types of expressions. Then, a method for adaptive parameter learning is put
forward to calculate the most suitable feature weights and generate foreground
confidence score map. Furthermore, segmentation network is used to learn
foreground common features from different instances. By fusing semantic and
apparent features, as well as cascading the modules of intra-image adaptive
feature weight learning and inter-image common feature learning, the research
achieves performance that significantly exceeds baselines on the PASCAL VOC

can be the key to building a well-performant solution. This is because most
learning algorithms operate with the features in order to find models for the

mapped to a space where classes are easily separated, and regression can be
facilitated by finding a manifold of data in the feature space. As a general
rule, features are transformed by means of statistical methods such as
principal component analysis, or manifold learning techniques such as Isomap or
locally linear embedding. From a plethora of representation learning methods,
one of the most versatile tools is the autoencoder. In this paper we aim to
demonstrate how to influence its learned representations to achieve the desired
learning behavior. To this end, we present a series of learning tasks: data
embedding for visualization, image denoising, semantic hashing, detection of
abnormal behaviors and instance generation. We model them from the
representation learning perspective, following the state of the art
methodologies in each field. A solution is proposed for each task employing
autoencoders as the only learning method. The theoretical developments are put
into practice using a selection of datasets for the different problems and
implementing each solution, followed by a discussion of the results in each
case study and a brief explanation of other six learning applications. We also
explore the current challenges and approaches to explainability in the context

  High-Frequency Radars","16 pages, 11 figures",,,,"eess.SP physics.ao-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We propose two concepts for the significant improvement of surface current
mapping with bistatic oceanographic High-Frequency Radars. These ameliorations
pertain to the azimuthal processing of radar data with linear or quasi-linear
antenna arrays. The first idea is to take advantage of the remote transmitter
to perform an automatic correction of the complex gains of the receiving
antennas based on the analysis of the signal received in the direct path. This
direct signal can be found at the zero-Doppler and minimal range cell in the
Range-Doppler representation. We term this adjustment as ""self-calibration"" of
the receiving array, as it can be performed in real-time without any specific
action from the operator. The second idea consists in applying a Direction
Finding technique (instead of traditional Beam Forming) not only to the full
array of antenna but also to subarrays made of a smaller number of sequential
antennas, a method which we refer to as ""antenna grouping"". The combination of
self-calibration and antenna grouping makes it possible to obtain
high-resolution maps with full coverage, thereby combining the respective
merits of Direction Finding and Beam Forming techniques. In addition the method
is found robust to missing antennas in the array. These techniques are applied
to and illustrated with the multistatic High-Frequency Radar network in Toulon.

application of weight decay as an explicit mechanism of forgetting does not
improve the performance under the considered drift processes. Furthermore, we

solar atmosphere, forming active regions (ARs) including sunspots. Existing
theories of flux emergence suggest that the magnetic flux can rise buoyantly
through the convection zone but is trapped at the photosphere, while its
further rising into the atmosphere resorts to the Parker buoyancy instability.
To trigger such an instability, the Lorentz force in the photosphere needs to
be as large as the gas pressure gradient to hold up an extra amount of mass
against gravity. This naturally results in a strongly non-force-free
photosphere, which is indeed shown in typical idealized numerical simulations
of flux tube buoyancy from below the photosphere into the corona. Here we
conduct a statistical study of the extents of normalized Lorentz forces and
torques in the emerging photospheric magnetic field with a substantially large
sample of SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. We found that the photospheric field has
a rather small Lorentz force and torque on average, and thus is very close to a
force-free state, which is not consistent with theories as well as idealized
simulations of flux emergence. Furthermore, the small extents of forces and
torques seem not to be influenced by the emerging AR's size, the emergence
rate, or the non-potentiality of the field. This result puts an important
constraint on future development of theories and simulations of flux emergence.

while the three-flavor NJL model is used for the quark matter. Exploring the
present uncertainty on the empirical parameters of nuclear matter and the
parameter space of the NJL model, we construct two datasets of
thermodynamically consistent and causal hybrid EoSs, compatible with

core size, the intensity of the phase transition from hadron to quark matter
cannot be strong, having a energy density gap below $200$ MeV/fm$^3$, and must
occur at baryon densities not above four times the saturation density. A non
zero but not too strong quark vector-isoscalar term and a weak vector isovector
quark term are required. Large quark cores carrying almost half of the star

items), but they are utilized to retrieve items in the entire space which
consists of both displayed and non-displayed items (most are long-tail items).
Due to the sample selection bias, the long-tail items lack sufficient records
to learn good feature representations, i.e. data sparsity and cold start
problems. The resultant distribution discrepancy between displayed and
non-displayed items would cause poor long-tail performance. To this end, we
propose an entire space adaptation model (ESAM) to address this problem from
the perspective of domain adaptation (DA). ESAM regards displayed and
non-displayed items as source and target domains respectively. Specifically, we
design the attribute correlation alignment that considers the correlation
between high-level attributes of the item to achieve distribution alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce two effective regularization strategies, i.e.
\textit{center-wise clustering} and \textit{self-training} to improve DA
process. Without requiring any auxiliary information and auxiliary domains,
ESAM transfers the knowledge from displayed items to non-displayed items for
alleviating the distribution inconsistency. Experiments on two public datasets
and a large-scale industrial dataset collected from Taobao demonstrate that
ESAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially in the long-tail space.
Besides, we deploy ESAM to the Taobao search engine, leading to significant
improvement on online performance. The code is available at

  Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Omnidirectional images (also referred to as static 360{\deg} panoramas)
impose viewing conditions much different from those of regular 2D images. How
do humans perceive image distortions in immersive virtual reality (VR)
environments is an important problem which receives less attention. We argue
that, apart from the distorted panorama itself, two types of VR viewing
conditions are crucial in determining the viewing behaviors of users and the
perceived quality of the panorama: the starting point and the exploration time.
We first carry out a psychophysical experiment to investigate the interplay
among the VR viewing conditions, the user viewing behaviors, and the perceived
quality of 360{\deg} images. Then, we provide a thorough analysis of the
collected human data, leading to several interesting findings. Moreover, we
propose a computational framework for objective quality assessment of 360{\deg}
images, embodying viewing conditions and behaviors in a delightful way.
Specifically, we first transform an omnidirectional image to several video
representations using different user viewing behaviors under different viewing
conditions. We then leverage advanced 2D full-reference video quality models to
compute the perceived quality. We construct a set of specific quality measures
within the proposed framework, and demonstrate their promises on three VR
quality databases.

violates social distancing. Also, as the pandemic is expected to stay for a
while, there is a need for an alternate diagnosis tool which overcomes these
limitations, and is deployable at a large scale. The prominent symptoms of
COVID-19 include cough and breathing difficulties. We foresee that respiratory
sounds, when analyzed using machine learning techniques, can provide useful
insights, enabling the design of a diagnostic tool. Towards this, the paper
presents an early effort in creating (and analyzing) a database, called
Coswara, of respiratory sounds, namely, cough, breath, and voice. The sound
samples are collected via worldwide crowdsourcing using a website application.
The curated dataset is released as open access. As the pandemic is evolving,
the data collection and analysis is a work in progress. We believe that
insights from analysis of Coswara can be effective in enabling sound based

in the near future this can help to diagnose COVID-19.

different categories or domains. Given two relevant domains (e.g., Book and
Movie), users may have interactions with items in one domain but not in the
other domain. To the latter, these users are considered as cold-start users.
How to effectively transfer users' preferences based on their interactions from
one domain to the other relevant domain, is the key issue in cross-domain
recommendation. Inspired by the advances made in review-based recommendation,
we propose to model user preference transfer at aspect-level derived from
reviews. To this end, we propose a cross-domain recommendation framework via
aspect transfer network for cold-start users (named CATN). CATN is devised to
extract multiple aspects for each user and each item from their review
documents, and learn aspect correlations across domains with an attention
mechanism. In addition, we further exploit auxiliary reviews from like-minded
users to enhance a user's aspect representations. Then, an end-to-end
optimization framework is utilized to strengthen the robustness of our model.
On real-world datasets, the proposed CATN outperforms SOTA models significantly
in terms of rating prediction accuracy. Further analysis shows that our model
is able to reveal user aspect connections across domains at a fine level of
granularity, making the recommendation explainable.

contain global annotations, making the localisation of diseases a weakly

access to true shared memory concurrency. SharedArrayBuffers are simple linear
buffers of bytes, and the JavaScript specification defines an axiomatic relaxed
memory model to describe their behaviour. While this model is heavily based on
the C/C++11 model, it diverges in some key areas. JavaScript chooses to give a
well-defined semantics to data-races, unlike the ""undefined behaviour"" of
C/C++11. Moreover, the JavaScript model is mixed-size. This means that its
accesses are not to discrete locations, but to (possibly overlapping) ranges of
bytes.
  We show that the model, in violation of the design intention, does not
support a compilation scheme to ARMv8 which is used in practice. We propose a
correction, which also incorporates a previously proposed fix for a failure of
the model to provide Sequential Consistency of Data-Race-Free programs
(SC-DRF), an important correctness condition. We use model checking, in Alloy,
to generate small counter-examples for these deficiencies, and investigate our
correction. To accomplish this, we also develop a mixed-size extension to the
existing ARMv8 axiomatic model.
  Guided by our Alloy experimentation, we mechanise (in Coq) the JavaScript
model (corrected and uncorrected), our ARMv8 model, and, for the corrected
JavaScript model, a ""model-internal"" SC-DRF proof and a compilation scheme
correctness proof to ARMv8. In addition, we investigate a non-mixed-size subset
of the corrected JavaScript model, and give proofs of compilation correctness
for this subset to x86-TSO, Power, RISC-V, ARMv7, and (again) ARMv8, via the

to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the nonlinear reconstruction of

accurately reconstruct the nonlinearities in both simulations and a lab

suboptimal closed loop performance under simulated atmospheric turbulence.
However, it is demonstrated that using a CNN to estimate the nonlinear error
term on top of a linear model results in an improved effective dynamic range of
a simulated adaptive optics system. The larger effective dynamic range results
in a higher Strehl ratio under conditions where the nonlinear error is
relevant. This will allow the current and future generation of large
astronomical telescopes to work in a wider range of atmospheric conditions and
therefore reduce costly downtime of such facilities.

invariably to the solution of an optimised effective potential (OEP) equation

this problem and demonstrate with numerous examples that despite well-known
mathematical issues of the OEP with finite basis sets, our OEP equations are
well behaved. We demonstrate that constraining the screening charge of the
Hartree, exchange and correlation potential not only corrects its asymptotic

performance scales in terms of the base station (BS) spatial density $\lambda$,

spectral efficiency (ASE). If the number of antennas at each BS scales at least
linearly with $\lambda$, which increases the number of possible beam

prove that the SINR approaches a finite random variable that is independent of
$\lambda$ and the ASE scales at least linearly with $\lambda$. In contrast, if
the number of antennas scales sub-linearly with $\lambda$, then the SINR decays
to zero and the ASE saturates to a constant. Thus, by moving to higher carrier
frequencies with successively smaller antennas, and exploiting the
correspondingly increased directionality, cellular operators can in principle
avoid the densification plateau (or collapse) in cellular networks and instead
continue to harvest linear sum throughput gains through BS densification.

restart of the UK economy. Our economic model is designed to address the unique
features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both
supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting
economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to
model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts
conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry
are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also
includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption.
We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of
production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects,
and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few
industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and
contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the
transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening
scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the
increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that
yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in
economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer
facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare,
and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.

single, flat extra dimension, where a fat brane is localized and contains the
standard model (SM) fields, similar to Universal Extra Dimension models. There
is only one Dirac fermion in the bulk, and in four dimensions it results in two
towers of Kaluza-Klein (KK) Majorana sterile neutrinos, whose mass mixing with
the SM neutrinos is suppressed due to a brane-localized kinetic term. The
interaction between the sterile neutrinos and the SM is through the usual
coupling with the Higgs boson, where the coupling depends upon the
compactification radius $R^{-1}=10^{-2}-1$ GeV and the width of the fat brane
$L^{-1}=2$ TeV, where the latter value is chosen to avoid LHC constraints. Due
to this suppression mechanism the mass of the lightest sterile neutrinos can be
of order $\mathcal{O}(1-10)$~\text{TeV} while naturally explaining the small SM
neutrino mass, which in turn is easily obtained for a large range of parameter
choices. Furthermore, neutrino oscillations are not substantially influenced by
the tower of sterile KK particles. Finally, leptogenesis is investigated in
this setup, and it is viable for some values within the parameter space.

elements of the chirality operator sandwiched between two eigenstates of the
staggered Dirac operator are related to those of the shift operator by the Ward
identity of the conserved $U(1)_A$ symmetry of staggered fermion actions. We
perform a numerical study in quenched QCD using HYP staggered quarks to
demonstrate the Ward identity. We introduce a new concept of leakage patterns
which collectively represent the matrix elements of the chirality operator and
the shift operator sandwiched between two eigenstates of the staggered Dirac
operator. The leakage pattern provides a new method to identify zero modes and
non-zero modes in the Dirac eigenvalue spectrum. This method is as robust as
the spectral flow method but requires much less computing power. Analysis using
a machine learning technique confirms that the leakage pattern is universal,
since the staggered Dirac eigenmodes on normal gauge configurations respect it.
In addition, the leakage pattern can be used to determine a ratio of
renormalization factors as a by-product. We conclude that it might be possible
and realistic to measure the topological charge $Q$ using the Atiya-Singer
index theorem and the leakage pattern of the chirality operator in the

sensitivity to identify extreme solar particle events (SPEs). First, the
strongest directly observed SPE (23-Feb-1956), used as a reference for
proxy-based reconstructions, was revisited using the newly developed method.
Next, the sensitivity of the cosmogenic-isotope method to detect a reference
SPE was assessed against the precision and number of individual isotopic
records, showing that it is too weak by a factor $\approx$30 to be reliably
identified in a single record. Uncertainties of 10Be and 14C data are shown to
be dominated by local/regional patterns and measurement errors, respectively.
By combining several proxy records, an SPE 4--5 times stronger than the
reference one can be potentially detected, increasing the present-day
sensitivity by an order of magnitude. This will allow filling the observational
gap in SPE strength distribution, thus enriching statistics of extreme events
from 3--4 presently known ones to several tens. This will provide a solid basis
for research in the field of extreme events, both for fundamental science, viz.
solar and stellar physics, and practical applications, such as the risk

leading to a $14\times 28$ noise coefficient matrix $S$. We show that (i) the

sample trajectories of the 14D representation are pathwise equivalent to
trajectories of Fox and Lu's system, as well as trajectories of several
existing Langevin models; (iv) our 14D representation (and those equivalent to
it) give the most accurate interspike-interval distribution, not only with
respect to moments but under both the $L_1$ and $L_\infty$ metric-space norms;
and (v) the 14D representation gives an approximation to exact Markov chain
simulations that are as fast and as efficient as all equivalent models. Our

Dust temperature exhibit a gradient inside a clump, decreasing from the edge to
the center by several degrees for a clump of a size of 0.1 au and larger. We
argue that dust temperatures and high opacity within clumps larger than 0.1 au

sequential recommendation. Existing neural sequential recommenders typically
adopt a generative way trained with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). When
context information (called factor) is involved, it is difficult to analyze
when and how each individual factor would affect the final recommendation
performance. For this purpose, we take a new perspective and introduce
adversarial learning to sequential recommendation. In this paper, we present a
Multi-Factor Generative Adversarial Network (MFGAN) for explicitly modeling the
effect of context information on sequential recommendation. Specifically, our
proposed MFGAN has two kinds of modules: a Transformer-based generator taking
user behavior sequences as input to recommend the possible next items, and
multiple factor-specific discriminators to evaluate the generated sub-sequence
from the perspectives of different factors. To learn the parameters, we adopt
the classic policy gradient method, and utilize the reward signal of
discriminators for guiding the learning of the generator. Our framework is
flexible to incorporate multiple kinds of factor information, and is able to
trace how each factor contributes to the recommendation decision over time.
Extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the

Graph-Based Entropy to represent the variety of price changes based on the

pump-probe experiments. This implies multiple measurements where the sample
under investigation is pumped with a short light pulse and then probed with a
second pulse at various time delays to follow its dynamics. Recently, the
principle of streaking extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses in the temporal domain
has enabled recording the dynamics of a system within a single pulse. However,
separate pump-probe experiments at different absorption edges still lack a
unified timing, when comparing the dynamics in complex systems. Here we report
on an experiment using a dedicated optical element and the two-color emission
of the FERMI XUV free-electron laser to follow the charge and spin dynamics in
composite materials at two distinct absorption edges, simultaneously. The
sample, consisting of ferromagnetic Fe and Ni layers, separated by a Cu layer,
is pumped by an infrared laser and probed by a two-color XUV pulse with photon
energies tuned to the M edges of these two transition metals. The experimental
geometry intrinsically avoids any timing uncertainty between the two elements
and unambiguously reveals an approximately 100 fs delay of the magnetic
response with respect to the electronic excitation for both Fe and Ni. This
delay shows that the electronic and spin degrees of freedom are decoupled
during the demagnetization process. These observations underline the importance
of simultaneous investigation of the temporal response of both charge and spin
in multi-component materials. In a more general scenario, the experimental
approach can be extended to continuous energy ranges, promising the development
of jitter-free transient absorption spectroscopy in the XUV and soft X-ray

such an offline learning approach has many benefits compared to an online one,

Unbiased LTR uses Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) to enable unbiased learning
from logged user interactions. One of the major difficulties in applying
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approaches to counterfactual learning
problems is the large variance introduced by the propensity weights. In this
paper we show that the convergence rate of SGD approaches with IPS-weighted
gradients suffers from the large variance introduced by the IPS weights:
convergence is slow, especially when there are large IPS weights. To overcome
this limitation, we propose a novel learning algorithm, called CounterSample,
that has provably better convergence than standard IPS-weighted gradient
descent methods. We prove that CounterSample converges faster and complement
our theoretical findings with empirical results by performing extensive
experimentation in a number of biased LTR scenarios -- across optimizers, batch

longitudinal image coverage was worse in short-segment BE. OCT candidate

First, we
review the influence of the gravitational field of the Earth on the quantum
Hall effect. Taking the gravitational field of the Earth to be uniform along
the vertical direction, we compute the affected quantized Hall resistivity.
Then, we investigate how the gravitational field modifies the Landau levels of
a particle moving between two massive hemispheres in the presence of a constant
and uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of motion. We find that
the familiar degeneracy of the Landau levels is removed and the spacing between
the latter becomes dependent on the mass density of the hemispheres and on the
gravitational constant $G$. We use this result to show that the quantum Hall
effect in a thin conductor, sandwiched between two massive hemispheres, should
yield a slightly different variation of the Hall resistivity with the applied
magnetic field. We then argue that the well-known problem of the
gravitationally induced electric field, that might a priori be thought to
hinder the effect of gravity, has actually a beneficial role as it amplifies
the latter. We finally discuss whether there is a possibility of using the
quantum Hall effect to probe the inverse-square law of gravity.

understated. With the sheer volume of potentially useful compounds that are
considered for use, it is becoming increasingly computationally difficult to
investigate the overlapping interactions between drugs. Understanding this is
also important to the layperson who needs to know what they can and cannot mix,
especially for those who use recreational drugs - which do not have the same
rigorous warnings as prescription drugs. Without access to deterministic,
experimental results for every drug combination, other methods are necessary to
bridge this knowledge gap. Ideally, such a method would require minimal inputs,
have high accuracy, and be computationally feasible. We have not come across a
model that meets all these criteria. To this end, we propose a minimal-input
multi-layer perceptron that predicts the interactions between two drugs. This
model has a great advantage of requiring no structural knowledge of the
molecules in question, and instead only uses experimentally accessible chemical
and physical properties - 20 per compound in total. Using a set of known
drug-drug interactions, and associated properties of the drugs involved, we
trained our model on a dataset of about 650,000 entries. We report an accuracy
of 0.968 on unseen samples of interactions between drugs on which the model was
trained, and an accuracy of 0.942 on unseen samples of interactions between
unseen drugs. We believe this to be a promising and highly extensible model

perspective of machine learning which detects such behavior in a static
context. However, the way aggression diffuses in the network has received
little attention as it embeds modeling challenges. In fact, modeling how
aggression propagates from one user to another, is an important research topic
since it can enable effective aggression monitoring, especially in media
platforms which up to now apply simplistic user blocking techniques. In this
paper, we address aggression propagation modeling and minimization on Twitter,
since it is a popular microblogging platform at which aggression had several
onsets. We propose various methods building on two well-known diffusion models,
Independent Cascade (IC) and Linear Threshold (LT), to study the aggression
evolution in the social network. We experimentally investigate how well each
method can model aggression propagation using real Twitter data, while varying
parameters, such as seed users selection, graph edge weighting, users'
activation timing, etc. It is found that the best performing strategies are the
ones to select seed users with a degree-based approach, weigh user edges based
on their social circles' overlaps, and activate users according to their
aggression levels. We further employ the best performing models to predict
which ordinary real users could become aggressive (and vice versa) in the
future, and achieve up to AUC=0.89 in this prediction task. Finally, we
investigate aggression minimization by launching competitive cascades to
""inform"" and ""heal"" aggressors. We show that IC and LT models can be used in
aggression minimization, providing less intrusive alternatives to the blocking
techniques currently employed by popular online social network platforms.

latches and logic are added, inhibiting an attacker from determining the actual

locking insertion flow, analyzed PPA and ATPG overhead on benchmark circuits

taped out a demonstration chip. Importantly, we show that the design overhead
with this approach is significantly less than with previous logic locking
schemes, while resisting model checker-based, oracle-driven attacks. With
minimal delay overhead, large numbers of decoy latches can be added, cheaply

as an hypothesis testing problem where we observe a single instance of a graph.
The null hypothesis, corresponding to the absence of a botnet, is modeled as a
random geometric graph where every vertex is assigned a location on a
$d$-dimensional torus and two vertices are connected when their distance is
smaller than a certain threshold. The alternative hypothesis is similar, except
that there is a small number of vertices, called the botnet, that ignore this
geometric structure and simply connect randomly to every other vertex with a
prescribed probability.
  We present two tests that are able to detect the presence of such a botnet.
The first test is based on the idea that botnet vertices tend to form large
isolated stars that are not present under the null hypothesis. The second test
uses the average graph distance, which becomes significantly shorter under the
alternative hypothesis. We show that both these tests are asymptotically
optimal. However, numerical simulations show that the isolated star test
performs significantly better than the average distance test on networks of
moderate size. Finally, we construct a robust scheme based on the isolated star
test that is also able to identify the vertices in the botnet.

of the Hubble constant $H_0$ can be reformulated as a tension in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) monopole temperature $T_0$. The latter is
customarily fixed to the FIRAS best-fit value in CMB data analyses. Although
this value was confirmed by several independent experiments, it is interesting
to see how much parameter constraints depend on this prior. We first provide a
detailed pedagogical description of the $T_0$ effects on cosmological
observables. We show that the recombination history and transfer functions do
not depend on $T_0$, provided they are parametrized by the energy scale rather
than redshift, and at fixed dark matter and baryon densities per CMB photon.
Thus, $T_0$ is only a property of the observer, quantifying the amount of
expansion between key cosmological events and today. As a consequence, the sole
effect of $T_0$ on small-scale primary CMB anisotropies is through the angular
diameter distance to the epoch of last scattering, resulting in a near-perfect
degeneracy between $T_0$ and $H_0$. This geometric degeneracy is partially
lifted by the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and CMB lensing. Still,
Planck data alone is consistent with a broad region in the $H_0-T_0$ plane,
implying that removing the FIRAS prior on $T_0$ can make Planck and SH0ES less
discrepant, without introducing new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM. One may break
the degeneracy by combining Planck with SH0ES, yielding an independent
measurement of $T_0$, which happens to be in $3\sigma$ tension with FIRAS.
Therefore, the Hubble tension indeed can be recast into the $T_0$ tension. The
agreement with FIRAS is restored when combining Planck with the baryon acoustic
oscillation data instead of SH0ES. Thus, the tension between SH0ES and
cosmological measurements of $H_0$ persists even if we discard the FIRAS $T_0$
prior.

photoconductive gains up to 10$^{8}$ electrons per photon. These photodetectors
rely on a highly absorbing layer in close proximity of graphene, which induces
a shift of the graphene chemical potential upon absorption, hence modifying its
channel resistance. However, due to the semi-metallic nature of graphene, the
readout requires dark currents of hundreds of $\mu$A up to mA, leading to high
power consumption needed for the device operation. Here we propose a novel
approach for highly responsive graphene-based photodetectors with orders of
magnitude lower dark current levels. A shift of the graphene chemical potential
caused by light absorption in a layer of colloidal quantum dots, induces a
variation of the current flowing across a metal-insulator-graphene diode
structure. Owing to the low density of states of graphene near the neutrality
point, the light-induced shift in chemical potential can be relatively large,
dramatically changing the amount of current flowing across the insulating
barrier, and giving rise to a novel type of gain mechanism. This readout
requires dark currents of hundreds of nA up to few $\mu$A, orders of magnitude
lower than other graphene-based photodetectors, while keeping responsivities of
$\sim$70A/W in the infrared, almost two orders of magnitude higher compared to
established germanium on silicon and indium gallium arsenide infrared
photodetectors. This makes the device appealing for applications where high
responsivity and low power consumption are required.

Euler class of a relevant bundle and then finding out the corresponding
degenerate contribution to the Euler class. The method we use is closely based
on the method followed by A. Zinger and I. Biswas, S. D'Mello, R. Mukherjee and
V. Pingali. We also verify that our answer for the characteristic numbers of
rational cuspidal planar cubics and quartics is consistent with the answer
obtained by N. Das and the first author, where they compute the characteristic
number of $\delta$-nodal planar curves in $\mathbb{P}^3$ with one cusp (for
$\delta \leq 2$).

finite alphabet $A$, the rank of $X$ is the minimal cardinality of a set $F$
such that $X \subseteq F^*$. We say that a submonoid $M$ generated by $k$
elements of $A^*$ is {\em $k$-maximal} if there does not exist another
submonoid generated by at most $k$ words containing $M$. We call a set $X
\subseteq A^*$ {\em primitive} if it is the basis of a $|X|$-maximal submonoid.
This definition encompasses the notion of primitive word -- in fact, $\{w\}$ is
a primitive set if and only if $w$ is a primitive word. By definition, for any
set $X$, there exists a primitive set $Y$ such that $X \subseteq Y^*$. We
therefore call $Y$ a {\em primitive root} of $X$. As a main result, we prove
that if a set has rank $2$, then it has a unique primitive root. To obtain this
result, we prove that the intersection of two $2$-maximal submonoids is either
the empty word or a submonoid generated by one single primitive word. For a
single word $w$, we say that the set $\{x,y\}$ is a {\em bi-root} of $w$ if $w$
can be written as a concatenation of copies of $x$ and $y$ and $\{x,y\}$ is a
primitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at most one bi-root
$\{x,y\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the bi-root of a word is
unique provided the word is sufficiently long with respect to the size (sum of
lengths) of the root. Our results are also compared to previous approaches that
investigate pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive function $\theta$ is
defined on $A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\theta$-power,
$\theta$-primitive and $\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word
has a unique $\theta$-primitive root. This result can be obtained with our
approach by showing that a word $w$ is $\theta$-primitive if and only if $\{w,
\theta(w)\}$ is a primitive set.

express it as a simple functional of the density or of other local observables,

is the state-of the art approach to perform high dimensional regressions and
classification tasks, and is becoming widely used in the condensed matter
community to develop increasingly accurate density functionals. Autoencoders
are deep learning models that perform efficient dimensionality reduction,
allowing the distillation of data to its fundamental features needed to
represent it. By training autoencoders on a large data-set of 1-RDMs from
exactly solvable real-space model systems, and performing principal component
analysis, the machine learns to what extent the data can be compressed and
hence how it is constrained. We gain insight into these machine learned
constraints and employ them to inform approximations to the 1-RDM as a
functional of the charge density. We exploit known physical properties of the
1-RDM in the simplest possible cases to perform feature engineering, where we
inform the structure of the models from known mathematical relations, allowing
us to integrate existing understanding into the machine learning methods. By
comparing various deep learning approaches we gain insight into what physical
features of the density matrix are most amenable to machine learning, utilising

evaluated for both superconducting LECO and non-superconducting NCO and found
to be 0.40 and 0.05 electrons per Cu, respectively. In LECO but not in NCO,
extended X-ray absorption fine structure analysis revealed a softening in the
strength of the Cu-O bond in the CuO$_2$ plane due to annealing, which is
consistent with the screening effect on phonons in the metallic state. Since
the amounts of oxygen loss due to annealing ($\delta$) for LECO and NCO are
comparable with each other, these results suggest distinct electron-doping
processes in the two compounds. That electron-doping in NCO approximately
follows the relation $n_{\rm AN}=2\delta$ can be understood if electrons are
doped through oxygen deficiency, but the anneal-induced metallic nature and
large $n_{\rm AN}$ of LECO suggest a variation of the electronic band structure
causes self-doping of carriers. The origin of the difference in doping
processes due to annealing is discussed in connection with the size of the

$d=3.97$~nm contained by the perfect graphene layers and crystallizing under
external stationary electric field. It was found that the electric field
applied perpendicular to graphene layers impedes structural ordering, while the
electric field applied in lateral direction contributes to formation of the
cubic ice ($Ic$) phase, which is thermodynamically less stable compared to the
hexagonal ice ($Ih$) phase. It is shown that the growth of the $Ic$ crystalline
phase occurs without formation of intermediate crystalline phases. It was found
that the crystallization rate depends strongly on the magnitude of the applied
electric field. In particular, the processes of full electrocrystallization of
the system do not appear over simulation time scale ($\sim 40$~ns) if the
electric field of the magnitude less than $0.07~\rm{V/\AA}$ is applied.

time and memory consumption by: 1) attempting to minimize execution time across
the whole network by selecting data layouts and primitive operations to
implement each layer; and 2) allocating an appropriate workspace that reflects
the upper bound of memory footprint per layer. These two optimization
strategies can be used to run any CNN on any platform with a C compiler. Our
evaluation with a range of popular ImageNet neural architectures (GoogleNet,
AlexNet, VGG, ResNet and SqueezeNet) on the ARM Cortex-A15 yields speedups of
8x compared to a greedy algorithm based primitive selection, reduces memory

at the dual level $\ell$. Conversely a diagonal Heisenberg coset of the
principal W-superalgebra at level $\ell$ times the lattice vertex superalgebra
$V_{\sqrt{-1}\mathbb Z}$ is the subregular W-algebra at the dual level k. Again
this is proven for the universal W-algebras as well as for the simple
quotients. We show that a consequence of the Kazama-Suzuki type construction is
that the simple principal W-superalgebra and its Heisenberg coset at level
$\ell$ are rational and/or C_2-cofinite if the same is true for the simple
subregular W-algebra at dual level $\ell$. This gives many new C_2-cofiniteness

previously applied to clusters of atoms where it was demonstrated to converge
in select cases where SCF had difficulty with convergence. In the present work
we implement it-TDDFT propagation for {\it periodic systems} by modifying the
Quantum ESPRESSO package, which uses a plane-wave basis with multiple

DFT+U calculations with ultra-soft pseudo potentials. Our implementation of
it-TDDFT propagation converges to the exact SCF energy (up to the decimal
guaranteed by double precision) in all but one case where it converged to a
slightly lower value than SCF, suggesting a useful alternative for systems
where SCF has difficulty to reach the Kohn-Sham ground state. In addition, we

first dichotomy is for any $k,l\ge2$ and says that the growth function is
either eventually constant or at least $n-k+2$. The second dichotomy is only
for $k=3,l=2$ and says that the growth function of an ideal of edge two-colored
complete $3$-uniform hypergraphs grows either at most polynomially, or for
$n\ge23$ at least as $G_n$ where $G_n$ is the sequence defined by $G_1=G_2=1$,

by quasi-one dimensional XXZ models, which enjoy the property of quantum
integrability. In these instances, one can in principle use their underlying
algebraic structure to describe very precisely how excitations, the so-called
spinons, participate in dynamical correlations functions. Even though the
available theories (either algebraic Bethe ansatz or quantum group approach)
provide all the needed physical quantities such as form factors, complete set
of eigenstates and spectrum, it is typically a rather daunting task, however,
to obtain sufficiently simple analytical expressions for computing Dynamical
Structure Factors (DSFs), valuable, e.g., for parameters estimation based on
experimental data. This is particularly the case for the longitudinal DSF of
the XXZ model, which has eluded a formal mathematical treatment thus far. Using
the quantum group approach, we present here an exact and simple expression of

  and Engagement",,,,,"cs.GT econ.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Volunteer crowdsourcing platforms match volunteers with tasks which are often
recurring. To ensure completion of such tasks, platforms frequently use a lever
known as ""adoption,"" which amounts to a commitment by the volunteer to
repeatedly perform the task. Despite reducing match uncertainty, high levels of
adoption can decrease the probability of forming new matches, which in turn can
suppress growth. We study how platforms should manage this trade-off. Our
research is motivated by a collaboration with Food Rescue U.S. (FRUS), a
volunteer-based food recovery organization active in over 30 locations. For
platforms such as FRUS, success crucially depends on volunteer engagement.
Consequently, effectively utilizing non-monetary levers, such as adoption, is
critical. Motivated by the volunteer management literature and our analysis of
FRUS data, we develop a model for two-sided markets which repeatedly match
volunteers with tasks. Our model incorporates match uncertainty as well as the
negative impact of failing to match on future engagement. We study the
platform's optimal policy for setting the adoption level to maximize the total
discounted number of matches. We fully characterize the optimal myopic policy
and show that it takes a simple form: depending on volunteer characteristics
and market thickness, either allow for full adoption or disallow adoption. In
the long run, we show that such a policy is either optimal or achieves a
constant-factor approximation. Our finding is robust to incorporating
heterogeneity in volunteer behavior. Our work sheds light on how two-sided
platforms need to carefully control the double-edged impacts that commitment
levers have on growth and engagement. A one-size-fits-all solution may not be
effective, as the optimal design crucially depends on the characteristics of
the volunteer population.

directly related to how well one can hide the structure of an error-correcting
code, the security reduction of the HQC encryption framework is independent of
the nature of the auxiliary decoding procedure which is publicly available.
What is expected from it is that the decoding algorithm is both efficient and
has a decoding failure rate which can be easily modelized and analyzed. The
original error-correction procedure proposed for the HQC framework was to use
tensor products of BCH codes and repetition codes. In this paper we consider
another code family for removing the error vector deriving from the general
framework: the concatenation of Reed-Muller and Reed-Solomon codes. We denote
this instantiation of the HQC framework by HQC-RMRS. These codes yield better
decoding results than the BCH and repetition codes: overall we gain roughly
17\% in the size of the key and the ciphertext, while keeping a simple
modelization of the decoding error rate. The paper also presents a simplified

element framework to study the diffusion-coupled growth and morphogenesis of
finite bodies formed on uniform and flat substrates. We find that in this
simplified growth setting, the evolving body exhibits a sequence of distinct
growth stages that are reminiscent of natural systems, and appear spontaneously
without any externally imposed regulation or coordination. The computational
framework developed in this work can serve as the basis for future models that
are able to account for growth in arbitrary geometrical settings, and can shed
light on the basic physical laws that orchestrate growth and morphogenesis in
the natural world.

large class of problems involving gradual slopes, a wide range of sediment

The variable rotated parabolic equation is not effective for problems involving
frequent or continuous changes in slope, but it provides a high level of
accuracy for most of the test cases, which have regions of constant slope.
Approaches based on a coordinate mapping and on using a film of solid material

measures that capture different aspects of signal operations. The proposed
method can serve as a tool to guide agencies looking to alter their signal

evaluation of travel rate based upon non-dynamic days. Dynamic days represent
the variability of traffic on a segment. Performance measures on non-dynamic
days include Median Travel Rate, Within-Day Variability of travel rate,
between-days variability of travel rate Minimum Travel Rate Dispersion, and two
variables which include Overall Travel Rate Variabilities. Consequently, a
corridor having high number of dynamic segments along with poor performance

conducted on 11 corridors within Des Moines, Iowa where Merle Hay Road and

estimate the receiver position using 3 LEDs regardless of the LEDs'
orientations. R-P3P first utilizes visual information captured by the camera to
estimate the incidence angles of visible lights. Then, R-P3P calculates the
candidate distances between the LEDs and the receiver based on the law of
cosines and the Wu-Ritt's zero decomposition method. Based on the incidence
angles, the candidate distances and the physical characteristics of the LEDs,
R-P3P can select the exact distances from all the candidate distances. Finally,
the linear least square (LLS) method is employed to estimate the position of
the receiver. Due to the combination of visual and strength information of
visible light signals, R-P3P can achieve high accuracy using 3 LEDs regardless
of the LEDs' orientations. Simulation results show that R-P3P can achieve
positioning accuracy within 10 cm over 70% indoor area with low complexity

120, 230501 (2018)], many discussions on this topic have been published. In
this paper, we consider relationship between quantum multipartite maskers

pure states of a system $K$ can be masked by an operator $S$ into a
multipartite system $\H^{(n)}$ if all of the image states $S|\psi\>$ of states
$|\psi\>$ in $Q$ have the same marginal states on each subsystem. We call such

relationship between QMMs and QECCs, which reads that an isometry is a QMM of
all pure states of a system if and only if its range is a QECC of any
one-erasure channel. As an application, we prove that there is no an isometric
universal masker from $\C^2$ into $\C^2\otimes\C^2\otimes\C^2$ and then the
states of $\C^3$ can not be masked isometrically into
$\C^2\otimes\C^2\otimes\C^2$. This gives a consummation to a main result and

Another application is that arbitrary quantum states of $\C^d$ can be
completely hidden in correlations between any two subsystems of the tripartite
system $\C^{d+1}\otimes\C^{d+1}\otimes\C^{d+1}$, while arbitrary quantum states
cannot be completely hidden in the correlations between subsystems of a

which was recently reported in Schwarzschild black holes backgrounds, in which
the longest-lived modes are the ones with higher angular number, for a scalar
field mass smaller than a critical value, while that beyond this value the
behavior is inverted. We study the QNMs for various overtone numbers and they
depend on a parameter $\beta$ which appears in the metric and characterizes the
$f(R)$ gravity. For small $\beta$, i.e small deviations from the
Schwarzschild-dS black hole the anomalous behaviour in the QNMs is present for
the photon sphere modes, and the critical value of the mass of the scalar field
depends on the parameter $\beta$ while for large $\beta$, i.e large deviations
the anomalous behaviour and the critical mass does not appear. Also, the
critical mass of the scalar field increases when the overtone number increases
until the $f(R)$ gravity parameter $\beta$ approaches the near extremal limit

determine optimal decisions by using an often costly optimization, which
typically does not scale for large problems. We propose a rule-based and
utility-driven adaptation scheme that achieves the benefits of both directions
such that the adaptation decisions are optimal, whereas the computation scales
by avoiding an expensive optimization. We use this adaptation scheme for
architecture-based self-healing of large software systems. For this purpose, we
define the utility for large dynamic architectures of such systems based on
patterns that define issues the self-healing must address. Moreover, we use
pattern-based adaptation rules to resolve these issues. Using a pattern-based

impact of each rule application on the overall utility and to realize an
incremental and efficient utility-driven self-healing. In addition to formally
analyzing the computational effort and optimality of the proposed scheme, we

ubiquitous coherent ion-scale waves in the inner heliosphere, which are
signatures of kinetic wave-particle interactions and fluid-scale instabilities.
However, initial studies of the circularly polarized ion-scale waves observed
by PSP have only thoroughly analyzed magnetic field signatures, precluding a
determination of solar-wind frame propagation direction and intrinsic
wave-polarization. A comprehensive determination of wave-properties requires
measurements of both electric and magnetic fields. Here, we use full
capabilities of the PSP/FIELDS instrument suite to measure both the electric
and magnetic components of circularly polarized waves. Comparing spacecraft
frame magnetic field measurements with the Doppler-shifted cold-plasma
dispersion relation for parallel transverse waves constrains allowable plasma
frame polarizations and wave-vectors. We demonstrate that the Doppler-shifted
cold-plasma dispersion has a maximum spacecraft frequency $f_{sc}^{*}$ for
which intrinsically right-handed fast-magnetosonic waves (FMWs) propagating
sunwards can appear left-handed in the spacecraft frame. Observations of
left-handed waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$ are uniquely explained by intrinsically
left-handed, ion-cyclotron, waves (ICWs). We demonstrate that electric field
measurements for waves with $|f|>f_{sc}^{*}$ are consistent with ICWs
propagating away from the sun, verifying the measured electric field. Applying
the verified electric field measurements to the full distribution of waves
suggests that, in the solar wind frame, the vast majority of waves propagate
away from the sun, indicating that the observed population of coherent
ion-scale waves contains both intrinsically left and right hand polarized
modes.

representations and models using parametric matrix-variate distributions to
approximate the diffusion tensor distribution (DTD) $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{D})$.
Theory: We establish practical mathematical tools, the matrix moments of the
DTD, enabling to compute the mean diffusion tensor and covariance tensor
associated with any parametric matrix-variate DTD whose moment-generating
function is known. As a proof of concept, we apply these tools to the
non-central matrix-variate Gamma (nc-mv-Gamma) distribution, whose covariance
tensor was so far unknown, and design a new signal representation capturing
intra-voxel heterogeneity via a single nc-mv-Gamma distribution: the
matrix-variate Gamma approximation. Methods: Furthering this proof of concept,
we evaluate the matrix-variate Gamma approximation in silico and in vivo, in a
human-brain 'tensor-valued' diffusion MRI dataset. Results: The matrix-variate
Gamma approximation fails to capture the heterogeneity arising from orientation
dispersion and from simultaneous variances in the trace (size) and anisotropy
(shape) of the underlying diffusion tensors, which is explained by the
structure of the covariance tensor associated with the nc-mv-Gamma
distribution. Conclusion: The matrix moments promote a more widespread use of
matrix-variate distributions as plausible approximations of the DTD by
alleviating their intractability, thereby facilitating the design/validation of
matrix-variate microstructural techniques.

in The Future of High-Resolution Radio Interferometry in Space series. The
first meeting (2018 September 5--6; Noordwijk, the Netherlands) focused on the
full range of science applications possible for very long baseline
interferometry (VLBI) with space-based antennas. Accordingly, the observing
frequencies (wavelengths) considered ranged from below 1~MHz (> 300 m) to above
300~GHz (< 1 mm). For this second meeting, the focus was narrowed to mission
concepts and the supporting technologies to enable the highest angular
resolution observations at frequencies of 30~GHz and higher (< 1 cm).
  This narrowing of focus was driven by both scientific and technical
considerations. First, results from the RadioAstron mission and the Event
Horizon Telescope (EHT) have generated considerable excitement for studying the
inner portions of black hole (BH) accretion disks and jets and testing elements
of the General Theory of Relativity (GR). Second, the technologies and
requirements involved in space-based VLBI differ considerably between 100~MHz
and 100~GHz; a related consideration is that there are a number of existing
instruments or mission concepts for frequencies of approximately 100~MHz and
below, while it has been some time since attention has been devoted to space
VLBI at frequencies above 10~GHz.

However, the previous work had largely ignored how individual preferences may

with few exceptions, researchers have only considered scenarios in which
fairness is measured relative to a single sensitive feature or attribute (such

fairness-aware recommendation that learns individual preferences across
multiple fairness dimensions and uses them to enhance provider fairness in
recommendation results. Specifically, we show that our opportunistic and

fairness than prior re-ranking approaches and does so across multiple fairness

to encourage agents to trade with their neighboring agents. In addition, a
reputation factor is considered for each agent, reflecting its past performance
in delivering the committed energy. Before starting the negotiation, agents
select their trading partners based on their preferences over the reputation

this result by proving that, in a broader setting, the Bayes optimal fair

justification to the post-processing approach in fair classification, in which

unobserved quantities of interest through PDEs, PI-GANs allow for the
estimation of underlying probability distributions without their direct
measurement (i.e. inverse problems). The scalable nature of GANs allows
high-dimensional, spatially-dependent probability distributions (i.e., random

allows the training datasets to be relatively small.
  In this work, PI-GANs are demonstrated for the application of elastic modulus
estimation in mechanical testing. Given measured deformation data, the
underlying probability distribution of spatially-varying elastic modulus
(stiffness) is learned. Two feed-forward deep neural network generators are
used to model the deformation and material stiffness across a two dimensional
domain. Wasserstein GANs with gradient penalty are employed for enhanced
stability. In the absence of explicit training data, it is demonstrated that
the PI-GAN learns to generate realistic, physically-admissible realizations of
material stiffness by incorporating the PDE that relates it to the measured
deformation. It is shown that the statistics (mean, standard deviation,
