are not preserved at the boundaries of the sample, gapless hinge modes or
in-gap corner states cannot be stabilized. Therefore, careful engineering of
the sample termination is required. Similarly, magnetic textures, whose quantum
fluctuations determine the supported magnonic excitations, tend to relax to new
configurations that may also break crystalline symmetries when boundaries are
introduced. Here we uncover that antiskyrmion crystals provide an
experimentally accessible platform to realize a magnonic topological quadrupole
insulator, whose hallmark signature are robust magnonic corner states.
Furthermore, we show that tuning an applied magnetic field can trigger the
self-assembly of antiskyrmions carrying a fractional topological charge along
the sample edges. Crucially, these fractional antiskyrmions restore the
symmetries needed to enforce the emergence of the magnonic corner states. Using
the machinery of nested Wilson loops, adapted to magnonic systems supported by
noncollinear magnetic textures, we demonstrate the quantization of the bulk
quadrupole moment, edge dipole moments, and corner charges.

tests with varying geometries of the flaplets were conducted in the anechoic
wind tunnel at Brandenburg University of Technology, at chord based Reynolds
numbers, $Re_c = 100,000 - 900,000$ at three geometric angles of attack
$\alpha_g = 0^\circ, 10^\circ$ and $15^\circ$. It was observed that all flaplet
configurations reduce tonal noise and that the key geometric parameter to
reduce this noise component is the width of the flaplets. The narrowest
configuration tested almost completely removed the tonal noise, leading to an
average overall sound pressure level reduction of up to 9 dB across the entire
$Re_c$ range at $\alpha_g = 10^\circ$. It was also observed that, in the low
frequency regime, a further noise reduction can be achieved by tuning the
natural frequency of the oscillating flaplets. The thereby affected frequency
range in the noise spectrum moves to higher frequencies when the natural
frequency of the flaplets is increased and vice versa. Hence we show a novel
way to target specific frequencies in passive aerofoil self-noise cancellation.

judiciously solved in a black-box fashion to generate data and to set up the
error estimator. In the online phase, the estimator is used to bound the error
of the reduced-model predictions for new initial conditions and new control

systematically underestimates the coefficient of inter-diffusion yet provides
reliable estimates for the relatively weakly coupled plasmas found in nearly
all types of stars as well as in white dwarfs with hydrogen envelopes. In white

thermal radiation information from infrared images and texture details from
visible images. In this paper, a model-based convolutional neural network (CNN)
model, referred to as Algorithm Unrolling Image Fusion (AUIF), is proposed to
overcome the shortcomings of traditional CNN-based IVIF models. The proposed
AUIF model starts with the iterative formulas of two traditional optimization
models, which are established to accomplish two-scale decomposition, i.e.,
separating low-frequency base information and high-frequency detail information
from source images. Then the algorithm unrolling is implemented where each
iteration is mapped to a CNN layer and each optimization model is transformed
into a trainable neural network. Compared with the general network
architectures, the proposed framework combines the model-based prior
information and is designed more reasonably. After the unrolling operation, our
model contains two decomposers (encoders) and an additional reconstructor
(decoder). In the training phase, this network is trained to reconstruct the
input image. While in the test phase, the base (or detail) decomposed feature
maps of infrared/visible images are merged respectively by an extra fusion
layer, and then the decoder outputs the fusion image. Qualitative and
quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of our model, which can
robustly generate fusion images containing highlight targets and legible
details, exceeding the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our network has
fewer weights and faster speed.

to the SM for small values of the Higgs field, and allows for inflation in the

judicial interpretation to be automated. Second, we show how the legal
protection offered by non-discrimination law is challenged when AI, not humans,
discriminate. Humans discriminate due to negative attitudes (e.g. stereotypes,
prejudice) and unintentional biases (e.g. organisational practices or
internalised stereotypes) which can act as a signal to victims that
discrimination has occurred. Finally, we examine how existing work on fairness

cryptographic problems more efficiently than classical computers. As progress
continues in the field of quantum computing it is important to understand the
risks they pose to deployed cryptographic systems. Here we focus on one of
these risks - quantum key-recovery attacks against ideal ciphers. Specifically,
we seek to model the risk posed by an economically motivated quantum attacker
who will choose to run a quantum key-recovery attack against an ideal cipher if
the cost to recover the secret key is less than the value of the information at
the time when the key-recovery attack is complete. In our analysis we introduce
the concept of a quantum cipher circuit year to measure the cost of a quantum
attack. This concept can be used to model the inherent tradeoff between the
total time to run a quantum key recovery attack and the total work required to
run said attack. Our model incorporates the time value of the encrypted
information to predict whether any time/work tradeoff results in a key-recovery
attack with positive utility for the attacker. We make these predictions under
various projections of advances in quantum computing. We use these predictions
to make recommendations for the future use and deployment of symmetric key
ciphers to secure information against these quantum key-recovery attacks. We
argue that, even with optimistic predictions for advances in quantum computing,
128 bit keys (as used in common cipher implementations like AES-128) provide
adequate security against quantum attacks in almost all use cases.

dichalcogenides (ZnS2, CdS2 and CdSe2) are systematically investigated and
compared with those of the prototype ZnSe2 in order to optimize their
thermoelectric properties. Using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we
find that they all have ultralow lattice thermal conductivities. By analyzing
their vibrational properties, these are attributed to soft phonon modes derived
from the loosely bound rattling-like metal atoms and to strong anharmonicities
caused by the vibrations of all atoms perpendicular to the strongly bound
nonmetallic dimers. Additionally, by correlating those properties along the
series, we elucidate a number of chemical trends. We find that heavier atom
masses, larger atomic displacement parameters and longer bond lengths between
metal and nonmetal atoms can be beneficial to the looser rattling of the metal
atoms and therefore lead to softer phonon modes, and that stronger nonmetallic
dimer bonds can boost the anharmonicities, both leading to lower thermal
conductivities. Furthermore, we find that all three compounds have complex
energy isosurfaces at valence and conduction band edges that simultaneously
allow for large density-of-states effective masses and small conductivity
effective masses for both p-type and n-type carriers. Consequently, the
calculated thermoelectric figures of merit (ZT), can reach large values both
for p-type and n-type doping. Our study illustrates the effects of
rattling-like metal atoms and localized nonmetallic dimers on the thermal
transport properties and the importance of different carrier effective masses
to electrical transport properties in these pyrite-type dichalcogenides, which
can be used to predict and optimize the thermoelectric properties of other
thermoelectric compounds in the future.

experimentally validate these findings on miniaturized specimens, relevant for

miniaturized cellular metamaterial specimens are manufactured with different
scale ratios, subjected to in-situ micro-compression tests combined with
digital image correlation yielding full-field kinematics, and compared to
complementary numerical simulations. The specimens' global behavior agrees well
with the numerical predictions, in terms of pre-buckling stiffness, buckling

transformation and boundary layer formation, is also consistent between

spatio-temporal prediction: test the effectiveness of our methods on a
synthetic benchmark dataset and tackle three real-world wind prediction
datasets. For one of them, we propose a method to spatially order the unordered

extends the well-known class of purely massless theories. More generally, it is
proved that the complete theory has to have a form of the flatness condition
for a connection of a Lie algebra, which, provided there is a non-degenerate
invariant bilinear form, can be derived from the Chern-Simons action. We also
point out the existence of higher spin theories without the dynamical graviton

frame-like formulation can be systematically constructed starting from the
metric one by employing a combination of the local BRST cohomology technique
and the parent formulation approach, we also obtain an explicit uplift of any
given metric-like vertex to its frame-like counterpart. This procedure is valid
for general gauge theories while in the case of higher spin fields in
d-dimensional Minkowski space one can even use as a starting point metric-like
vertices in the transverse-traceless gauge. In particular, this gives the fully
off-shell lift for transverse-traceless vertices.

logics for hyperproperties have been proposed, and there is a need to
understand their decidability and relative expressiveness. The new logics have
been obtained from standard logics with two principal extensions: temporal
logics, like LTL and CTL$^*$, have been generalized to hyperproperties by
adding variables for traces or paths. First-order and second-order logics, like
monadic first-order logic of order and MSO, have been extended with the
equal-level predicate. We study the impact of the two extensions across the
spectrum of linear-time and branching-time logics, in particular for logics
with quantification over propositions. The resulting hierarchy of hyperlogics
differs significantly from the classical hierarchy, suggesting that the
equal-level predicate adds more expressiveness than trace and path variables.
Within the hierarchy of hyperlogics, we identify new boundaries on the
decidability of the satisfiability problem. Specifically, we show that while
HyperQPTL and HyperCTL$^*$ are both undecidable in general, formulas within
their $\exists^*\forall^*$ fragments are decidable.

used by compilers to provide security benefits for compiled code (e.g., memory
safety). The existing C to CHERI compiler, for example, achieves memory safety
by following a principle called ""pointers as capabilities"" (PAC). Informally,
PAC says that a compiler should represent a source language pointer as a
machine code capability. But the security properties of PAC compilers are not
yet well understood. We show that memory safety is only one aspect, and that
PAC compilers can provide significant additional security guarantees for
partial programs: the compiler can provide security guarantees for a
compilation unit, even if that compilation unit is later linked to
attacker-provided machine code.
  As such, this paper is the first to study the security of PAC compilers for
partial programs formally. We prove for a model of such a compiler that it is
fully abstract. The proof uses a novel proof technique (dubbed TrICL, read
trickle), which should be of broad interest because it reuses the whole-program
compiler correctness relation for full abstraction, thus saving work. We also
implement our scheme for C on CHERI, show that we can compile legacy C code
with minimal changes, and show that the performance overhead of compiled code
is roughly proportional to the number of cross-compilation-unit function calls.

due to business interruptions and shutdowns from social-distancing measures. To
evaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic
model is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household
income, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a
crisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can
use their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period,
when households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level.
The San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a
lockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance
(UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of
three months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9%
in the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income
earners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the
combination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero,
and reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income
loss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is
spatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the
average and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a
first step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional
scale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect
macroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making
and the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural
disasters).

scale-dependent bending rigidity for sheets that are much larger than a
characteristic thermal length scale. The presented results are universal and
apply to a wide range of microscopic sheets. These results are especially
relevant for atomically thin 2D materials, where thermal fluctuations can
significantly increase the critical buckling load because the thermal length
scale is on the order of nanometers at room temperature.

work in offline RL has been confined almost exclusively to model-free RL
approaches. In this work, we present MOReL, an algorithmic framework for
model-based offline RL. This framework consists of two steps: (a) learning a
pessimistic MDP (P-MDP) using the offline dataset; and (b) learning a
near-optimal policy in this P-MDP. The learned P-MDP has the property that for
any policy, the performance in the real environment is approximately
lower-bounded by the performance in the P-MDP. This enables it to serve as a
good surrogate for purposes of policy evaluation and learning, and overcome
common pitfalls of model-based RL like model exploitation. Theoretically, we
show that MOReL is minimax optimal (up to log factors) for offline RL. Through
experiments, we show that MOReL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art results in
widely studied offline RL benchmarks. Moreover, the modular design of MOReL
enables future advances in its components (e.g. generative modeling,
uncertainty estimation, planning etc.) to directly translate into advances for
offline RL.

situations in the world cannot be meaningfully isolated from their environment

Grothendieck construction to construct a double category of open dynamical

  In our main theorem, we construct covariantly representable indexed double

a stable shock and showed that they could reproduce the observed bimodality
scale for plausible values of the metallicity of the accreted gas and the shock
radius. Here, we take their analysis one step further and present a new
semianalytic model that computes the shock radius from first principles. This
advancement allows us to compute the critical mass individually for each halo.
Separating cold-mode and hot-mode accretion has little effect on the final
galaxy masses if feedback does not preferentially couple to the hot gas. We
also present an improved model for stellar feedback where 70% of the wind mass
is in a cold galactic fountain with a shorter reaccretion timescale at high
masses. The latter is the key mechanism that allows us to reproduce the
low-mass end of the mass function of galaxies over the entire redshift range
0<z<2.5. Cooling must be mitigated to avoid overpredicting the number density
of galaxies with stellar mass greater than a hundred billion Solar masses but
is important to form intermediate-mass galaxies. At virial masses greater than
three hundred billion Solar masses, cold accretion is more important at high z,
where gas is accreted from smaller solid angles, but this is not true at lower
masses because high-z filaments have lower metallicities. Our predictions are
consistent with the observed metallicity evolution of the intergalactic medium
at 0<z<5.

the second observed SN$\,$Ia, after iPTF$\,$14atg, to display an early flash of
emission in the ultraviolet (UV) and optical. Our analysis finds that
SN$\,$2019yvq was unusual, even when ignoring the initial flash, in that it was
moderately underluminous for an SN$\,$Ia ($M_g \approx -18.5\,$mag at peak) yet
featured very high absorption velocities ($v \approx
15,000\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ for Si II $\lambda$6355 at peak). We find that
many of the observational features of SN$\,$2019yvq, aside from the flash, can
be explained if the explosive yield of radioactive $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ is
relatively low (we measure $M_{^{56}\mathrm{Ni}} = 0.31 \pm 0.05\,M_\odot$) and
it and other iron-group elements are concentrated in the innermost layers of
the ejecta. To explain both the UV/optical flash and peak properties of

ejecta and a nondegenerate companion, extended clumps of $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ in
the outer ejecta, a double-detonation explosion, and the violent merger of two
white dwarfs. Each of these models has shortcomings when compared to the
observations; it is clear additional tuning is required to better match
SN$\,$2019yvq. In closing, we predict that the nebular spectra of SN$\,$2019yvq
will feature either H or He emission, if the ejecta collided with a companion,
strong [Ca II] emission, if it was a double detonation, or narrow [O I]
emission, if it was due to a violent merger.

generate large samples of satellite populations for a host halo of desired
mass, redshift, and assembly history. The model combines dark-matter halo
merger trees, empirical relations for the galaxy-halo connection, and analytic
prescriptions for tidal effects, dynamical friction, and ram pressure
stripping. SatGen emulates cosmological zoom-in hydro-simulations in certain
aspects. Satellites can reside in cored or cuspy DM subhaloes, depending on the
halo response to baryonic physics that can be formulated from hydro-simulations
and physical modeling. The subhalo profile and the stellar mass and size of a
satellite evolves depending on its tidal mass loss and initial structure. The
host galaxy can include a baryonic disc and a stellar bulge, each described by
a density profile that allows analytic orbit integration. SatGen complements
simulations by propagating the effect of halo response found in simulated field
galaxies to satellites (not properly resolved in simulations) and outperforms
simulations by sampling the halo-to-halo variance of satellite statistics and
overcoming artificial disruption due to insufficient resolution. As a first
application, we use the model to study satellites of Milky Way sized hosts,
making it emulate simulations of bursty star formation and of smooth star
formation, respectively, and to experiment with a disc potential in the host
halo. Our model reproduces the observed satellite statistics reasonably well.
Different physical recipes make a difference in satellite abundance and spatial
distribution at the 25% level, not large enough to be distinguished by current

tidal migration to work, an internal viscosity similar to that of molten rock

the spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, where spin degrees of freedom are hot but

Bethe ansatz quasiparticles. We then turn to the dynamics along special lines

relativity solution are small in the weak-field approximation outside the star:
the solution for the frame-dragging function is the same as in general
relativity at leading order. Moreover, in most cases the corrections are
suppressed by powers of the Vainshtein radius provided that the screening
operates in spherical symmetry. Outside the Vainshtein radius, the frame
dragging function receives corrections that are not suppressed by the
Vainshtein radius, but which are still subleading. This suggests that the
Vainshtein mechanism in general can be extended to slowly rotating stars and
that it works analogously to the static case inside the Vainshtein radius. We
also study relativistic stars and show that for some theories the

that the screening is perfect outside the star.

overarching goal in GC studies. The inference of tight scaling relations
between GC system properties and the mass of both the stellar and dark halo
components of their host galaxies are indicative of an intimate physical
connection, yet have also raised fundamental questions about how and when GCs
form. Specifically, the inferred correlation between the mass of a GC system
(Mgc) and the dark matter halo mass (Mhalo) of a galaxy has been posited as a
consequence of a causal relation between the formation of dark matter
mini-haloes and GC formation during the early epochs of galaxy assembly. We
present the first results from a new simulation of a cosmological volume
($L=34.4$~cMpc on a side) from the E-MOSAICS suite, which includes treatments
of the formation and evolution of GCs within the framework of a detailed galaxy
formation model. The simulated Mgc-Mhalo relation is linear for halo masses
$>5\times10^{11}~Msun$, and is driven by the hierarchical assembly of galaxies.
Below this halo mass, the simulated relation features a downturn, which we show
is consistent with observations, and is driven by the underlying stellar
mass-halo mass relation of galaxies. Our fiducial model reproduces the observed
Mgc-Mstar relation across the full mass range, which we argue is more
physically relevant than the Mgc-Mhalo relation. We also explore the physical
processes driving the observed constant value of $Mgc / Mhalo \sim

test gravity, and more generally fundamental physics, particularly with regards
to the existence of additional scalar fields. The first observation of a black
hole (BH) shadow by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has opened a new direct
window onto tests of gravity in the strong-field regime, including probes of
violations of the NHT. We consider two scenarios described by the
Einstein-Maxwell equations of General Relativity and electromagnetism, to which
we add a scalar field. In the first case we consider a minimally-coupled scalar
field with a potential, whereas in the second case the field is
conformally-coupled to curvature. In both scenarios we construct charged BH
solutions, which are found to carry primary scalar hair. We then compute the
shadows cast by these two BHs as a function of their electric charge and scalar
hair parameter. Comparing these shadows to the shadow of M87* recently imaged
by the EHT collaboration, we set constraints on the amount of scalar hair
carried by these two BHs. The conformally-coupled case admits a regime for the
hair parameter, compatible with EHT constraints, describing a so-called mutated
Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m BH: this solution was recently found to effectively
mimic a wormhole. Our work provides novel constraints on fundamental physics,
and in particular on violations of the no-hair theorem and the existence of
additional scalar fields, from the shadow of M87*.

We proof the nature of candidate YSCs fully embedded in molecular clouds, by
recovering their associated faint radio continuum luminosities. Using the
Halpha line to identify free-free radio emission at 5 GHz in the more evolved,
partially exposed YSCs, we retrieve information on the relevance of magnetic
fields and cosmic rays across the M33 disk at 25 pc spatial scales. A
cross-correlation of MIR and radio continuum luminosities is established from
bright to very faint YSCs, with MIR-to-radio emission ratio showing a gradual
decline towards the outer disk, while the magnetic field is pervasive at all
radii. We establish and discuss the tight relation between radio continuum and
other star formation indicators, such as Halpha. This relation holds for
individual YSCs over four orders of magnitude as well as for molecular clouds
hosting YSCs. On average about half of radio emission at 5 GHz in YSCs is
non-thermal. For exposed but compact YSCs the non-thermal radio fraction
increases with source brightness, while for large HII regions the fraction is
lower and shows no clear trend. This has been found for YSCs with and without
identified SNRs and underlines the possible role of massive stars in triggering
particle acceleration through winds and shocks: these particles diffuse
throughout the native molecular cloud prior to cloud dispersal.

the disc or the central accretor. Moreover, BHXRBs have different properties
compared with NSXRBs: quiescent BHXRBs are typically two to three orders of
magnitude less luminous than NSXRBs in X-ray, whereas BHXRBs are more radio
loud than NSXRBs. In observations, an empirical correlation has been
established between radio and X-ray luminosity, $L_{\rm R} \propto L_{\rm

However, there are some outliers of BHXRBs showing unusually steep correlation
as NSXRBs at higher luminosities. In this work, under the assumption that the
origin of jet power is related to the internal energy of the inner disc, we
apply our magnetized, radiatively efficient thin disc model and the well-known
radiatively inefficient accretion flow model to NSXRBs and BHXRBs. We find that
the observed radio/X-ray correlations in XRBs can be well understood by the

Interestingly, for white background noise, the optimal solution is the simple

is the first toolkit providing enclave developers with a memory-language.
However, Rust is considered a Systems language and has become the right choice
for concurrent applications and web browsers. Many application domains such as
Big Data, Machine Learning, Robotics, Computer Vision are more commonly

developers cannot benefit from secure enclaves like Intel SGX and rust-SGX. To
fill this gap, we propose Python-SGX, which is a memory-safe SGX SDK providing
enclave developers a memory-safe Python development environment. The key idea
is to enable memory-safe Python language in SGX by solving the following key
challenges: (1) defining a memory-safe Python interpreter (2)replacing unsafe
elements of Python interpreter with safe ones,(3) achieving comparable
performance to non-enclave Python applications, and (4) not introducing any
unsafe new code or libraries into SGX. We propose to build Python-SGX with
PyPy, a Python interpreter written by RPython, which is a subset of Python, and
tame unsafe parts in PyPy by formal verification, security hardening, and
memory safe language. We have implemented python-SGX and tested it with a

form a droplet-like cell aggregate or spread as a monolayer of migrating cells.
Tissue wetting depends not only on the chemical but also on the mechanical
properties of the substrate. Here, we study the role of substrate stiffness in
tissue spreading, which we describe by means of an active polar fluid model.
Taking into account that cells exert larger active traction forces on stiffer
substrates, we predict a tissue wetting transition at a critical substrate
stiffness that decreases with tissue size. On substrates with a stiffness
gradient, we find that the tissue spreads faster on the stiffer side. Further,
we show that the tissue can wet the substrate on the stiffer side while
dewetting from the softer side. We also show that, by means of viscous forces
transmitted across the tissue, the stiffer-side interface can transiently drag
the softer-side interface towards increasing stiffness, against its spreading
tendency. These two effects result in directed tissue migration up the
stiffness gradient. This phenomenon -- tissue durotaxis -- can thus emerge both
from dewetting at the soft side and from hydrodynamic interactions between the
tissue interfaces. Overall, our work unveils mechanisms whereby substrate
stiffness impacts the collective migration and the active wetting properties of
living tissues, which are relevant in development, regeneration, and cancer.

information visualization and human computer interaction. They provide an
organization of the techniques used in a particular domain that better enable
researchers to describe their work, discover existing methods, and identify
gaps in the literature. Existing taxonomies in related fields do not capture or
describe the unique paradigms employed in immersive analytics. We conceptualize
a taxonomy that organizes immersive analytics according to two dimensions:
spatial and visual presentation. Each intersection of this taxonomy represents
a unique design paradigm which, when thoroughly explored, can aid in the design
and research of new immersive analytic applications.

interacting inertial particles of finite volume, is proposed and analysed in
any finite dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$. It is a regularised and inertial version
of the Dean-Kawasaki model. A high-probability well-posedness theory for this
model is developed. This theory improves significantly on the spatial scaling
restrictions imposed in an earlier work of the same authors, which applied only
to significantly larger particles in one dimension. The well-posedness theory
now applies in $d$-dimensions when the particle-width $\epsilon$ is
proportional to $N^{-1/\theta}$ for $\theta>2d$ and $N$ is the number of
particles. This scaling is optimal in a certain Sobolev norm. Key tools of the
analysis are fractional Sobolev spaces, sharp bounds on Bessel functions,
separability of the regularisation in the $d$-spatial dimensions, and use of
the Fa\`a di Bruno's formula.

MA baseline scenario, using the nonlinear hybrid Kinetic-MHD code XTOR-K. Two
limit cases have been studied, in order to analyse the characteristic regimes
of the fishbone instability : the weak kinetic drive limit and the strong
kinetic drive limit. In both those regimes, characteristic features of the n =
m = 1 fishbone instability are recovered, such as a strong up/down-chirping of
the mode frequency, associated with a resonant transport of trapped and passing
alpha particles. The effects of the n = m = 0 sheared poloidal and toroidal
plasma rotation are taken into account in the simulations. The shear is not
negligible, which implies that the fishbone mode frequency has a radial
dependency, impacting the wave-particle resonance condition. Phase space hole
and clump structures are observed in both nonlinear regimes, centered around
the precessional and passing resonances. These structures remains attached to
the resonances as the different mode frequencies chirp up and down. In the
nonlinear phase, the transport of individual resonant trapped particles is
identified to be linked to mode-particle synchronization. On this basis, a
partial mechanism for the nonlinear coupling between particle transport and
mode dominant down-chirping is proposed. The overall transport of alpha
particles inside out the q = 1 surface is of order 2-5% of the initial
population between the simulations. The loss of alpha power is found to be
directly equal to the loss of alpha particles.

antiquark in the formal limit where the heavy quark masses go to infinity. It
extends the theoretical framework developed for tetraquark containing two heavy
quarks based on semi-classical analysis and the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.
It is shown that for sufficiently small light quark masses, parametrically
narrow $q\bar{q}'Q\bar{Q}$ tetraquarks must exist in the formal limit of
arbitrarily large heavy quark masses. The analysis is model-independent; it
requires no assumptions about the structure of the state or the mechanism of
its decay beyond what can be deduced directly from QCD. The formal analysis
here is only directly applicable to tetraquarks with large angular momentum and
hence does not directly apply to experimentally observed tetraquark candidates.
We also discuss the condition needed for a version of the analysis to apply for
low angular momenta states. Whether this condition holds can be explored via
lattice calculations. Current lattice calculations suggest that the condition
is not met. If these preliminary calculations are confirmed, there are strong
implications for the nature of the observed tetraquark resonances containing
$\bar{c}c$ or $\bar{b}b$ pairs. It raises the possibility that the observed
tetraquarks exist and are narrow not because the charm and bottom quarks are
extremely heavy, but because they are sufficiently light.

general strategy to increase the strength of the attacks and evaluate their
transferability when such a strength varies. We experimentally show that, in
this way, attack transferability can be largely increased, at the expense of a
larger distortion. Our research confirms the security threats posed by the
existence of adversarial examples even in multimedia forensics scenarios, thus

random-access memory (PSA-STT-MRAM) consists in increasing the storage layer
thickness to values comparable to the cell diameter, to induce a perpendicular
shape anisotropy in the magnetic storage layer. Making use of that
contribution, the downsize scalability of the STT-MRAM may be extended towards
sub-20 nm technological nodes, thanks to a reinforcement of the thermal
stability factor $\Delta$. Although the larger storage layer thickness improves
$\Delta$, it is expected to negatively impact the writing current and switching
time. Hence, optimization of the cell dimensions (diameter, thickness) is of
utmost importance for attaining a sufficiently high $\Delta$ while keeping a
moderate writing current. Micromagnetic simulations were carried out for
different pillar thicknesses of fixed lateral size 20 nm. The switching time
and the reversal mechanism were analysed as a function of the applied voltage
and aspect-ratio (AR) of the storage layer. For AR $<$ 1, the magnetization
reversal resembles a macrospin-like mechanism, while for AR $>$ 1 a
non-coherent reversal is observed, characterized by the nucleation of a
transverse domain wall at the ferromagnet/insulator interface which then
propagates along the vertical axis of the pillar. It was further observed that
the inverse of the switching time is linearly dependent on the applied voltage.
This study was extended to sub-20 nm width with a value of $\Delta$ around 80.
It was observed that the voltage necessary to reverse the magnetic layer
increases as the lateral size is reduced, accompanied with a transition from
macrospin-reversal to a buckling-like reversal at high aspect-ratios.

debated for decades. It was recently modeled as an eccentric binary with a
periodic brightening at periastron of the emission originating in a shock
heated zone near the companion. The focus of this paper is to further test the
binary model and to constrain the nature of the unseen close companion by
searching for emission arising in the shock-heated region. We analyze over 400
high resolution the International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra obtained between
1983 and 1995 and XMM-Newton observations obtained in 2010. The light curve and
radial velocity (RV) variations were fit with the eccentric binary model and
the orbital elements were constrained. We find RV variations in the primary
emission lines with a semi-amplitude K$_1\sim$30 km/s in 1992 and 1995, and a
second set of emissions with an anti-phase RV curve with K$_2\sim$150 km/s. The
simultaneous model fit to the RVs and the light curve yields the orbital
elements for each epoch. Adopting a Wolf-Rayet mass M$_1\sim$20 M$_\odot$ leads
to M$_2\sim$3-5 M$_\odot$, which implies that the companion could be a late
B-type star. The eccentric (e=0.1) binary model also explains the hard X-ray
light curve obtained by XMM-Newton and the fit to these data indicates that the
duration of maximum is shorter than the typical exposure times. The anti-phase
RV variations of two emission components and the simultaneous fit to the RVs
and the light curve are concrete evidence in favor of the binary nature of EZ
Canis Majoris. The assumption that the emission from the shock-heated region
closely traces the orbit of the companion is less certain, although it is
feasible because the companion is significantly heated by the WR radiation
field and impacted by the WR wind.

However, humans can easily recognize novel classes with only few samples. A key
component of such ability is the compositional recognition that human can
perform, which has been well studied in cognitive science but is not well
explored in FSL. Inspired by such capability of humans, to imitate humans'
ability of learning visual primitives and composing primitives to recognize
novel classes, we propose an approach to FSL to learn a feature representation
composed of important primitives, which is jointly trained with two parts, i.e.
primitive discovery and primitive enhancing. In primitive discovery, we focus
on learning primitives related to object parts by self-supervision from the
order of image splits, avoiding extra laborious annotations and alleviating the
effect of semantic gaps. In primitive enhancing, inspired by current studies on
the interpretability of deep networks, we provide our composition view for the
FSL baseline model. To modify this model for effective composition, inspired by
both mathematical deduction and biological studies (the Hebbian Learning rule
and the Winner-Take-All mechanism), we propose a soft composition mechanism by
enlarging the activation of important primitives while reducing that of others,
so as to enhance the influence of important primitives and better utilize these
primitives to compose novel classes. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks
are conducted on both the few-shot image classification and video recognition
tasks. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on all these

communication (that is, the minimum amount of communication required to achieve
a certain task) using quantum states. One representative example is quantum
fingerprinting, in which the simultaneous message passing model is considered
and the minimum amount of communication could be exponentially smaller than the
classical fingerprinting protocol. Experimental demonstrations based on a
practical quantum fingerprinting protocol where coherent states are used to
construct the fingerprints, have successfully shown the superiority of quantum
fingerprinting. However, as a consequence of using coherent states, the
communication time in this coherent quantum fingerprinting (CQF) protocol is
increased. Moreover, the minimum amount of information communicated in these
experimental demonstrations is largely limited by the dark counts of the single
photon detectors. Here, we propose to enhance the performance of the existing
CQF protocol through applying wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and
simultaneous detection of multiple wavelength channels. We show that the new
WDM-CQF protocol can potentially reduce the communication time significantly.
More importantly, with the same experimental parameters, the amount of
communication is much reduced in the new scheme compared with the original CQF
protocol. The more wavelength channels are used, the less communication is
required by WDM-CQF protocol. We also perform a proof-of-concept experimental
demonstration of the new WDM-CQF protocol with 6 wavelength channels. The
experimental results further validate that the new scheme with WDM not only
beats the classical protocol, but also reduces the amount of communication
required by the original CQF protocol by more than half.

constant problem. In this scenario, the vacuum energy density of quantum fields
does not gravitate and the cosmological constant appears merely as an
integration constant. Recently, it has been shown that energy diffusion that
may arise in quantum gravity and in theories with spontaneous collapse is
compatible with this framework by virtue of its restricted diffeomorphism
invariance. New studies suggest that this phenomenon could lead to higher-order
equations in the context of homogeneous and isotropic Universe, affecting the
well-posedness of their Cauchy initial-value problem. In this work, we show
that this issue can be circumvented by assuming an equation of state that
relates the energy density to the function that characterizes the diffusion. As
an application, we solve the field equations analytically for an isotropic and
homogeneous Universes in a barotropic model and in the mass-proportional
continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) scenario, assuming that only dark
matter develops energy diffusion. Different solutions possessing phase
transition from decelerated to accelerated expansion are found. We use
cosmological data of type Ia Supernovae and observational Hubble data to
constrain the free parameters of both models. It is found that very small but
nontrivial energy nonconservation is compatible with the barotropic model.
However, for the CSL model, we find that the best-fit values are not compatible
with previous laboratory experiments. We comment on this fact and propose

using a computational version of the Framework Theory by Marvin Minsky (1974)
leveraging on the Word2Vec approach to text vectorization by Mikolov et al.
(2013), used to generate distributed representation of words based on the
context where they appear. Our approach is based on three components: 1. a
framework/'room' representing the point of view; 2. a benchmark representing
the criteria for the analysis - in this case the emotion classification, from a
study of human emotions by Robert Plutchik (1980); and 3. the document to be
analyzed. By using similarity measure between words, we are able to extract the
relative relevance of the elements in the benchmark - intensities of emotions
in our case study - for the document to be analyzed. Our method provides a
measure that take into account the point of view of the entity reading the
document. This method could be applied to all the cases where evaluating
subjectivity is relevant to understand the relative value or meaning of a text.
Subjectivity can be not limited to human reactions, but it could be used to
provide a text with an interpretation related to a given domain (""room""). To
evaluate our method, we used a test case in the political domain.

matrix where each entry of $A$ is multiplied by an independent
$\{0,1\}$-Bernoulli random variable with parameter $1/2$. This paper is about
when, how and why the non-Hermitian eigen-spectra of the randomly induced
asymmetric matrices $A_1 (A - A_1)^*$ and $(A-A_1)^*A_1$ captures more of the
relevant information about the principal component structure of $A$ than via
its SVD or the eigen-spectra of $A A^*$ and $A^* A$, respectively. Hint: the
asymmetry inducing randomness breaks the echo-chamber effect that cripples the
SVD.
  We illustrate the application of this striking phenomenon on the low-rank
matrix completion problem for the setting where each entry is observed with
probability $d/n$, including the very sparse regime where $d$ is of order $1$,
where matrix completion via the SVD of $A$ fails or produces unreliable
recovery. We determine an asymptotically exact, matrix-dependent, non-universal
detection threshold above which reliable, statistically optimal matrix recovery
using a new, universal data-driven matrix-completion algorithm is possible.
Averaging the left and right eigenvectors provably improves the recovered
matrix but not the detection threshold. We define another variant of this
asymmetric procedure that bypasses the randomization step and has a detection
threshold that is smaller by a constant factor but with a computational cost
that is larger by a polynomial factor of the number of observed entries. Both
detection thresholds shatter the seeming barrier due to the well-known
information theoretical limit $d \asymp \log n$ for matrix completion found in
the literature.

widely used to trace the photospheric elemental isotopic ratios of evolved
stars. However, depending on the molecular species and the physical conditions
of the environment, the circumstellar isotopologue ratio may deviate
considerably from the stellar atmospheric value. In this paper, we aim to
examine how the CO and HCN abundance ratios vary radially due to chemical
reactions in the outflows of AGB stars and the effect of excitation and optical
depth on the resulting line intensity ratios. We find that the circumstellar
12CO/13CO can deviate from its atmospheric value by up to 25-94% and 6-60% for
C- and O-type CSEs, respectively. We show that variations of the intensity of
the ISRF and the gas kinetic temperature can significantly influence the CO
isotopologue ratio in the outer CSEs. On the contrary, the H12CN/H13CN ratio is
stable for all tested mass-loss rates. The RT modeling shows that the
integrated line intensity ratio of CO of different rotational transitions
varies significantly for stars with intermediate mass-loss rates due to
combined chemical and excitation effects. In contrast, the excitation
conditions for the both HCN isotopologues are the same. We demonstrate the
importance of using the isotopologue abundance profiles from chemical models as
inputs to RT models in the interpretation of isotopologue observations.
Previous studies of CO isotopologue ratios are based on multi-transition data
for individual sources and it is difficult to estimate the errors in the
reported values due to assumptions that are not entirely correct according to
this study. If anything, previous studies may have overestimated the
circumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio. The use of the HCN as a tracer of C
isotope ratios is affected by fewer complicating problems, provided one
accounts corrections for high optical depths.

atmosphere whose physical origin is still being actively debated. Aims: We
study six recurrent jets occurring in the active region NOAA 12644 on April 04,
2017. They are observed in all the hot filters of AIA as well as cool surges in
IRIS slit-jaw high spatial and temporal resolution images. Methods: The AIA
filters allow us to study the temperature and the emission measure of the jets
using the filter ratio method. We study the pre-jet phases by analyzing the
intensity oscillations at the base of the jets with the wavelet technique.
Results: A fine co-alignment of the AIA and IRIS data shows that the jets are
initiated at the top of a canopy-like, double-chambered structure with cool
emission on one side and hot emission in the other. The hot jets are collimated
in the hot temperature filters, have high velocities (around 250 km/s) and
accompanied by the cool surges and ejected kernels both moving at about 45
km/s. In the pre-phase of the jets, at their base we find quasi-periodic
intensity oscillations in phase with small ejections; they have a period
between 2 and 6 minutes and are reminiscent of acoustic or MHD waves.
Conclusions: This series of jets and surges provides a good case-study to test
the 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models that result from magnetic flux
emergence. The double-chambered structure found in the observations corresponds
to the cold and hot loop regions found in the models beneath the current sheet
that contains the reconnection site. The cool surge with kernels is comparable
with the cool ejection and plasmoids that naturally appear in the models.

layers in these devices contain previously unexplained misfit dislocations,
which facilitate non-radiative recombination. We demonstrate here that these
misfit dislocations form during post-growth cooldown due to the combined
effects of (1) thermal-expansion mismatch between the III-V layers and silicon
and (2) precipitate and alloy hardening in the active region. By incorporating
an additional sub-critical thickness, indium-alloyed misfit dislocation
trapping layer, we leverage these mechanical hardening effects to our
advantage, successfully displacing 95% of misfit dislocations from the QD layer
in model structures. Unlike conventional dislocation mitigation strategies, the
trapping layer reduces neither the number of threading dislocations nor the
number of misfit dislocations. It simply shifts the position of misfit
dislocations away from the QD layer, reducing the defects' impact on
luminescence. In full lasers, adding a misfit dislocation trapping layer both
above and below the QD active region displaces misfit dislocations and
substantially improves performance: we measure a twofold reduction in lasing
threshold currents and a greater than threefold increase in output power. Our
results suggest that devices employing both traditional threading dislocation
reduction techniques and optimized misfit dislocation trapping layers may
finally lead to fully integrated, commercially viable silicon-based photonic

(NLSMs) and a $\mathbb{Z}_{4}$ = 2 topological crystalline insulator (TCI), by
including substantial SOC. We demonstrate that in three space groups ({\it
i.e.} $Pbam$ (No.55), $P4/mbm$ (No.127) and $P4_2/mbc$ (No.135)), the TCI
supports a fourfold Dirac fermion on the (001) surface protected by two glide
symmetries, which originates from the intertwined drumhead surface states of
the CICE NLs. The higher order topology is further demonstrated by the
emergence of one-dimensional helical hinge states, indicating a new higher
order topological insulator protected by a glide symmetry.

A
primary objective is to determine whether waves refract as monochromatic waves
by Snell's law with phase velocity or as wave packets. The refraction of wave
packets requires two refraction laws. The wave packets refract according to
Snell's law with the geometric group velocity while the wavelets within the
wave packets refract according to Snell's law with phase velocity. The tests
were performed using directional power spectra from gravity water waves
originating in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, and the
Southern Ocean. In all cases the waves were measured with arrays of pressure
sensors. It was found that the refraction of monochromatic waves led to
backtracks from a measurement site that spread out for the different wave
periods and did not go back to a common source. When the refraction was large
the results were especially bad. When the data were used to test the refraction
of wave packets very good results were obtained. For every storm considered the
backtracks of the different wave periods went back together to the wave
generation area. These results offer strong support for refracting waves in
dispersive media as wave packets, not as monochromatic waves. This result for
wave groups was also determined in a controlled wave tank experiment of gravity
water waves where a critical angle was tested. The properties of propagating
wave packets are also considered and illustrated. Reflection points and
critical angles are found and explained. There can be major differences between
the propagation of wave packets and monochromatic waves.

detection of mobile malware by building a scalable and obfuscation resilient

our proposed concept, namely malicious community, in which we consider
malicious instances that share common features are the most likely part of the
same malware family. Using this concept, we presumably assume that multiple
similar Android apps with different authors are most likely to be malicious.
Specifically, Cypider leverages this assumption for the detection of variants
of known malware families and zero-day malicious apps. Cypider applies
community detection algorithms on the similarity network, which extracts
sub-graphs considered as suspicious and possibly malicious communities.
Furthermore, we propose a novel fingerprinting technique, namely community
fingerprint, based on a one-class machine learning model for each malicious
community. Besides, we proposed an enhanced Cypider framework, which requires
less memory, x650, and less time to build the similarity network, x700,

The observations are sensitive to absorption columns of $N_{\rm H} \sim

lowly-ionized gas on timescales spanning days to well over a decade. We
detected variability in the column density of the full-covering absorber in
7/20 sources, on timescales of months-years, indicating a component of
compact-scale X-ray-obscuring gas lying along the line of sight of each of
these objects. Our results imply that torus models incorporating clouds or
overdense regions should account for line of sight column densities as low as
$\sim$ a few $\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. However, 13/20 sources yielded no
detection of significant variability in the full-covering obscurer, with upper
limits to ${\Delta}N_{\rm H}$ spanning $10^{21-23}$ cm$^{-2}$. The dominant
absorbing media in these systems could be distant, such as kpc-scale dusty

to a planar ordinary differential equation with a limit cycle. These situations
appear in models of several physical processes, where small delay effects are
added. Even if the delays are small, they are very singular perturbations since
the natural phase space of an SDDE is an infinite dimensional space.
  We show that the SDDE admits solutions which resemble the solutions of the
ODE. That is, there exist a periodic solution and a two parameter family of
solutions whose evolution converges to the periodic solution. Even if the phase
space of the SDDE is naturally a space of functions, we show that there are
initial values which lead to solutions similar to that of the ODE.
  The method of proof bypasses the theory of existence, uniqueness, dependence
on parameters of SDDE. We consider the class of functions of time that have a
well defined behavior (e.g. periodic, or asymptotic to periodic) and derive a
functional equation which imposes that they are solutions of the SDDE. These
functional equations are studied using methods of functional analysis. We
provide a result in ""a posteriori"" format: Given an approximate solution of the
functional equation, which has some good condition numbers, we prove that there
is true solution close to the approximate one. Thus, we can use the result to
validate the results of numerical computations. The method of proof leads also
to practical algorithms. In a companion paper, we present the implementation
details and representative results.
  One feature of the method presented here is that it allows to obtain smooth
dependence on parameters for the periodic solutions and their slow stable
manifolds without studying the smoothness of the flow (which seems to be
problematic for SDDEs, for now the optimal result on smoothness of the flow is
$C^1$).

compute a two parameter family of solutions of the SDDE which converge to the
solutions of the ODE as the perturbation goes to zero in a neighborhood of the
limit cycle.
  The method we use formulates functional equations among periodic functions
(or functions converging exponentially to periodic). The functional equations
express that the functions solve the SDDE. Therefore, rather than evolving
initial data and finding solutions of a certain shape, we consider spaces of
functions with the desired shape and require that they are solutions.
  The mathematical theory of these invariance equations is developed in a
companion paper, which develops ""a posteriori"" theorems. They show that, if
there is a sufficiently approximate solution (with respect to some explicit

Since the numerical methods produce an approximate solution, and provide
estimates of the condition numbers, we can make sure that the numerical
solutions we consider approximate true solutions.

finite set of numbers (Taylor-Fourier series) and develop a toolkit of

interactions and the difference in the masses of the up and down quarks. A
recent study by Hoff and collaborators presented evidence that the ground-state
spin of $^{73}$Sr is different from that of its mirror, $^{73}$Br, due to an
inversion of the ground- and first-excited states, separated by only 27 keV in
the $^{73}$Br system. In this brief note, we place this inversion within the
necessary context of the past half-century of experimental and theoretical
work, and show that it is entirely consistent with normal behaviour, and
affords no new insight into isospin-symmetry breaking. The essential point is
that isospin-breaking effects due to the Coulomb interaction frequently vary
from level to level within a given medium-mass nucleus by as much as 200 keV.
Any level splitting smaller than this is liable to manifest a level inversion
in the mirror partner which, absent disagreement with an appropriate nuclear
model, does not challenge our understanding. While we note the novelty of an
inversion in nuclear ground states, we emphasize that in the context of isospin
there is nothing specifically illuminating about the ground state, or a level
inversion.

a supermassive black hole, with about 50% of the star's mass eventually
accreted by the black hole. The resulting flare can, in extreme cases of
super-Eddington mass accretion, result in a relativistic jet. While tidal
disruption events have been theoretically proposed as sources of high-energy
cosmic rays and neutrinos, stacking searches indicate that their contribution
to the diffuse extragalactic neutrino flux is very low. However, a recent
association of a track-like astrophysical neutrino with a tidal disruption
event (AT2019dsg) indicates that some tidal disruption events can accelerate
cosmic rays to PeV energies. Here we introduce a phenomenological concordance
scenario with a relativistic jet to explain this association: an expanding
cocoon progressively obscures the X-rays emitted by the accretion disk, while
at the same time providing a sufficiently intense external target of
back-scattered X-rays for the production of neutrinos via proton-photon
interactions. We also reproduce the delay (relative to the peak) of the
neutrino emission by scaling the production radius with the black body radius.
Our energetics and assumptions for the jet and the cocoon are compatible with
expectations from numerical simulations of tidal disruption events.

successive parameters, which promotes local constancy. In many applications,
there is a coefficient, often denoted as $\lambda$, on the regularization term,
which adjusts the relative importance between the two losses.
  In this paper, we characterize how the optimal solution evolves with the
increment of $\lambda$. We show that, if all fidelity loss functions are convex
piecewise linear, the optimal value for \emph{each} variable changes at most
$O(nq)$ times for a problem of $n$ variables and total $q$ breakpoints. On the

\emph{all} variables in $\tilde{O}(nq)$ time for all $\lambda \geq 0$.
Interestingly, we find that the path of solutions for each variable can be
divided into up to $n$ locally convex-like segments. For problems of arbitrary
convex loss functions, for a given solution accuracy, one can transform the
loss functions into convex piecewise linear functions and apply the above
results, giving pseudo-polynomial bounds as $q$ becomes a pseudo-polynomial
quantity.

accesses. However, many applications exhibit irregular access patterns that do
not manifest spatio-temporal locality in the memory address space. Such
applications usually do not fall under the scope of existing prefetching
techniques, which observe only the stream of addresses dispatched by the memory
unit but not the code flows that produce them. Similarly, temporal correlation
prefetchers detect recurring relations between accesses, but do not track the
chain of causality in program code that manifested the memory locality.
Conversely, techniques that are code-aware are limited to the basic program
functionality and are bounded by the machine depth. In this paper we show that
contextual analysis of the code flows that generate memory accesses can detect
recurring code patterns and expose their underlying semantics even for
irregular access patterns. Moreover, program locality artifacts can be used to
enhance the memory traversal code and predict future accesses. We present the
semantic prefetcher that analyzes programs at run-time and learns their memory
dependency chains and address calculation flows. The prefetcher then constructs
forecast slices and injects them at key points to trigger timely prefetching of
future contextually-related iterations. We show how this approach takes the
best of both worlds, augmenting code injection with forecast functionality and
relying on context-based temporal correlation of code slices. This combination
allows us to overcome critical memory latencies that are currently not covered
by any other prefetcher. Our evaluation of the semantic prefetcher using an
industrial-grade, cycle-accurate x86 simulator shows that it improves
performance by 24% on average over SPEC 2006 (outliers up to 3.7x), and 16% on

continuously widening, as the wealth of a relatively small group increases and,
therefore, the rest of the world shares a shrinking fraction of resources. This
situation has been predicted and denounced by economists and econophysicists.
The latter ones have widely used models of market dynamics which consider that
wealth distribution is the result of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A
simple analogy relates the wealth in a society with the kinetic energy of the
molecules in a gas, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between
the molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems, thanks to
the equipartition of energy, the gas eventually arrives at an equilibrium
state, in many exchange models the economic system never equilibrates. Instead,
it moves toward a ""condensed"" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all
the wealth of the society and the rest of agents shares zero or a very small
fraction of the total wealth. Here we discuss two ways of avoiding the
""condensed"" state. On one hand, we consider a regulatory policy that favors the
poorest agent in the exchanges, thus increasing the probability that the wealth
goes from the richest to the poorest agent. On the other hand, we study a tax
system and its effects on wealth distribution. We compare the redistribution
processes and conclude that complete control of the inequalities can be

the device consists of a floating, boat-shaped hull that is slack-moored to the
sea bed. Internally, a gyroscopic power take off (PTO) unit converts the
wave-induced pitch motion of the hull into electrical energy. The CFD model is
based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and utilizes the fictitious
domain Brinkman penalization technique to couple the device physics and water
wave dynamics. A numerical wave tank is used to emulate realistic sea operating
conditions. A Froude scaling analysis is performed to enable two- and
three-dimensional simulations for a scaled-down (1:20) ISWEC model. It is
demonstrated that the scaled-down 2D model is sufficient to accurately simulate
the hull's pitching motion and to predict the power generation capability of
the converter. A systematic parameter study of the ISWEC is conducted, and its
optimal performance in terms of power generation is determined based on the
hull and gyroscope control parameters. It is demonstrated that the device
achieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on
reactive control theory. It is shown that a proportional control of the PTO
control torque is required to generate continuous gyroscope precession effects,
without which the device generates no power. In an inertial reference frame, it
is demonstrated that the yaw and pitch torques acting on the hull are of the
same order of magnitude, informing future design investigations of the ISWEC

vdW magnets are limited by their extreme sensitivity to air, low ordering
temperatures, and poor charge transport properties. Here we report the magnetic
and electronic properties of CrSBr, an air-stable vdW antiferromagnetic
semiconductor that readily cleaves perpendicular to the stacking axis. Below
its N\'{e}el temperature, $T_N = 132 \pm 1$ K, CrSBr adopts an A-type
antiferromagnetic structure with each individual layer ferromagnetically
ordered internally and the layers coupled antiferromagnetically along the
stacking direction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL)
reveal that the electronic gap is $\Delta_E = 1.5 \pm 0.2$ eV with a
corresponding PL peak centered at $1.25 \pm 0.07$ eV. Using magnetotransport
measurements, we demonstrate strong coupling between magnetic order and
transport properties in CrSBr, leading to a large negative magnetoresistance
response that is unique amongst vdW materials. These findings establish CrSBr
as a promising material platform for increasing the applicability of vdW
magnets to the field of spin-based electronics.

nucleate locally and propagate eventually along the entire interface causing
global sliding. The static friction coefficient is a macroscopic measure of the
applied force at this particular instant when the frictional interface loses
stability. However, experimental studies are known to present important scatter
in the measurement of static friction; the origin of which remains unexplained.
Here, we study the nucleation of local slip at interfaces with slip-weakening
friction of random strength and analyze the resulting variability in the
measured global strength. Using numerical simulations that solve the
elastodynamic equations, we observe that multiple slip patches nucleate
simultaneously, many of which are stable and grow only slowly, but one reaches
a critical length and starts propagating dynamically. We show that a
theoretical criterion based on a static equilibrium solution predicts
quantitatively well the onset of frictional sliding. We develop a Monte-Carlo
model by adapting the theoretical criterion and pre-computing modal convolution
terms, which enables us to run efficiently a large number of samples and to
study variability in global strength distribution caused by the stochastic
properties of local frictional strength. The results demonstrate that an
increasing spatial correlation length on the interface, representing geometric
imperfections and roughness, causes lower global static friction. Conversely,
smaller correlation length increases the macroscopic strength while its
variability decreases. We further show that randomness in local friction
properties is insufficient for the existence of systematic precursory slip
events. Random or systematic non-uniformity in the driving force, such as
potential energy or stress drop, is required for arrested slip fronts. Our

inconsistent personality across conversations or the average personality of all

generation via conditioning on prior conversations of a target actor. In doing
so, we are able to utilize more abstract patterns within a person's speech and
better emulate them in generated responses. This work introduces the Generative
Conversation Control model, an augmented and fine-tuned GPT-2 language model
that conditions on past reference conversations to probabilistically model
multi-turn conversations in the actor's persona. We introduce an accompanying
data collection procedure to obtain 10.3M conversations from 6 months worth of
Reddit comments. We demonstrate that scaling model sizes from 117M to 8.3B
parameters yields an improvement from 23.14 to 13.14 perplexity on 1.7M held

in human evaluations that measure preference of model samples to the held out
target distribution in terms of realism (31% increased to 37% preference),

  Computing using Linear Dependence of Intermediate Values","6 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ISIT2020",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In large scale distributed computing systems, communication overhead is one
of the major bottlenecks. In the map-shuffle-reduce framework, which is one of
the major distributed computing frameworks, the communication load among
servers can be reduced by increasing the computation load of each server, that
is, there is a trade-off between computation load and communication load.
Recently, it has been shown that coded distributed computing (CDC) improves
this trade-off relationship by letting servers encode their intermediate
computation results. The original CDC scheme does not assume any special
structures on the functions that servers compute. However, in actual problems,
these functions often have some structures, and the trade-off relation may be
further improved by using that structures. In this paper, we propose a new
scheme that further improves the trade-off relationship by utilizing the linear
dependency structure of the intermediate computation results. The intermediate
values computed in the map phase can be considered as vectors on
$\mathbb{F}_{2}$. In some applications, these intermediate values have a linear
dependency and in such cases, it is sufficient for each server to send a basis
of the linear subspace and linear combination coefficients. As a result, the
proposed approach improves over the best-known computation-communication
overhead trade-off in some applications.

depending on the sign of the spin-exchange coupling, ferromagnetic(FM) or

different magnetic structures. For the two fermions case, we demonstrate the
Kondo screening effect for the attractive branch with AFM coupling, and show
that such screening is absent for the ground state with FM coupling. Moreover,
we find a sequence of FM upper branches in the AFM coupling side. These FM
states are orthogonal to all other attractive branches and their wave functions
feature a full spin-charge separation. The effect of an additional contact
interaction and the extension of our results to many particles are also

redshift-space halo power spectra measured from the Dark Quest $N$-body
simulation suite that covers 101 flat-geometry $w$CDM cosmologies around the
Planck $\Lambda$CDM model, we feed these data into a feed-forward neural
network to build the fast and accurate emulation of the power spectrum from the
linear to nonlinear scales up to $k \simeq 0.6 \,h \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Our
emulator achieves about 1% and 5% fractional accuracies in predicting the
monopole and quadrupole moments of the power spectrum, respectively, for halos
of $\sim 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$ that correspond to host halos of the SDSS LOWZ-

to the statistical errors of SDSS volume. The validation and performance of the
emulator are given by the comparison of the emulator predictions with the power
spectra directly measured from the simulations for validation sets that are not
used in the training. We demonstrate that the emulator outputs can be used to
make model predictions for the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies by
employing user-fed models for the halo-galaxy connection, such as the halo
occupation distribution. The emulator allows us to easily incorporate the
Finger-of-God effect due to the virial motions of galaxies and the

non-informative responses in general. A scenario where informativeness can be
significantly enhanced is Conversing by Reading (CbR), where conversations take
place with respect to a given external document. In previous work, the external
document is utilized by (1) creating a context-aware document memory that
integrates information from the document and the conversational context, and
then (2) generating responses referring to the memory. In this paper, we
propose to create the document memory with some anticipated responses in mind.
This is achieved using a teacher-student framework. The teacher is given the
external document, the context, and the ground-truth response, and learns how
to build a response-aware document memory from three sources of information.
The student learns to construct a response-anticipated document memory from the
first two sources, and the teacher's insight on memory creation. Empirical
results show that our model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art for the
CbR task.

manufactured by using focused ion beam (FIB) equipment, and the diffraction

that the contrast of low-spatial-frequency components in the CNT image was

machine learning pipelines and the emergence of automated feature generation
techniques such as deep learning, which typically requires a lot of training
data, has further exacerbated the problem. While weak-supervision techniques
have circumvented this bottleneck, existing frameworks either require users to
write a set of diverse, high-quality rules to label data (e.g., Snorkel), or
require a labeled subset of the data to automatically mine rules (e.g., Snuba).
The process of manually writing rules can be tedious and time consuming. At the
same time, creating a labeled subset of the data can be costly and even
infeasible in imbalanced settings. This is due to the fact that a random sample
in imbalanced settings often contains only a few positive instances.
  To address these shortcomings, we present Darwin, an interactive system
designed to alleviate the task of writing rules for labeling text data in
weakly-supervised settings. Given an initial labeling rule, Darwin
automatically generates a set of candidate rules for the labeling task at hand,
and utilizes the annotator's feedback to adapt the candidate rules. We describe
how Darwin is scalable and versatile. It can operate over large text corpora
(i.e., more than 1 million sentences) and supports a wide range of labeling
functions (i.e., any function that can be specified using a context free
grammar). Finally, we demonstrate with a suite of experiments over five
real-world datasets that Darwin enables annotators to generate
weakly-supervised labels efficiently and with a small cost. In fact, our
experiments show that rules discovered by Darwin on average identify 40% more
positive instances compared to Snuba even when it is provided with 1000 labeled
instances.

the observed trends including the reduced scatter at large radii which is a
signature of self-similarity suggested in previous studies. One of our
simulated sets, Gadget-X, reproduces well the shape of the observed temperature
profile, while Gadget-MUSIC has a higher and flatter profile in the cluster

profiles from both simulation sets, despite following the observed trend, have
a relatively lower normalisation. The cumulative stellar density profiles from
SAMs are in better agreement with the observed result than both hydrodynamic

challenges of having only lacunary information about daily new infections are
compounded by the geographic heterogeneity of the population. To address this
problem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban
settings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the
pandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models. The
setting of the model parameters takes into account the fact that SARS-CoV-2
transmission occurs mostly via human-to-human contact, and that the frequency
of contact among individuals differs between urban and rural areas, and may
change over time. Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an
uninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other
communities where the infection is present. To account for these important
aspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact
between its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes. Census
and cell phone data can be used to set up the adjacency matrix of the network,
which can, in turn, be modified to account for different levels of mitigation
measures. In order to make the network SEIR model that we propose easy to
customize, it is formulated in terms of easily interpretable parameters that
can be estimated from available community level data. The models parameters are
estimated with Bayesian techniques using COVID-19 data for the states of Ohio

($2\Delta$). Here, on the basis of inelastic neutron scattering measurements on
a quasi-two-dimensional iron-based superconductor KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$, we
have discovered a two-dimensional spin resonant mode with downward dispersions,
a behavior closely resembling the low branch of the hour-glass-type spin
resonance in cuprates. The resonant intensity is predominant by two broad
incommensurate peaks near $Q=$(0.5, 0.5) with a sharp energy peak at $E_R=16$

total gap $\Delta_{\rm tot}=|\Delta_k|+|\Delta_{k+Q}|$. These experimental
results deeply challenge the conventional understanding of the resonance modes

along with the emerging trend in secure data processing that recognizes that

We, first, provide a new security definition, entitled partitioned data
security for guaranteeing that the joint processing of non-sensitive data (in
cleartext) and sensitive data (in encrypted form) does not lead to any leakage.
Then, this paper proposes a new secure approach, entitled query binning (QB)
that allows secure execution of queries over non-sensitive and sensitive parts
of the data. QB maps a query to a set of queries over the sensitive and
non-sensitive data in a way that no leakage will occur due to the joint
processing over sensitive and non-sensitive data. In particular, we propose
secure algorithms for selection, range, and join queries to be executed over
encrypted sensitive and cleartext non-sensitive datasets. Interestingly, in
addition to improving performance, we show that QB actually strengthens the
security of the underlying cryptographic technique by preventing size,
frequency-count, and workload-skew attacks.

sequences of pulsation modes that can be compared with theoretical models,
which has been done successfully for many classes of pulsators, including
low-mass solar-type stars, red giants, high-mass stars and white dwarfs.
However, a large group of pulsating stars of intermediate mass--the so-called
delta Scuti stars--have rich pulsation spectra for which systematic mode
identification has not hitherto been possible. This arises because only a
seemingly random subset of possible modes are excited, and because rapid
rotation tends to spoil the regular patterns. Here we report the detection of
remarkably regular sequences of high-frequency pulsation modes in 60
intermediate-mass main-sequence stars, allowing definitive mode identification.
Some of these stars have space motions that indicate they are members of known

that these stars are indeed young.

derivation is based on the observation that a term appearing in the conditional

The asymptotic analysis of the complex integral can then be performed using the

function to assign discrete objects to regular grids for fast Fourier transform

implementation can achieve sub-percent precision till close to the Nyquist
frequency. Impact of removing bulk flow on estimation of momentum power spectra
are derived theoretically and verified numerically, subtracting bulk flow has
little effects at large scales but might induce meaningful differences in
nonlinear regime, and probably it is not necessary to subtract bulk flow for
samples which peculiar velocities are exact or sufficiently accurate. Momentum
power spectra of dark matter samples from N-body simulation are measured and
discussed. As expected, prediction of the one loop Eulerian perturbation theory
agrees with simulation only slightly better than the linear theory at z=0, but
can be applied to higher redshift with improved accuracy. Measurements of
simulation data and the one loop Eulerian theory both reveal that the momentum
field contains strong rotational part, and there is a large stochastic
component in the divergence of momentum which is not correlated with the
density field. The three kinds of momentum power spectra have their own

domains that carry net chirality. Coupled with the aforementioned magnetic
fields, they may induce a charge separation of the particles generated in the
collisions. This charge separation is called the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME)
and can be measured through charged-particle angular correlations. Measurements
of the $\gamma_{1,1}$ correlator, which is sensitive to the CME, are shown for
Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV as well as for Xe--Xe
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.44$ TeV. These are found to have a
significant charge dependence between opposite-sign and same-sign charge pairs.
This behavior is consistent with a CME-like signal. However, the $\delta_{1}$
correlator, which measures charge correlations unrelated to any symmetry plane
(i.e. background), was measured in Xe--Xe collisions and also shows a
significant charge dependence. This prevents a clear interpretation of the

$\tau \sim 11$ days that increases from blue to red wavelengths. The
polarization angle is initially aligned with the jet axis but rotates by
roughly $90^\circ$ as the flare grows. Two distinct states are evident at low
and high fluxes. Below 18 mJy, the polarization angle takes on a wide range of
values, without any clear relation to the flux. In contrast, there is a
positive correlation between the polarization angle and flux above 18 mJy. The
polarization degree does not display a clear correlation with the flux. We find
that the photopolarimetric behaviour for the high flux state can be attributed
to a variable component with a steady power-law spectral energy distribution
and high optical polarization degree (13.3%). These properties are interpreted
within the shock-in-jet model, which shows that the observed variability can be
explained by a shock that is seen nearly edge-on. Some parameters derived for
the relativistic jet within the shock-in-jet model are: $B=0.06$ G for the

phases. During the first phase, the macro-cell (MC) base station (BS) deploys
massive receive antennas and a few transmit antennas; the small-cell (SC) BSs
employ large-scale receive antennas and a single transmit antenna. For the
second phase, the roles of the transmit and receive antennas are switched. Due
to the low-resolution ADCs, we account for quantization noise (QN). We
characterize the joint impact of the number of antennas, self-interference,
SC-to-SC interference, QN, and Rician K-factor. For the first phase, the SE is
enhanced with the massive receive antennas and the loss due to QN is limited.
For the second phase, the desired signal and QN have the same order. Therefore,
the SE saturates with the massive transmit antennas. As the Rician K-factor
increases, the SE converges. Power scaling laws are derived to demonstrate that
the transmit power can be scaled down proportionally to the massive antennas.
We investigate the EE/SE trade-offs. The envelope of the EE/SE region grows

Markov decision processes (MDPs) as finite abstractions of given original
systems, and (ii) synthesize controllers for the constructed finite MDPs
satisfying bounded-time high-level properties including safety, reachability
and reach-avoid specifications. In AMYTISS, scalable parallel algorithms are
designed such that they support the parallel execution within CPUs, GPUs and
hardware accelerators (HWAs). Unlike all existing tools for stochastic systems,
AMYTISS can utilize high-performance computing (HPC) platforms and
cloud-computing services to mitigate the effects of the state-explosion
problem, which is always present in analyzing large-scale stochastic systems.
We benchmark AMYTISS against the most recent tools in the literature using
several physical case studies including robot examples, room temperature and
road traffic networks. We also apply our algorithms to a 3-dimensional
autonomous vehicle and 7-dimensional nonlinear model of a BMW 320i car by

rectified linear units (ReLUs) are popular choices in neural network (NN)
regression. Although ReLUs are popular, they can collapse to a constant
function and ""die"", effectively removing their contribution from the model.
While some mitigations are known, the underlying reasons of ReLUs dying during
optimization are currently poorly understood. In this paper, we consider the
effects of target normalization and momentum on dying ReLUs. We find
empirically that unit variance targets are well motivated and that ReLUs die
more easily, when target variance approaches zero. To further investigate this
matter, we analyze a discrete-time linear autonomous system, and show
theoretically how this relates to a model with a single ReLU and how common
properties can result in dying ReLU. We also analyze the gradients of a
single-ReLU model to identify saddle points and regions corresponding to dying
ReLU and how parameters evolve into these regions when momentum is used.
Finally, we show empirically that this problem persist, and is aggravated, for
deeper models including residual networks.

remarkably stable up to escape energy levels where breakdown is expected, while
the Hollomon lattice never breaks, yet is unstable at low energies and only

envelope proteins are also highly damaged in the process. This in turn may
alter their antigenic properties, affecting their capacity to induce an

calculated the expected number of lesions in the spike and membrane proteins,

damage for the same level of RNA lesions, because a single ion traversal
through the nuclear envelope is sufficient to inactivate the virus. We propose
that accelerated charged particles produce inactivated viruses with little

instrumentation systems. Ideally, in a properly designed system, the used
analog to digital converter (ADC) should not limit the system performance.
However, despite recent improvements in ADC technology, quite often this is not
possible and the choice of the ADC influences significantly or even restricts
the system performance. It is therefore very important to estimate the
requirements for the analog to digital conversion at an early stage of the
system design and evaluate whether one can find an adequate ADC fulfilling the
system specification. In case of beam instrumentation systems requiring both,
high time and amplitude resolution, it often happens that the system
specification cannot be met with the available ADCs without applying special
processing to the analog signals prior to their digitisation. In such cases the
requirements for the ADC even influence the system architecture. This paper
aims at helping the designer of a beam instrumentation system in the process of
selecting an ADC, which in many cases is iterative, requiring a trade off
between system performance, complexity and cost. Analog to digital conversion
is widely and well described in the literature, therefore this paper focusses
mostly on aspects related to beam instrumentation. The ADC fundamentals are
limited to the content presented as an introduction during the CAS one-hour

Asymmetrically-clipped O-OFDM (ACO-OFDM) is a single-layer O-OFDM scheme, whose

9 K revealing magneto-optical correlations not linked to crystal structure

by the sequential loss of positional and orientational order. Whereas melting
processes in passive systems are typically triggered by external heat
injection, active matter crystals can self-assemble and melt into an active
fluid by virtue of their intrinsic motility and inherent non-equilibrium
stresses. Emergent crystal-like order has been observed in recent experiments
on suspensions of swimming sperm cells, fast-moving bacteria, Janus colloids,
and in embryonic tissues. Yet, despite recent progress in the theoretical
description of such systems, the non-equilibrium physics of active
crystallization and melting processes is not well understood. Here, we
establish the emergence and investigate the melting of self-organized vortex
crystals in 2D active fluids using an experimentally validated generalized
Toner-Tu theory. Performing hydrodynamic simulations at an unprecedented scale,
we identify two distinctly different melting scenarios: a hysteretic
discontinuous phase transition and melting through an intermediary hexatic
phase, both of which can be controlled by self-propulsion and active stresses.
Our analysis further reveals intriguing transient features of active vortex
crystals including meta-stable superstructures of opposite spin polarity.
Generally, these results highlight the differences and similarities between
crystalline phases in active fluids and their equilibrium counterparts.

a major M6.6 long duration event (LDE) with special emphasize on its pre-flare
phase. The event occurred in NOAA 12371 on 2015 June 22. A remarkable aspect of
the event was an active pre-flare phase lasting for about an hour during which
a hot EUV coronal channel was in build-up stage and displayed co-spatial hard
X-ray (HXR) emission up to energies of 25 keV. As such, this is the first
evidence of HXR coronal channel. The coronal magnetic field configuration based
on NLFFF modeling clearly exhibited a magnetic flux rope (MFR) oriented along
the polarity inversion line (PIL) and co-spatial with the coronal channel. We
observed significant changes in the AR's photospheric magnetic field during an
extended period of $\approx$42 hours in the form of rotation of sunspots,
moving magnetic features, and flux cancellation along the PIL. Prior to the
flare onset, the MFR underwent a slow rise phase ($\approx$14 km s$^{-1}$) for
$\approx$12 min which we attribute to the faster build-up and activation of the
MFR by tether-cutting reconnection occurring at multiple locations along the
MFR itself. The sudden transition in the kinematic evolution of the MFR from
the phase of slow to fast rise ($\approx$109 km s$^{-1}$ with acceleration
$\approx$110 m s$^{-2}$) precisely divides the pre-flare and impulsive phase of
the flare, which points toward the feedback process between the early dynamics
of the eruption and the strength of the flare magnetic reconnection.

straightforward and is generally too expensive to be directly used as selective
pressure in the evolutionary process. Indirectly promoting evolvability as a
side effect of other easier and faster to compute selection pressures would
thus be advantageous. In an unbounded behavior space, it has already been shown
that evolvable individuals naturally appear and tend to be selected as they are
more likely to invade empty behavior niches. Evolvability is thus a natural
byproduct of the search in this context. However, practical agents and
environments often impose limits on the reach-able behavior space. How do these
boundaries impact evolvability? In this context, can evolvability still be
promoted without explicitly rewarding it? We show that Novelty Search
implicitly creates a pressure for high evolvability even in bounded behavior
spaces, and explore the reasons for such a behavior. More precisely we show
that, throughout the search, the dynamic evaluation of novelty rewards
individuals which are very mobile in the behavior space, which in turn promotes
evolvability.

landscape is divided into cells and represented as a grid graph where each cell
has a fuel age that increases over time and becomes old if no treatment is
applied in the meantime: this induces a potential high fire risk whenever two
contiguous cells are old. Cells fuel ages can be reset to zero under
appropriate fuel treatments but there is a limited budget for treatment in each
period. The problem calls for finding a suitable selection of cells to be
treated so as to minimize the presence of old contiguous cells over the whole
time horizon. We prove that problem BFTS is strongly NP-complete on paths and
thus on grid graphs and show that no polynomial time approximation algorithm
exists unless P = NP. We provide an enhanced integer linear programming

up to be efficiently solved by an ILP solver on reasonably large size

the line in relation to other chromospheric lines and also the influence of the

strengths as a function of the respective EUV radiation field strengths
suggests that the mechanism of photoionization and recombination is necessary
to form the line for inactive models, while collisions start to play a role in
our most active models. Moreover, the published model set, which is optimized

to start reproduction, i.e. where and when to recruit. For an informed decision
on recruitment, individuals may prospect potential breeding sites and gather
information on the future breeding site, hence reducing uncertainty.
Recruitment may also be delayed or advanced over a range of sexually mature
ages and this individual decision may influence survival costs of first
reproduction, senescence patterns and ultimately lifetime reproductive success.
Here we show that recruitment in the long-lived Audouin's gull is mostly
informed, meaning that mainly occurs when the individual has visited the colony
before. Individuals recruiting without gathering information were all young
first-time breeders. Interestingly, these recruits were affected by demographic
carry-over effects: first, they were much less prone to reproduce in subsequent
seasons than individuals that performed informed recruitment. More strikingly,
uninformed recruitment also affected survival, which was much lower for those
individuals breeding without gathering information on the breeding site. This
study suggests that taking stock before recruitment may be crucial for reducing
environmental uncertainty and for maximising individual fitness prospects.

ASDEX-Upgrade tokamak (AUG), is presented and discussed in an attempt to
produce a coherent picture of SOL filamentary transport: A clear correlation is
found between L-mode density shoulder formation in the outer midplane and a
transition between the sheath limited and the inertial filamentary regimes.
Divertor collisionality is found to be the parameter triggering the transition.
A clear reduction of the ion temperature takes place in the far SOL after the
transition, both for the background and the filaments. This coincides with a
strong variation of the ion temperature distribution, which deviates from
Gaussianity and becomes dominated by a strong peak below $5$ eV. The filament
transition mechanism triggered by a critical value of collisionality seems to
be generally applicable to inter-ELM H-mode plasmas, although a secondary
threshold related to deuterium fueling is observed. EMC3-EIRENE simulations of
neutral dynamics show that an ionization front near the main chamber wall is
formed after the shoulder formation. Finally, a clear increase of SOL opacity
to neutrals is observed associated to the shoulder formation. A common SOL

mechanical ventilators all over the world. In this backdrop, there is wide
interest in looking for ways to support multiple patients from a single
ventilator. Various solutions, based upon simple mechanical division of the
ventilator tubings are described. However, recently warnings have been issued
by multiple international professional societies against these plumbing
solutions as it can seriously harm the patients.
  Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a
single ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors
along with volume and PEEP control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost
microcontroller based control system integrates and displays the data in the
familiar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen. The
system is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition
to the standard microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add
UV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre wavelength in the expiratory channel for its
virucidal effect.
  Results: The dynamic ventilatory divider system is capable of providing and
controlling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive End-expiratory
pressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the
ventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a
familiar format. FiO2 and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator.
  Conclusions: The prototype system has a potential to provide safe ventilation
to at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while maintaining the
unique requirements of each patient.

Revision to an earlier submitted version",,,,"cs.IT math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider a multi-armed bandit in which each arm is a Markov
process evolving on a finite state space. The state space is common across the
arms, and the arms are independent of each other. The transition probability
matrix of one of the arms (the odd arm) is different from the common transition
probability matrix of all the other arms. A decision maker, who knows these
transition probability matrices, wishes to identify the odd arm as quickly as
possible, while keeping the probability of decision error small. To do so, the
decision maker collects observations from the arms by pulling the arms in a
sequential manner, one at each discrete time instant. However, the decision
maker has a trembling hand, and the arm that is actually pulled at any given
time differs, with a small probability, from the one he intended to pull. The
observation at any given time is the arm that is actually pulled and its
current state. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms continue to evolve.
This makes the arms restless.
  For the above setting, we derive the first known asymptotic lower bound on
the expected time required to identify the odd arm, where the asymptotics is of
vanishing error probability. The continued evolution of each arm adds a new
dimension to the problem, leading to a family of Markov decision problems
(MDPs) on a countable state space. We then stitch together certain
parameterised solutions to these MDPs and obtain a sequence of strategies whose
expected times to identify the odd arm come arbitrarily close to the lower
bound in the regime of vanishing error probability. Prior works dealt with
independent and identically distributed (across time) arms and rested Markov
arms, whereas our work deals with restless Markov arms.

The upper limit is especially conservative because it may include a
non-negligible contribution from the FRB host galaxies and a non-zero
contribution from the cosmic web. It strongly disfavors models where the Galaxy
has retained the majority of its baryons with a density profile tracking the
presumed dark matter density profile. Last, we perform Monte Carlo simulations
of larger FRB samples to validate our technique and assess the sensitivity of
ongoing and future surveys. We recover bounds of several tens $\text{pc

majority of its baryonic mass. We estimate that a sample of several thousand

surface of the cathode allows the thermal neutrons detection through the
release of $^7$Li and $\alpha$ particles in the active volume. This technology
has been developed to be an efficient and convenient alternative to the $^3$He

neutron detector by developing and testing small planar prototypes with readout
boards suitably segmented with strip or pad read out, equipped with existing
electronics or readout in current mode. Preliminary results from the test with
different prototypes, showing a good agreement with the simulation, will be

voluntary agreements among free people -- as a foundation from which an
egalitarian and just society can emerge. A \emph{digital social contract} is
the novel incarnation of this concept for the digital age: a voluntary
agreement between people that is specified, undertaken, and fulfilled in the
digital realm. It embodies the notion of ""code-is-law"" in its purest form, in
that a digital social contract is in fact a program -- code in a social
contracts programming language, which specifies the digital actions parties to
the social contract may take; and the parties to the contract are entrusted,
equally, with the task of ensuring that each party abides by the contract.
Parties to a social contract are identified via their public keys, and the one
and only type of action a party to a digital social contract may take is a
""digital speech act"" -- signing an utterance with her private key and sending
it to the other parties to the contract. Here, we present a formal definition
of a digital social contract as agents that communicate asynchronously via
crypto-speech acts, where the output of each agent is the input of all the
other agents. We outline an abstract design for a social contracts programming
language and show, via programming examples, that key application areas,
including social community; simple sharing-economy applications; egalitarian
currency networks; and democratic community governance, can all be expressed
elegantly and efficiently as digital social contracts.

setup. For application of a parametric identification method this would require
estimating a large number of parameters, as well as an appropriate model order
selection step for a possibly large scale MISO problem, thereby increasing the
computational complexity of the identification algorithm to levels that are
beyond feasibility. An alternative identification approach is presented
employing regularized kernel-based methods. Keeping a parametric model for the
module of interest, we model the impulse response of the remaining modules in
the MISO structure as zero mean Gaussian processes (GP) with a covariance
matrix (kernel) given by the first-order stable spline kernel, accounting for
the noise model affecting the output of the target module and also for possible
instability of systems in the MISO setup. Using an Empirical Bayes (EB)
approach the target module parameters are estimated through an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with a substantially reduced
computational complexity, while avoiding extensive model structure selection.
Numerical simulations illustrate the potentials of the introduced method in
comparison with the state-of-the-art techniques for local module

control theory that provides an optimal solution to linear problems of
regulation in the presence of uncertainty. This framework combines Kalman-Bucy
filters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators
for the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in
neuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to
sensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models.
According to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian
inference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active
inference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational
approximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others,
perception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy
minimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to
LQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor
control in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this
note we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear
systems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their
commonalities and technical differences.

possessing exciton-polariton resonances. The transfer of a domain wall is
driven by spatially localised, adiabatic pump modulation in the vicinity of the
domain wall. The stochastic calculations prove the coherent nature of the
domain wall transfer. For appropriate system parameters the coherence degree is
preserved after multiple transitions, paving the way towards long-range
transfer of a coherent quantum state.

structure for solving specific problems. This optimization can be used for
various purposes: to prevent overfitting, to save resources for implementation

minimal structure that cannot be pruned further is not unique. Ensemble of
minimal structures can be used as a committee of intellectual agents that
solves problems by voting. Each minimal NN presents an ""empirical knowledge""
about the problem and can be verbalized. The non-uniqueness of such knowledge
extracted from data is an important property of data-driven Artificial
Intelligence (AI). In this work, we review an approach to pruning based on the
principle: What controls training should control pruning. This principle is
expected to work both for artificial NN and for selection and modification of
important synaptic contacts in brain. In back-propagation artificial NN
learning is controlled by the gradient of loss functions. Therefore, the first
order sensitivity indicators are used for pruning and the algorithms based on
these indicators are reviewed. The notion of logically transparent NN was
introduced. The approach was illustrated on the problem of political
forecasting: predicting the results of the US presidential election. Eight
minimal NN were produced that give different forecasting algorithms. The
non-uniqueness of solution can be utilised by creation of expert panels
(committee). Another use of NN pluralism is to identify areas of input signals
where further data collection is most useful. In Conclusion, we discuss the
possible future of widely advertised XAI program.

network architectures, have achieved great outcomes in the visual tasks.
Designing efficient binary architectures is not trivial due to the binary
nature of the network. In this paper, we propose a use of evolutionary search
to facilitate the construction and training scheme when binarizing MobileNet, a
compact network with separable depth-wise convolution. Inspired by one-shot
architecture search frameworks, we manipulate the idea of group convolution to
design efficient 1-Bit Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), assuming an
approximately optimal trade-off between computational cost and model accuracy.
Our objective is to come up with a tiny yet efficient binary neural
architecture by exploring the best candidates of the group convolution while
optimizing the model performance in terms of complexity and latency. The
approach is threefold. First, we train strong baseline binary networks with a
wide range of random group combinations at each convolutional layer. This
set-up gives the binary neural networks a capability of preserving essential
information through layers. Second, to find a good set of hyperparameters for
group convolutions we make use of the evolutionary search which leverages the
exploration of efficient 1-bit models. Lastly, these binary models are trained
from scratch in a usual manner to achieve the final binary model. Various
experiments on ImageNet are conducted to show that following our construction
guideline, the final model achieves 60.09% Top-1 accuracy and outperforms the
state-of-the-art CI-BCNN with the same computational cost.

focus is how the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these $L^*$ star-forming
galaxies change over the last 10 Gyr. We find that the high-$z$ CGM is almost
equally divided between the ""cool"" ($T<10^5$ K) and ""hot"" ($T\geq 10^5$ K)
phases, while the low-$z$ hot CGM phase contains $5\times$ more mass. The
high-$z$ hot CGM contains 60% more metals than the cool CGM, while the low-$z$
cool CGM contains 35% more metals than the hot CGM content. The metals are
evenly distributed radially between the hot and cool phases throughout the
high-$z$ CGM. At high $z$, the CGM volume is dominated by hot outflows, cool
gas is mainly inflowing, but cool metals are flowing outward. At low $z$, the
cool metals dominate the interior and the hot metals are more prevalent at
larger radii. The low-$z$ cool CGM has tangential motions consistent with
rotational support out to $0.2 R_{200}$, often exhibiting $r \approx 40$ kpc
disc-like structures. The low-$z$ hot CGM has several times greater angular
momentum than the cool CGM, and a more flattened radial density profile than
the high-$z$ hot CGM. This study verifies that, just as galaxies demonstrate
significant evolutionary stages over cosmic time, the gaseous haloes
surrounding them also undergo considerable changes of their own both in
physical characteristics of density, temperature and metallicity, and dynamic
properties of velocity and angular momentum.

bipartite matching, which has held a central role in online algorithms ever
since. Of particular importance are the Ranking algorithm for integral matching
and the Water-filling algorithm for fractional matching. Most algorithms in the
literature can be viewed as adaptations of these two in the corresponding
models. Recently, Huang et al.~(STOC 2018, SODA 2019) introduced a more general
model called \emph{fully online matching}, which considers general graphs and
allows all vertices to arrive online. They also generalized Ranking and
Water-filling to fully online matching and gave some tight analysis: Ranking is
$\Omega \approx 0.567$-competitive on bipartite graphs where the
$\Omega$-constant satisfies $\Omega e^\Omega = 1$, and Water-filling is
$2-\sqrt{2} \approx 0.585$-competitive on general graphs.
  We propose fully online matching algorithms strictly better than Ranking and
Water-filling. For integral matching on bipartite graphs, we build on the
online primal dual analysis of Ranking and Water-filling to design a
$0.569$-competitive hybrid algorithm called Balanced Ranking. To our knowledge,
it is the first integral algorithm in the online matching literature that
successfully integrates ideas from Water-filling. For fractional matching on
general graphs, we give a $0.592$-competitive algorithm called Eager
Water-filling, which may match a vertex on its arrival. By contrast, the
original Water-filling algorithm always matches vertices at their deadlines.
Our result for fractional matching further shows a separation between fully
online matching and the general vertex arrival model by Wang and Wong (ICALP
2015), due to an upper bound of $0.5914$ in the latter model by Buchbinder,
Segev, and Tkach (ESA 2017).

deep mathematical properties of 2-player 0-sum games that are defined over
various combinatorial structures. The aim of this work is to lay foundations to
bridging the conceptual and technical gaps between CGT and EGT, here
interpreted as so-called Extensive Form Games, so they can be treated within a
unified framework. More specifically, we introduce a class of $n$-player,
general-sum games, called Cumulative Games, that can be analyzed by both CGT
and EGT tools. We show how two of the most fundamental definitions of CGT---the
outcome function, and the disjunctive sum operator---naturally extend to the
class of Cumulative Games. The outcome function allows for an efficient
equilibrium computation under certain restrictions, and the disjunctive sum
operator lets us define a partial order over games, according to the advantage
that a certain player has. Finally, we show that any Extensive Form Game can be
written as a Cumulative Game.

extension of string periodicity. The basic notions of quasiperiodicity are
cover and seed. A cover of a text $T$ is a string whose occurrences in $T$
cover all positions of $T$. A seed of text $T$ is a cover of a superstring of
$T$. In various applications exact quasiperiodicity is still not sufficient due
to the presence of errors. We consider approximate notions of quasiperiodicity,
for which we allow approximate occurrences in $T$ with a small Hamming,
Levenshtein or weighted edit distance.
  In previous work Sip et al. (2002) and Christodoulakis et al. (2005) showed
that computing approximate covers and seeds, respectively, under weighted edit
distance is NP-hard. They, therefore, considered restricted approximate covers
and seeds which need to be factors of the original string $T$ and presented
polynomial-time algorithms for computing them. Further algorithms, considering
approximate occurrences with Hamming distance bounded by $k$, were given in
several contributions by Guth et al. They also studied relaxed approximate
quasiperiods that do not need to cover all positions of $T$.
  In case of large data the exponents in polynomial time complexity play a
crucial role. We present more efficient algorithms for computing restricted
approximate covers and seeds. In particular, we improve upon the complexities
of many of the aforementioned algorithms, also for relaxed quasiperiods. Our
solutions are especially efficient if the number (or total cost) of allowed
errors is bounded. We also show NP-hardness of computing non-restricted
approximate covers and seeds under Hamming distance.
  Approximate covers were studied in three recent contributions at CPM over the
last three years. However, these works consider a different definition of an
approximate cover of $T$.

this approach is able to achieve a good scaling even when computing a

develop a tool with a high degree of abstraction without losing control and
performance by using \emph{MPI+OpenMP} tasking. The main motivation of this
work is the evaluation of this cutting-edge simulation on multi-morphology

completely different among them, is an important challenge. In fact, in the
multi-morphology simulations, we find an important unbalancing between the
nodes, mainly due to the differences in the neurons, which causes an important
under-utilization of the available resources. In this work, the authors present
and evaluate mechanisms to deal with this and reduce the time of this kind of

we propose a library for programming with global combinators -- a set of
functions for writing and verifying multiparty protocols in OCaml. Local
behaviours for all processes in a protocol are inferred at once from a global
combinator. We formalise global combinators and prove a sound realisability of
global combinators -- a well-typed global combinator derives a set of local
types, by which typed endpoint programs can ensure type and communication
safety. Our approach enables fully-static verification and implementation of
the whole protocol, from the protocol specification to the process
implementations, to happen in the same language. We compare our implementation
to untyped and continuation-passing style implementations, and demonstrate its
expressiveness by implementing a plethora of protocols. We show our library can

fluence of $\sim10^{-7}-10^{-6}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ were detected by the IBIS
instrument in the 20-200 keV range. The burst with the hardest spectrum,
discovered and localized in real time by the INTEGRAL Burst Alert System, was
spatially and temporally coincident with a short and very bright radio burst
detected by the CHIME and STARE2 radio telescopes at 400-800 MHz and 1.4 GHz,
respectively. Its lightcurve shows three narrow peaks separated by $\sim$29 ms
time intervals, superimposed on a broad pulse lasting $\sim$0.6 s. The
brightest peak had a delay of 6.5$\pm$1.0 ms with respect to the 1.4 GHz radio
pulse (that coincides with the second and brightest component seen at lower
frequencies). The burst spectrum, an exponentially cut-off power law with
photon index $\Gamma=0.7_{-0.2}^{+0.4}$ and peak energy $E_p=65\pm5$ keV, is
harder than those of the bursts usually observed from this and other magnetars.
By the analysis of an expanding dust scattering ring seen in X-rays with the
{\it Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory} XRT instrument, we derived a distance of
4.4$_{-1.3}^{+2.8}$ kpc for SGR 1935+2154, independent of its possible
association with the supernova remnant G57.2+0.8. At this distance, the burst
20-200 keV fluence of $(6.1\pm 0.3)\times10^{-7}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ corresponds to
an isotropic emitted energy of $\sim1.4\times10^{39}$ erg. This is the first
burst with a radio counterpart observed from a soft $\gamma$-ray repeater and
it strongly supports models based on magnetars that have been proposed for
extragalactic fast radio bursts.

Three sets of candidate operations are composed respectively for three kinds of

ends up with two optimal structures for the upward and downward blocks.
Moreover, the developed solution also integrates normalization and patching

perform a massive data analysis, through geolocalized data from 13M Facebook
users, on how such a stress affected mobility patterns in France, Italy and UK.
We find that the general reduction of the overall efficiency in the network of
movements is accompanied by geographical fragmentation with a massive reduction
of long-range connections. The impact, however, differs among nations according
to their initial mobility structure. Indeed, we find that the mobility network
after the lockdown is more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more
distributed in Italy. Such a process can be approximated through percolation to
quantify the substantial impact of the lockdown.

the libration frequency is less than twice of the rotation frequency and the
libration amplitude is small. Time-dependent flows mainly consist of inertial
waves excited at the critical latitudes due to the Ekman pumping singularities,
forming conical shear layers. In particular, previous theoretical studies have
proposed different scalings for the conical shear layers spawned from the
critical latitudes at the inner boundary. Our numerical results favor the
velocity amplitude scaling $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon E^{1/12})$ predicted by Le
Diz\`es \& Le Bars (2017) over the scaling $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon E^{1/6})$
initially proposed by Kerswell (1995), though the Ekman numbers in our
calculations are not sufficiently small to pin down this scaling. Non-linear
interactions in the boundary layers drive a mean zonal flow with several
geostrophic shears. Our numerical results show that geostrophic shears
associated with the critical latitudes at the inner and outer boundaries
exhibit the same scalings, i.e. an amplitude of $\mathrm{O}(\varepsilon^2

shear associated with the critical latitude, our numerical results show that
the reflection of inertial waves can induce a geostrophic shear with an

field profile in the focal plane depends on the transverse polarisation
profile, as interference between different parts of the beam needs to be taken
into account. It is well known that radial polarised light produces a
longitudinal polarisation component and can be focused below the conventional
diffraction limit for homogeneously polarised light, and azimuthally polarised
light that carries one unit of angular momentum can achieve even tighter focal
spots. This is of interest for example for enhancing resolution in scanning
microscopy. There are numerous ways to generate such polarisation structures,
however, setups can be expensive and usually rely on birefringent components,
hence prohibiting broadband operation. We have recently demonstrated a passive,
low-cost technique using a simple glass cone (Fresnel cone) to generate beams
with structured polarisation. We show here that the polarisation structure
generated by Fresnel cones focuses better than radial polarised light at all
numerical apertures. Furthermore, we investigate in detail the application of
polarised light structures for two-photon microscopy. Specifically we
demonstrate a method that allows us to generate the desired polarisation

second part learns the voxelwise nonrigid deformation between the target image

representations in order to progressively build a map of the discovered

identify and target several key functionalities. First, we aim to build lasting
representations and avoid catastrophic forgetting throughout the exploration
process. Secondly we aim to learn a diversity of representations allowing to
discover a ""diversity of diversity"" of structures (and associated skills) in
complex high-dimensional environments. Thirdly, we target representations that
can structure the agent discoveries in a coarse-to-fine manner. Finally, we
target the reuse of such representations to drive exploration toward an
""interesting"" type of diversity, for instance leveraging human guidance.
Current approaches in state representation learning rely generally on
monolithic architectures which do not enable all these functionalities.
Therefore, we present a novel technique to progressively construct a Hierarchy
of Observation Latent Models for Exploration Stratification, called HOLMES.
This technique couples the use of a dynamic modular model architecture for
representation learning with intrinsically-motivated goal exploration processes
(IMGEPs). The paper shows results in the domain of automated discovery of
diverse self-organized patterns, considering as testbed the experimental

Hate speech detection requires overwhelming resources including

Recently, Deep Learning (DL)-based solutions have been proposed for automatic
detection of hate speech, using modest-sized training datasets of few thousands
of hate speech sequences. While these methods perform well on the specific
datasets, their ability to detect new hate speech sequences is limited and has
not been investigated. Being a data-driven approach, it is well known that DL
surpasses other methods whenever a scale-up in train dataset size and diversity

further utilize the generated dataset to train a well-studied DL-based hate
speech detector, and demonstrate consistent and significant performance
improvements across five public hate speech datasets. Therefore, the proposed
solution enables high sensitivity detection of a very large variety of hate
speech sequences, paving the way to a fully automatic solution.

an observationally-based methodology to estimate the strength of irradiation of
BHXB discs by combining multiwavelength X-ray and optical/IR data throughout
transient outbursts. We apply this to $\sim15$ yrs of activity in the Galactic
BHXB GX339$-$4. Our findings suggest that the irradiation heating required by
the optical data is large in this system. Direct illumination of the outer disc
does not produce sufficient irradiation, but this should also produce a
thermal-radiative wind which adds to the irradiation heating by scattering flux
down onto the disc. However, analytic estimates of X-ray illumination from
scattering in the wind is still not sufficient to produce the observed heating,
even in combination with direct illumination. Either the analytic
thermal-radiative wind models are underestimating the effect of the wind, or
there are additional scattering mechanisms at work, such as magnetically-driven
outflows, acting to increase the optical/IR flux. While wind-driven irradiation
is likely a common feature among long-period BHXBs, fully understanding the
driving mechanism(s) behind such a wind will require radiation-hydrodynamic
simulations.

still suffer from the distribution gaps between source and target domains,
especially the resolution discrepany in the remote sensing images. To address
this problem, this paper designs a novel end-to-end semantic segmentation
network, namely Super-Resolution Domain Adaptation Network (SRDA-Net). SRDA-Net
can simultaneously achieve the super-resolution task and the domain adaptation
task, thus satisfying the requirement of semantic segmentation for remote
sensing images which usually involve various resolution images. The proposed
SRDA-Net includes three parts: a Super-Resolution and Segmentation (SRS) model
which focuses on recovering high-resolution image and predicting segmentation
map, a Pixel-level Domain Classifier (PDC) for determining which domain the
pixel belongs to, and an Output-space Domain Classifier (ODC) for
distinguishing which domain the pixel contribution is from. By jointly
optimizing SRS with two classifiers, the proposed method can not only
eliminates the resolution difference between source and target domains, but
also improve the performance of the semantic segmentation task. Experimental
results on two remote sensing datasets with different resolutions demonstrate
that SRDA-Net performs favorably against some state-of-the-art methods in terms

approach to apply the filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm to the SRT. The
FBP algorithm is generally not suitable for SRT due to the several issues with
solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) observations, in particular a problem caused by
missing data because of the unobserved back side of corona hidden behind the
Sun. We developed a method to generate a modified sinogram which resolves the
blocking problem. The modified sinogram is generated by combining the EUV data
at two opposite sites observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)
onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We generated the modified
sinogram for about one month in 2019 February and reconstructed the
three-dimensional corona under the static state assumption. In order to obtain
the physical parameters of the corona, we employed a DEM inversion method. We
tested the performance of the FBP algorithm with the modified sinogram by
comparing the reconstructed data with the observed EUV image, electron density
models, previous studies of electron temperature, and an observed coronagraph
image. The results illustrate that the FBP algorithm reasonably reconstructs
the bright regions and the coronal holes, and can reproduce their physical
parameters. The main advantage of the FBP algorithm is that it is easy to
understand and computationally efficient. Thus, it enables us to easily probe
the inhomogeneous coronal electron density and temperature distribution of the

of Laplace eigenfunctions on a general compact Riemannian manifold. With
probability one with respect to the Gaussian coefficients, we establish that,
both for large band and monochromatic models, the process properly rescaled and
evaluated at an independently and uniformly chosen point $X$ on the manifold,
converges in distribution under the sole randomness of $X$ towards an universal
Gaussian field as the frequency tends to infinity. This result extends the
celebrated central limit Theorem of Salem--Zygmund for trigonometric
polynomials series to the more general framework of compact Riemannian
manifolds. We then deduce from the above convergence the almost-sure
asymptotics of the nodal volume associated with the random wave. To the best of
our knowledge, in the real Riemannian case, these asymptotics were only known
in expectation and not in the almost sure sense due to the lack of sufficiently
accurate variance estimates. This in particular addresses a question of S.
Zelditch regarding the almost sure equidistribution of nodal volume.

collection of interrelated PSQRs that share the same template parameterization.
These PSQRs are estimated jointly in a pseudo-likelihood fashion, where Poisson
pseudo-likelihood is used to approximate the original more
computationally-intensive pseudo-likelihood problem stemming from PSQRs.
Theoretically, we demonstrate that under mild assumptions, the Poisson
pseudo-likelihood approximation is sparsistent for recovering the underlying
PSQR. Empirically, we learn TPSQRs from Marshfield Clinic electronic health

for modeling a photovoltaic (PV) module in a simulated environment. These
parameters need to be accurately extracted from the specifications given in the
datasheet of the PV module such that the simulation model should exhibit the

In literature, the first four equations are easily created from the key data

main challenge however is the formulation of the fifth equation. The approaches
found in literature have inherent inaccuracies due to some approximations or
iterative techniques leading to discrepancy in the simulated model. This paper
presents a unique analytical approach for the formulation of the fifth equation

make of it, after quantization, a rare prototype of systems with quantum
configurations that do not have a classical analogue. Assuming spherical
symmetry in order to reduce the effective dimensionality, we have performed a
Monte Carlo simulation of the path integral with transition probability
$e^{-\beta |S|}$. Although this choice does not allow to reproduce the full
dynamics, it does lead us to find a large ensemble of metric configurations
having action $|S|\ll \hbar$ by several magnitude orders. These vacuum
fluctuations are strong deformations of the flat space metric (for which $S=0$
exactly). They exhibit a periodic polarization in the scalar curvature $R$. In
the simulation we fix a length scale $L$ and divide it into $N$ sub-intervals.
The continuum limit is investigated by increasing $N$ up to $\sim 10^6$; the
average squared action $\langle S^2 \rangle$ is found to scale as $1/N^2$ and
thermalization of the algorithm occurs at a very low temperature (classical
limit). This is in qualitative agreement with analytical results previously
obtained for theories with stabilized conformal factor in the asymptotic safety
scenario.

To end the global COVID-19 pandemic major behavioral, social distancing,
contact tracing, and state interventions has been undertaken to reduce the
outbreak and avert the persistence of the coronavirus in humans in India and
worldwide. In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost
priority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.
  Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission
dynamics of COVID-19 in India. Based on the estimated data our model predicts
the evolution of epidemics and the end of SARS-CoV-2 and aids to evaluate the
influence of different policies to control the spread of the diseases.
  Findings: With the real data for infected individuals, we find the basic
reproduction number $R_0$ for 17 states of India and overall India. A complete
figure is given to demonstrate the estimated pandemic life cycle along with the
real data or history to date. Our study reveals that the strict control
measures implemented in India substantially mitigated the disseminate of
SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, model simulations predict that 95% reduction of
outbreak on June 26, 2020 and 99% reduction of outbreak on July 26, 2020 in
India.
  Interpretation: Our model simulation demonstrates that the community-wide
elimination of SARS-CoV-2 is possible by mitigating the social distancing and
use essential precautions. Lockdown can be implemented strictly to prevent the
human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. The model-based and parameter
estimation of epidemic life cycle, and end dates, if can be done precisely, may
decrease distress and over optimism and develop the mentality for all of us for
the next stages of the outbreak evolution.

with medical swabs following a pure convenience criterion which, at least in an
early phase, has privileged the exam of patients showing evident symptoms.
However, there are evidences of a very high proportion of asymptomatic patients
(e. g. Aguilar et al., 2020; Chugthai et al, 2020; Li, et al., 2020; Mizumoto

estimate the real number of infected (and to estimate the lethality rate), it
should be necessary to run a properly designed sample survey through which it
would be possible to calculate the probability of inclusion and hence draw
sound probabilistic inference. Some researchers proposed estimates of the total
prevalence based on various approaches, including epidemiologic models, time
series and the analysis of data collected in countries that faced the epidemic
in earlier time (Brogi et al., 2020). In this paper, we propose to estimate the
prevalence of Covid-19 in Italy by reweighting the available official data
published by the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\`a so as to obtain a more
representative sample of the Italian population. Reweighting is a procedure
commonly used to artificially modify the sample composition so as to obtain a
distribution which is more similar to the population (Valliant et al., 2018).
In this paper, we will use post-stratification of the official data, in order
to derive the weights necessary for reweighting them using age and gender as
post-stratification variables thus obtaining more reliable estimation of
prevalence and lethality.

with limited viewing range in the three-dimensional Euclidean space. In the
Gathering problem, a set of initially scattered robots is required to gather at
the same position. The robots' capabilities are very restricted -- they do not
agree on any coordinate system or compass, have a limited viewing range, have
no memory of the past and cannot communicate. We study the problem in two
different time models, in FSYNC (fully synchronized discrete rounds) and the
continuous time model. For FSYNC, we introduce the 3D-Go-To-The-Center-strategy
and prove a runtime of $\Theta(n^2)$ that matches the currently best runtime
bound for the same model in the Euclidean plane [SPAA'11]. Our main result is
the generalization of contracting strategies (continuous time) from
[Algosensors'17] to three dimensions. In contracting strategies, every robot
that is located on the global convex hull of all robots' positions moves with
full speed towards the inside of the convex hull. We prove a runtime bound of
$O(\Delta \cdot n^{3/2})$ for any three-dimensional contracting strategy, where
$\Delta$ denotes the diameter of the initial configuration. This comes up to a
factor of $\sqrt{n}$ close to the lower bound of $\Omega (\Delta \cdot n)$
which is already true in two dimensions. In general, it might be hard for
robots with limited viewing range to decide whether they are located on the
global convex hull and which movement maintains the connectivity of the swarm,
rendering the design of concrete contracting strategies a challenging task. We
prove that the continuous variant of 3D-Go-To-The-Center is contracting and
keeps the swarm connected. Moreover, we give a simple design criterion for
three-dimensional contracting strategies that maintains the connectivity of the
swarm and introduce an exemplary strategy based on this criterion.

  medium-resolution satellite imagery",,,"10.1080/01431161.2020.1841324",,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Scattered trees outside of dense, closed-canopy forests are very important
for carbon sequestration, supporting livelihoods, maintaining ecosystem
integrity, and climate change adaptation and mitigation. In contrast to trees
inside of closed-canopy forests, not much is known about the spatial extent and
distribution of scattered trees at a global scale. Due to the cost of
high-resolution satellite imagery, global monitoring systems rely on
medium-resolution satellites to monitor land use. Here we present a globally
consistent method to identify trees with canopy diameters greater than three
meters with medium-resolution optical and radar imagery. Biweekly cloud-free,
pan-sharpened 10 meter Sentinel-2 optical imagery and Sentinel-1 radar imagery
are used to train a fully convolutional network, consisting of a convolutional
gated recurrent unit layer and a feature pyramid attention layer. Tested across
more than 215,000 Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 pixels distributed from -60 to +60
latitude, the proposed model exceeds 75% user's and producer's accuracy
identifying trees in hectares with a low to medium density (less than 40%) of
tree cover, and 95% user's and producer's accuracy in hectares with dense
(greater than 40%) tree cover. The proposed method increases the accuracy of
monitoring tree presence in areas with sparse and scattered tree cover (less
than 40%) by as much as 20%, and reduces commission and omission error in
mountainous and very cloudy regions by nearly half. When applied across large,
heterogeneous landscapes, the results demonstrate potential to map trees in
high detail and accuracy over diverse landscapes across the globe. This
information is important for understanding current land cover and can be used
to detect changes in land cover such as agroforestry, buffer zones around
biological hotspots, and expansion or encroachment of forests.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) algorithms currently use pre-trained
models as their feature extractors, which are usually trained on the ImageNet
data set by using deep neural networks. The richness of the feature information
embedded in the pre-trained models can help the ZSL model extract more useful
features from its limited training samples. However, sometimes the difference
between the training data set of the current ZSL task and the ImageNet data set
is too large, which may lead to the use of pre-trained models has no obvious
help or even negative impact on the performance of the ZSL model. To solve this
problem, this paper proposes a biologically inspired feature enhancement
framework for ZSL. Specifically, we design a dual-channel learning framework
that uses auxiliary data sets to enhance the feature extractor of the ZSL model
and propose a novel method to guide the selection of the auxiliary data sets
based on the knowledge of biological taxonomy. Extensive experimental results
show that our proposed method can effectively improve the generalization
ability of the ZSL model and achieve state-of-the-art results on three
benchmark ZSL tasks. We also explained the experimental phenomena through the
way of feature visualization.

feature extraction. In this paper, a novel approach of user behavior detection
is proposed with Deep Learning Network (DNN). Initial approach was to use
recurrent neural network (RNN) along with LSTM for completely unsupervised

Short Term Memory (LSTM) to understand the user behaviour, which are then fed
into the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). This work mainly concentrates on
detection of user behaviour and anomaly detection for usage analysis of mobile

minimisation of the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional $E^{HK}[\rho]$ performed
using the auxiliary functional $E_{v_{AB}}^{FDET}[\Psi_A,\rho_B]$, where
$\Psi_A$ is the embedded $N_A$-electron wave-function and
$\rho_B(\vec{\mathrm{r}})$ a non-negative function in real space integrating to
a given number of electrons $N_B$. This choice of independent variables in the
total energy functional $E_{v_{AB}}^{FDET}[\Psi_A,\rho_B]$ makes it possible to
treat the corresponding two components of the total density using different
methods in multi-level simulations. We demonstrate, for the first time, the
applications of FDET using $\rho_B(\vec{\mathrm{r}})$ reconstructed from X-ray
diffraction data on a molecular crystal. For eight hydrogen-bonded clusters
involving a chromophore (represented with $\Psi_A$) and the glycylglycine
molecule (represented as $\rho_B(\vec{\mathrm{r}})$), FDET is used to derive
excitation energies. It is shown that experimental densities are suitable to be
used as $\rho_B(\vec{\mathrm{r}})$ in FDET based simulations.
