substrate and solidifies at the same time. The interplay between the phase
transition effects and the contact-line motion, leading to its arrest, remains
poorly understood. Here we reveal the early solidification patterns and
dynamics of spreading hexadecane droplets. Total internal reflection (TIR)
imaging is employed to temporally and spatially resolve the early
solidification behaviour. With this, we determine the conditions leading to the
contact-line arrest. We quantify the overall nucleation behaviour,
\textit{i.e.} the nucleation rate and the crystal growth speed, and show its
sensitivity to the applied undercooling of the substrate. By combining the
Johnson-Mehl-Avrami-Kolmogorov nucleation theory and scaling relations for the
spreading, we can calculate the temporal evolution of the solid area fraction,
which is in good agreement with our observations. We also show that for strong
enough undercooling it is the rapid growth of the crystals which determines the
eventual arrest of the spreading contact line.

this open question in the affirmative when the initial data of fluid are
well-prepared in a real analytic space, in 3D half space. As a key of this

no-slip boundary condition, as an $\textit{intermediary}$ approximation of the
Euler equations through a new Hilbert-type expansion of Boltzmann equation with
the diffuse reflection boundary condition. Aiming to justify the approximation
we establish a novel quantitative $L^p$-$L^\infty$ estimate of the Boltzmann
perturbation around a local Maxwellian of such viscous approximation, along
with the commutator estimates and the integrability gain of the hydrodynamic
part in various spaces; we also establish direct estimates of the Navier-Stokes

boundary layer weights using a recent Green's function approach. The
incompressible Euler limit follows as a byproduct of our framework.

Finally, we are able to give a combinatorial interpretation for $a_w$ when $w$

development from 1992 to present. Not all settlements can be detected with
night light, but the continuum of built environments where a rapidly growing
majority of the population lives generally can. Segmenting a continuous field
into discrete spatially contiguous subsets of pixels produces a spatial network
in which each contiguous segment represents a distinct network component.
Representing the continuum of lighted development as spatial networks of
varying spatial connectivity allows the generative conditions for power law
network structure to be applied in a spatial context to provide a general
explanation for similar scaling observed in settlements and other land cover
types. This study introduces a novel methodology to combine complementary
sources of satellite-derived night light observations to quantify the evolution
of the global spatial network structure of lighted development from 1992 to
2015. Area-perimeter distributions of network components show multifractal
scaling with larger components becoming increasingly tortuous. Rank-size
distributions of network components are linear and well described by power laws
with exponents within 0.08 of -1 for all 27 subsets of geography, year and
degree of connectivity - indicating robust scaling properties. Area
distributions of luminance within network components show an abrupt transition
from continuously low-skewed for smaller components to discontinuous, nearly
uniform luminance distributions for larger components, suggesting a fundamental
change in network structure despite a continuum of size and shape. These
results suggest that city size scaling, observed inconsistently for
administratively-defined city populations, is more consistent for
physically-defined settlement network area and can be explained more simply by
a spatial network growth process.

Meanwhile, in many real-world scenarios, there are some noisy supervising
auxiliary variables, for instance, subjective diagnostic opinions, that are
related to the observed heterogeneity of the unlabeled data. By leveraging
information from both supervising auxiliary variables and unlabeled data, we
seek to uncover more scientifically interpretable group structures that may be

develop a new statistical pattern discovery method named Supervised Convex

towards finding more interpretable patterns via a joint convex fusion penalty.
We develop several extensions of SCC to integrate different types of

discover new candidate genes as well as new subtypes of Alzheimer's Disease

Previous works either directly rank items by an end to end model, or rank items
by a score function that trades-off the point-wise score and the diversity
between items. However, there are two main existing challenges that are not
well studied: (1) the evaluation of the slate is hard due to the complex mutual
influences between items of one slate; (2) even given the optimal evaluation,
searching the optimal slate is challenging as the action space is exponentially
large. In this paper, we present a novel Generator and Critic slate re-ranking

different kernels, the same densities can be used for any reaction in which a
probe interacts perturbatively with the target. The method therefore exploits
the factorisation between nuclear structure and interaction kernel that occurs
in such processes. We study in detail the convergence in the number of partial
waves for matrix elements relevant in elastic Compton scattering on $^3$He. The
results are fully consistent with our previous calculations in Chiral Effective
Field Theory. But the new approach is markedly more computationally efficient,
which facilitates the inclusion of more partial-wave channels in the
calculation. We also discuss the usefulness of the transition-density method
for other nuclei and reactions. Calculations of elastic Compton scattering on
heavier targets like $^4$He are straightforward extensions of this study, since
the same interaction kernels are used. And the generality of the formalism

step in analysis, deformable registration among different image modalities is
often required in order to provide complementary visual information. During
registration, semantic information is key to match homologous points and
pixels. Nevertheless, many conventional registration methods are incapable in
capturing high-level semantic anatomical dense correspondences. In this work,
we propose a novel multi-task learning system, JSSR, based on an end-to-end 3D
convolutional neural network that is composed of a generator, a registration
and a segmentation component. The system is optimized to satisfy the implicit
constraints between different tasks in an unsupervised manner. It first
synthesizes the source domain images into the target domain, then an
intra-modal registration is applied on the synthesized images and target
images. The segmentation module are then applied on the synthesized and target
images, providing additional cues based on semantic correspondences. The
supervision from another fully-annotated dataset is used to regularize the
segmentation. We extensively evaluate JSSR on a large-scale medical image
dataset containing 1,485 patient CT imaging studies of four different contrast

systems, e.g., conventional laser gyroscopes near the deadband, have run up
against the Petermann limit, where excess noise exactly cancels any
scale-factor enhancement resulting in no overall enhancement in precision. As a
result, one might be tempted to conclude that exceptional points (EPs)
generally cannot be used to increase the precision of laser sensors. Indeed,
using a linear eigenmode analysis we show that the Petermann limit applies not
just to maximally dissipative systems, but for any type of EP, owing to the
fact that EPs are rotationally invariant. It turns out, however, that this
restriction comes from the assumption of linearity. We find that nonlinearity
breaks the rotation symmetry such that the different types of EPs are no longer
equivalent above threshold. In particular, for sufficiently high measurement
frequencies, EPs in conservatively coupled systems having a saturation
imbalance can lead to an increase in the fundamental precision beyond the
Petermann limit. Importantly, we find that only one mode lases under these
conditions. We show that the beat note can be recovered by interference with an
auxiliary mode, but that this has consequences for the quantum and classical
noise that depend on the recovery scheme. Thus, it remains to be seen whether
practical experiments can be designed that can take advantage of this
enhancement.

through communication links with neighboring satellites. The same control law
is used to maintain relative angular positions in the presence of disturbance
forces. The stability of the constellation in the desired orbit is proved using
a compositional approach. We first show the existence and uniqueness of an
equilibrium of the interconnected system. We then certify each satellite and
communication link is equilibrium-independent passive with respective storage
functions. By leveraging the skew symmetric coupling structure of the
constellation and the equilibrium-independent passivity property of each
subsystem, we show that the equilibrium of the interconnected system is stable
with a Lyapunov function composed of the individual subsystem storage
functions. We further prove that the angular velocity of each satellite
converges to the desired value necessary to maintain circular, areostationary

the proposed control law in acquisition and station-keeping of an

in the circular polarized light induced injection current. According to current
theoretical understanding, RhSi and its counterparts are believed to be the
most promising candidate for the experimental observation of the quantized

date. Since all the previous theoretical studies for the quantized CPGE were
based on effective model but not realistic band structures, it should lose some
crucial details that influence the quantized signal. The current status motives
us to perform a realistic ab-initio study for the CPGE. Our result shows that
the quantized value is very easy to be interfered by trivial bands related
optic transitions, and an fine tuning of the chemical potential by doping is
essential for the observation of quantized CPGE. This work performs the first
ab-initio analysis for the quantized CPGE based on realistic electronic band

reionization are strongly disfavoured, i.e. redshift when the reionization
begins, $z_{xe=0}=18.18_{-10.89}^{+1.61}$ at 68% CL,and that reionization
duration (defined between 10% and 99% reionization) is significantly reduced,
i.e. $\Delta_z^{Reion}=4.59_{-2.45}^{+1.67}$ at 68% CL. We explore possible
correlations between reionization histories and cosmological parameters,
including important extensions beyond $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the degeneracy
between reionization and scalar spectral index,neutrino mass sum, spatial
curvature, dark matter annihilation and other non-standard models are
significantly reduced.The reduction of the error bars and the degeneracies,
together with the shift towards lower values of the optical depth that we
observe in the Poly-reion model are mainly driven by the new low-$\ell$

cycles of quantum heat engines by counting the photons that are emitted and
absorbed by their working systems. Using the quantum jump approach to
open-system dynamics, we show that such experiments would give access to a set
of observables that determine the trade-off between power and efficiency in
finite-time engine cycles. By analyzing the single-jump statistics of
thermodynamic fluxes such as heat and entropy production, we obtain a family of
general bounds on the power of microscopic heat engines. Our new bounds unify
two earlier results and admit a transparent physical interpretation in terms of
single-photon measurements. In addition, these bounds confirm that
driving-induced coherence leads to an increase in dissipation that suppresses
the efficiency of slowly driven quantum engines in the weak-coupling regime. A
nanoscale heat engine based on a superconducting qubit serves as an
experimentally relevant example and a guiding paradigm for the development of
our theory.

finite point configurations generated by a compact set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$.
The first problem concerns how the Lebesgue measure or the Hausdorff dimension
of the finite point configuration set depends on that of $E$. In particular, we
show that if a planar set has dimension exceeding $\frac{5}{4}$, then there
exists a point $x\in E$ so that for each integer $k\geq2$, the set of
""$k$-chains"" with initial point at $x$ has positive Lebesgue measure.
  The second problem is a continuous analogue of the Erd\H{o}s unit distance
problem, which aims to determine the maximum number of times a point
configuration with prescribed gaps can appear in $E$. For instance, given a
triangle with prescribed sides and given a sufficiently regular planar set $E$
with Hausdorff dimension no less than $\frac{7}{4}$, we show that the dimension
of the set of vertices in $E$ forming said triangle does not exceed
$3\,\dim_{\mathcal{H}} (E)-3$. In addition to the Euclidean norm, we consider
more general distances given by functions satisfying the so-called Phong-Stein
rotational curvature condition. We also explore a number of examples to
demonstrate the extent to which our results are sharp.

deployed in the grid to reduce the grid's carbon emissions. While energy
storage has previously been used for grid optimizations such as peak shaving
and smoothing intermittent sources, our insight is to use distributed storage
to enable utilities to reduce their reliance on their less efficient and most
carbon-intensive power plants and thereby reduce their overall emission
footprint. We formulate the problem of emission-aware scheduling of distributed
energy storage as an optimization problem, and use a robust optimization
approach that is well-suited for handling the uncertainty in load predictions,
especially in the presence of intermittent renewables such as solar and wind.
We evaluate our approach using a state of the art neural network load

has become essential for emerging applications, such as autonomous driving,
environment monitoring. But the limitations of computation capability and
energy consumption make it difficult to run complex machine learning algorithms
on IoT devices, especially when latency deadline exists. One solution is to
offload the computation intensive tasks to the edge server. However, the
wireless uploading of the raw data is time consuming and may lead to deadline
violation. To reduce the communication cost, lossy data compression can be
exploited for inference tasks, but may bring more erroneous inference results.
In this paper, we propose a dynamic compression ratio selection scheme for edge
inference system with hard deadlines. The key idea is to balance the tradeoff
between communication cost and inference accuracy. By dynamically selecting the
optimal compression ratio with the remaining deadline budgets for queued tasks,
more tasks can be timely completed with correct inference under limited
communication resources. Furthermore, information augmentation that retransmits
less compressed data of task with erroneous inference, is proposed to enhance
the accuracy performance. While it is often hard to know the correctness of
inference, we use uncertainty to estimate the confidence of the inference, and
based on that, jointly optimize the information augmentation and compression
ratio selection. Lastly, considering the wireless transmission errors, we
further design a retransmission scheme to reduce performance degradation due to
packet losses. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed schemes
under different deadlines and task arrival rates.

edges, the line segments connecting them, are weighted by the Euclidean
distance between their endpoints. A spanning tree is an $\alpha$-spanning tree
($\alpha$-ST) of $G$ if, for any $i \in V$, the smallest angle that encloses
all line segments corresponding to its $i$-incident edges does not exceed
$\alpha$. $\alpha$-MSTP consists in finding an $\alpha$-ST with the least

${\mathcal F}_{xy}^*$ and $\mathcal{F}_x^{++}$ and their accompanying
Branch-and-cut (BC) algorithms, BCFXY$^*$ and BCFX$^{++}$. Both formulations
can be seen as improvements over formulations coming from the literature. The

existing set of inequalities in charge of enforcing $\alpha$ angular
constraints and (ii) characterizing $\alpha$-MSTP valid inequalities from the
Stable Set polytope, a structure behind $\alpha-$STs, that we disclosed here.
These formulations and their predecessors in the literature were compared from
a polyhedral perspective. From a numerical standpoint, we observed that
BCFXY$^*$ and BCFX$^{++}$ compare favorably to their competitors in the

$\mathcal{F}_x^{++}$, BCFX$^{++}$ seems to outperform the other existing
$\alpha-$MSTP algorithms. It is able to solve more instances to proven
optimality and to provide sharper lower bounds, when optimality is not attested
within an imposed time limit. As a by-product, BCFX$^{++}$ provided 8 new

the contact values are described only by the geometric porosity and do not
include the dependence on other types of porosity that are important for the

such contact values neglects the effects of trapping of fluid particles by a

virtual machines (VMs) for long periods (1 or 3 years) rather than acquiring
them on demand. Unfortunately, reserving VMs exposes users to \emph{demand
risk} that can increase cost if their expected future demand does not
materialize. Since accurately forecasting demand over long periods is
challenging, users often limit their use of reserved VMs. To mitigate demand
risk, Amazon operates a Reserved Instance Marketplace (RIM) where users may
publicly list the remaining time on their VM reservations for sale at a price
they set. The RIM enables users to limit demand risk by either selling VM
reservations if their demand changes, or purchasing variable- and shorter-term
VM reservations that better match their demand forecast horizon. Clearly, the
RIM's potential to mitigate demand risk is a function of its price
characteristics. However, to the best of our knowledge, historical RIM prices
have neither been made publicly available nor analyzed. To address the problem,
we have been monitoring and archiving RIM prices for 1.75 years across all 69

Since 2DA acts as a plug-in layer, injecting it into different computation
stages of the NBoF model results in different 2DA-NBoF architectures, each of

financial forecasting, audio analysis as well as medical diagnosis problems to
benchmark the proposed formulations in comparison with existing methods,

levels / scenes / conditions from the same task, has become essential for many
applications aiming to achieve generalization and domain transfer from

generalization, the use of multiple scenes significantly increases the variance
of samples collected for policy gradient computations. Current methods continue
to view this collection of scenes as a single Markov Decision Process (MDP)
with a common value function; however, we argue that it is better to treat the
collection as a single environment with multiple underlying MDPs. To this end,
we propose a dynamic value estimation (DVE) technique for these multiple-MDP
environments, motivated by the clustering effect observed in the value function
distribution across different scenes. The resulting agent is able to learn a
more accurate and scene-specific value function estimate (and hence the
advantage function), leading to a lower sample variance. Our proposed approach
is simple to accommodate with several existing implementations (like PPO, A3C)
and results in consistent improvements for a range of ProcGen environments and
the AI2-THOR framework based visual navigation task.

we rely on various previous works including those of Gressman--Strain,

an important challenge of this problem is to exploit the dispersive properties

different environments as reported in recent studies. However, it is unclear
how the viruses survive for such a long time and why their survivability varies
across different surfaces. To address these questions, we conduct systematic
experiments investigating the evaporation of droplets produced by a nebulizer
and human-exhaled gas on surfaces. We found that these droplets do not
disappear with evaporation, but instead shrink to a size of a few micrometers
(referred to as residues), persist for more than 24 hours, and are highly
durable against changes of environmental conditions. The characteristics of
these residues change significantly across surface types. Specifically,
surfaces with high thermal conductivity like copper do not leave any resolvable
residues, while stainless steel, plastic, and glass surfaces form residues from
a varying fraction of all deposited droplets at 40% relative humidity. Lowering
humidity level suppresses the formation of residues while increasing humidity
level enhances it. Our results suggest that these microscale residues can
potentially insulate the virus against environmental changes, allowing them to
survive inhospitable environments and remain infectious for prolonged durations
after deposition. Our findings can also be extended to other viruses
transmitted through respiratory droplets (e.g., SARS-CoV, flu viruses, etc.),
and can thus lead to practical guidelines for disinfecting surfaces and other
prevention measures (e.g., humidity control) for limiting viral transmission.

increasing dependence on cluster total mass at larger radius, and appears to be
self-similar with a universal radial dependence after scaling by cluster
radius. We also compare the diffuse light radial profiles to the cluster

them to be comparable. The IllustrisTNG galaxy formation simulation, TNG300,
offers further insight into the connection between diffuse stellar mass and
cluster matter distributions -- the simulation radial profile of the diffuse
stellar component does not have a similar slope with the total cluster matter
content, although that of the cluster satellite galaxies does. Regardless of
the radial trends, the amount of diffuse stellar mass has a low-scatter scaling
relation with cluster's total mass in the simulation, out-performing the total
stellar mass of cluster satellite galaxies. We conclude that there is no
consistent evidence yet on whether or not diffuse light is a faithful radial
tracer of the cluster matter distribution. Nevertheless, both observational and

halo properties to predict stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) are halo
mass, growth rate, and scale factor at the time the mass peaks, which results
from a feature importance analysis with random forests. We train different
models with supervised learning to find the optimal network architecture.
GalaxyNet is then trained with a reinforcement learning approach: for a fixed
set of weights and biases, we compute the galaxy properties for all haloes and
then derive mock statistics (stellar mass functions, cosmic and specific SFRs,
quenched fractions, and clustering). Comparing these statistics to observations
we get the model loss, which is minimised with particle swarm optimisation.
GalaxyNet reproduces the observed data very accurately
($\chi_\mathrm{red}=1.05$), and predicts a stellar-to-halo mass relation with a
lower normalisation and shallower low-mass slope at high redshift than
empirical models. We find that at low mass, the galaxies with the highest SFRs
are satellites, although most satellites are quenched. The normalisation of the
instantaneous conversion efficiency increases with redshift, but stays constant
above $z\gtrsim0.7$. Finally, we use GalaxyNet to populate a cosmic volume of
$(5.9~\mathrm{Gpc})^3$ with galaxies and predict the BAO signal, the bias, and
the clustering of active and passive galaxies up to $z=4$, which can be tested
with next-generation surveys, such as LSST and Euclid.

light curves of stars in stellar clusters and young associations for the
identification of candidate exoplanets and variable stars. The cutting-edge
tools used in this project allow us to measure the real flux of stars in dense
fields, minimising the effects due to contamination by neighbour sources. We
extracted about 200 000 light curves of stars in 645 open clusters located in
the southern ecliptic hemisphere and observed by TESS during the first year of
its mission. We searched for transiting signals and we found 33 objects of
interest, 11 of them are strong candidate exoplanets. Because of the limited
S/N, we did not find any Earth or super-Earth. We identified two Neptune-size
planets orbiting stars with $R_{\star}<1.5\,R_{\odot}$, implying a frequency
$f_{\star}=1.34 \pm 0.95\,\%$, consistent with the frequency around field
stars. The 7 Jupiter candidates around stars with $R_{\star}<\,1.5R_{\odot}$
imply a frequency $f_{\star}=0.19\pm 0.07\,\%$, smaller than in the field. A
more complete estimate of the survey completeness and false positive rate is
needed to confirm these results. Light curves used in this work will be made
available to the astronomical community on the Mikulski Archive for Space

their quantum character. This happens when the quantum sub-system of interest
interacts and becomes entangled with an environment that is traced out. For
ordinary macroscopic systems, electromagnetic and other interactions cause
rapid decoherence. However, dark matter (DM) may have the unique possibility of
exhibiting naturally prolonged macroscopic quantum properties due to its weak
coupling to its environment, particularly if it only interacts gravitationally.
In this work, we compute the rate of decoherence for light DM in the galaxy,
where a local density has its mass, size, and location in a quantum
superposition. The decoherence is via the gravitational interaction of the DM
overdensity with its environment, provided by ordinary matter. We focus on
relatively robust configurations: DM perturbations that involve an overdensity
followed by an underdensity, with no monopole, such that it is only observable
at relatively close distances. We use non-relativistic scattering theory with a
Newtonian potential generated by the overdensity to determine how a probe
particle scatters off of it and thereby becomes entangled. As an application,
we consider light scalar DM, including axions. In the galactic halo, we use
diffuse hydrogen as the environment, while near the earth, we use air as the
environment. For an overdensity whose size is the typical DM de Broglie
wavelength, we find that the decoherence rate in the halo is higher than the
present Hubble rate for DM masses $m_a \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-7}$eV and in
earth based experiments it is higher than the classical field coherence rate
for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-6}$eV. When spreading of the states occurs, the rates
can become much faster, as we quantify. Also, we establish that DM BECs
decohere very rapidly and so are very well described by classical field theory.

with spectral aging. Beyond NGC 1275, we also analyze complex radio sources
harbored in the cluster. Two new distinct, narrowly-collimated jets are visible
in IC 310, consistent with a highly-projected narrow-angle tail radio galaxy
infalling into the cluster. We show how this is in agreement with its
blazar-like behavior, implying that blazars and bent-jet radio galaxies are not
mutually exclusive. We report the presence of filamentary structures across the
entire tail of NGC 1265, including two new pairs of long filaments in the
faintest bent extension of the tail. Such filaments have been seen in other
cluster radio sources such as relics and radio lobes, indicating that there may
be a fundamental connection between all these radio structures. We resolve the
very narrow and straight tail of CR 15 without indication of double jets, so
that the interpretation of such head-tail sources is yet unclear. Finally, we
note that only the brightest western parts of the mini-halo remain, near NGC
1272 and its bent double jets.

at 1800 km/s, was most likely produced by tidal break-up of a tight binary by
the supermassive black hole SgrA*. Taking a Monte Carlo approach, we show that
the former companion of S5-HVS1 was likely a main-sequence star between 1.2 and
6 solar masses and was captured into a highly eccentric orbit with pericenter
distance in the range 1-10 AU and semimajor axis about $10^3$ AU. We then
explore the fate of the captured star. We find that the heat deposited by
tidally excited stellar oscillation modes leads to runaway disruption if the
pericenter distance is smaller than about 3 AU. Over the past 5 Myr, its
angular momentum has been significantly modified by orbital relaxation, which
may stochastically drive the pericenter inwards below 3 AU and cause tidal
disruption. We find an overall survival probability in the range 5% to 50%,
depending on the local relaxation time in the close environment of the captured
star, and the initial pericenter at capture. The pericenter distance of the
surviving star has migrated to 10-100 AU, making it potentially the most
extreme member of the S-star cluster. From the ejection rate of S5-HVS1-like
stars, we estimate that there may currently be a few stars in such highly
eccentric orbits. They should be detectable (typically Ks < 18.5 mag) by the
GRAVITY instrument and by future Extremely Large Telescopes and hence provide
an extraordinary probe of the spin of SgrA*.

self-replicating space probes has not been presented since the 1980s, and it is
still unclear how far they are feasible. In this paper, we propose a concept
for a partially self-replicating probe for space exploration based on current

chart a path towards self-replication with near-term benefits, rather than
attempting full self-replication. For this reason, components such as
microchips and other microelectronic components are brought with the initial
probe and are not replicated. We estimate that such a probe would be capable of
replicating 70% of its mass. To further increase this percentage, we identify
technology gaps that are promising to address. We conclude that small-scale,
partially self-replicating probes are feasible near-term. Their benefits would
play out in exploration missions requiring roughly more than a dozen of probes.

related to the equation of state of the universe. Furthermore, the induced

derive the thermodynamic profiles of galaxy clusters. JoXSZ follows a fully
Bayesian forward-modelling approach, accounts for the SZ calibration
uncertainty and X-ray background level systematic. It improves upon most
state-of-the-art, and not publicly available, analyses because it adopts the
correct Poisson-Gauss expression for the joint likelihood, makes full use of
the information contained in the observations, even in the case of missing
values within the datasets, has a more inclusive error budget, and adopts a
consistent temperature across the various parts of the code, allowing for
differences between X-ray and SZ gas mass weighted temperatures when required
by the user. JoXSZ accounts for beam smearing and data analysis transfer
function, accounts for the temperature and metallicity dependencies of the SZ
and X-ray conversion factors, adopts flexible parametrization for the
thermodynamic profiles, and on user request allows either adopting or relaxing
the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE). When HE holds, JoXSZ uses a
physical (positive) prior on the radial derivative of the enclosed mass and
derives the mass profile and overdensity radii $r_\Delta$. For these reasons,
JoXSZ goes beyond simple SZ and electron density fits. We illustrate the use of
JoXSZ by combining Chandra and NIKA data on the high-redshift cluster CL
J1226.9+3332. The code is written in Python, it is fully documented and the

eye blinks for overall video realism. In this paper, we propose a method for
identity-preserving realistic facial animation from speech. We first generate
person-independent facial landmarks from audio using DeepSpeech features for
invariance to different voices, accents, etc. To add realism, we impose eye
blinks on facial landmarks using unsupervised learning and retargets the
person-independent landmarks to person-specific landmarks to preserve the
identity-related facial structure which helps in the generation of plausible
mouth shapes of the target identity. Finally, we use LSGAN to generate the
facial texture from person-specific facial landmarks, using an attention
mechanism that helps to preserve identity-related texture. An extensive

demonstrates a significant improvement in terms of lip synchronization

experiment to demonstrate computation heterogeneity is a more pronounced
bottleneck than communication on the current generation of battery-powered
mobile devices, and the existing methods are haunted by mobile stragglers.
Further, non-identically distributed data across the mobile users makes the
selection of participants critical to the accuracy and convergence. To tackle
the computational and statistical heterogeneity, we utilize data as a tuning
knob and propose two efficient polynomial-time algorithms to schedule different
workloads on various mobile devices, when data is identically or
non-identically distributed. For identically distributed data, we combine
partitioning and linear bottleneck assignment to achieve near-optimal training

into an average cost minimization problem and propose a greedy algorithm to
find a reasonable balance between computation time and accuracy. We also
establish an offline profiler to quantify the runtime behavior of different
devices, which serves as the input to the scheduling algorithms. We conduct
extensive experiments on a mobile testbed with two datasets and up to 20

for macro cell and small cell base stations (BSs) such that the weighted sum
rate of the system is maximized, subject to a total transmit power at
individual BSs. The optimization problem is inherently nonconvex and
intractable, making it difficult to explore the full potential performance of
the scheme. To this end, we first propose an algorithm to find a globally
optimal solution based on the generic monotonic branch reduce and bound
optimization framework. Then, for a more computationally efficient method, we
adopt the inner approximation (InAp) technique to efficiently derive a locally
optimal solution, which is numerically shown to achieve near-optimal
performance. In addition, for decentralized networks such as those comprising
of multi-access edge computing servers, we develop an algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers, which distributively implements
the InAp-based solution. Our main conclusion is that the noncoherent JT is a
promising transmission scheme for dense small cell networks, since it can
exploit the densitification gain, outperforms the coordinated beamforming, and
is amenable to distributed implementation.

fidelity quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation. Recent
experiments have demonstrated that microwave photons, as well as phonons, can
be used to couple superconducting qubits, with a fidelity limited primarily by
loss in the communication channel. Adiabatic protocols can overcome channel
loss by transferring quantum states without populating the lossy communication
channel. Here we present a unique superconducting quantum communication system,
comprising two superconducting qubits connected by a 0.73 m-long communication
channel. Significantly, we can introduce large tunable loss to the channel,
allowing exploration of different entanglement protocols in the presence of
dissipation. When set for minimum loss in the channel, we demonstrate an
adiabatic quantum state transfer protocol that achieves 99% transfer efficiency
as well as the deterministic generation of entangled Bell states with a
fidelity of 96%, all without populating the intervening communication channel,
and competitive with a qubit-resonant mode-qubit relay method. We also explore
the performance of the adiabatic protocol in the presence of significant
channel loss, and show that the adiabatic protocol protects against loss in the
channel, achieving higher state transfer and entanglement fidelities than the
relay method.

observers in given situations which lead to debates about whether
observer-specific information should affect the probability for some outcome or
hypothesis. Our purpose is not to advocate for such observer selection effects,
but rather to show that any such effects depend greatly on the assumptions
made. We focus on the debate about the existence of a `Doomsday
effect'---whether observer index information should cause one to favor
possibilities with fewer observers, which has been argued to have implications
for models of cosmology. Our central goal is to reconcile the apparent
inconsistencies in the literature by introducing a formalism to lay bare
assumptions made and address a key issue that has not been clearly articulated
in such problems: whether the observer is selected by *picking from* or *being
in* a set of worlds. In the former there generally are observer selection
effects, and in the latter there generally are not. This leads us to
differentiate what we call *inclusive* from *exclusive* selection, and how they
relate to the concept of a multiverse. Then we relax the assumption that all
observers are equally typical, and consider the problem of Boltzmann brains,
showing that typicality can play a role in solving the problem. We then stress
the need for scale-invariant questions, which causes us to analyze J. Richard
Gott's approach to the problem. This all allows us to analyze the Doomsday and
Universal Doomsday arguments. We find that there is no Doomsday effect, absent
a set of assumptions we find somewhat unreasonable. Then we use our formalism
to resolve a debate in the philosophy community called the `Sleeping Beauty
Problem.' Finally, we conclude with a heuristic summary, free from equations,
and point to possible future directions of this line of research.

since there is no apparent supernova remnant or pulsar wind nebula detected in
the lower energy bands. The radio pulsar PSR J1928+1746, coinciding with the
HAWC source position, has no X-ray counterpart. Our SED modeling shows that
inverse Compton scattering in the putative pulsar wind nebula can account for
the TeV emission only if the unseen nebula is extended beyond r ~ 4 [arcmin].
Alternatively, TeV gamma rays may be produced by hadronic interactions between
relativistic protons from an undetected supernova remnant associated with the
radio pulsar and a nearby molecular cloud G52.9+0.1. NuSTAR and Chandra
observations detected a variable X-ray point source within the HAWC error
circle, potentially associated with a bright IR source. The X-ray spectra can
be fitted with an absorbed power-law model with $N_{\rm H} =

possibly associated with the IR source (likely an O star), is the counterpart
of the HAWC source, it may be a new TeV gamma-ray binary powered by collisions
between the pulsar wind and stellar wind. Follow-up X-ray observations are

no-write-down no-read-up style security policy known as noninterference.
Traditional methods for both static and dynamic IFC suffer from untenable
numbers of false alarms on real-world programs. Secure Multi-Execution (SME)
promises to provide secure IFC without modifying the behaviour of already
secure programs, a property known as transparency. Implementations of SME exist
for the web and as plug-ins to several programming languages. Furthermore, SME
can in theory work in a black-box manner, meaning that it can be programming
language agnostic, making it perfect for securing legacy or third-party
systems. As such SME, and its variants like Multiple Facets (MF) and Faceted
Secure Multi-Execution (FSME), appear to be a family of panaceas for the
security engineer. The question is, how come, given all these advantages, that
these techniques are not ubiquitous in practice? The answer lies, partially, in
the issue of runtime and memory overhead. SME and its variants are
prohibitively expensive to deploy in many non-trivial situations. Why is this
the case? On the surface, the reason is simple. The techniques in the SME
family all rely on the idea of multi-execution, running all or parts of a
program multiple times to achieve noninterference. Naturally, this causes
overhead. However, the goal in the IFC community has been to overcome these
overheads. In this paper we argue that there are fundamental reasons to expect
this not to be possible and prove two key theorems: 1. All transparent
enforcement is polynomial time equivalent to multi-execution. 2. All black-box
enforcement takes time exponential in the number of principals in the security
lattice. We also answer, in the affirmative, an open question about the
possibility of transparently enforcing the TINI security condition.

solutions. We resolve this by supplementing the smooth global basis with an
inherently discontinuous basis, incorporating knowledge of the location of the
discontinuities. The solution's discontinuities are reproduced with exponential
convergence, expediting simulations. The highly constrained discontinuous basis
also eliminates the freedom to generate spurious solutions. We employ the
combined smooth and discontinuous bases to construct a solver for the modes of
a resonator in an open electromagnetic system. These modes can then expand any
scattering problem for any source configuration or incidence condition without
further numerics, enabling ready access and physical insight into the spatial

dimming or extinguishing publicly owned outdoor lighting during overnight

single-channel and spatially resolved ground-based measurements of broadband
night sky radiance obtained during the tests, determining that the zenith sky
brightness during the tests decreased by ($-5.4\pm0.9$)% near the city center

of the street lighting system was dimmed from 90% of its full power draw to 30%

continuous vector-valued paths, and has received attention for use in machine
learning on time series. However, real-world temporal data is typically
observed at discrete points in time, and must first be transformed into a
continuous path before signature techniques can be applied. We make this step
explicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess
the impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based
neural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies,
Gaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes
uncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while
at the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our
experiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow
signature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust. Next, we
observe that uncertainty-aware predictions (based on GP-PoM or indicator
imputations) are beneficial for predictive performance, even compared to the
uncertainty-aware training of conventional GP adapters. In conclusion, we have
demonstrated that the path construction is indeed crucial for signature models
and that our proposed strategy leads to competitive performance in general,
while improving robustness of signature models in particular.

However, Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed predominately Alfv\'enic slow solar
wind during several of its initial encounters. From its first encounter
observations, about 55.3\% of the slow solar wind inside 0.25 au is highly
Alfv\'enic ($|\sigma_C| > 0.7$) at current solar minimum, which is much higher
than the fraction of quiet-Sun-associated highly Alfv\'enic slow wind observed
at solar maximum at 1 au. Intervals of slow solar wind with different
Alfv\'enicities seem to show similar plasma characteristics and temperature
anisotropy distributions. Some low Alfv\'enicity slow wind intervals even show
high temperature anisotropies, because the slow wind may experience
perpendicular heating as fast wind does when close to the Sun. This signature
is confirmed by Wind spacecraft measurements as we track PSP observations to 1
au. Further, with nearly 15 years of Wind measurements, we find that the
distributions of plasma characteristics, temperature anisotropy and helium
abundance ratio ($N_\alpha/N_p$) are similar in slow winds with different
Alfv\'enicities, but the distributions are different from those in the fast
solar wind. Highly Alfv\'enic slow solar wind contains both helium-rich
($N_\alpha/N_p\sim0.045$) and helium-poor ($N_\alpha/N_p\sim0.015$)

results suggest that highly Alfv\'enic slow solar wind shares similar
temperature anisotropy and helium abundance properties with regular slow solar

Using a spiral ansatz for the spins, we study the effect of the electron

individual blocks, the spiral phases are suppressed, and the ground state
oscillates between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order as the size of the
buffer regions is varied. This is accompanied by a corresponding oscillation in
the Drude weight reflecting an increased conductivity in the ferromagnetic
state compared to the antiferromagnetic one. These results are reminiscent of
classic giant magnetoresistance phenomena observed in a similar geometry of
thin, sandwiched magnetic and non-magnetic layers. Our analysis provides a
robust framework for understanding the role of the RKKY interaction on the

resolution ($m_{gas} \simeq 1.8\times 10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$) cluster zoom
simulations, to investigate the redshift evolution of metallicity, with
particular focus on the cluster outskirts. The early enrichment model, in which
the majority of metals are produced in the core of cluster progenitors at high
redshift, suggests that metals in cluster outskirts have not significantly
evolved since $z=2$. With the C-EAGLE sample, we find reasonable agreement with
the early enrichment model as there is very little scatter in the metallicity
abundance at large radius across the whole sample, out to at least $z=2$. The
exception is Fe for which the radial dependence of metallicity was found to
evolve at low redshift as a result of being mainly produced by Type Ia
supernovae, which are more likely to be formed at later times than
core-collapse supernovae. We also found considerable redshift evolution of
metal abundances in the cores of the C-EAGLE clusters which has not been seen
in other simulations or observation based metallicity studies. Since we find
this evolution to be driven by accretion of low metallicity gas, it suggests
that the interaction between outflowing, AGN heated material and the
surrounding gas is important for determining the core abundances in clusters.

inputs using an evolutionary fitness function for further mutation. Despite
their success, evolutionary fuzzers tend to get stuck in long sequences of
unproductive mutations. In recent years, machine learning (ML) based mutation
strategies have reported promising results. However, the existing ML-based
fuzzers are limited by the lack of quality and diversity of the training data.
As the input space of the target programs is high dimensional and sparse, it is
prohibitively expensive to collect many diverse samples demonstrating
successful and unsuccessful mutations to train the model. In this paper, we
address these issues by using a Multi-Task Neural Network that can learn a
compact embedding of the input space based on diverse training samples for
multiple related tasks (i.e., predicting for different types of coverage). The
compact embedding can guide the mutation process by focusing most of the
mutations on the parts of the embedding where the gradient is high. \tool

networks for time series forecasting has become more prevalent. The
quasi-periodic nature of the solar cycle makes it a good candidate for applying
time series forecasting methods. We employ a combination of WaveNet and LSTM
neural networks to forecast the sunspot number using the years 1749 to 2019 and
total sunspot area using the years 1874 to 2019 time series data for the
upcoming Solar Cycle 25. Three other models involving the use of LSTMs and 1D
ConvNets are also compared with our best model. Our analysis shows that the
WaveNet and LSTM model is able to better capture the overall trend and learn
the inherent long and short term dependencies in time series data. Using this
method we forecast 11 years of monthly averaged data for Solar Cycle 25. Our
forecasts show that the upcoming Solar Cycle 25 will have a maximum sunspot
number around 106 $\pm$ 19.75 and maximum total sunspot area around 1771 $\pm$
381.17. This indicates that the cycle would be slightly weaker than Solar Cycle
24.

reachability tasks for a continuous time mobile robotic system is presented.
Control barrier functions provide formal guarantees of forward invariance of
safe sets and finite-time reachability and are able to enforce task execution.
Barrier functions used in quadratic programs result in implementation of
controllers with real-time performance guarantees. Existing approaches for
multi-objective task execution using control barrier functions leverage
discretely switched, sequential quadratic programs to achieve successive tasks.
However, discrete switching can lead to control input discontinuities which can
affect a robot's performance. Hence, we propose a method which ensures
continuous transitions between sequential quadratic programs. In particular, a
time varying component to the barrier function constraint is introduced which
allows for a smooth transition between objectives. Robotic implementation
results are also provided.

proposed framework is that the application does not require the solution to

predicted output error, possibly with some input regularization. Instead of
using terminal cost/sets or a positive definite stage cost as is standard in
MPC theory, we build on the theoretical results by Grimm et al. 2005 using a

ensures exponential stability of the regulator manifold. We also provide a
design procedure in case of unstable zero dynamics using an incremental input
regularization and a nonresonance condition. Inherent robustness properties for
the noisy error/output-feedback case are established under simplifying
assumptions (e.g. no state constraints). The theoretical results are
illustrated with an example involving offset free tracking with noisy error

format designed for matrices with shared sparsity structure between adjacent

blocks that contain nonzeros in a dense format. This reduces the memory
footprint and enables optimizations such as register blocking and
instruction-level parallelism. Existing approaches use heuristics to determine
which rows and columns should be grouped together. We show that finding the
optimal grouping of rows and columns for VBR is NP-hard under several
reasonable cost models. In light of this finding, we propose a 1-dimensional
variant of VBR, called 1D-VBR, which achieves better performance than VBR by
only grouping rows. We describe detailed cost models for runtime and memory

optimally grouping the rows for 1D-VBR format. We extend our algorithm to
produce a heuristic VBR partitioner which alternates between optimally
partitioning rows and columns, assuming the columns or rows to be fixed,

showed ethanol preference that was abolished on high nutrient concentration
diets. Additionally, manipulating total food intake without altering the
nutritive value of the base diet or the ethanol concentration was sufficient to
evoke or eliminate ethanol preference. Absolute ethanol intake and food volume

  Analysis now includes two refreshed shock models and expanded discussion",,"10.3847/1538-4357/aba75a",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Energy injection into the external shock system that generates the afterglow
to a gamma-ray burst (GRB) can result in a re-brightening of the emission. Here
we investigate the off-axis view of a re-brightened refreshed shock afterglow.
We find that the afterglow light-curve, when viewed from outside of the jet
opening angle, could be characterised by a slow rise, or long-plateau, with a
maximum flux determined by the total system energy. Using the broadband
afterglow data for GRB170817A, associated with the gravitational wave detected
binary neutron star merger GW170817, we show that a refreshed shock model with
a simple top-hat jet can reproduce the observed afterglow features. We consider
two particular refreshed shock models: a single episode of energy injection;
and a period of continuous energy injection. The best fit model parameters give
a jet opening angle, for our first or second model of
$\theta_j=5.2^{+1.1}_{-0.6}~$or$~6.3^{+1.7}_{-1.1}$ deg, an inclination to the
line of sight $\iota=16.0^{+3.4}_{-1.1}~$or$~17.8^{+4.5}_{-2.9}$ deg, an
initial isotropic equivalent kinetic energy $E_1 =
(0.3^{+3.5}_{-0.3}~$or$~0.5^{+6.7}_{-0.2})\times10^{52}$erg and a total/final,
refreshed shock energy $E_{\rm
total}=(0.42^{+5.6}_{-0.4}~$or$~1.26^{+18.2}_{-0.7})\times10^{53}$erg. The
first model fitting prefers an initial bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma_{0,1}<60$,
with a comparatively low central value of $\Gamma_{0,1}=19.5$, indicating that,
in this case, the on-axis jet could have been a `failed-GRB'. Alternatively,
our second model is consistent with a bright GRB for an on-axis observer, with
$\Gamma_{0,1}=162.2^{+219.7}_{-122.1}$. Due to the low-Lorentz factor or the
jet opening angles at $\theta_j\sim\iota/3$, both models are unable to
reproduce the $\gamma$-ray emission observed in GRB170817A, which would
therefore require an alternative explanation such as cocoon shock-breakout.

  https://github.com/JonasBeal/Causal_Precision_Medicine",,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The development of high-throughput sequencing and targeted therapies has led
to the emergence of personalized medicine: a patient's molecular profile or the
presence of a specific biomarker of drug response will correspond to a
treatment recommendation made either by a physician or by a treatment
assignment algorithm. The growing number of such algorithms raises the question
of how to quantify their clinical impact knowing that a personalized medicine
strategy will inherently include different versions of treatment.
  We thus specify an appropriate causal framework with multiple versions of
treatment to define the causal effects of interest for precision medicine
strategies and estimate them emulating clinical trials with observational data.
Therefore, we determine whether the treatment assignment algorithm is more
efficient than different control arms: gold standard treatment, observed
treatments or random assignment of targeted treatments.
  Causal estimates of the precision medicine effects are first evaluated on
simulated data and they demonstrate a lower biases and variances compared with
naive estimation of the difference in expected outcome between treatment arms.
The various simulations scenarios also point out the different bias sources
depending on the clinical situation (heterogeneity of response, assignment of
observed treatments etc.). A RShiny interactive application is also provided to
further explore other user-defined scenarios. The method is then applied to
data from patient-derived xenografts (PDX): each patient tumour is implanted in
several immunodeficient cloned mice later treated with different drugs, thus
providing access to all corresponding drug sensitivities for all patients.
Access to these unique pre-clinical data emulating counterfactual outcomes
allows to validate the reliability of causal estimates obtained with the
proposed method.

capture the behavior difference between insiders and normal users due to
various challenges related to the characteristics of underlying data, such as

Advanced deep learning techniques provide a new paradigm to learn end-to-end

commonly-used dataset for insider threat detection and review the recent

that compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, deep learning

excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of

is the key protection factor against COVID-19. Social distancing alone should
have been enough to protect again the virus, yet things have gone very
differently, with a big mismatch between theory and practice. What are the
reasons? A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and
the corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the
world-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to
see for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify
dangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future
pandemics.
  Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social
distance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical
COVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various
Personal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.
  Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous
strategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of
social distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the
paradoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior. In
shortage of masks, DIY (Do It Yourself) masks can also be used: even without
filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. Goggles should
be recommended for general use, as they give an extra powerful safety boost.
Generic Public Health policies and media campaigns do not work well on social

are of interest and importance in many applications such as image processing

vanishing moments for sparse multiscale representation, fast framelet
transforms for numerical efficiency, and redundancy for robustness. However, it
is a challenging problem to study and construct multivariate nonseparable
framelets, mainly due to their intrinsic connections to factorization and
syzygy modules of multivariate polynomial matrices. In this paper, we
circumvent the above difficulties through the approach of quasi-tight
framelets, which behave almost identically to tight framelets. Employing the
popular oblique extension principle (OEP), from an arbitrary compactly
supported $\dm$-refinable vector function $\phi$ with multiplicity greater than
one, we prove that we can always derive from $\phi$ a compactly supported
multivariate quasi-tight framelet such that (i) all the framelet generators
have the highest possible order of vanishing moments;(ii) its associated fast
framelet transform is compact with the highest balancing order.For a refinable
scalar function $\phi$, the above item (ii) often cannot be achieved
intrinsically but we show that we can always construct a compactly supported
OEP-based multivariate quasi-tight framelet derived from $\phi$ satisfying item
(i).This paper provides a comprehensive investigation on OEP-based multivariate
quasi-tight multiframelets and their associated framelet transforms with high

implication of the classical notion of the vortex representation. Various
vortex identification criteria have been proposed to extract the vortex
filaments from available velocity fields, which is an essential procedure in
the practice of the vortex representation. This work focuses on the
effectiveness of those identification criteria in the compressed representation
of wall-bounded turbulence. Five local identification criteria regarding the
vortex strength and three criteria for the vortex axis are considered. To
facilitate the comparisons, this work first non-dimensionalize the criteria of
the vortex strength based on their dimensions and root mean squares, with
corresponding equivalent thresholds prescribed. The optimal definition for the
vortex vector is discussed by trialling all the possible combinations of the
identification criteria for the vortex strength and the vortex axis. The
effectiveness of those criteria in the compressed representation is evaluated
based on two principles: (1) efficient compression, which implies the less
information required, the better for the representation; (2) accurate
decompression, which stresses that the original velocity fields could be
reconstructed based on the vortex representation in high accuracy. In practice,
the alignment of the identified vortex axis and vortex isosurface, and the
accuracy for decompressed velocity fields based on those criteria are
quantitatively compared. The alignment degree is described by using the
differential geometry method, and the decompressing process is implemented via
the two-dimensional field-based linear stochastic estimation. The results of
this work provide some reference for the applications of vortex identification
criteria in wall-bounded turbulence.

Spectrometer (FTS) Spectral Feature Finder (FF). The FF is an automated process
designed to extract significant spectral features from SPIRE FTS data products.
Optimising the number of features found in SPIRE-FTS spectra is challenging.
The wide SPIRE-FTS frequency range (447-1568 GHz) leads to many molecular
species and atomic fine structure lines falling within the observed bands. As
the best spectral resolution of the SPIRE-FTS is ~1.2 GHz, there can be
significant line blending, depending on the source type. In order to find, both
efficiently and reliably, features in spectra associated with a wide range of
sources, the FF iteratively searches for peaks over a number of signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) thresholds. For each threshold, newly identified features are
rigorously checked before being added to the fitting model. At the end of each
iteration, the FF simultaneously fits the continuum and features found, with
the resulting residual spectrum used in the next iteration. The final FF
products report the frequency of the features found and the associated SNRs.
Line flux determination is not included as part of the FF products, as
extracting reliable line flux from SPIRE-FTS data is a complex process that
requires careful evaluation and analysis of the spectra on a case-by-case
basis. The FF results are 100% complete for features with SNR greater than 10
and 50-70% complete at SNR of 5. The FF code and all FF products are publicly

a network architecture derived from the loss to maximize conditional
log-likelihood by optimizing the lower bound with a proper approximate
posterior that has shown impressive performance in several generative models.
In addition, by extending the layer of latent variables to multiple layers, the
network is able to learn robust features on scale with no task-specific
regularization or data augmentation. We provide a detailed analysis and show
the results on three public benchmark datasets to confirm the efficiency and

of tens of free spectral ranges from each other, have been recently discovered
in quantum cascade lasers (QCLs). There is an ongoing debate how the harmonic
combs can be formed and stable under continuous pumping. Here we reproduce the
harmonic state of lasing in QCLs by space-time-domain numerical simulations and
show that the corresponding optical wave has a frequency-modulated (FM) nature,
with the fundamental beat note in the electron population being suppressed. To
understand the physics behind the formation and stability of the harmonic
state, we develop a frequency-domain linearized analytic theory which analyzes
the stability of single mode lasing with respect to the harmonic state
formation and the instabilities of the resulting harmonic state. Our analysis
shows how the instability of a single lasing mode can result in the growth of
harmonic side modes. The coupling between the two side modes leads to opposite
gains for FM and amplitude-modulated (AM) waves, and the FM gain is enhanced as
compared to the AM gain. The dependence of the sideband gain spectrum on group
velocity dispersion is also studied. While the instability gain of a single
lasing mode does not prove that the harmonic state can be self-starting, we
analyze the sideband instability gain in the presence of three strong harmonic
modes and demonstrate that the harmonic state can be stable and self-supported.

importance in material characterization and analysis. Recent studies have shown
that deep learning (DL) methods can effectively reveal the correlations between
X-ray or electron-beam diffraction patterns and crystal symmetry. Despite their
promise, most of these studies have been limited to identifying relatively few
classes into which a target material may be grouped. On the other hand, the
DL-based identification of crystal symmetry suffers from a drastic drop in
accuracy for problems involving classification into tens or hundreds of
symmetry classes (e.g., up to 230 space groups), severely limiting its
practical usage. Here, we demonstrate that a combined approach of shaping
diffraction patterns and implementing them in a multistream DenseNet (MSDN)
substantially improves the accuracy of classification. Even with an imbalanced
dataset of 108,658 individual crystals sampled from 72 space groups, our model
achieves 80.2% space group classification accuracy, outperforming conventional
benchmark models by 17-27 percentage points (%p). The enhancement can be
largely attributed to the pattern shaping strategy, through which the subtle
changes in patterns between symmetrically close crystal systems (e.g.,
monoclinic vs. orthorhombic or trigonal vs. hexagonal) are well differentiated.
We additionally find that the novel MSDN architecture is advantageous for
capturing patterns in a richer but less redundant manner relative to
conventional convolutional neural networks. The newly proposed protocols in
regard to both input descriptor processing and DL architecture enable accurate
space group classification and thus improve the practical usage of the DL
approach in crystal symmetry identification.

under exposure to radio frequency (RF) radiation generated by wearable devices.
The biggest challenge in the implementation of wearable devices is to reduce
the usage of energy to minimize the harmful impacts of exposure to RF on human
health. Power management is one of the key energy-saving strategies used in
wearable networks. Signals enter the receiver (Rx) from a transmitter (Tx)
through the human body in the form of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation
produced during the transmission of the packet. It may have a negative effect
on human health as a result of specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR is the
amount of radio frequency energy consumed by human tissue in mass units. The
higher the body's absorption rate, the more radio frequency radiation.
Therefore, SAR can be reduced by distributing the power over a greater mass or
tissue volume equivalently larger. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.6-supported multi-hop topology is particularly useful
for low-power embedded devices that can reduce consumption of energy by
communicating to the receiver (Rx) through nearby transmitted devices. In this
paper, we suggest a relaying mechanism to minimize the transmitted power and,
as a consequence, the power density (PD), a measure of SAR.

the effect of increasing the depth has remained less well understood. In this

overparameterized regime. To gain an insight into the advantage of depth, we
introduce local and global labels as abstract but simple classification rules.
It turns out that the locality of the relevant feature for a given

deeper is better for local labels, whereas shallower is better for global
labels. We also compare the results of finite networks with those of the neural
tangent kernel (NTK), which is equivalent to an infinitely wide network with a
proper initialization and an infinitesimal learning rate. It is shown that the
NTK does not correctly capture the depth dependence of the generalization

ambiguity and style inconsistency, which severely degrade the visual quality
and realism of generated images. Aiming towards real-world applications, we
develop a more challenging yet practical HPT setting, termed as Fine-grained

can intermittently communicate to the cloud, where a centralized fusion center
fuses estimates from all sensor clusters to make a final determination

this hybrid communication scheme as a cloud-cluster architecture. Minimizing
the expected loss function of networks where noisy sensors are intermittently
connected to the cloud, as in our hybrid communication scheme, has not been

inequalities to arrive at an optimized decision rule for each cluster and we
analyze the expected detection performance resulting from our hybrid scheme.

the case of low communication probability with the cloud. For larger clusters,
a steep improvement in detection performance is possible even for a low

  World",,,,,"cs.SI math.OC physics.soc-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  While social living is considered to be an indispensable part of human life
in today's ever-connected world, social distancing has recently received much
public attention on its importance since the outbreak of the coronavirus
pandemic. In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among
solitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or
slowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social
distancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of
social sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing
down some others so that the social contacts across the network can be
minimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every
individual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can
minimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be
found for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large
class of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social
sites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes
many well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and
can be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or
allow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible
distancing. We derive the equilibrium conditions of these strategies, and
analyze their rigidity and flexibility on different types of r-regular
subnetworks. We also extend our model to weighted networks, when different
contact values are assigned to different network sites.

completeness for two redshift bins centered at $z=3.4, 4.7$. We quantify a
measure of how much confidence we should have for each candidate galaxy from
different selections and what are the conservative error estimates propagated
into our selection. Then we compare the evolution of the corresponding number
densities and their stellar mass density with numerical simulations,
semi-analytical models, and previous observational estimates, which shows
slight tension at higher redshifts as the models tend to underestimate the
number and mass densities. By estimating the average halo masses of the
candidates ($M_h \approx 4.2, 1.9, 1.3 \times 10^{12} M_\odot$ for redshift
bins centered at $z=3.4, 4.1, 4.7$), we find them to be consistent with halos
that were efficient in turning baryons to stars and were relatively immune to
the feedback effects and on the verge of transition into hot-mode accretion.
This can suggest the relative cosmological starvation of the cold gas followed
by an overconsumption phase in which the galaxy consumes the available cold gas
rapidly as one of the possible drivers for the quenching of the massive evolved
population at high redshift.

items from a unique mixed view from user and entity angles. MVIN learns item
representations from both the user view and the entity view. From the user
view, user-oriented modules score and aggregate features to make
recommendations from a personalized perspective constructed according to KG
entities which incorporates user click information. From the entity view, the
mixing layer contrasts layer-wise GCN information to further obtain
comprehensive features from internal entity-entity interactions in the KG. We
evaluate MVIN on three real-world datasets: MovieLens-1M (ML-1M), LFM-1b 2015

Figures further illustrate that mixing layers in a heterogeneous KG plays a
vital role in neighborhood information aggregation.

especially in the cases with high traffic flow rate. Furthermore, we conducted
a proof-of-principle experiment for Wi-Wi-based data transfer between two
electrically connected nodes and confirmed that the skew was less than 300 ns

exhibited huge and unstable skew. These results indicate that precision time
synchronization is a promising resource to significantly reduce the

by flexible/colorful clothing, and different structures of human bodies or

challenges. The proposed method fuses gradient magnitude and direction
coherence of text pixels in a new way for detecting candidate regions.
Candidate regions are used for determining the number of temporal frame
clusters obtained by K-means clustering on frame differences. This process in
turn detects key frames. The proposed method explores Bayesian probability for
skin portions using color values at both pixel and component levels of temporal
frames, which provides fused images with skin components. Based on skin
information, the proposed method then detects faces and torsos by finding
structural and spatial coherences between them. We further propose adaptive
pixels linking a deep learning model for text detection from torso regions. The
proposed method is tested on our own dataset collected from marathon/sports

tested on the standard natural scene datasets, namely, CTW1500 and MS-COCO text

of an M${}^\natural$-convex function that transforms the given
M${}^\natural$-convex function to an M-convex function, which we call a
compression of an M${}^\natural$-convex function. For the class of valuated
generalized matroids, which are special M${}^\natural$-convex functions, the
compression induces a valuated permutohedron together with a decomposition of
the valuated generalized matroid into flag-matroid strips, each corresponding
to a maximal linearity domain of the induced valuated permutohedron. We examine
the details of the structure of flag-matroid strips and the induced valuated
permutohedron by means of discrete convex analysis of Murota.

dispersion, ""the fundamental plane"", has long been understood as resulting from
equilibrium in their largely pressure supported stellar dynamics. The
dissipation and feedback involved in reaching such an equilibrium through
merger formation of these galaxies over cosmic time can be responsible for the
orientation of the plane. We see a correlation between surface brightness
enhancement and youth in the 6dF Galaxy Survey. Correlations of this `tilt'
with stellar mass, age, concentration, shape and metallicity now point the
direction for further work on the resolved kinematics and structure of these
nearby galaxies and on their initial mass function and dark matter component.
  On the face of it, the Tully Fisher relation is a simpler one dimensional
scaling relation. However, as late type galaxies have bulges as well as disks,
and, as the surface density of disks is only standard for the more massive
galaxies, additional parameters are involved.

optical, ultraviolet, and X-ray sky. These flares are set into motion when a
star is torn apart by the tidal field of a massive black hole, triggering a
chain of events which is -- so far -- incompletely understood. However, the
disruption process has been studied extensively for almost half a century, and
unlike the later stages of a TDE, our understanding of the disruption itself is
reasonably well converged. In this Chapter, we review both analytical and
numerical models for stellar tidal disruption. Starting with relatively simple,
order-of-magnitude physics, we review models of increasing sophistication, the
semi-analytic ``affine formalism,'' hydrodynamic simulations of the disruption
of polytropic stars, and the most recent hydrodynamic results concerning the
disruption of realistic stellar models. Our review surveys the immediate
aftermath of disruption in both typical and more unusual TDEs, exploring how
the fate of the tidal debris changes if one considers non-main sequence stars,
deeply penetrating tidal encounters, binary star systems, and sub-parabolic
orbits. The stellar tidal disruption process provides the initial conditions
needed to model the formation of accretion flows around quiescent massive black
holes, and in some cases may also lead to directly observable emission, for
example via shock breakout, gravitational waves or runaway nuclear fusion in
deeply plunging TDEs.

if the generation models indeed learn to realize the given action plans. We
demonstrate that a basic dialogue policy that operates at the sentence level
generates better responses in comparison to turn level generation as well as
baseline models with no action plan. Additionally the basic dialogue policy has

realizations by perturbing the original point set following the geometric
constraints imposed by the Delaunay tessellation in the vicinity of each point

significantly reduce artifacts arising from the Delaunay tessellation in poorly

self-adaptive scale, mass conservation and continuity, while being able to

to the class of shallow alternating layered ansatz. However, even though the
high trainability of this ansatz is proved, it is still unclear whether it has
rich expressibility in state generation. In this paper, with a proper

lack of fine-grained 3D shape benchmarks. To address this issue, we first
introduce a new 3D shape dataset (named FG3D dataset) with fine-grained class
labels, which consists of three categories including airplane, car and chair.
Each category consists of several subcategories at a fine-grained level.
According to our experiments under this fine-grained dataset, we find that
state-of-the-art methods are significantly limited by the small variance among
subcategories in the same category. To resolve this problem, we further propose
a novel fine-grained 3D shape classification method named FG3D-Net to capture
the fine-grained local details of 3D shapes from multiple rendered views.
Specifically, we first train a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to detect the
generally semantic parts inside multiple views under the benchmark of generally
semantic part detection. Then, we design a hierarchical part-view attention
aggregation module to learn a global shape representation by aggregating
generally semantic part features, which preserves the local details of 3D
shapes. The part-view attention module hierarchically leverages part-level and
view-level attention to increase the discriminability of our features. The
part-level attention highlights the important parts in each view while the
view-level attention highlights the discriminative views among all the views of
the same object. In addition, we integrate a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to
capture the spatial relationships among sequential views from different
viewpoints. Our results under the fine-grained 3D shape dataset show that our

petawatt (PW) to hundreds-petawatt (100PW) lasers with ps to fs pulse duration
is the requirement of as large as meter-sized gratings in the compressor so as
to avoid the laser-induced damage to the gratings. However, this kind of
meter-sized grating with high quality is hard to manufacture so far. Here, we
propose a new in-house beam-splitting compressor based on the property that the
damage threshold of gratings depend on the pulse duration. The new scheme will
simultaneously improve the stability, save expensive gratings, and simplify the
size of compressor because the split beams share the first two parallel
gratings. Furthermore, based on the fact that the transmitted wavefront of a
glass plate can be much better and more precisely controlled than that of the
diffraction wavefront of a large grating, then glass plates with designed
transmitted wavefront are proposed to compensate the wavefront distortion
introduced by the second, the third gratings, and other optics in-house such as
the beam splitter. This simple and economical method can compensate the
space-time distortion in the compressor and then improve the focal intensity,
which otherwise cannot be compensated by the deformable mirror outside the
compressor due to angular chirp. Together with multi-beams tiled-aperture
combining scheme, the novel compressor provides a new scheme to achieve
high-energy PW-100PW lasers or even exawatt lasers with relatively small

for an economic and social optimum for activities restarting. This work
modifies an existing Agent-Based Model to estimate the virus spreading in
touristic areas, including tourists and residents' behaviours, movement and
virus effects on them according to a probabilistic approach. Consolidated
proximity-based and exposure-time-based contagion spreading rules are included
according to international health organizations and previous calibration
through experimental data. Effects of tourists' capacity (as ""social
distancing""-based measure) and other strategies (i.e. facial mask
implementation) are evaluated depending on virus-related conditions (i.e.
initial infector percentages). An idealized scenario representing a significant
case study has been analysed to demonstrate the tool capabilities and compare
the effectiveness of those solutions. Results show that ""social distancing""
seems to be more effective at the highest infectors' rates, although represents
an extreme measure with important economic effects. This measure loses its full
effectiveness (on the community) as the infectors' rate decreases and
individuals' protection measures become predominant (facial masks). The model
could be integrated to consider other recurring issues on tourist-related
fruition and schedule of urban spaces and facilities (e.g. cultural/leisure
buildings).

close to the final application, often leads to a substantial performance drop.
In order to overcome this problem, it is necessary to consider a shift between
source and target domains. Tackling the shift is known as Domain Adaptation
(DA). In this work, we focus on unsupervised DA: maintaining the detection
accuracy across different data distributions, when only unlabeled images are
available of the target domain. Recent state-of-the-art methods try to reduce
the domain gap using an adversarial training strategy which increases the
performance but at the same time the complexity of the training procedure. In
contrast, we look at the problem from a new perspective and keep it simple by
solely matching image statistics between source and target domain. We propose
to align either color histograms or mean and covariance of the source images
towards the target domain. Hence, DA is accomplished without architectural
add-ons and additional hyper-parameters. The benefit of the approaches is
demonstrated by evaluating different domain shift scenarios on public data
sets. In comparison to recent methods, we achieve state-of-the-art performance
using a much simpler procedure for the training. Additionally, we show that
applying our techniques significantly reduces the amount of synthetic data
needed to learn a general model and thus increases the value of simulation.

the opponents can evolve their policies concurrently. This increases the
complexity of the learning task and slows down the learning speed of the RL

policy learning when playing against concurrent learners. Specifically, we
propose an algorithm that can efficiently learn explainable and generalized
action selection rules by taking advantages of the representation of
quantitative heuristics and an opponent model with an eXtended classifier
system (XCS) in zero-sum Markov games. A neural network is used to model the
opponent from their behaviors and the corresponding policy is inferred for
action selection and rule evolution. In cases of multiple heuristic policies,
we introduce the concept of Pareto optimality for action selection. Besides,
taking advantages of the condition representation and matching mechanism of
XCS, the heuristic policies and the opponent model can provide guidance for
situations with similar feature representation. Furthermore, we introduce an
accuracy-based eligibility trace mechanism to speed up rule evolution, i.e.,
classifiers that can match the historical traces are reinforced according to
their accuracy. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm over

However, present works focus mainly on one of the requirements and only
consider either user-outfit or outfit-item relationships, thereby easily
leading to suboptimal representations and limiting the performance. In this
work, we unify two tasks, fashion compatibility modeling and personalized

inspirations from recent graph neural networks, and employ the embedding

his/her historical outfits. Furthermore, we jointly train these two tasks to
optimize these representations. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HFGN, we
conduct extensive experiments on a benchmark dataset, and HFGN achieves

simple topological drawings, which we introduce and investigate in the course
of this article. As indicated by the name they are a generalization of
signotopes, a structure studied in the context of encodings for arrangements of
pseudolines.

simulations provide insight in fields as varied as high energy physics,

from ultracold-atoms to superconducting circuits through trapped ions have been
proposed as quantum simulators. This article reviews recent developments in
another well established platform for quantum simulations: polaritons in
semiconductor microcavities. These quasiparticles obey a nonlinear
Schr\""odigner equation (NLSE), and their propagation in the medium can be
understood in terms of quantum hydrodynamics. As such, they are considered as
""fluids of light"". The challenge of quantum simulations is the engineering of
configurations in which the potential energy and the nonlinear interactions in
the NLSE can be controlled. Here, we revisit some landmark experiments with
polaritons in microcavities, discuss how the various properties of these
systems may be used in quantum simulations, and highlight the richness of
polariton systems to explore non-equilibrium physics

  industrial case study",,,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: While many companies conduct their software testing activities
in-house, many other companies outsource their software testing needs to other
firms who act as software testing service providers. As a result, Testing as a
Service (TaaS) has emerged as a strong service industry in the last several
decades. In the context of software testing services, there could be various
challenges (e.g., during the planning and service delivery phases) and, as a
result, the quality of testing services is not always as expected. Objective:
It is important, for both providers and also customers of testing services, to
assess the quality and maturity of test services and subsequently improve them.
Method: Motivated by a real industrial need in the context of several testing
service providers, to assess the maturity of their software testing services,
we chose the existing CMMI for Services maturity model (CMMI-SVC), and
conducted a case study using it in the context of two Turkish testing service
providers. Results: The case-study results show that maturity appraisal of
testing services using CMMI-SVC was helpful for both companies and their test
management teams by enabling them objectively assess the maturity of their
testing services and also by pinpointing potential improvement areas.
Conclusion: We empirically observed that, after some minor customization,
CMMI-SVC is indeed a suitable model for maturity appraisal of testing services.

Martingale Optimal Transport problem (A) and an associated optimization problem
(B). In (A) we follow the approach taken in the Entropy Optimal Transport (EOT)
primal problem by Liero et al. ""Optimal entropy-transport problems and a new
Hellinger-Kantorovic distance between positive measures"", Invent. math. 2018,
but we add the constraint, typical of Martingale Optimal Transport (MOT)
theory, that the infimum of the cost functional is taken over martingale
probability measures, instead of finite positive measures, as in Liero et al..
The Problem (A) differs from the corresponding problem in Liero et al. not only
by the martingale constraint, but also because we admit less restrictive
penalization terms $\mathcal{D}_{U}$, which may not have a divergence
formulation. In Problem (B) the objective functional, associated via Fenchel
conjugacy to the terms $\mathcal{D}_{U}$, is not any more linear, as in OT or
in MOT. This leads to a novel optimization problem which also has a clear
financial interpretation as a nonlinear subhedging value. Our theory allows us
to establish a nonlinear robust pricing-hedging duality, which covers a wide
range of known robust results. We also focus on Wasserstein-induced
penalizations and we study how the duality is affected by variations in the
penalty terms, with a special focus on the convergence of EMOT to the extreme
case of MOT.

unsupervised learning framework for pixel-wise abnormality detection in brain
magnetic resonance imaging captured from a patient population with metastatic
brain tumor. Our concept is as follows: If an image reconstruction network can
faithfully reproduce the global features of normal anatomy, then the abnormal
lesions in unseen images can be identified based on the local difference from
those reconstructed as normal by a discriminative network. Both networks are
trained on a dataset comprising only normal images without labels. In addition,
we devise a metric to evaluate the anatomical fidelity of the reconstructed
images and confirm that the overall detection performance is improved when the
image reconstruction network achieves a higher score. For evaluation,
clinically significant abnormalities are comprehensively segmented. The results
show that the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve values
for metastatic brain tumors, extracranial metastatic tumors, postoperative
cavities, and structural changes are 0.78, 0.61, 0.91, and 0.60, respectively.

the most naive scheme, we show that the L p-error of the estimator of the

the subject of intense debate, following the claim that it hosts an
$\sim$70$M_{\odot}$ black hole, in stark contrast with the expectations for
stellar remnants in the Milky Way. We conducted a high-resolution,
phase-resolved spectroscopic study of the near-infrared Paschen lines in this
system, using the 3.5-m telescope at Calar Alto Observatory. We find that
Pa$\beta$ and Pa$\gamma$ (after proper subtraction of the stellar absorption
component) are well fitted with a standard double-peaked model, typical of disk
emission. We measured the velocity shifts of the red and blue peaks at 28
orbital phases: the line center has an orbital motion in perfect antiphase with
the stellar motion, and the radial velocity amplitude ranges from 8 to 13 km/s
for different choices of lines and profile modelling. We interpret this curve
as proof that the disk is tracing the orbital motion of the primary, ruling out
the circumbinary disk and the hierarchical triple scenarios. The phase-averaged
peak-to-peak half-separation (proxy for the projected rotational velocity of
the outer disk) is $\sim$70 km s$^{-1}$, larger than the stellar orbital
velocity and also inconsistent with a circumbinary disk. From those results, we
infer a primary mass 4--8 times higher than the secondary mass. Moreover, we
show that the ratio of the blue and red peaks (V/R intensity ratio) has a
sinusoidal behaviour in phase with the secondary star, which can be interpreted
as the effect of external irradiation by the secondary star on the outer disk.
Finally, we briefly discuss our findings in the context of alternative
scenarios recently proposed for LB-1. Definitive tests between alternative
solutions will require further astrometric data from $Gaia$.

test archi using CHEOPS simulated images, and show that photometry of
background stars in CHEOPS images is only slightly degraded (by a factor of 2
to 3) with respect to the main target. This opens a potential for the use of
CHEOPS to produce photometric time series of several close-by targets at once,
as well as to use different stars in the image to calibrate systematic errors.
We also show one clear scientific application where the study of the companion
light curve can be important for the understanding of the contamination on the

addition, recent spacecraft measurements indicated that some fraction of
coherent whistler waves in the solar wind may propagate anti-parallel to the
electron heat flux, being produced due to a perpendicular temperature
anisotropy of suprathermal electrons. We present analysis of properties of
parallel and anti-parallel whistler waves unstable at electron heat fluxes and
temperature anisotropies of suprathermal electrons typical of the pristine
solar wind. Assuming the electron population consisting of counter-streaming
dense thermal core and tenuous suprathermal halo populations, we perform a
linear stability analysis to demonstrate that anti-parallel whistler waves are
expected to have smaller frequencies, wave numbers and growth rates compared to
parallel whistler waves. The stability analysis is performed over a wide range
of parameters of core and halo electron populations. Using the quasi-linear
scaling relation we show that anti-parallel whistler waves saturate at
amplitudes of one order of magnitude smaller than parallel whistler waves,
which is at about $10^{-3}\;B_0$ in the pristine solar wind. The analysis shows
that the presence of anti-parallel whistler waves in the pristine solar wind is
more likely to be obscured by turbulent magnetic field fluctuations, because of
lower frequencies and smaller amplitudes compared to parallel whistler waves.
The presented results will be also valuable for numerical simulations of the

at the micro- and nano-scale it requires resonant mechanisms that enhance the
nonlinear light-matter interaction. These strategies commonly result in
wavelength-specific performances and narrowband applications. Disordered
photonic materials, made up of a random assembly of optical nonlinear crystals,
enable a broadband tunability in the random quasi-phase-matching (RQPM) regime
and do not require high-quality materials. Here, we combine resonances and
disorder by implementing RQPM in Mie-resonant spheres of a few microns realized
by the bottom-up assembly of barium titanate nano-crystals. The measured second
harmonic generation (SHG) reveals a combination of broadband and resonant wave
mixing, in which Mie resonances drive and enhance the SHG, while the disorder
keeps the phase-matching conditions relaxed. This new phase-matching regime can
be described by a random walk in the SHG complex plane whose step lengths
depend on the local field enhancement within the micro-sphere. Our
nano-crystals assemblies provide new opportunities for tailored phase-matching
at the micro-scale, beyond the coherence length of the bulk crystal. They can
be adapted to achieve frequency conversion from the near-ultraviolet to the

our 0D-3D simulations by various physics-based models, and theoretical

originated droplets (d < 20microns) allows lingering in the air for O(1h) so
that they could be inhaled. Consistent with the previous literature, numerical
evidence on the rapid drying process of even large droplets, up to sizes
O(100microns), into droplet nuclei/aerosols is provided. Based on the
literature and the public media sources, we provide evidence that the infected
individuals could have been exposed to aerosols/droplet nuclei by inhaling them
in significant numbers e.g. O(100). By 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
simulations, we give examples on the transport and dilution of aerosols
(d<20microns) over distances O(10m) in generic environments. We study
susceptible and infected individuals in generic public places by Monte-Carlo
modeling. The model accounts for the locally varying aerosol concentration
levels which the susceptible accumulate via inhalation. The introduced concept,
'exposure time' to virus containing aerosols is proposed to complement the
traditional 'safety distance' thinking. We show that the exposure time to
inhale O(100) aerosols could range from O(1s) to O(1min) or even to O(1h)

hydrodynamic regime according to the Knudsen number. On the kinetic scale, the
dynamics of micro flow can be described by the linearized kinetic equation. In
the continuum regime, hydrodynamic equations such as linearized Navier-Stokes
equations and Euler equations can be derived from the linearized kinetic
equation by the Chapman-Enskog asymptotic analysis. In this paper, based on the
linearized kinetic equation we are going to propose a unified gas kinetic
scheme scheme (UGKS) for micro flow simulation, which is an effective
multiscale scheme in the whole micro flow regime. The important methodology of
UGKS is the following. Firstly, the evolution of microscopic distribution
function is coupled with the evolution of macroscopic flow quantities.
Secondly, the numerical flux of UGKS is constructed based on the integral
solution of kinetic equation, which provides a genuinely multiscale and
multidimensional numerical flux. The UGKS recovers the linear kinetic solution
in the rarefied regime, and converges to the linear hydrodynamic solution in
the continuum regime. An outstanding feature of UGKS is its capability of
capturing the accurate viscous solution even when the cell size is much larger
than the kinetic kinetic length scale, such as the capturing of the viscous
boundary layer with a cell size ten times larger than the particle mean free
path. Such a multiscale property is called unified preserving (UP) which has
been studied in \cite{guo2019unified}. In this paper, we are also going to give
a mathematical proof for the UP property of UGKS.

how many agents are required to explore the grid, or equivalently, find a

water transitions and the CO (4-3) line towards 11 evolved stars. The sample
included semi-regular and Mira variables, plus a red supergiant star. We
performed radiative transfer modelling for the water masers. We also used the
CO observations to determine mass loss rates for the stars.
  From the sample of 11 evolved stars, 7 display one or more of the masers at
437, 439, 471, and 474 GHz. We therefore find that these masers are common in
evolved star circumstellar envelopes. The fact that the maser lines are
detected near the stellar velocity indicates that they are likely to originate
from the inner circumstellar envelopes of our targets. We tentatively link the
presence of masers to the degree of variability of the target star, that is,
masers are more likely to be present in Mira variables than in semi-regular
variables. We suggest that this indicates the importance of strong shocks in
creating the necessary conditions for the masers. Typically, the 437 GHz line
is the strongest maser line observed among those studied here. We cannot
reproduce the above finding in our radiative transfer models. In general, we
find that maser emission is very sensitive to dust temperature in the lines
studied here. To produce strong maser emission, the dust temperature must be
significantly lower than the gas kinetic temperature. In addition to running
grids of models in order to determine the optimum physical conditions for
strong masers in these lines, we performed smooth wind modelling for which we
cannot reproduce the observed line shapes. This also suggests that the masers
must originate predominantly from the inner envelopes.

Lindblad equation, it is unclear whether correlated topological states, such as
fractional quantum Hall states, are maintained even in the presence of the jump
term. In this paper, we introduce the pseudo-spin Chern number of the
Liouvillian which is computed by twisting the boundary conditions only for one
of the subspaces of the doubled Hilbert space. The existence of such a
topological invariant elucidates that the topological properties remain
unchanged even in the presence of the jump term which does not close the gap of
the effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (obtained by neglecting the jump term).
In other words, the topological properties are encoded into an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian rather than the full Liouvillian. This is
particularly useful when the jump term can be written as a strictly block-upper
(-lower) triangular matrix in the doubled Hilbert space, in which case the
presence or absence of the jump term does not affect the spectrum of the
Liouvillian. With the pseudo-spin Chern number, we address the characterization
of fractional quantum Hall states with two-body loss but without gain,
elucidating that the topology of the non-Hermitian fractional quantum Hall
states is preserved even in the presence of the jump term. This numerical
result also supports the use of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian which
significantly reduces the numerical cost. Similar topological invariants can be
extended to treat correlated topological states for other spatial dimensions
and symmetry (e.g., one-dimensional open quantum systems with inversion
symmetry), indicating the high versatility of our approach.

Classically, this task is tackled (i) in a soft way (without out-of-sample

managing restaurants and staff canteens. In particular, properly predicting
future sales of menu items allows a precise ordering of food stock. From an

pre-consumer food waste, while from the managerial point of view, this is
critical to guarantee the profitability of the restaurant. Hence, we are
interested in predicting future values of the daily sold quantities of given
menu items. The corresponding time series show multiple strong seasonalities,
trend changes, data gaps, and outliers. We propose a forecasting approach that
is solely based on the data retrieved from Point of Sales systems and allows
for a straightforward human interpretation. Therefore, we propose two
generalized additive models for predicting the future sales. In an extensive
evaluation, we consider two data sets collected at a casual restaurant and a
large staff canteen consisting of multiple time series, that cover a period of
20 months, respectively. We show that the proposed models fit the features of
the considered restaurant data. Moreover, we compare the predictive performance
of our method against the performance of other well-established forecasting
approaches.

a critical point in the single-loss setting. This is known to break down for
vanilla gradient descent when moving to multi-loss optimization, but can we
hope to build some algorithm with global guarantees? We negatively resolve this
open problem by proving that desirable convergence properties cannot
simultaneously hold for any algorithm. Our result has more to do with the
existence of games with no satisfactory outcomes, than with algorithms per se.
More explicitly we construct a two-player game with zero-sum interactions whose
losses are both coercive and analytic, but whose only simultaneous critical
point is a strict maximum. Any 'reasonable' algorithm, defined to avoid strict
maxima, will therefore fail to converge. This is fundamentally different from
single losses, where coercivity implies existence of a global minimum.
Moreover, we prove that a wide range of existing gradient-based methods almost
surely have bounded but non-convergent iterates in a constructed zero-sum game
for suitably small learning rates. It nonetheless remains an open question
whether such behavior can arise in high-dimensional games of interest to ML
practitioners, such as GANs or multi-agent RL.

parameters like frame rate, read noise, dynamic range and pixel size. We have
implemented and tested a novel front-end binning design in a photon-integrating
hybrid pixel array detector using the MM-PAD-2.0 pixel architecture. In this
architecture, the pixels can be optionally binned in a 2$\times$2 pixel
configuration using a network of switches to selectively direct the output of 4
sensor pixels to a single amplifier input. Doing this allows a trade-off
between frame rate and spatial resolution. Tests show that the binned pixels
perform well, but with some degradation on performance as compared to an
un-binned pixel. The increased parasitic input capacitance does reduce the
signal collected per x-ray as well as increases the noise of the pixel. The
increase in noise is, however, less than the factor of 2 increase one would
observe for binning in post-processing. Spatial scans across the binned pixels
show that no measured signal intensity is lost at the inner binning unit
boundaries. In the high flux regime, at a 2$\times$2 pixel wide beam spot
(FWHM) size, binned mode responds linearly up to a photon flux of ~10$^{7}$
x-rays/s, and performs comparably with un-binned mode up to a photon flux of
~10$^{8}$ x-rays/s. While this study demonstrates a proof of concept for
front-end binning in integrating detectors, we also identify changes to this
early-stage prototype which can further improve the performance of binning
pixel structures.

of source structure and fringe-fitting parameters in Very Long Baseline
Interferometry (VLBI) observations. As a first step, we demonstrate this
technique through the analysis of synthetic short-duration Event Horizon
Telescope (EHT) observations of various geometric source models at 230 GHz, in
the presence of baseline-dependent thermal noise. We perform Bayesian parameter
estimation and model selection between the different source models to obtain
reliable uncertainty estimates and correlations between various source and
fringe-fitting related model parameters. We also compare the Bayesian
posteriors with those obtained using widely-used VLBI data reduction packages
such as CASA and AIPS, by fringe-fitting 200 Monte Carlo simulations of each
source model with different noise realisations, to obtain distributions of the
Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates. We find that, in the presence of resolved
asymmetric source structure and a given array geometry, the traditional
practice of fringe-fitting with a point source model yields appreciable offsets
in the estimated phase residuals, potentially biasing or limiting the dynamic
range of the starting model used for self-calibration. Simultaneously
estimating the source structure earlier in the calibration process with formal
uncertainties improves the precision and accuracy of fringe-fitting and
establishes the potential of the available data especially when there is little
prior information. We also note the potential applications of this method to
astrometry and geodesy for specific science cases and the planned improvements
to the computational performance and analyses of more complex source
distributions.

performance for the global model (denoted as the \emph{initial performance} in

Josephson junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980's. In the last
twenty years, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified
research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information
processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly
and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic
fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of
circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic
cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter
has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right.
Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the
quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all
current approaches to quantum information processing with superconducting
circuits. In addition, circuit QED enables the study of hybrid quantum systems
interacting with microwave photons. Here, we review the coherent coupling of
superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators
focussing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit,
and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system. We
discuss coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is
necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also
invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient
in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an
introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit
QED, we discuss important use cases of these ideas in quantum information
processing and in quantum optics.

different applied magnetic field values. We examine the conditions for optimal

accelerated through diffusive shock acceleration (DSA). The standard DSA theory
predicts an electron spectral index of $p=2$, corresponding to a radio spectral
index of $\alpha=-0.5$. An extension of DSA predicts that the accelerated
particles changes the shock structure, resulting in a spectrum that is steeper
than $p>2$ ($\alpha<-0.5$) at low energies and flattens with energy. For Cas A,
a synchrotron spectral flattening was previously reported for a small part of
the remnant in the mid-infrared regime. Here, we present new measurements for
spectral flattening using archival radio (4.72~GHz) and mid-infrared
(3.6~$\mu$m) data, and produce a complete spectral index map to investigate the
spatial variations within the remnant. We compare this to measurements of the
radio spectral index from L-(1.285~GHz) and C-(4.64~GHz) band maps. Our result
shows overall spectral flattening across the remnant ($\alpha _\mathrm{R-IR}
\sim -0.5$ to $-0.7$), to be compared to the radio spectral index of
$\alpha_{\rm R}=-0.77$. The flattest values coincide with the locations of most
recent particle acceleration. In addition to overall flattening, we detect a
relatively steeper region in the southeast of the remnant ($\alpha
_\mathrm{R-IR} \sim -0.67$). We explore whether these locally steeper spectra
could be the result of synchrotron cooling, which provides constraints on the
local magnetic-field strengths/age of the plasma, suggesting $B\lesssim 2$~mG
for an age of 100~yr, and even $B\lesssim 1$~mG using the age of Cas A, in
agreement with other estimates.

including wound healing, embryonic morphogenesis, and cancer metastasis. It
relies on complex dynamical patterns of cell shape changes that pose
long-standing challenges to mathematical modeling and raise a need for
automated and reproducible approaches to extract quantitative morphological
features from image sequences. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework and a
computational method for obtaining smooth representations of the spatiotemporal
contour dynamics from stacks of segmented microscopy images. Based on a
Gaussian process regression we propose a one-parameter family of regularized
contour flows that allows us to continuously track reference points (virtual
markers) between successive cell contours. We use this approach to define a
coordinate system on the moving cell boundary and to represent different local
geometric quantities in this frame of reference. In particular, we introduce
the local marker dispersion as a measure to identify localized membrane
expansions and provide a fully automated way to extract the properties of such
expansions, including their area and growth time. The methods are available as
an open-source software package called AmoePy, a Python-based toolbox for
analyzing amoeboid cell motility (based on time-lapse microscopy data),
including a graphical user interface and detailed documentation. Due to the
mathematical rigor of our framework, we envision it to be of use for the
development of novel cell motility models. We mainly use experimental data of

approach.

various observation sparsities, we show that the classical depth-fusion

worsens the photo-consistency check. As another line of the solution, we
present SurfaceNet+, a volumetric method to handle the 'incompleteness' and the
'inaccuracy' problems induced by a very sparse MVS setup. Specifically, the
former problem is handled by a novel volume-wise view selection approach. It
owns superiority in selecting valid views while discarding invalid occluded
views by considering the geometric prior. Furthermore, the latter problem is
handled via a multi-scale strategy that consequently refines the recovered
geometry around the region with the repeating pattern. The experiments
demonstrate the tremendous performance gap between SurfaceNet+ and
state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision and recall. Under the extreme

we apply minimum risk training with SIMILE and entity delexicalization. We use

Amrl-Q agents are able to learn a policy and state estimator in parallel during

on costly measurements of the environment to its state estimator in order to
increase its reward. It does this without harm to the learned policy. Our

First, through a comprehensive set of numerical simulations, it is demonstrated
that solutions arising from a certain class of initial conditions, referred to
as ""periodic single-lobe"" potentials, share the same qualitative features,
which also coincide with those of solutions arising from localized initial
conditions. The spectrum of the associated scattering problem in each of these
cases is then numerically computed, and it is shown that such spectrum is
confined to the real and imaginary axes of the spectral variable in the
semiclassical limit. This implies that all nonlinear excitations emerging from
the input have zero velocity, and form a coherent nonlinear condensate.
Finally, by employing a formal Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin expansion for the
scattering eigenfunctions, asymptotic expressions for the number and location
of the bands and gaps in the spectrum are obtained, as well as corresponding
expressions for the relative band widths and the number of ""effective
solitons"". These results are shown to be in excellent agreement with those from
direct numerical computation of the eigenfunctions. In particular, a scaling
law is obtained showing that the number of effective solitons is inversely
proportional to the small dispersion parameter.

obtaining the ground state in quantum many-body problems on a classical
computer. A recently proposed quantum imaginary-time evolution method (QITE)
faces problems of deep circuit depth and difficulty in the implementation on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this study, a nonlocal
approximation is developed to tackle this difficulty. We found that by removing
the locality condition or local approximation (LA), which was imposed when the
imaginary-time evolution operator is converted to a unitary operator, the
quantum circuit depth is significantly reduced. We propose two-step
approximation methods based on a nonlocality condition: extended LA (eLA) and
nonlocal approximation (NLA). To confirm the validity of eLA and NLA, we apply
them to the max-cut problem of an unweighted 3-regular graph and a weighted
fully connected graph; we comparatively evaluate the performances of LA, eLA,
and NLA. The eLA and NLA methods require far fewer circuit depths than LA to
maintain the same level of computational accuracy. Further, we developed a
``compression'' method of the quantum circuit for the imaginary-time steps as a
method to further reduce the circuit depth in the QITE method. The eLA, NLA,
and the compression method introduced in this study allow us to reduce the
circuit depth and the accumulation of error caused by the gate operation
significantly and pave the way for implementing the QITE method on NISQ
devices.

efficiency and accuracy of potential theory on water waves and the advantage of
two-phase CFD solvers on complex flows (wave breaking, flow separation, etc.).
The decomposition strategy is called Spectral Wave Explicit Navier-Stokes
Equations (SWENSE), originally proposed for single-phase CFD solvers. Firstly,
this paper presents an extension of the SWENSE method for two-phase CFD
solvers. Secondly, an accurate and efficient method to interpolate potential
flow results obtained with the High Order Spectral (HOS) wave model on CFD mesh
is proposed. The method is able to reduce the divergence error of the
interpolated velocity field to meet the CFD solver's needs without
reprojection. Implemented within OpenFOAM, these methods are tested by three
convincing verification, validation and application cases, considering incident
wave propagation, high-order loads on a vertical cylinder in regular waves, and
a Catenary Anchor Leg Mooring (CALM) buoy in both regular and irregular waves.
Speed-ups between 1.71 and 4.28 are achieved with the test cases. The wave
models and the interpolation method are released open-source to the public.

  In the literature, the asynchronous byzantine agreement problem is studied in
a fully connected network model where every node can directly send messages to
every other node. This assumption is questionable in many real-world
environments. In the reality, nodes might need to communicate by means of an
incomplete network, and Byzantine nodes might not forward messages.
Furthermore, Byzantine nodes might not behave correctly and, for example,
corrupt messages. Therefore, in order to truly understand Byzantine Agreement,
we need both ingredients: asynchrony and incomplete communication networks.
  In this paper, we study the asynchronous Byzantine agreement problem in
incomplete networks. A classic result by Danny Dolev proved that in a
distributed system with n nodes in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, the
vertex connectivity of the system communication graph should be at least
(2f+1). While Dolev's result was for synchronous deterministic systems, we
demonstrate that the same bound also holds for asynchronous randomized systems.
We show that the bound is tight by presenting a randomized algorithm, and a
matching lower bound.

out that the method of {quantitative} extrapolation is an appropriate

only. The LINERS of configurations 1 and 2 are examined. The spaxel spectra of
the LINERs form a sequences on the BPT diagram. The line ratios change smoothly
with radius, from AGN-like at the center to HII-region-like at larger
distances. This is in agreement with the paradigm that the LINERs are excited
by AGN activity. The AGN and INT radiation in the circumnuclear region is
accompanied by an enhanced gas velocity dispersion, s_g. The radius of the area
of the AGN and INT radiation is similar to the radius of the area with enhanced
s_g, and the central s_g,c correlates with the luminosity of the AGN+INT area.
We assume that the gas velocity dispersion can serve as an indicator of the AGN
activity. The values of s_g,c for the SF-type centers partly overlap with those

spatially-resolved magnetic field and flare-accelerated relativistic electrons

profile shows a local maximum where the reconnecting field lines of opposite
polarities closely approach each other, known as the reconnection X point. The
measurements also reveal a local minimum near the bottom of the current sheet
above the flare loop-top, referred to as a ""magnetic bottle"". This spatial
structure agrees with theoretical predictions and numerical modeling results. A
strong reconnection electric field of ~4000 V/m is inferred near the X point.

First, we show that the formalism developed for the study of magnetised neutron
stars in General Relativity, based on the \textit{eXtended Conformally Flat
Condition}, can easily be extended in the presence of a non-minimally coupled
scalar field, retaining many of its numerical advantages. We then carry out a
study of the parameter space considering the two extreme geometries of purely
toroidal and purely poloidal magnetic fields, varying both the strength of the
magnetic field and the intensity of scalarisation. We compare our results with
magnetised general-relativistic solutions and un-magnetised scalarised
solutions, showing how the mutual interplay between magnetic and scalar fields
affect the magnetic and the scalarisation properties of neutron stars. In
particular, we focus our discussion on magnetic deformability, maximum mass and
range of scalarisation.

complicate the extraction of signal parameters from noisy data. To address
this, we present iDQ, a supervised learning framework to autonomously detect
noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors based only on auxiliary degrees
of freedom insensitive to gravitational waves. iDQ has operated in low latency
throughout the advanced detector era at each of the two LIGO interferometers,
providing invaluable data quality information about each detection to date in

possible applications within gravitational-wave searches. In particular, we
construct a likelihood-ratio test that simultaneously accounts for the presence
of non-Gaussian noise artifacts and utilizes information from both the observed
gravitational-wave strain signal and thousands of auxiliary degrees of freedom.
We also present several examples of iDQ's performance with modern
interferometers, showing iDQ's ability to autonomously reproduce known data

they, as sometimes we do, lack an understanding of what similarity means. To
address this challenge, we first introduce a corpus of real-world spoken

observed in experiments, supporting these hypotheses. Yet, there remains an
open debate about which of these possible mechanisms actually occurs first.

limit the performance of many workloads. Although prior works provide DRAM
designs that reduce DRAM access latency, their reduced storage capacities
hinder the performance of workloads that need large memory capacity. Because
the capacity-latency trade-off is fixed at design time, previous works cannot
achieve maximum performance under very different and dynamic workload demands.
  This paper proposes Capacity-Latency-Reconfigurable DRAM (CLR-DRAM), a new
DRAM architecture that enables dynamic capacity-latency trade-off at low cost.
CLR-DRAM allows dynamic reconfiguration of any DRAM row to switch between two
operating modes: 1) max-capacity mode, where every DRAM cell operates
individually to achieve approximately the same storage density as a
density-optimized commodity DRAM chip and 2) high-performance mode, where two
adjacent DRAM cells in a DRAM row and their sense amplifiers are coupled to
operate as a single low-latency logical cell driven by a single logical sense
amplifier.
  We implement CLR-DRAM by adding isolation transistors in each DRAM subarray.
Our evaluations show that CLR-DRAM can improve system performance and DRAM
energy consumption by 18.6% and 29.7% on average with four-core multiprogrammed
workloads. We believe that CLR-DRAM opens new research directions for a system
to adapt to the diverse and dynamically changing memory capacity and access
latency demands of workloads.

understood. Here we study the degree of collisional heating and compaction by
analysing the large set of previous simulations of small body break-ups by
Jutzi et al. (2019), which used porous targets of 50 - 400 km in diameter and
investigated a large range of impact velocities, angles as well as energies. We
find that the degree of impact processing is generally larger than found in
previous studies which considered smaller objects (e.g. Jutzi et al., 2017;
Schwartz et al., 2018). However, there is a clear dichotomy in terms of impact
processing: the escaping material always experiences stronger heating than the
material bound to the largest remnant. Assuming they originate from the same
parent body, some of the observed differences between the recently visited
asteroids Ryugu and Bennu may be explained by a different location of the
material eventually forming these asteroids in the original parent body. Our
results also provide constraints on the initial size of cometary nuclei.

systems of (self-)propelled agents, and a key component in the structuring of

underlying microscopic interactions have been extensively explored both
experimentally and theoretically. While emerging patterns often show one
specific symmetry (e.g. nematic lane patterns or polarized traveling flocks),
depending on the symmetry of the alignment interactions patterns with different
symmetries can apparently coexist. Indeed, recent experiments with an actomysin
motility assay suggest that polar and nematic patterns of actin filaments can
interact and dynamically transform into each other. However, theoretical
understanding of the mechanism responsible remains elusive. Here, we present a
kinetic approach complemented by a hydrodynamic theory for agents with mixed
alignment symmetries, which captures the experimentally observed phenomenology
and provides a theoretical explanation for the coexistence and interaction of
patterns with different symmetries. We show that local, pattern-induced
symmetry breaking can account for dynamically coexisting patterns with
different symmetries. Specifically, in a regime with moderate densities and a
weak polar bias in the alignment interaction, nematic bands show a local
symmetry-breaking instability within their high-density core region, which
induces the formation of polar waves along the bands. These instabilities
eventually result in a self-organized system of nematic bands and polar waves
that dynamically transform into each other. Our study reveals a mutual feedback
mechanism between pattern formation and local symmetry breaking in active
matter that has interesting consequences for structure formation in biological
systems.

for a targeted electromagnetic response involves exploring large geometry and
material spaces, which is computationally costly, time consuming and a highly
iterative process based on trial and error. Moreover, the non-uniqueness of
structural designs and high non-linearity between electromagnetic response and
design makes this problem challenging. To model this non-intuitive relationship
between electromagnetic response and metasurface structural design as a
probability distribution in the design space, we introduce a cyclical deep
learning (DL) based framework for inverse design of nanophotonic metasurfaces.
The proposed framework performs inverse design and optimization mechanism for
the generation of meta-atoms and meta-molecules as metasurface units based on
DL models and genetic algorithm. The framework includes consecutive DL models
that emulate both numerical electromagnetic simulation and iterative processes
of optimization, and generate optimized structural designs while simultaneously
performing forward and inverse design tasks. A selection and evaluation of
generated structural designs is performed by the genetic algorithm to construct
a desired optical response and design space that mimics real world responses.
Importantly, our cyclical generation framework also explores the space of new
metasurface topologies. As an example application of utility of our proposed
architecture, we demonstrate the inverse design of gap-plasmon based half-wave
plate metasurface for user-defined optical response. Our proposed technique can
be easily generalized for designing nanophtonic metasurfaces for a wide range

conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as a risk measure. We also employ a
cardinality constraint for limiting the number of invested assets. Solving such
a cardinality-constrained mean-CVaR model is computationally challenging for
two main reasons. First, this model is formulated as a mixed-integer
optimization (MIO) problem because of the cardinality constraint, so solving it
exactly is very hard when the number of investable assets is large. Second, the
problem size depends on the number of asset return scenarios, and the
computational efficiency decreases when the number of scenarios is large. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a high-performance algorithm named the
\emph{bilevel cutting-plane algorithm} for exactly solving the

reformulating the problem as a bilevel optimization problem and then develop a
cutting-plane algorithm for solving the upper-level problem. To speed up
computations for cut generation, we apply to the lower-level problem another
cutting-plane algorithm for efficiently minimizing CVaR with a large number of

with $r\sim 3 (1-n_s)^2$, and these are viable theories. Moreover, in the case
that $x$ takes larger values in specific ranges and is constant for a given
$F(R)$ gravity, the resulting $r-n_s$ relation has the form $r\sim 3 \alpha
(1-n_s)^2$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. Thus we conclude that the viable
$F(R)$ gravities may be classified into two limiting types of $r-n_s$
relations, one identical to the $R^2$ model at leading order in $x$, and one
similar to the $\alpha$-attractors $r-n_s$ relation, for the $F(R)$ gravity
models that yield $x$ constant. Finally, we also discuss the case that $x$ is
not constant.

previously available with Huygens' metasurfaces (HMS). These enhanced

are based on analyses of zero-thickness surfaces with abstract surface
impedance properties. However, the design of practical metasurfaces has proven
tedious. Herein, we propose a novel, easily designed structure to realize
OBMSs. Extending our previous work, we show that an asymmetrical cascade of two
judiciously engineered Fabry-Perot (FP) etalons could form an OBMS meta-atom to
provide desired wave control capabilities. Implementing this FP-OBMS for
anomalous refraction, we show that bianisotropy effectively produces a virtual
anti-reflective coating over a HMS, leading to the OBMS efficiency enhancement.
This intriguing observation, backed by an approximate closed-form solution,
provides an original physical interpretation of the mechanism underlying
perfect anomalous refraction, and is used to explain for the first time
differences in the angular response of OBMS in comparison to HMS. Implementing
the FP-OBMS for the more intricate functionality of beam-splitting, we show
that the FP-OBMS are capable of non-local excitation of surface waves required
to this end, despite being electrically thick. These results, verified via
full-wave computations, demonstrate the ability of the proposed configuration
to meticulously reproduce the scattering properties of ideal (abstract)
zero-thickness OBMS, thereby paving the path to practical realization of wave
transmission with exotic functionalities, some of which have never before been

a scalar field around a radiating BH with taking into account the effect of
Hawking radiation. We find that the vacuum decay rate slightly decreases in the

the horizon. However, the stabilization effect becomes weak at the points
sufficiently far from the horizon. Consequently, we find that the decay rate is
not significantly changed unless the effective coupling constant of the scalar

membrane pressure originating from the surface dipoles exhibits a non-uniform
salt dependence, characterized by an enhancement for dilute salt conditions and
a decrease at intermediate salt concentrations. Upon addition of multivalent
cations to the submolar salt solution, the separate interactions of these
cations with the opposite charges of the surface dipoles makes the
intermembrane pressure more repulsive at low membrane separation distances and
strongly attractive at intermediate distances, resulting in a discontinuous
like-charge binding transition followed by the membrane binding transition. By
extending our formalism to account for correlation corrections associated with
large salt concentrations, we show that membranes of high surface dipole
density immersed in molar salt solutions may undergo a membrane binding
transition even without the multivalent cations. Hence, the tuning of the
surface polarization forces by membrane engineering can be an efficient way to
adjust the equilibrium configuration of dipolar membranes in concentrated salt

gaining significant attention from farmers and industries to reduce costs,
human workload, and required resources. Nevertheless, achieving sufficient
autonomous navigation capabilities requires the simultaneous cooperation of
different processes; localization, mapping, and path planning are just some of
the steps that aim at providing to the machine the right set of skills to
operate in semi-structured and unstructured environments. In this context, this
study presents a low-cost local motion planner for autonomous navigation in
vineyards based only on an RGB-D camera, low range hardware, and a dual layer
control algorithm. The first algorithm exploits the disparity map and its depth
representation to generate a proportional control for the robotic platform.
Concurrently, a second back-up algorithm, based on representations learning and
resilient to illumination variations, can take control of the machine in case
of a momentaneous failure of the first block. Moreover, due to the double
nature of the system, after initial training of the deep learning model with an

possibility of exploiting new automatically labeled data, coming from the

has been trained and tested, using transfer learning, with acquired images
during different field surveys in the North region of Italy and then optimized
for on-device inference with model pruning and quantization. Finally, the
overall system has been validated with a customized robot platform in the

intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Many of these challenges originate
from the error characteristics that stem from rapid decoherence and noise
during measurement, qubit connections, crosstalk, the qubits themselves, and
transformations of qubit state via gates. Not only are qubits not ""created

their quantum systems once per day and reports noise levels (errors) at the
time of such calibration. This information is subsequently used to map circuits
to higher quality qubits and connections up to the next calibration point.
  This work provides evidence that there is room for improvement over this
daily calibration cycle. It contributes a technique to measure noise levels

qubit mappings. With this just-in-time recalibrated transpilation, the fidelity

Resolving IndividUal Stars) project, we demonstrate a stochastic star formation
model for star-by-star simulations. An assumed stellar initial mass function
(IMF) is randomly assigned to newly formed stars. We introduce a maximum search
radius to assemble the mass from surrounding gas particles to form star
particles. In this study, we perform a series of N-body/smoothed particle
hydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formations from turbulent molecular
clouds and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as test cases. The IMF can be correctly
sampled if a maximum search radius that is larger than the value estimated from
the threshold density for star formation is adopted. In small clouds, the
formation of massive stars is highly stochastic because of the small number of
stars. We confirm that the star formation efficiency and threshold density do
not strongly affect the results. We find that our model can naturally reproduce
the relationship between the most massive stars and the total stellar mass of
star clusters. Herein, we demonstrate that our models can be applied to
simulations varying from star clusters to galaxies for a wide range of
resolutions.

(SPR) map with higher accuracy than conventional single energy CT (SECT) by
obtaining the energy dependence of photon interactions. However, DECT is not as
widely implemented as SECT in proton radiation therapy simulation. This work
presents a learning-based method to synthetize DECT images from SECT for proton
radiation therapy. Methods: The proposed method uses a residual attention
generative adversarial network. Residual blocks with attention gates were used
to force the model focus on the difference between DECT maps and SECT images.
To evaluate the accuracy of the method, we retrospectively investigated 20
head-and-neck cancer patients with both DECT and SECT scans available. The high
and low energy CT images acquired from DECT acted as learning targets in the
training process for SECT datasets and were evaluated against results from the
proposed method using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. To evaluate
our method in the context of a practical application, we generated SPR maps
from sDECT using physics-based dual-energy stoichiometric method and compared
the maps to those generated from DECT. Results: The synthesized DECT images
showed an average mean absolute error around 30 Hounsfield Unit (HU) across the
whole-body volume. The corresponding SPR maps generated from synthetic DECT
showed an average normalized mean square error of about 1% with reduced noise
level and artifacts than those from original DECT. Conclusions: The accuracy of
the synthesized DECT image by our machine-learning-based method was evaluated
on head and neck patient, and potential feasibility for proton treatment
planning and dose calculation was shown by generating SPR map using the
synthesized DECT.

A classic result of
Vizing shows that $\chi'(G)$, the chromatic index of $G$, is either $\Delta$ or
$\Delta+1$. We say $G$ is of \emph{Class 1} if $\chi'(G)=\Delta$, and is of
\emph{Class 2} otherwise. A graph $G$ is \emph{$\Delta$-critical} if
$\chi'(G)=\Delta+1$ and $\chi'(H)<\Delta+1$ for every proper subgraph $H$ of
$G$, and is \emph{overfull} if $|E(G)|>\Delta \lfloor (|V(G)|-1)/2 \rfloor$.
Clearly, overfull graphs are Class 2. Hilton and Zhao in 1997 conjectured that
if $G$ is obtained from an $n$-vertex $\Delta$-regular Class 1 graph with
maximum degree greater than $n/3$ by splitting a vertex, then being overfull is
the only reason for $G$ to be Class 2. This conjecture was only confirmed when
$\Delta\ge \frac{n}{2}(\sqrt{7}-1)\approx 0.82n$. In this paper, we improve the
bound on $\Delta$ from $\frac{n}{2}(\sqrt{7}-1)$ to $0.75n$. Considering the
structure of $\Delta$-critical graphs with a vertex of degree 2, we also show
that for an $n$-vertex $\Delta$-critical graph with $\Delta\ge \frac{3n}{4}$,
if it contains a vertex of degree 2, then it is overfull. We actually obtain a
more general form of this result, which partially supports the overfull
conjecture of Chetwynd and Hilton from 1986, which states that if $G$ is an
$n$-vertex $\Delta$-critical graph with $\Delta>n/3$, then $G$ contains an
overfull subgraph $H$ with $\Delta(H)=\Delta$. Our proof techniques are new and
might shed some light on attacking both of the conjectures when $\Delta$ is
large.

the problem of predicting periods where the demand peaks for individual

that predicts the k hours of each day with the highest and lowest demand. We
evaluate our approach using a two year trace from a real micro-grid of 156

generate analogous counterfactuals that can explain new problems and their

1+2 dimensions. We also look at particle creation on $\Bbb R\times \Bbb Z_n$
and find an additional $m=0$ adiabatic no particle creation expansion as well
as the particle creation spectrum for a smoothed step expansion.

new non-commutative and higher derivatives quantum mechanics. Within it, we
introduce the shortest fundamental scale as a UV fixed point in the NLGUP
commutators [X, P] = i\hbar f(P), having in mind a fundamental highest energy
threshold related to the Planck scale. We show that this leads to lose
commutativity of space coordinates, that start to be dependent by the angular
momenta of the system. On the other hand, non-linear GUP must lead to a
redefinition of the Schrodinger equation to a new non-local
integral-differential equation. We also discuss the modification of the Dyson
series in time-dependent perturbative approaches. This may suggest that, in
NLGUPs, non-commutativity and higher derivatives may be intimately
interconnected within a unified and coherent algebra. We also show that Dirac
and Klein-Gordon equations are extended with higher space-derivatives according
to the NLGUP. We compute momenta-dependent corrections to the dispersion
velocity, showing that the Lorentz invariance is deformed. We comment on
possible implications in tests of light dispersion relations from
Gamma-Ray-Bursts or Blazars, with potential interests for future experiments
such as LHAASO, HAWC and CTA.

  2021",,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A complex combination of simultaneous supervised-unsupervised learning is
believed to be the key to humans performing tasks seamlessly across multiple
domains or tasks. This phenomenon of cross-domain learning has been very well
studied in domain adaptation literature. Recent domain adaptation works rely on
an indirect way of first aligning the source and target domain distributions
and then train a classifier on the labeled source domain to classify the target
domain. However, this approach has the main drawback that obtaining a
near-perfect alignment of the domains in itself might be difficult/impossible
(e.g., language domains). To address this, we follow Vapnik's imperative of
statistical learning that states any desired problem should be solved in the
most direct way rather than solving a more general intermediate task and
propose a direct approach to domain adaptation that does not require domain
alignment. We propose a model referred Contradistinguisher that learns
contrastive features and whose objective is to jointly learn to
contradistinguish the unlabeled target domain in an unsupervised way and
classify in a supervised way on the source domain. We achieve the
state-of-the-art on Office-31 and VisDA-2017 datasets in both single-source and
multi-source settings. We also notice that the contradistinguish loss improves
the model performance by increasing the shape bias.

research, and ample evidence has shown that different languages exhibit some
common laws. Studies have found that letters in some alphabetic writing
languages have strikingly similar statistical usage frequency distributions.
Does this hold for Chinese, which employs ideogram writing? We obtained letter
frequency data of some alphabetic writing languages and found the common law of
the letter distributions. In addition, we collected Chinese literature corpora
for different historical periods from the Tang Dynasty to the present, and we
dismantled the Chinese written language into three kinds of basic particles:
characters, strokes and constructive parts. The results of the statistical
analysis showed that, in different historical periods, the intensity of the use
of basic particles in Chinese writing varied, but the form of the distribution
was consistent. In particular, the distributions of the Chinese constructive
parts are certainly consistent with those alphabetic writing languages. This
study provides new evidence of the consistency of human languages.

is governed by optically induced electric and magnetic Mie resonances
facilitating confinement of light with the amplitude enhancement. However,
strong subwavelength trapping of light was associated traditionally only with
plasmonic or epsilon-near-zero structures which however suffer from losses.
Recently, an alternative localization mechanism was proposed to trap light in
individual subwavelength optical resonators with a high quality factor in the
regime of a supercavity mode. Here, we present the experimental observation of
the supercavity modes in subwavelength ceramic resonators in the radiofrequency
range. We demonstrate experimentally that the regime of supercavity mode can be
achieved via precise tuning of the resonator's dimensions resulting in a huge
growth of the quality factor reaching the experimental values up to 1.25x10^4,
being limited only by material losses in dielectrics. We reveal that the
supercavity modes can be excited efficiently by both near- and far-fields by
means of dipole sources and plane waves, respectively. In both the cases, the
supercavity mode manifests itself clearly via characteristic peculiarities of
the Fano resonance and radiation patterns. Our work paves the way for future
compact practical devices in photonics and radiophysics.

  COVID-19 on Vulnerable Individuals and the Approaches Required to Help them
  Emerge from Lockdown",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  COVID-19 has shown a relatively low mortality rate in young healthy
individuals, with the majority of this group being asymptomatic or having mild
symptoms, while the severity of the disease among individuals with underlying
health conditions has caused signiffcant mortality rates worldwide.
Understanding these differences in mortality amongst different sectors of
society and modelling this will enable the different levels of risk and
vulnerabilities to be determined to enable strategies exit the lockdown.
However, epidemiological models do not account for the variability encountered
in the severity of the SARS-CoV-2 disease across different population groups.
To overcome this limitation, it is proposed that a modiffed SEIR model, namely
SEIR-v, through which the population is separated into two groups regarding
their vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2 is applied. This enables the analysis of the
spread of the epidemic when different contention measures are applied to
different groups in society regarding their vulnerability to the disease. A
Monte Carlo simulation indicates a large number of deaths could be avoided by
slightly decreasing the exposure of vulnerable groups to the disease. From this
modelling a number of mechanisms can be proposed to limit the exposure of
vulnerable individuals to the disease in order to reduce the mortality rate
among this group. One option could be the provision of a wristband to
vulnerable people and those without a contact-tracing app. By combining very
dense contact tracing data from smartphone apps and wristband signals with
information about infection status and symptoms, vulnerable people can be
protected and kept safer. Widespread utilisation would extend the protection
further beyond these high risk groups.
