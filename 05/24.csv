  logistics based on blockchain: the case of mobile phones",,,,,"cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human beings produce electronic waste (e-waste) at an unprecedented pace.
Mobile phones and other inter-connected smart devices make a significant
contribution to the generation of e-waste. Reverse logistics (RL) activities
play an essential role in managing mobile phones during their end-of-life.
However, remanufacturing and/or refurbishing of mobile phones might prove
difficult not only from an operational point of view but also from a data
management and privacy perspective (due to privacy-related regulatory
frameworks like the EU General Data Protection Regulation directive). In this
paper, we propose a distributed trustless and secure framework for electronic
equipment RL activities based on blockchain technology. We consider the
remanufacturing/refurbishing recovery option for mobile phones, and we develop
an autonomous and effective back-end data sharing architecture based on smart
contracts/blockchain technology for keeping track of all the
remanufacturing/refurbishing processes. For demonstrating the applicability of
our approach, we develop a functional set of smart contracts and a local
private blockchain. The benefits of our framework are further discussed, along
with fruitful areas for future research.

systems involves identifying appropriate boundary conditions in addition to
writing down the correct Hamiltonian. In the simplest problem of scattering in
one dimensional lattice, scattering due to an on-site potential and scattering
due to an unequal bond (in otherwise translationally invariant lattice) give
different results for scattering amplitudes. While the scattering problems in
the continuum and the lattice models can be mapped to one another for
scattering due to on-site potential, the equivalent continuum model for
scattering due to an unequal bond is missing. We introduce a new parameter $c$
in the boundary condition of the continuum model that is equivalent to
scattering due to an unequal bond on the lattice. Further, we study a junction
between a normal metal quantum wire and a one dimensional edge of quantum spin
Hall insulator (QSHI) in continuum using the parameter $c$. In the case of a
junction between a normal metal quantum wire and the edge of QSHI, we identify
the boundary condition that permits maximum transmission. Further, we solve the
scattering problem between the junction of quantum wire and QSHI using a
lattice model and map it to continuum model results. The problem of transport
between four channels of spinful normal metal quantum wire and two channels of
QSHI edge is not well-defined. We rectify this situation by formulating the
scattering problem in terms of a junction of a semi-infinite normal metal
quantum wire with an infinite edge of QSHI, gapping out one semi-infinite
section of the QSHI edge by a Zeeman field and applying an appropriate boundary
condition at the junction. We calculate the scattering amplitudes analytically.

networks (GNNs), which have been shown as a powerful approach for graph
representation learning in many tasks, such as node classification and graph
classification. The research on the robustness of these models has also started
to attract attentions in the machine learning field. However, most of the
existing work in this area focus on the GNNs for node-level tasks, while little
work has been done to study the robustness of the GNNs for the graph
classification task. In this paper, we aim to explore the vulnerability of the
Hierarchical Graph Pooling (HGP) Neural Networks, which are advanced GNNs that
perform very well in the graph classification in terms of prediction accuracy.
We propose an adversarial attack framework for this task. Specifically, we
design a surrogate model that consists of convolutional and pooling operators
to generate adversarial samples to fool the hierarchical GNN-based graph
classification models. We set the preserved nodes by the pooling operator as
our attack targets, and then we perturb the attack targets slightly to fool the
pooling operator in hierarchical GNNs so that they will select the wrong nodes
to preserve. We show the adversarial samples generated from multiple datasets
by our surrogate model have enough transferability to attack current
state-of-art graph classification models. Furthermore, we conduct the robust
train on the target models and demonstrate that the retrained graph
classification models are able to better defend against the attack from the
adversarial samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on
the adversarial attack against hierarchical GNN-based graph classification
models.

different forms, most notably as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), to
transform wireless communications for extraordinary diversity and multiplexing

antennas at fixed locations which dictates the fundamental limit on the
achievable performance. By contrast, this paper envisages the scenario where
the physical position of an antenna can be switched freely to one of the N
positions over a fixed-length line space to pick up the strongest signal in the
manner of traditional selection combining. We refer to this system as a fluid
antenna system (FAS) for tremendous flexibility in its possible shape and
position. The aim of this paper is to study the achievable performance of a
single-antenna FAS system with a fixed length and N in arbitrarily correlated
Rayleigh fading channels. Our contributions include exact and approximate
closed-form expressions for the outage probability of FAS. We also derive an
upper bound for the outage probability, from which it is shown that a
single-antenna FAS given any arbitrarily small space can outperform an
L-antenna maximum ratio combining (MRC) system if N is large enough. Our
analysis also reveals the minimum required size of the FAS, and how large N is

We use the caustic method to measure the mass profiles to these large radii. We
demonstrate the validity of our estimates by applying the same approach to a

the simulated clusters are unbiased and agree within $19\%$ with the median

(RRL) variables pulsating either in the fundamental (39 RRab) or in the first
overtone (9 RRc) mode. We measured radial velocities (RVs) of four strong
metallic and four Balmer lines along the entire pulsational cycle and derived
RV amplitudes with accuracies better than 1$-$2~\kmsec. The new amplitudes were
combined with literature data for 23~RRab and 3~RRc stars (total sample 74
RRLs) which allowed us to investigate the variation of the Bailey diagram
(photometric amplitude versus period) when moving from optical to mid-infrared
bands and to re-cast the Bailey diagram in terms of RV amplitudes. We found
that RV amplitudes for RRab are minimally affected by nonlinear phenomena
(shocks) and multi-periodicity (Blazhko effect). The RV slope ($\log
P$--A(V$_r$)) when compared with the visual slope ($\log P$--A($V$)) is
shallower and the dispersion, at fixed period, decreases by a factor of two. We
constructed homogeneous sets of Horizontal Branch evolutionary models and
nonlinear, convective pulsation models of RRLs to constrain the impact of
evolutionary effects on their pulsation properties. Evolution causes, on the
Bailey diagram based on RV amplitudes, a modest variation in pulsation period
and a large dispersion in amplitude. The broad dispersion in period of the
Bailey diagram is mainly caused by variation in RRL intrinsic parameters
(stellar mass, chemical composition). Empirical evidence indicates that RV
amplitudes are an optimal diagnostic for tracing the mean effective temperature
across the RRab instability strip.

morphology by using two sharp-tipped lobes. The lobes are placed on either end
of the minor axis in an elliptic nozzle. The design Mach number and the aspect
ratio of the elliptic nozzle and the lobed nozzle are 2.0 and 1.65. The
supersonic jet is exhausted into ambient at almost perfectly expanded
conditions. Time-resolved schlieren imaging, longitudinal and cross-sectional
planar laser Mie-scattering imaging, planar Particle Image Velocimetry, and
near-field microphone measurements are performed to assess the fluidic behavior
of the two nozzles. Dynamic Mode and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (DMD and
POD) analysis are carried out on the schlieren and the Mie-scattering images.
Mixing characteristics are extracted from the Mie-scattering images through the
image processing routines. The flapping elliptic jet consists of two dominant
DMD modes, while the lobed nozzle has only one dominant mode, and the flapping
is suppressed. Microphone measurements show the associated noise reduction. The
jet column bifurcates in the lobed nozzle enabling a larger surface contact
area with the ambient fluid and higher mixing rates in the near-field of the
nozzle exit. The jet width growth rate of the two-lobed nozzle is about twice
as that of the elliptic jet in the near-field, and there is a 40\% reduction in
the potential core length. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) contours
substantiate the results.

the corresponding backbone and resetting from secondary fingers to the main
fingers. The transient dynamics along the backbone in all three cases is
different due to the different resetting mechanisms, finding a wide range of
dynamics for the mean squared displacement. For the particular geometry studied
herein, we compute the stationary solution and the mean square displacement and
find that the global resetting breaks the transport in the three directions.
Regarding the resetting to the backbone, the transport is broken in two
directions but it is enhanced in the main axis. Finally, the resetting to the
fingers enhances the transport in the backbone and the main fingers but reaches
a steady value for the mean squared displacement in the secondary fingers.

changes, illumination variations and appearance diversities, etc. Most of
previous work only consider the attribute-level feature embedding, which might
perform poorly in complicated heterogeneous conditions. To address this
problem, we propose a hierarchical feature embedding (HFE) framework, which
learns a fine-grained feature embedding by combining attribute and ID
information. In HFE, we maintain the inter-class and intra-class feature
embedding simultaneously. Not only samples with the same attribute but also
samples with the same ID are gathered more closely, which could restrict the
feature embedding of visually hard samples with regard to attributes and
improve the robustness to variant conditions. We establish this hierarchical
structure by utilizing HFE loss consisted of attribute-level and ID-level
constraints. We also introduce an absolute boundary regularization and a
dynamic loss weight as supplementary components to help build up the feature
embedding. Experiments show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art
results on two pedestrian attribute datasets and a facial attribute dataset.

Subordinates interact with rivals through reinforcement learning, and report

practices to write comments. None of them has compared such developer practices
to the standard comment guidelines to study the extent to which developers
follow the guidelines. This paper reports the first empirical study
investigating commenting practices in Pharo Smalltalk. First, we analyze class
comment evolution over seven Pharo versions. Then, we investigate the
information types embedded in class comments. Finally, we study the adherence
of developer commenting practices to the official class comment template over
Pharo versions.
  The results of this study show that there is a rapid increase in class
comments in the initial three Pharo versions, while in subsequent versions
developers added comments to both new and old classes, thus maintaining a
similar code to comment ratio. We furthermore found three times as many
information types in class comments as those suggested by the template.
However, the information types suggested by the template tend to be present
more often than other types of information. Additionally, we find that a
substantial proportion of comments follow the writing style of the template in
writing these information types, but they are written and formatted in a
non-uniform way.This suggests the need to standardize the commenting guidelines
for formatting the text, and to provide headers for the different information
types to ensure a consistent style and to identify the information easily.
Given the importance of high-quality code comments, we draw numerous
implications for developers and researchers to improve the support for comment

in which the laser pulse propagating in LiNbO$_3$ is modulated by the terahertz
field it produces, and this in turn drives optical rectification more
effectively to produce the terahertz field. This resonant cascading effect can
greatly increase terahertz conversion efficiencies when the input laser pulse
is properly pre-chirped with additional third order dispersion. We also observe

maximization (EM) algorithm is highly sensitive to outliers. Here we propose a

Adaptive Trimming (CAT) method. We consider simultaneous outlier detection and
robust parameter estimation to minimize the effect of outlier contamination.
Robust mixture regression has many important applications including in human
cancer genomics data, where the population often displays strong heterogeneity
added by unwanted technological perturbations. Existing robust mixture
regression methods suffer from outliers as they either conduct parameter
estimation in the presence of outliers, or rely on prior knowledge of the level
of outlier contamination. CAT was implemented in the framework of
classification expectation maximization, under which a natural definition of
outliers could be derived. It implements a least trimmed squares (LTS) approach
within each exclusive mixing component, where the robustness issue could be
transformed from the mixture case to simple linear regression case. The high
breakdown point of the LTS approach allows us to avoid the pre-specification of
trimming parameter. Compared with multiple existing algorithms, CAT is the most
competitive one that can handle and adaptively trim off outliers as well as
heavy tailed noise, in different scenarios of simulated data and real genomic

objectives, are attractive to decision makers in multi-criterion

attractive since a small improvement on one objective can lead to a significant
degradation on at least one of the other objectives. In this paper, we propose
a simple and effective knee point identification method based on trade-off
utility, dubbed KPITU, to help decision makers identify knee points from a
given set of trade-off solutions. The basic idea of KPITU is to sequentially
validate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its trade-off
utility with others within its neighbourhood. In particular, a solution is a
knee point if and only if it has the best trade-off utility among its
neighbours. Moreover, we implement a GPU version of KPITU that carries out the
knee point identification in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the
worst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. To validate the effectiveness
of KPITU, we compare its performance with five state-of-the-art knee point
identification methods on 134 test problem instances. Empirical results fully
demonstrate the outstanding performance of KPITU especially on problems with
many local knee points. At the end, we further validate the usefulness of KPITU

matrix is to calculate all the correspondence from the $i$ area to the $j$

superposition of the power and logarithmic cost functions. In these functions,
the cost is a combination of average time and distance between areas, which
depends on the parameters. The correspondence matrix is calculated for multiple
sets of parameters and then we calculate the quality of the restored matrix
relative to the known correspondence matrix. We assume that the noise in the
restored correspondence matrix is Gaussian, as a result, we use the standard

Although the topic has attracted attention recently, current approaches all
rely on the ability to access a sizable amount of target data for use at
training time. This is a heavy assumption, as often it is not possible to
anticipate the domain where a detector will be used, nor to access it in
advance for data acquisition. Consider for instance the task of monitoring
image feeds from social media: as every image is created and uploaded by a
different user it belongs to a different target domain that is impossible to
foresee during training. This paper addresses this setting, presenting an
object detection algorithm able to perform unsupervised adaption across domains
by using only one target sample, seen at test time. We achieve this by
introducing a multi-task architecture that one-shot adapts to any incoming
sample by iteratively solving a self-supervised task on it. We further enhance
this auxiliary adaptation with cross-task pseudo-labeling. A thorough benchmark
analysis against the most recent cross-domain detection methods and a detailed
ablation study show the advantage of our method, which sets the

before deployment. A number of static analysis tools have been developed for
finding security bugs in smart contracts. However, despite the numerous
bug-finding tools, there is no systematic approach to evaluate the proposed
tools and gauge their effectiveness. This paper proposes SolidiFI, an automated
and systematic approach for evaluating smart contract static analysis tools.
SolidiFI is based on injecting bugs (i.e., code defects) into all potential
locations in a smart contract to introduce targeted security vulnerabilities.
SolidiFI then checks the generated buggy contract using the static analysis
tools, and identifies the bugs that the tools are unable to detect
(false-negatives) along with identifying the bugs reported as false-positives.
SolidiFI is used to evaluate six widely-used static analysis tools, namely,
Oyente, Securify, Mythril, SmartCheck, Manticore and Slither, using a set of 50
contracts injected by 9369 distinct bugs. It finds several instances of bugs
that are not detected by the evaluated tools despite their claims of being able
to detect such bugs, and all the tools report many false positives

mechanism called kinetic proofreading to enhance their specificity. Kinetic
proofreading typically requires several dedicated structural features in the
enzyme, such as a nucleotide hydrolysis site and multiple enzyme-substrate
conformations that delay product formation. Such requirements limit the
applicability and the adaptability of traditional proofreading schemes. Here,
we explore an alternative conceptual mechanism of error correction that
achieves delays between substrate binding and subsequent product formation by
having these events occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the
enzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged
to discard wrong substrates. This mechanism does not require dedicated
structural elements on the enzyme, making it easier to overlook in experiments
but also making proofreading tunable on the fly. We discuss how tuning the
length scales of enzyme or substrate concentration gradients changes the
fidelity, speed and energy dissipation, and quantify the performance
limitations imposed by realistic diffusion and reaction rates in the cell. Our
work broadens the applicability of kinetic proofreading, and sets the stage for
the study of spatial gradients as a possible route to specificity.

transform input multivariate data residing in M-dimensional space
$\mathcal{R}^M$ to a single-dimensional space of positive real numbers
$\mathcal{R}_+$, i.e., $\mathcal{R}^M \rightarrow \mathcal{R}_+$, where $M >

propose to apply the above test locally on multiple input data scales obtained

address two challenges in this problem, namely the design of a powerful

Existing methods suffer from problems in the inputs with face orientation and
zero-volume structures. Additionally most methods do not scale to meshes of

faces between occupied voxels and empty voxels, and uses a projection-based
optimization method to accurately recover a watertight manifold that resembles

It does not rely on face normals of the input triangle soups and can accurately
recover zero-volume structures. Our algorithm is scalable, because it employs
an adaptive Gauss-Seidel method for shape optimization, in which each step is
an easy-to-solve convex problem. We test ManifoldPlus on ModelNet10 and
AccuCity datasets to verify that our methods can generate watertight meshes
ranging from object-level shapes to city-level models. Furthermore, through our

recurrent neural networks (RNN), has received much attention in recent years.
However, the potential of RNN-based models in traffic forecasting has not yet
been fully exploited in terms of the predictive power of spatial-temporal data
and the capability of handling missing data. In this paper, we focus on
RNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its

unidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the
design of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key
component of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to
capture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data.
To deal with missing values in spatial-temporal data, we also propose a data
imputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation
unit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional
version of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world
network-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and
published to facilitate further traffic prediction research. The prediction
performance of multiple types of multi-layer LSTM or BDLSTM models is
evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the proposed SBU-LSTM
architecture, especially the two-layer BDLSTM network, can achieve superior
performance for the network-wide traffic prediction in both accuracy and
robustness. Further, comprehensive comparison results show that the proposed
data imputation mechanism in the RNN-based models can achieve outstanding

algorithm on mobile phones. A meta-smoothing module is also proposed to
simultaneously upscale a stylized frame to arbitrary resolution and remove

(SRNN) is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to other
spiking neural networks and almost reach or exceed the performance of classical
recurrent neural networks (RNNs) while exhibiting sparse activity. From this,
we calculate a $>$100x energy improvement for our SRNNs over classical RNNs on
the harder tasks. To achieve this, we model standard and adaptive
multiple-timescale spiking neurons as self-recurrent neural units, and leverage
surrogate gradients and auto-differentiation in the PyTorch Deep Learning
framework to efficiently implement backpropagation-through-time, including
learning of the important spiking neuron parameters to adapt our spiking
neurons to the tasks.

It makes photo
taking popular due to its convenience and high resolution. However, when users
take a photo of a scenery, a building or a target person, a stranger may also
be unintentionally captured in the photo. Such photos expose the location and
activity of strangers, and hence may breach their privacy. In this paper, we
propose a cooperative mobile photographing scheme called PoliteCamera to
protect strangers' privacy. Through the cooperation between a photographer and
a stranger, the stranger's face in a photo can be automatically blurred upon
his request when the photo is taken. Since multiple strangers nearby the
photographer might send out blurring requests but not all of them are in the
photo, an adapted balanced convolutional neural network (ABCNN) is proposed to
determine whether the requesting stranger is in the photo based on facial
attributes. Evaluations demonstrate that the ABCNN can accurately predict
facial attributes and PoliteCamera can provide accurate privacy protection for
strangers.

$P(X)$ and $P(Y)$ alone; one also needs one of the conditionals $P(X|Y)$ or
$P(Y|X)$. But is there a best guess, given only the marginals? Here we answer
this question in the affirmative, obtaining in closed form the function of the
marginals that has the lowest expected Kullbach-Liebler (KL) divergence between
the unknown ""true"" joint probability and the function value. The expectation is
taken with respect to Jeffreys' non-informative prior over the possible joint
probability values, given the marginals. This distribution can also be used to
obtain the expected information loss for any other ""aggregation operator"", as
such estimators are often called in fuzzy logic, for any given pair of marginal
input values. This enables such such operators, including ours, to be compared
according to their expected loss under the minimal knowledge conditions we
assume. We go on to develop a method for evaluating the expected accuracy of
any aggregation operator in the absence of knowledge of its inputs. This
requires averaging the expected loss over all possible input pairs, weighted by
an appropriate distribution. We obtain this distribution by marginalizing
Jeffreys' prior over the possible joint distributions (over the 3 functionally
independent coordinates of the space of joint distributions over two Boolean
variables) onto a joint distribution over the pair of marginal distributions, a
2-dimensional space with one parameter for each marginal. We report the
resulting input-averaged expected losses for a few commonly used operators, as
well as the optimal operator. Finally, we discuss the potential to develop our
methodology into a principled risk management approach to replace the often
rather arbitrary conditional-independence assumptions made for probabilistic
graphical models.

move collectively and self-organize into dynamic structures with long-range

cellular motility, structure, intracellular transport, and division.
Semiflexible cytoskeletal filaments driven by polymerization or motor-protein
interactions on a two-dimensional substrate, such as the cell cortex, can
induce filament bending and curvature leading to interesting collective
behavior. For example, the bacterial cell-division filament FtsZ is known to
have intrinsic curvature that causes it to self-organize into rings and
vortices, and recent experiments reconstituting the collective motion of
microtubules driven by motor proteins on a surface have observed chiral
symmetry breaking of the collective behavior due to motor-induced curvature of
the filaments. Previous work on the self-organization of driven filament
systems have not studied the effects of curvature and filament structure on
collective behavior. In this work, we present Brownian dynamics simulation
results of driven semiflexible filaments with intrinsic curvature and
investigate how the interplay between filament rigidity and radius of curvature
can tune the self-organization behavior in homochiral systems and heterochiral
mixtures. We find a curvature-induced phase transition from polar flocks to
self-sorted chiral clusters, which is modified by filament flexibility. This
phase transition changes filament transport from ballistic to diffusive at long

results show that deep learning approaches, such as Faster R-CNN, are not

networks (CompositionalNets) have been shown to be robust at classifying
occluded objects by explicitly representing the object as a composition of

CompositionalNets which will enable them to detect partially occluded objects:
1) CompositionalNets, as well as other DCNN architectures, do not explicitly
separate the representation of the context from the object itself. Under strong
object occlusion, the influence of the context is amplified which can have
severe negative effects for detection at test time. In order to overcome this,
we propose to segment the context during training via bounding box annotations.
We then use the segmentation to learn a context-aware CompositionalNet that
disentangles the representation of the context and the object. 2) We extend the
part-based voting scheme in CompositionalNets to vote for the corners of the
object's bounding box, which enables the model to reliably estimate bounding
boxes for partially occluded objects. Our extensive experiments show that our
proposed model can detect objects robustly, increasing the detection
performance of strongly occluded vehicles from PASCAL3D+ and MS-COCO by 41% and

detect different anomalies. This paper proposes an efficient strategy to
aggregate multiple detectors. First, the aggregation strategy chooses one
detector as master detector by experience, and sets the remaining detectors as
auxiliary detectors. Then, the aggregation strategy extracts credible
information from auxiliary detectors, including credible abnormal (Cred-a)
frames and credible normal (Cred-n) frames. After that, the frequencies that
each video frame being judged as Cred-a and Cred-n are counted. Applying the
events' time continuity property, more Cred-a and Cred-n frames can be
inferred. Finally, the aggregation strategy utilizes the Cred-a and Cred-n
frequencies to vote to calculate soft weights, and uses the soft weights to
assist the master detector. Experiments are carried out on multiple datasets.
Comparing with existing aggregation strategies, the proposed strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

say that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies

require well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means
they cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the

greater than $1$.
  In a recent result, Bennett, Golovnev and Stephens-Davidowitz showed that
under Gap-ETH, there is no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm for approximating
$\mathsf{CVP}_p$ up to some constant factor $\gamma \geq 1$ for any $1 \leq p

reduction from $\mathsf{Gap3SAT}$ to the Gap Closest Vector Problem with
Bounded Minima. This, together with the above mentioned reduction, implies
that, under Gap-ETH, there is no $2^{o(n)}$-time algorithm for approximating
$\mathsf{SIVP}_p$ up to some constant factor $\gamma \geq 1$ for any $1 \leq p

observers perform a kind of a minimum-error type state discriminating
measurement where the goal of the observers is to maximize their joint
probability of successfully guessing the state that the qubit was initially
prepared in. We call this the joint best guess strategy. In this scheme, Alice
prepares a qubit in one of two possible states. The qubit is first sent to Bob,
who measures it, and then on to Charlie, and so on to altogether N consecutive
receivers who all perform measurements on it. The goal for all observers is to
determine which state Alice sent. In the joint best guess strategy, every time
a system is received the observer is required to make a guess, aided by the
measurement, about its state. The price to pay for this requirement is that
errors must be permitted, the guess can be correct or in error. There is a
nonzero probability for all the receivers to successfully identify the
initially prepared state, and we maximize this joint probability of success.
This work is a step toward developing a theory of nondestructive sequential
quantum measurements and could be useful in multiparty quantum communication
schemes based on communicating with single qubits, particularly in schemes
employing continuous variable states. It also represents a case where
subsequent observers can probabilistically and optimally get around both the
collapse postulate and the no-broadcasting theorem.

travelling in such media can emit Cherenkov radiation with a power spectrum
directly proportional to the photon frequency $\omega$. Therefore, by
extrapolating $\omega$ beyond the critical synchrotron frequency $\omega_{c}$,
the Cherenkov radiation will eventually dominate over its synchrotron
counterpart. However, such an extrapolation is not possible. We show that in
the framework of effective field theory, the maximal attainable photon
frequency $\omega_{\tiny{\mbox{max}}}$ is about four order of magnitude less
than $\omega_{c}$. At $\omega=\omega_{\tiny{\mbox{max}}}$, given the
$\gamma_{e}$-factor of an electron travelling normal to a constant and
spatially uniform magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$, the spectrum of Cherenkov
radiation becomes dominant when $\gamma_{e}(|\mathbf{B}|/\mbox{Gauss})\gtrsim

astrophysical environments remains challenging since its spectral flux density
is about three orders of magnitude less than the synchrotron radiation.

the stability problem for a two-dimensional Boussinesq system with only

smooths and stabilizes the fluids. If the temperature were not present, the
fluid is governed by the 2D Navier-Stokes with only vertical dissipation and
its stability remains open. It is the coupling and interaction between the

non-logical symbols have only one possible interpretation that renders the
axioms true. Although non-categoricity has become ubiquitous in the second half
of the 20th century whether one looks at number theory, geometry or analysis,
the first axiomatizations of such mathematical theories by Dedekind, Hilbert,
Huntington, Peano and Veblen were indeed categorical. A common resolution of
the difference between the earlier categorical axiomatizations and the more
modern non-categorical axiomatizations is that the latter derive their
non-categoricity from Skolem's Paradox and G\""odel's Incompleteness Theorems,
while the former, being second order, suffer from a heavy reliance on
metatheory, where the Skolem-G\""odel phenomenon re-emerges. Using second order
meta-theory to avoid non-categoricity of the meta-theory would only seem to
lead to an infinite regress. In this paper we maintain that internal
categoricity breaks this traditional picture. It applies to both first and
second order axiomatizations, although in the first order case we have so far
only examples. It does not depend on the meta-theory in a way that would lead
to an infinite regress. And it covers the classical categoricity results of
early researchers. In the first order case it is weaker than categoricity
itself, and in the second order case stronger. We give arguments suggesting
that internal categoricity is the ""right"" concept of categoricity.

overall control cost scale with the number of possible realizations. We verify
the theory in three examples of interest: a unidirectional chain network with
uncertain edge weights and self-loop weights, a network where each edge weight
is drawn from a given distribution, and the Jacobian of the dynamics
corresponding to the cell signaling network of autophagy in the presence of
uncertain parameters. Our work sheds fundamental insight into the relationship
between optimality and uncertainty. Our main result is that the optimal cost
corresponding to the solution of the optimal control problem remains finite for
possibly infinitely many network realizations as long as uncertainty is
bounded.

  of the novel learning rules",,,,"math.OC cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neural learning rules for principal component / subspace analysis (PCA / PSA)
can be derived by maximizing an objective function (summed variance of the
projection on the subspace axes) under an orthonormality constraint. For a
subspace with a single axis, the optimization produces the principal
eigenvector of the data covariance matrix. Hierarchical learning rules with
deflation procedures can then be used to extract multiple eigenvectors.
However, for a subspace with multiple axes, the optimization leads to PSA
learning rules which only converge to axes spanning the principal subspace but
not to the principal eigenvectors. A modified objective function with distinct
weight factors had to be introduced produce PCA learning rules. Optimization of
the objective function for multiple axes leads to symmetric learning rules
which do not require deflation procedures. For the PCA case, the estimated
principal eigenvectors are ordered (w.r.t. the corresponding eigenvalues)
depending on the order of the weight factors.
  Here we introduce an alternative objective function where it is not necessary
to introduce fixed weight factors; instead, the alternative objective function
uses squared summands. Optimization leads to symmetric PCA learning rules which
converge to the principal eigenvectors, but without imposing an order. In place
of the diagonal matrices with fixed weight factors, variable diagonal matrices
appear in the learning rules. We analyze this alternative approach by
determining the fixed points of the constrained optimization. The behavior of
the constrained objective function at the fixed points is analyzed which
confirms both the PCA behavior and the fact that no order is imposed. Different
ways to derive learning rules from the optimization of the objective function
are presented. The role of the terms in the learning rules obtained from these
derivations is explored.

appropriate to formulate traffic networks as graphs mathematically. Recently,
various novel deep learning techniques have been developed to process graph

decompose these graph-based architectures to discuss their shared deep learning
techniques, clarifying the utilization of each technique in traffic tasks.
What's more, we summarize some common traffic challenges and the corresponding

develop a distributed output feedback control law such that the output of the

leading vehicles exponentially. The convex hull formed by the output of the
leading vehicles and the system matrix of leading vehicles are estimated via a

converge to zero exponentially, which indicates the containment control
objective is well achieved. A distributed dynamic state-feedback control law is
deduced as a special case of the output feedback control. Finally, numerical

for certain partitions of sets of integers into weakly sum-free classes.
However, no proof or supporting construction was published at that time. In
today's terminology, that claim was equivalent to giving a formulaic lower
bound for the weak Schur number $WS(s)$. $WS(s)$ is the maximum number such
that there exists a weak Schur partition of the integers from 1 to $WS(s)$,
into $s$ subsets. In a weak Schur partition of a set of integers, there can be
no three distinct members $a$, $b$ and $c$ in any subset, such that $a+b=c$. An
iterative construction described in this paper results in a similar formulaic
lower bound. Although different from that given by Braun, it reproduces the
result $WS(6) \ge 554$ implied by his formula, and exceeds it for all larger
values of $s$. Various starting points can be used as a basis for the
iterations. This result itself is no longer remarkable: it has been proven
elsewhere that $WS(6) \ge 642$. Even so, it is hoped that the formula and its
underlying construction may nevertheless be of interest to those interested in
weak Schur partitions and/or the closely-related linear Ramsey graphs.

in the inner regions of nearby galaxies. The method performs especially well
when applied to the large number of independent lines-of-sight contained in the

orientations from the literature and kinematic orientations determined with our

this, we use seven scale factors to adjust the integrated positions and

the Newton iterative method combined with the singular value decomposition to
calculate these factors. This correction scheme can be applied to perturbed

exponent often tends to a constant 1. This seems to be a general rule. However,
a recent numerical experiment shows that there exists a contradiction between
the Zipf exponent 1 and high urbanization level in a large population country.
In this paper, mathematical modeling, computational analysis, and the method of
proof by contradiction are employed to reveal the numerical relationships
between urbanization level and Zipf scaling exponent. The main findings are as
follows. (1) If Zipf scaling exponent equals 1, the urbanization rate of a
large populous country can hardly exceed 50%. (2) If Zipf scaling exponent is
less than 1, the urbanization level of large populous countries can exceeds
80%. A conclusion can be drawn that the Zipf exponent is the control parameter
for the urbanization dynamics. In order to improve the urbanization level of
large population countries, it is necessary to reduce the Zipf scaling
exponent. Allometric growth law is employed to interpret the change of Zipf
exponent, and scaling transform is employed to prove that different definitions
of cities do no influence the above analytical conclusion essentially. This
study provides a new way of looking at Zipf's law of city-size distribution and
urbanization dynamics.

that the ""wormhole effect"", as a unique degree of freedom, introduces exotic
transport phenomena and thus manipulates the transport properties of
topological insulators. Our numerical results demonstrate that the transport
properties of a double-wormhole system can be manipulated by the wormhole
interference. Specifically, the conductance and local density of states both
oscillate with the Fermi energy due to the interference between the wormholes.
Furthermore, by studying the multi-wormhole systems, we find that the number of
wormholes can also modulate the differential conductance through a

with limited video highlight records in the training data and new segments
without any user ratings at the test stage. In this paper, we propose an
inductive Graph based Transfer learning framework for personalized video

graph neural network followed by an item embedding transfer network.
Specifically, the graph neural network part exploits the higher-order proximity
between users and segments to alleviate the user cold-start problem. The
transfer network is designed to approximate the learned item embeddings from
graph neural networks by taking each item's visual content as input, in order
to tackle the new segment problem in the test phase. We design two detailed

Intrinsic H$\alpha$ emission can be advantageously used to detect

  Aims. We characterise the young circumbinary planetary mass companion 2MASS
J01033563-5515561 (AB)b (Delorme 1 (AB)b) through medium-resolution
spectroscopy.
  Methods. We used the new narrow-field mode (NFM) for the MUSE integral-field
spectrograph, located on the ESO Very Large Telescope, during science
verification time to obtain optical spectra of Delorme 1 (AB)b.
  Results. We report the discovery of very strong H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$
emission, accompanied by He I emission. This is consistent with an active
accretion scenario. We provide accretion rate estimates obtained from several
independent methods and find a likely mass of $12-15$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ for Delorme
1 (AB)b. This is also consistent with previous estimates.
  Conclusions. Signs of active accretion in the Delorme 1 system might indicate
a younger age than the $\sim 30-40$ Myr expected from a likely membership in
Tucana-Horologium (THA). Previous works have also shown the central binary to
be overluminous, which gives further indication of a younger age. However,
recent discoveries of active discs in relatively old ($\sim 40$ Myr), very
low-mass systems suggests that ongoing accretion in Delorme 1 (AB)b might not
require in and of itself that the system is younger than the age implied by its
THA membership.

decision rules generated by AI-Interpret as flowcharts significantly improved
people's planning strategies and decisions across three diferent classes of

approach is significantly more effective than training people by giving them

consider two intervention cost models: (1) a linear cost model where the cost
of an intervention on a subset of variables has a linear form, and (2) an
identity cost model where the cost of an intervention is the same, regardless
of what variables it is on, i.e., the goal is just to minimize the number of
interventions. Under the linear cost model, we give an algorithm to identify
the ancestral relations of the underlying causal graph, achieving within a
$2$-factor of the optimal intervention cost. This approximation factor can be
improved to $1+\epsilon$ for any $\epsilon > 0$ under some mild restrictions.
Under the identity cost model, we bound the number of interventions needed to
recover the entire causal graph, including the latent variables, using a
parameterization of the causal graph through a special type of colliders. In
particular, we introduce the notion of $p$-colliders, that are colliders
between pair of nodes arising from a specific type of conditioning in the
causal graph, and provide an upper bound on the number of interventions as a
function of the maximum number of $p$-colliders between any two nodes in the
causal graph.

management. Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for
producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks.
Typically, these methods assume simple linear link function specifications,
which, however, limit the predictive power of a model. Furthermore, extensive
specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from
the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations.
Modern machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to automate the specification
of the link function. However, these methods do not capture estimation
uncertainty, and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations. In
light of these gaps in the literature, this paper proposes a new spatial
negative binomial model, which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to
endogenously select the specification of the link function. Posterior inference
in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Polya-Gamma data
augmentation technique. We test the performance of this new model on a crash
count data set from a metropolitan highway network. The empirical results show
that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count
data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking
ability.

price-setting mechanism: given agents' preferences and budgets, what set of
prices satisfies the maximum number of agents? Such an approach permits the
coupling of production and output within the economy to the allowed level of
debt in a simplified framework. Within our model, we identify three different
regimes upon varying the amount of debt that each agent can accumulate before
defaulting. In presence of a very loose constraint on debt, endogenous crises
leading to waves of synchronized bankruptcies are present. In the opposite
regime of very tight debt constraining, the bankruptcy rate is extremely high
and the economy remains structure-less. In an intermediate regime, the economy
is stable with very low bankruptcy rate and no aggregate-level crises. This
third regime displays a rich phenomenology:the system spontaneously and
dynamically self-organizes in a set of cheap and expensive goods (i.e. some
kind of ""speciation""), with switches triggered by random fluctuations and
feedback loops. Our analysis confirms the central role that debt levels play in
the stability of the economy. More generally, our model shows that constraints
at the individual scale can generate highly complex patterns at the aggregate
level.

compute the Cosmological OTOC during the stochastic particle production during
inflation and reheating following canonical quantization technique. In this
computation, two dynamical time scales are involved, out of them at one time
scale the cosmological perturbation variable and for the other the canonically
conjugate momentum is defined, which is the strict requirement to define time
scale separated quantum operators for OTOC and perfectly consistent with the
general definition of OTOC. Most importantly, using the present formalism not
only one can study the quantum correlation during stochastic inflation and
reheating, but also study quantum correlation for any random events in
Cosmology. Next, using the late time exponential decay of cosmological OTOC

maximal possible value can be quite large; thus it is necessary to estimate a
threshold so that numbers above it are truncated to reduce the amount of noise
that is required to all the data. The estimation must be done based on the data
in a private fashion. We develop such a method that uses the Exponential
Mechanism with a quality function that approximates well the utility goal while
maintaining a low sensitivity. Given the threshold, we then propose a novel
online hierarchical method and several post-processing techniques.
  Building on these ideas, we formalize the steps into a framework for private
publishing of stream data. Our framework consists of three components: a
threshold optimizer that privately estimates the threshold, a perturber that
adds calibrated noises to the stream, and a smoother that improves the result
using post-processing. Within our framework, we design an algorithm satisfying
the more stringent setting of DP called local DP (LDP). To our knowledge, this
is the first LDP algorithm for publishing streaming data. Using four real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art by
a factor of 6-10 orders of magnitude in terms of utility (measured by the mean

get suitable libraries, developers need to search through millions of libraries

barrier for programmers to locate appropriate ones. To help developers,
researchers have proposed automated approaches to recommend libraries based on
library usage pattern. However, these prior studies can not sufficiently match
user requirements and suffer from cold-start problem. In this work, we would
like to make recommendations based on requirement descriptions to avoid these
problems. To this end, we propose a novel neural approach called Req2Lib which
recommends libraries given descriptions of the project requirement. We use a
Sequence-to-Sequence model to learn the library linked-usage information and
semantic information of requirement descriptions in natural language. Besides,
we apply a domain-specific pre-trained word2vec model for word embedding, which
is trained over textual corpus from Stack Overflow posts. In the experiment, we
train and evaluate the model with data from 5,625 java projects. Our
preliminary evaluation demonstrates that Req2Lib can recommend libraries

  dynamics",,,,,"cs.DM cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An automata network is a network of entities, each holding a state from a
finite set and evolving according to a local update rule which depends only on
its neighbors in the network's graph. It is freezing if there is an order on
states such that the state evolution of any node is non-decreasing in any
orbit. They are commonly used to model epidemic propagation, diffusion
phenomena like bootstrap percolation or cristal growth. In this paper we
establish how treewidth and maximum degree of the underlying graph are key
parameters which influence the overall computational complexity of finite
freezing automata networks. First, we define a general model checking formalism
that captures many classical decision problems: prediction, nilpotency,
predecessor, asynchronous reachability. Then, on one hand, we present an
efficient parallel algorithm that solves the general model checking problem in
NC for any graph with bounded degree and bounded treewidth. On the other hand,
we show that these problems are hard in their respective classes when
restricted to families of graph with polynomially growing treewidth. For
prediction, predecessor and asynchronous reachability, we establish the
hardness result with a fixed set-defiend update rule that is universally hard
on any input graph of such families.

enables interesting many-body quantum phenomena, which are typically associated
with short-range disordered systems. As an example, we show how the system can
realize the so-called ""random singlet phase"", in which all atoms pair into
entangled singlets, but the pairing occurs over a distribution of ranges as
opposed to nearest neighbors. We use a renormalization group method to obtain
the distribution of spin entanglement in the random singlet phase, and show how
this state can be approximately reached via adiabatic evolution from the ground
state of a non-interacting Hamiltonian. We also discuss how experimentally this

deep-learning models in speech enhancement (SE) for mismatched noise
environments. Nevertheless, adaptation to a new environment may lead to
catastrophic forgetting of the previously learned environments. The
catastrophic forgetting issue degrades the performance of SE in real-world
embedded devices, which often revisit previous noise environments. The nature
of embedded devices does not allow solving the issue with additional storage of
all pre-trained models or earlier training data. In this paper, we propose a
regularization-based incremental learning SE (SERIL) strategy, complementing
existing noise adaptation strategies without using additional storage. With a
regularization constraint, the parameters are updated to the new noise
environment while retaining the knowledge of the previous noise environments.
The experimental results show that, when faced with a new noise domain, the
SERIL model outperforms the unadapted SE model. Meanwhile, compared with the
current adaptive technique based on fine-tuning, the SERIL model can reduce the
forgetting of previous noise environments by 52%. The results verify that the
SERIL model can effectively adjust itself to new noise environments while
overcoming the catastrophic forgetting issue. The results make SERIL a
favorable choice for real-world SE applications, where the noise environment
changes frequently.

They rely on ad hoc heuristics or expensive trial and error to choose the
effective kernels, and (ii) They fail to handle multilevel correlation
structure in the data. We introduce Longitudinal deep kernel Gaussian process
regression (L-DKGPR), which to the best of our knowledge, is the only method to
overcome these limitations by fully automating the discovery of complex

eliminates the need for ad hoc heuristics or trial and error using a novel
adaptation of deep kernel learning that combines the expressive power of deep
neural networks with the flexibility of non-parametric kernel methods. L-DKGPR
effectively learns the multilevel correlation with a novel addictive kernel
that simultaneously accommodates both time-varying and the time-invariant
effects. We derive an efficient algorithm to train L-DKGPR using latent space
inducing points and variational inference. Results of extensive experiments on
several benchmark data sets demonstrate that L-DKGPR significantly outperforms

Specifically, we (i) determine that the rates of crystal-crystal coalescence

stabilization of the particles, and are comparable to those of bimolecular

a custody protocol and demonstrates the security properties of that protocol.
The vault is implemented using pre-signed transactions with secure key deletion

enable the wallet owner to specify their desired balance for an inherent
trade-off between the security of and accessibility of bitcoin holdings by
adjusting the length of time-locks used. It is also demonstrated that wallet
owners have increased control of risk-management by compartmentalizing funds
across numerous vault transactions. While it isn't realistic to completely
prevent theft, the most likely theft scenarios (compromising the hot wallet)
have severely limited profitability for an attacker, deterring attempts at

challenge. The blockchain technology provides a promising solution to protect
the data integrity, provenance, privacy, and consistency for IoT networks. In
blockchains, communication is a prerequisite for participants, which are
distributed in the system, to reach consensus. However, in IoT networks, most
of the devices communicate through wireless links, which are not always
reliable. Hence, the communication reliability of IoT devices influences the
system security. In this article, we rethink the roles of communication and
computing in blockchains by accounting for communication reliability. We
analyze the tradeoff between communication reliability and computing power in
blockchain security, and present a lower bound to the computing power that is
needed to conduct an attack with a given communication reliability. Simulation
results show that adversarial nodes can succeed in tampering a block with less
computing power by hindering the propagation of blocks from other nodes.

the phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) method. sRI is
combined with four existing local energy evaluation strategies in ph-AFQMC,
namely (1) the half-rotated electron repulsion integral tensor (HR), (2)
Cholesky decomposition (CD), (3) tensor hypercontraction (THC), or (4) low-rank
factorization (LR). We demonstrate that HR-sRI achieves no scaling reduction,
CD-sRI scales as $\mathcal O(N^3)$, and THC-sRI and LR-sRI scale as $\mathcal
O(N^2)$, albeit with a potentially large prefactor. Furthermore, the
walker-specific extra memory requirement in CD is reduced from $\mathcal
O(N^3)$ to $\mathcal O(N^2)$ with sRI, while sRI-based THC and LR algorithms
lead to a reduction from $\mathcal O(N^2)$ extra memory to $\mathcal O(N)$.
Based on numerical results for one-dimensional hydrogen chains and water
clusters, we demonstrated that, along with the use of a variance reduction
technique, CD-sRI achieves cubic-scaling {\it without overhead}. In particular,
we find for the systems studied the observed scaling of standard CD is
$\mathcal O(N^{3-4})$ while for CD-sRI it is reduced to $\mathcal O(N^{2-3})$.
Once a memory bottleneck is reached, we expect THC-sRI and LR-sRI to be
preferred methods due to their quadratic-scaling memory requirements and their
quadratic-scaling of the local energy evaluation (with a potentially large
prefactor). The theoretical framework developed here should facilitate
large-scale ph-AFQMC applications that were previously difficult or impossible
to carry out with standard computational resources.

  Estimation",,,,,"cs.CV cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Head pose estimation is a crucial problem for many tasks, such as driver
attention, fatigue detection, and human behaviour analysis. It is well known
that neural networks are better at handling classification problems than
regression problems. It is an extremely nonlinear process to let the network
output the angle value directly for optimization learning, and the weight
constraint of the loss function will be relatively weak. This paper proposes a
novel Bernoulli heatmap for head pose estimation from a single RGB image. Our
method can achieve the positioning of the head area while estimating the angles
of the head. The Bernoulli heatmap makes it possible to construct fully
convolutional neural networks without fully connected layers and provides a new
idea for the output form of head pose estimation. A deep convolutional neural
network (CNN) structure with multiscale representations is adopted to maintain
high-resolution information and low-resolution information in parallel. This
kind of structure can maintain rich, high-resolution representations. In
addition, channelwise fusion is adopted to make the fusion weights learnable
instead of simple addition with equal weights. As a result, the estimation is
spatially more precise and potentially more accurate. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is empirically demonstrated by comparing it with other
state-of-the-art methods on public datasets.

scale and scheme (RSS) dependence in observables. We develop this approach by
matching RSS dependent observables (such as cross-sections and decay rates) to
a theory which is independent of both these forms of dependencies. We term the
fundamental basis behind this approach as the principle of observable effective
matching (POEM), which entails matching of a scale- and scheme-dependent
observable with the fully physical scale (PS) and dynamical scale-dependent
theory at loop orders at which RSS independence is guaranteed. This is aimed
toward achieving so-called ""effective"" RSS-independent expressions as the
resulting dynamical dependence is derived from a particular order in
RSS-dependent perturbation theory. With this matching at a PS at which the
coupling (and masses) is experimentally determined at this scale, we obtain an
""effective theoretical observable (ETO)"", a finite-order RSS-independent
version of the RSS-dependent observable. We illustrate our approach with a
study of the cross-section ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ for $e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow$
hadrons, which is demonstrated to achieve scale and scheme independence
utilizing the three- and four-loop order MS scheme expression in QCD
perturbation theory via matching at both one-loop and two-loop orders for
obtaining the ETO. With two-loop matching, we obtain an ETO prediction of

sufficient conditions which guarantee the convergence of solutions of Problem

bubbles propagating through circular capillary tubes is investigated by means
of an extensive three-dimensional numerical study using a hybrid
front-tracking/level-set method. The focus is on the visco-inertial regime,
which occurs when the Reynolds number of the flow is much larger than unity.
Under these conditions, `clean' bubbles exhibit interface undulations in the
proximity of the tail \cite{Magnini_prf_2017}, with an amplitude that increases
with the Reynolds number. We perform a systematic analysis of the impact of a
wide range of surfactant properties, including elasticity, bulk surfactant
concentration, solubility, and diffusivity, on the bubble and flow dynamics in
the presence of inertial effects. The results show that the introduction of
surfactants is effective in suppressing the tail undulations as they tend to
accumulate near the bubble tail. Here, large Marangoni stresses are generated,
which lead to a local `rigidification' of the bubble. This effect becomes more
pronounced for larger surfactant elasticities and adsorption depths. At reduced
surfactant solubility, a thicker rigid film region forms at the bubble rear,
where a Couette film flow is established, while undulations still appear at the
trailing edge of the downstream `clean' film region. In such conditions, the
bubble length becomes an influential parameter, with short bubbles becoming
completely rigid.

proposes a novel hybrid model which combines a Long short-term memory (LSTM)
artificial recurrent neural network with dynamic behavioral models. Several
factors and control strategies affect the virus spread, and the uncertainty
arisen from confounding variables underlying the spread of the Covid-19
infection is substantial. The proposed model considers the effect of multiple
factors to enhance the accuracy in predicting the number of cases and deaths
across the top ten most-affected countries and Australia. The results show that
the proposed model closely replicates test data. It not only provides accurate
predictions but also estimates the daily behavior of the system under
uncertainty. The hybrid model outperforms the LSTM model accounting for limited
available data. The parameters of the hybrid models were optimized using a
genetic algorithm for each country to improve the prediction power while
considering regional properties. Since the proposed model can accurately
predict Covid-19 spread under consideration of containment policies, is capable
of being used for policy assessment, planning and decision-making.

Currently, the best methods are the deep neural network (DNN)-powered variants

beamformers and the DNN-based filter-estimation methods that are used to
directly compute beamforming filters. Both approaches are effective; however,
they have blind spots in their generalizability. Therefore, we propose a novel
approach for combining these two methods into a single framework that attempts
to exploit the best features of both. The resulting model, called the W-Net
beamformer, includes two components; the first computes time-frequency
references that the second uses to estimate beamforming filters. The results on
data that include a wide variety of room and noise conditions, including static
and mobile noise sources, show that the proposed beamformer outperforms other
methods on all tested evaluation metrics, which signifies that the proposed
architecture allows for effective computation of the beamforming filters.

preserves the privacy of the participants and their contacts, and collects

weakest points of this modelling approach lies on the fact that rarely the
modeler has the enough information about the correct values or even the

combinations must be tried to find an acceptable set of input factors

severe physical afflictions through their use in assistive systems. Common
methods of achieving this is via Motor Imagery (MI), which maps brain signals
to code for certain commands. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is preferred for
recording brain signal data on account of it being non-invasive. Despite their
potential utility, MI-BCI systems are yet confined to research labs. A major
cause for this is lack of robustness of such systems. As hypothesized by two
teams during Cybathlon 2016, a particular source of the system's vulnerability
is the sharp change in the subject's state of emotional arousal. This work aims
towards making MI-BCI systems resilient to such emotional perturbations. To do
so, subjects are exposed to high and low arousal-inducing virtual reality (VR)
environments before recording EEG data. The advent of COVID-19 compelled us to
modify our methodology. Instead of training machine learning algorithms to
classify emotional arousal, we opt for classifying subjects that serve as proxy
for each state. Additionally, MI models are trained for each subject instead of
each arousal state. As training subjects to use MI-BCI can be an arduous and
time-consuming process, reducing this variability and increasing robustness can
considerably accelerate the acceptance and adoption of assistive technologies
powered by BCI.

we prove that TBPSA is able to escape plateaus with probability one in spite of
the fact that it can converge to local minima. This leads to an algorithm
effective in the multimodal setting without resorting to a random restart from
