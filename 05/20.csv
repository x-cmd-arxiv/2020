modeling the locations of the IoT devices as a bipolar Poisson Point Process

performance of the D2D links and status update links in terms of network
throughput and Age-of-Information (AoI), respectively. We consider a maximum
power constraint and distance-dependent fractional power control for all status
update transmissions. Hence, the locations of the IoT devices allowed to send
status updates are constrained to lie within the Johnson-Mehl cells. For this
set-up, the average network throughput is obtained by deriving the mean success
probability of the D2D links, whereas the spatial moments of the temporal mean
AoI are obtained by deriving the moments of the temporal means of both success

$\gamma$-ray data of 60 $Fermi$-4LAC flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs). In
the framework of the conventional one-zone leptonic model, we investigate the
physical properties of $Fermi$-4LAC FSRQs' jets by modeling their
quasi-simultaneous spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Our main results are
summarized as follows. (1) There is a linear correlation between synchrotron
peak frequency and curvature of the electron energy distribution. As suggested
by previous works, the slope of the best linear fitting equation of this
correlation is consistent with statistic acceleration which needs a fluctuation
of fractional acceleration gain. (2) The gamma-ray dissipation regions are
located at the range from 0.1 to 10 pc away from the super-massive black hole,
and located outside the broad-line region (BLR) and within the dusty torus
(DT). (3) A size relation $P_{\rm e}$ (the kinetic power carried in
relativistic electrons) $\sim$ $P_{\rm B}$ (Poynting flux) $\leq$ $P_{\rm r}$
(the radiative power ) $<$ $P_{\rm p}$ (the kinetic power in cold protons) is
found in our modeling. Among them, $P_{\rm e}\sim P_{\rm B}$ suggests that SEDs
of almost all FSRQs with parameters are close to equipartition between the
magnetic field and the relativistic electrons. The $P_{\rm e} < P_{\rm r}$
suggest that the most energy of the relativistic electrons are dissipated by EC
radiation for FSRQs. (4) There is an anti-correlation between the peak energy
of SEDs ($\gamma_{\rm peak}$) and the jet power ($P_{\rm jet}$), which is
consistent with the blazar sequence.

publication bias toward replicating fiducial numerical models. Here we present
the first systematic study of how the binary's orbital evolution varies with
disk scale height. We report three key results: (1) Binary orbital evolution
switches from outspiralling for warm disks (aspect ratio ~0.1), to inspiralling
for more realistic cooler, thinner disks at a critical aspect ratio ~0.04,
corresponding to orbital Mach number ~25. (2) The net torque on the binary
arises from a competition between positive torque from gas orbiting close to
the black holes, and negative torque from the inner edge of the CBD, which is
denser for thinner disks. This leads to increasingly negative net torques on
the binary for increasingly thin disks. (3) The accretion rate is modestly
suppressed with increasing Mach number. We discuss how our results may
influence modeling of the nano-Hz gravitational wave background, as well as
estimates of the LISA merger event rate.

source based on nanopatterned graphene (NPG) with a typical mobility of
CVD-grown graphene (up to $3000$ cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$), ensuring scalability
to large areas. For that, we solve the electrostatic problem of a conducting
hyperboloid with an elliptical wormhole in the presence of an in-plane electric
field. The localized surface plasmons (LSPs) on the NPG sheet allow for the
control and tuning of the thermal emission spectrum in the wavelength regime
from 3 $\mu$m to 12 $\mu$m. The LSPs along with an optical cavity increase the
emittance of graphene from about 2.3% for pristine graphene to 80% for NPG,
thereby outperforming state-of-the-art pristine graphene light sources
operating in the near-infrared (NIR) by a factor of 100. A maximum emission
power per area of 11x10^3 W/m$^2$ at $T=2000$ K for a bias voltage of $V=23$ V
is achieved by Joule heating. By generalizing Planck's theory and considering
the nonlocal fluctuation-dissipation theorem with nonlocal response of surface
plasmons in graphene in RPA, we show that the coherence length of the graphene
plasmons and the thermally emitted photons can be as large as 13 $\mu$m and 150
$\mu$m, respectively, providing the opportunity to create phased arrays. The
spatial phase variation of the coherence allows for beamsteering of the thermal
emission in the range between $12^\circ$ and $80^\circ$ by tuning the Fermi
energy. Our analysis of the nonlocal hydrodynamic response leads to the
conjecture that the diffusion length and viscosity in graphene are
frequency-dependent. Using finite-difference time domain (FDTD) calculations,
coupled mode theory, and RPA, we develop the model of a mid-IR light source
based on NPG, which will pave the way to graphene-based optical mid-IR
communication, mid-IR color displays, mid-IR spectroscopy, and virus detection.

SLIV), while this constraint leads to an emergence of the Nambu-Goldstone modes

gauge invariance in the theory is broken. At the same time, a crucial
difference with the two former cases is that the asymmetrical vacuum
corresponding to the lightlike Lorentz violation appears infinitely degenerated
with all other vacua including the symmetrical one. We show that this
degeneracy can be lifted out by introducing an extra gauge vector field being
sterile with respect to an ordinary matter, though having some potential
couplings with the basic $A_{\mu }$ field. A slight mixing of them makes the
underlying gauge invariance to be partially broken due to which physical
Lorentz invariance occurs broken as well. This may cause a variety of the

modeling of hydrodynamic force on particles in a particle-laden multiphase
flow. Results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) of
flow over a random array of stationary particles for eight combinations of
particle Reynolds number ($Re$) and volume fraction ($\phi$) are used in the
development of the models. The first approach follows a two step process. In
the first flow prediction step, the perturbation flow due to a particle is
obtained as an axisymmetric superposable wake using linear regression. In the
second force prediction step, the force on a particle is evaluated in terms of
the perturbation flow induced by all its neighbors using the generalized
Fax\'en form of the force expression. In the second approach, the force data on
all the particles from the PR-DNS simulations is used to develop an artificial
neural network (ANN) model for direct prediction of force on a particle. Due to
the unavoidable limitation on the number of fully resolved particles in the
PR-DNS simulations, direct force prediction with the ANN model tends to
over-fit the data and performs poorly in the prediction of test data. In
contrast, due to the millions of grid points used in the PR-DNS simulations,
accurate flow prediction is possible, which then allows accurate prediction of
particle force. This hybridization of multiphase physics and machine learning
is particularly important, since it blends the strength of each, and the
resulting pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model cannot be
developed by either physics or machine learning alone.

coordinated by cell polarity, which is determined by the non-uniform
distribution of certain proteins. Such protein patterns form via an interplay
of protein reactions and protein transport. Since Turing's seminal work, the
formation of protein patterns resulting from the interplay between reactions
and diffusive transport has been widely studied. Over the last few years,
increasing evidence shows that also advective transport, resulting from
cytosolic and cortical flows, is present in many cells. However, it remains
unclear how and whether these flows contribute to protein-pattern formation. To
address this question, we use a minimal model that conserves the total protein
mass to characterize the effects of cytosolic flow on pattern formation.
Combining a linear stability analysis with numerical simulations, we find that
membrane-bound protein patterns propagate against the direction of cytoplasmic
flow with a speed that is maximal for intermediate flow speed. We show that the
mechanism underlying this pattern propagation relies on a higher protein influx
on the upstream side of the pattern compared to the downstream side.
Furthermore, we find that cytosolic flow can change the membrane pattern
qualitatively from a peak pattern to a mesa pattern. Finally, our study shows
that a non-uniform flow profile can induce pattern formation by triggering a
regional lateral instability.

in such fractional Brownian motion based SDEs. In particular, we consider
asymptotic inference for two parameters in this regard; a multiplicative
parameter associated with the drift function, and the so-called ""Hurst

infinity. For unknown Hurst parameter, the likelihood does not lend itself
amenable to the popular Girsanov form, rendering usual asymptotic development
difficult. As such, we develop increasing domain infill asymptotic theory, by
discretizing the SDE. In this setup, we establish consistency and asymptotic
normality of the maximum likelihood estimators, as well as consistency and
asymptotic normality of the Bayesian posterior distributions. However,
classical or Bayesian asymptotic normality with respect to the Hurst parameter
could not be established. We supplement our theoretical investigations with
simulation studies in a non-asymptotic setup, prescribing suitable
methodologies for classical and Bayesian analyses of SDEs driven by fractional
Brownian motion. Applications to a real, close price data, along with
comparison with standard SDE driven by Wiener process, is also considered. As
expected, it turned out that our Bayesian fractional SDE triumphed over the
other model and methods, in both simulated and real data applications.

This flare activity was observed by the AIA on board SDO and the RHESSI. The
examination of photospheric magnetograms during the extended period, prior to
the event, suggests the successive development of a so-called 'anemone' type
magnetic configuration. NLFFF extrapolation reveals a fan-spine magnetic
configuration with the presence of a coronal null-point. We found that the

in the form of localized bright patches at two locations. A comparison of
locations and spatial structures of the pre-flare activity with magnetic
configuration of the corresponding region suggests onset of magnetic
reconnection at the null-point along with the low-atmosphere magnetic
reconnection caused by the emergence and the cancellation of the magnetic flux.
The main flare of M1.1 class is characterized by the formation of a
well-developed circular ribbon along with a region of remote brightening.
Remarkably, a set of relatively compact parallel ribbons formed inside the
periphery of the circular ribbon which developed lateral to the brightest part
of the circular ribbon. During the peak phase of the flare, a coronal jet is
observed at the north-east edge of the circular ribbon which suggests
interchange reconnection between large-scale field lines and low-lying closed
field lines. Our investigation suggests a combination of two distinct processes
in which ongoing pre-flare null-point reconnection gets further intensified as
the confined eruption along with jet activity proceeded from within the

  Microphones",,,,,"eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distant speech processing is a challenging task, especially when dealing with
the cocktail party effect. Sound source separation is thus often required as a
preprocessing step prior to speech recognition to improve the signal to
distortion ratio (SDR). Recently, a combination of beamforming and speech
separation networks have been proposed to improve the target source quality in
the direction of arrival of interest. However, with this type of approach, the
neural network needs to be trained in advance for a specific microphone array
geometry, which limits versatility when adding/removing microphones, or
changing the shape of the array. The solution presented in this paper is to
train a neural network on pairs of microphones with different spacing and
acoustic environmental conditions, and then use this network to estimate a
time-frequency mask from all the pairs of microphones forming the array with an
arbitrary shape. Using this mask, the target and noise covariance matrices can
be estimated, and then used to perform generalized eigenvalue (GEV)
beamforming. Results show that the proposed approach improves the SDR from 4.78
dB to 7.69 dB on average, for various microphone array geometries that
correspond to commercially available hardware.

  the ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures (SPAA) 2020",,,,"cs.DS cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present a new deterministic algorithm for distributed weighted all pairs
shortest paths (APSP) in both undirected and directed graphs. Our algorithm
runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ rounds in the Congest models on graphs with
arbitrary edge weights, and it improves on the previous $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$
bound of Agarwal et al. [ARKP18]. The main components of our new algorithm are
a new faster technique for constructing blocker set deterministically and a new
pipelined method for deterministically propagating distance values from source
nodes to the blocker set nodes in the network. Both of these techniques have
potential applications to other distributed algorithms.
  Our new deterministic algorithm for computing blocker set adapts the NC
approximate hypergraph set cover algorithm in [BRS94] to the distributed
construction of a blocker set. It follows the two-step process of first
designing a randomized algorithm that uses only pairwise independence, and then
derandomizes this algorithm using a sample space of linear size. This algorithm
runs in almost the same number of rounds as the initial step in our APSP
algorithm that computes $h$-hops shortest paths, and significantly improves on
the deterministic blocker set algorithms in [ARKP18, AR19] by removing an
additional $n\cdot |Q|$ term in the round bound, where Q is the blocker set.
  The other new component in our APSP algorithm is a deterministic pipelined
approach to propagate distance values from source nodes to blocker nodes. We
use a simple natural round-robin method for this step, and we show using a
suitable progress measure that it achieve the $\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ bound on the
number of rounds. It appears that the standard deterministic methods for
efficiently broadcasting multiple values, and for sending or receiving messages
using the routing schedule in [HPDG+19,LSP19] do not apply to this setting.

due to their diverse range of applications. The most well-known ones include
but are not limited to: volcanology, archaeology, civil engineering, nuclear
reactor monitoring, nuclear waste characterization, underground mapping, etc.
These methods are based on the attenuation or deviation of muons to image large
and/or dense objects where conventional techniques cannot work or their use
becomes challenging.
  In this context, we have constructed a muography telescope based on ""mini
glass-RPC planes"" following a design similar to the glass-RPC detectors
developed by the CALICE Collaboration and used by the TOMUVOL experiment in the
context of volcano radiography, but with smaller active area (16 $\times$ 16
cm$^{2}$). The compact size makes it an attractive choice with respect to other
detectors previously employed for imaging on similar scales. An important
innovation in this design is that the detectors are sealed. This makes the
detector more portable and solves the usual safety and logistic issues for gas
detectors operated underground and/or inside small rooms. This paper provides
an overview on our guiding principles, the detector development and our
operational experiences. Drawing on the lessons learnt from the first
prototype, we also discuss our future direction for an improved second
prototype, focusing primarily on a recently adopted serigraphy technique for
the resistive coating of the glass plates.

motility, growth, and evolution of cancer cells. We utilise simple simulations
of a population of individual cells in space to examine how changes in
mechanical properties of invasive cells and their surroundings can affect the
speed of cell migration. We also find that the growth rate of large lesions
depends weakly on the migration speed of escaping cells, and has stronger and
more complex dependencies on the rates of other stochastic processes in the
model, namely the rate at which cells transition to being motile and the
reverse rate at which cells cease to be motile.
  To examine how the rates of growth and evolution of an ensemble of cancerous
lesions depends on their geometry and underlying fitness landscape, we develop
an analytical framework in which the spatial structure is coarse grained and
the cancer treated as a continuously growing system with stochastic migration
events. Both approaches conclude that the whole ensemble can undergo
migration-driven exponential growth regardless of the dependence of size on
time of individual lesions, and that the relationship between growth rate and
rate of migration is determined by the geometrical constraints of individual
lesions. We also find that linear fitness landscapes result in
faster-than-exponential growth of the ensemble, and we can determine the
expected number of driver mutations present in several important cases of the
model.
  Finally, we study data from a clinical study of the effectiveness of a new
low-dose combined chemotherapy. This enables us to test some important
hypotheses about the growth rate of pancreatic cancers and the speed with which
evolution occurs in reality. Despite this, we find that the frequency of
resistant mutants is far too high to be explained without resorting to novel
mechanisms of cross-resistance to multiple drugs.

address these challenges, we first use an unsupervised alignment algorithm that
learns pairwise alignments between instructions of different recipes for the

multiple text and multiple video recipes for the same dish. We release the
Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus containing 150K pairwise
alignments between recipes across 4,262 dishes with rich commonsense

generalization of the classical graph Laplacian, where the edge weights are
allowed to take either sign. In the classical case, where the edge weights are
all positive, the Laplacian is positive semi-definite with the dimension of the
kernel representing the number of connected components of the graph. In many
applications one is interested in establishing conditions which guarantee the
positive semi-definiteness of the matrix. In this paper we present an
inequality on the eigenvalues of a weighted graph Laplacian (where the weights
need not have any particular sign) in terms of the first two moments of the
edge weights. This bound involves the eigenvalues of the equally weighted
Laplacian on the graph as well as the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of
the line graph (the edge-to-vertex dual graph). For a regular graph the bound
can be expressed entirely in terms of the second eigenvalue of the equally
weighted Laplacian, an object that has been extensively studied in connection
with expander graphs and spectral measures of graph connectivity. We present
several examples including Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs in the critical and
subcritical regimes, random large $d$-regular graphs, and the complete graph,
for which the inequalities here are tight.

progress has been made in designing sharding protocols that achieve throughput
scaling linearly in the number of nodes. However, existing protocols are not
robust to an adversary adaptively corrupting a fixed fraction of nodes. In this
paper, we propose Free2Shard -- a new architecture that achieves near-linear
scaling while being secure against a fully adaptive adversary.
  The focal point of this architecture is a dynamic self-allocation algorithm
that lets users allocate themselves to shards in response to adversarial
action, without requiring a central or cryptographic proof. This architecture
has several attractive features unusual for sharding protocols, including: (a)
the ability to handle the regime of large number of shards (relative to the
number of nodes); (b) heterogeneous shard demands; (c) requiring only a small
minority to follow the self-allocation; (d) asynchronous shard rotation; (e)
operation in a purely identity-free proof-of-work setting. The key technical
contribution is a deep mathematical connection to the classical work of
Blackwell in dynamic game theory.

speak, a genuine ""fact"" of the universe, a relativistic invariant. On the other
hand, since the dawn of quantum mechanics, there is no consensus on what the
theory is all about. The situation is admittedly subtler: quantum theory is
grounded on a complex vector space and the very notions of observer and
reference frame are controversial. Here we construct a theoretical framework
within which a given combination of quantum resources is shown to be a Galilean
invariant. To this end, we postulate a principle of relational symmetry between
""the observer"" and ""the observed"" and employ the notion of quantum reference
frame. Unitary transformations then follow that allow us to perceive the
physical resources seen from the viewpoint of any quantum system.
Interestingly, we find that one needs more than quantum coherence and quantum
correlations to prove quantum resources covariance. Finally, we show that the

imaging and spectral study on the null point of a fan-spine magnetic topology
during a solar flare. When magnetic reconnection occurs at the null point, the
fan-spine configuration brightens in the (extreme-)ultraviolet channels. In the
H$\alpha$ images, the fan-spine structure is partly filled and outlined by the
bi-directional material flows ejected from the reconnection site. The
extrapolated coronal magnetic field confirms the existence of the fan-spine
topology. Before and after the flare peak, the total velocity of the outflows
is estimated to be about 60 km s$^{-1}$. During the flare, the Si IV line
profile at the reconnection region is enhanced both in the blue-wing and
red-wing. At the flare peak time, the total velocity of the outflows is found
to be 144 km s$^{-1}$. Superposed on the Si IV profile, there are several deep
absorption lines with the blueshift of several tens of km s$^{-1}$. The reason
is inferred to be that the bright reconnection region observed in Si IV channel
is located under the cooler material appearing as dark features in the
H$\alpha$ line. The blueshifted absorption lines indicate the movement of the
cooler material toward the observer. The depth of the absorption lines also
depends on the amount of cooler material. These results imply that this kind of
spectral profiles can be used as a tool to diagnose the properties of cooler
material above reconnection site.

absorption corresponding to an abundance of log(H$_2$O) =
-2.71$^{+0.78}_{-1.05}$, and absorption compatible with an iron hydride
abundance of log(FeH)=$-5.25^{+0.88}_{-1.10}$, with an extended cloudy

state, and neutron star mergers, I discuss three projects related to transport
and nuclear matter in neutron star mergers. The first is the nature of beta
equilibrium in the portion of a merger that is transparent to neutrinos. We
calculate the weak interaction (Urca) rates and find that the beta equilibrium
condition needs to be modified by adding an additional chemical potential,
which changes slightly the particle content in neutrino-transparent beta
equilibrium. Secondly, we calculate the bulk viscosity in neutrino-transparent
nuclear matter in conditions encountered in neutron star mergers. Bulk
viscosity arises from a phase lag between the pressure and density in the
nuclear matter, which is due to the finite rate of beta equilibration. When
bulk viscosity is sufficiently strong, which happens when the equilibration
rate nearly matches the frequency of the density oscillation, it can noticeably
dampen the oscillation. We find that in certain thermodynamic conditions likely
encountered in mergers, oscillations in nuclear matter can be damped on
timescales on the order of 10 milliseconds, so we conclude that bulk viscosity
should be included in merger simulations. Finally, we study thermal transport
due to axions in neutron star mergers. We conclude that axions are never
trapped in mergers, but instead escape, carrying energy away from the merger.
We calculate the cooling time due to the energy carried away by axions and find
that within current constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling, axions could
cool fluid elements in mergers on timescales which could affect the dynamics of
the merger.

encountered when we attempted to mitigate serious traffic congestion occurring

that is able to (1) handle the traffic signal control when certain surveillance
cameras that retrieve information for reinforcement learning are down, (2)
learn from batch data without a traffic simulator, and (3) make control
decisions without shared information across intersections. We present a
two-stage framework to deal with the above-mentioned situations. The framework
can be decomposed into an Evolution Strategies approach that gives a fixed-time
traffic signal control schedule and a multi-agent off-policy reinforcement
learning that is capable of learning from batch data with the aid of three
proposed components, bounded action, batch augmentation, and surrogate reward
clipping. Our experiments show that the proposed framework reduces traffic
congestion by 36% in terms of waiting time compared with the currently used
fixed-time traffic signal plan. Furthermore, the framework requires only 600
queries to a simulator to achieve the result.

allows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and
forecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as
available, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be
weighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact
of idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological
data, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity. Algorithms to
optimize time-dependent NPI scenarios against user-defined cost functions are
included. PyRoss's current age-structured compartment framework for well-mixed
populations will in future reports be extended to include compartments
structured by location, occupation, use of travel networks and other attributes
relevant to assessing disease spread and the impact of NPIs. We argue that such
compartment models, by allowing social data of arbitrary granularity to be
combined with Bayesian parameter estimation for poorly-known disease variables,
could enable more powerful and robust prediction than other approaches to
detailed epidemic modelling. We invite others to use the PyRoss library for

denoising, it is often preferred to train one estimator and apply it to all
noise levels. The de facto training protocol to achieve this goal is to train
the estimator with noisy samples whose noise levels are uniformly distributed
across the range of interest. However, why should we allocate the samples
uniformly? Can we have more training samples that are less noisy, and fewer
samples that are more noisy? What is the optimal distribution? How do we obtain
such a distribution? The goal of this paper is to address this training sample
distribution problem from a minimax risk optimization perspective. We derive a
dual ascent algorithm to determine the optimal sampling distribution of which
the convergence is guaranteed as long as the set of admissible estimators is
closed and convex. For estimators with non-convex admissible sets such as deep
neural networks, our dual formulation converges to a solution of the convex
relaxation. We discuss how the algorithm can be implemented in practice. We
evaluate the algorithm on linear estimators and deep networks.

M64-GC1. This is the first globular cluster found in M64. The color-magnitude
diagram (CMD) of the resolved stars in M64-GC1 is well matched by 12 Gyr
isochrones with [Fe/H] $=-1.5\pm0.2$, showing that this cluster belongs to a
halo. The CMD of the resolved stars in the entire ACS field shows two
distinguishable red giant branches (RGBs): a curved metal-rich RGB and a
vertical metal-poor RGB. The metal-rich RGB represents an old metal-rich
([Fe/H] $\approx -0.4$) disk population. In contrast, the CMD of the metal-poor
RGB stars is very similar to the CMD of M64-GC1, showing that the metal-poor
RGB represents a halo population. The radial number density profile of the
metal-rich RGB stars is described by an exponential disk law, while the profile
of the metal-poor RGB stars is described by a de Vaucouleurs's law. From these,
we conclude that the origin of the Type III component in M64 is a halo which

elasticity, each dependent on only the first invariant of the left Cauchy-Green
strain tensor and having only two independent material constants. The models
are described as limited-stretch, or restricted elastic, because the strain
energy and stress response become infinite at a finite value of the first
invariant. These models describe well the limited stretch of the polymer chains
of which rubber is composed. We discuss Gent's model which is the simplest
limited-stretch model and agrees well with experiment. Various statistical
models are then described: the one-chain, three-chain, four-chain and
Arruda-Boyce eight-chain models, all of which involve the inverse Langevin
function. A numerical comparison between the three-chain and eight-chain models
is provided. Next, we compare various models which involve approximations to
the inverse Langevin function with the exact inverse Langevin function of the
eight-chain model. A new approximate model is proposed that is as simple as
Cohen's original model but significantly more accurate. We show that
effectively the eight-chain model may be regarded as a linear combination of
the neo-Hookean and Gent models. Treloar's model is shown to have about half
the percentage error of our new model but it is much more complicated. For
completeness a modified Treloar model is introduced but this is only slightly
more accurate than Treloar's original model. For the deformations of uniaxial
tension, biaxial tension, pure shear and simple shear we compare the accuracy
of these models, and that of Puso, with the eight-chain model by means of
graphs and a table. Our approximations compare extremely well with models
frequently used and described in the literature, having the smallest mean
percentage error over most of the range of the argument.

(CGM) gas around massive galaxies (M* > 10^11 Msun) at intermediate redshift
(z~0.5). We discover a significant abundance of small-scale, cold gas structure
in the CGM of 'red and dead' elliptical systems, as traced by neutral HI and
MgII. Halos can host tens of thousands of discrete absorbing cloudlets, with
sizes of order a kpc or smaller. With a Lagrangian tracer analysis, we show
that cold clouds form due to strong drho/rho >> 1 gas density perturbations
which stimulate thermal instability. These local overdensities trigger rapid
cooling from the hot virialized background medium at ~10^7 K to radiatively
inefficient ~10^4 K clouds, which act as cosmologically long-lived, 'stimulated
cooling' seeds in a regime where the global halo does not satisfy the classic
tcool/tff < 10 criterion. Furthermore, these small clouds are dominated by
magnetic rather than thermal pressure, with plasma beta << 1, suggesting that
magnetic fields may play an important role. The number and total mass of cold
clouds both increase with resolution, and the ~8x10^4 Msun cell mass of TNG50
enables the ~few hundred pc, small-scale CGM structure we observe to form.
Finally, we make a preliminary comparison against observations from the
COS-LRG, LRG-RDR, COS-Halos, and SDSS LRG surveys. We broadly find that our
recent, high-resolution cosmological simulations produce sufficiently high
covering fractions of extended, cold gas as observed to surround massive

these data confirm that the low states are the result of a drop in the mass
transfer rate between the secondary star and the magnetic white dwarf primary,
and are characterised by a decrease in the system's brightness coupled with a
change of the system's accretion structures from an accretion disc-fed geometry
to a combination of disc-fed and ballistic stream-fed accretion, and that
effects from accretion onto both magnetic poles become detectable. The failed
low state only displays a decrease in brightness, with the accretion geometry
remaining primarily disc-fed. We also find that the WD appears to be
exclusively accretion disc-fed during the high state. There is evidence for an
outflow close to the impact region between the ballistic stream and the disc
which is detectable in all of the states. Finally, there is marginal evidence
for narrow high velocity features in the H$\alpha$ emission line during the low

fully-convective M stars. Coherent photometric starspot signals on M dwarfs may
persist for hundreds of rotations, and the wavelength dependence of starspot RV
signals may not be consistent between stars due to differences in their
magnetic fields and active regions. We obtained precise multi-wavelength RVs of
four rapidly-rotating M dwarfs (AD Leo, G 227-22, GJ 1245B, GJ 3959) using the
near-infrared (NIR) Habitable-zone Planet Finder, and the optical Keck/HIRES
spectrometer. Our RVs are complemented by photometry from Kepler, TESS, and the
Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network of telescopes. We found that all four
stars exhibit large spot-induced Doppler signals at their rotation periods, and
investigated the longevity and optical-to-NIR chromaticity for these signals.
The phase curves remain coherent much longer than is typical for Sunlike stars.
Their chromaticity varies, and one star (GJ 3959) exhibits optical and NIR RV
modulation consistent in both phase and amplitude. In general, though, we find
that the NIR amplitudes are lower than their optical counterparts. We conclude
that starspot modulation for rapidly-rotating M stars frequently remains
coherent for hundreds of stellar rotations, and gives rise to Doppler signals
that, due to this coherence, may be mistaken for exoplanets.

including three hybrid pulsators, three eclipsing binaries, high frequency
modes in a Be star, and potential heat-driven pulsations in two Oe stars. We
identify stars for which future asteroseismic modelling is possible, provided
mode identification is achieved. By comparing the position of the variables to

observe the entire ejecta mass in X-rays for young SNRs, because the central

200 kilosecond Chandra observations of the Type Ia SNR G344.7-0.1, whose age is
old enough for the reverse shock to have reached the SNR center, providing an
opportunity to investigate the distribution of the entire ejecta mass. We
reveal a clear stratification of heavy elements with a centrally peaked
distribution of the Fe ejecta surrounded by intermediate-mass elements (IMEs:
Si, S, Ar Ca) with an arc-like structure. The centroid energy of the Fe K
emission is marginally lower in the central Fe-rich region than in the outer
IME-rich regions, suggesting that the Fe ejecta were shock-heated more
recently. These results are consistent with the prediction for standard SN Ia
models, where the heavier elements are synthesized in the interior of an
exploding white dwarf. We find, however, that the peak location of the Fe K
emission is slightly offset to the west with respect to the geometric center of
the SNR. This apparent asymmetry is likely due to the inhomogeneous density
distribution of the ambient medium, consistent with our radio observations of

shrink, the required control over systematic errors increases. Therefore,
models or approximations that were sufficiently accurate so far, may introduce
significant systematic biases in the parameter best-fit values and jeopardize
the robustness of cosmological analyses. We present a general expression to
estimate a priori the systematic error introduced in parameter inference due to
the use of insufficiently good approximations in the computation of the

Although this methodology can be applied to measurements of any scientific

galaxy power spectrum incorrectly. We also introduce Multi_CLASS, a new, public
modification of the Boltzmann code CLASS, which includes the possibility to
compute angular cross-power spectra for two different tracers. We find that
significant biases in most of the cosmological parameters are introduced if one
assumes the Limber approximation or neglects lensing magnification in modern

multi-tracer case, especially for the parameter controlling primordial
non-Gaussianity of the local type, $f_{\rm NL}$.

the quantum Hall regime is proximitized with superconductors that can be driven
to a topological phase with an external Zeeman field. In this regime, the
Majorana modes that emerge at the ends of each superconducting lead couple to
the chiral quantum Hall edge states. This produces distinguishable features in
the Andreev levels and Fraunhofer patterns that could help in detecting not
only the topological phase transition but also the spin degree of freedom of
these exotic quasiparticles. The current phase relation and the spectral
properties of the junction throughout the topological transition are fully
described by a numerical tight-binding calculation. In pursuance of the
understanding of these results, we develop a low-energy spinful model that
captures the main features of the numerical transport simulations in the
topological phase.

inertial frames. What role does the Principle of Equivalence play as regards
quantum gravitational effects in the local inertial frames? I address this
question here from a specific perspective. At mesoscopic scales close to, but
somewhat larger than, Planck length one could describe quantum spacetime and
matter in terms of an effective geometry. The key feature of such an effective
quantum geometry is the existence of a zero-point-length. When we proceed from
quantum geometry to quantum matter, the zero-point-length will introduce
corrections in the propagator for matter fields in a specific manner. On the
other hand, one cannot ignore the self-gravity of matter fields at the
mesoscopic scales and this will also modify the form of the propagator.
Consistency demands that, these two modifications - coming from two different
directions - are the same. I show that this non-trivial demand is actually
satisfied. Surprisingly, the Principle of Equivalence, operating at sub-Planck
scales, ensures this consistency in a subtle manner.

transverse momentum of the trigger photon due to parton energy loss but also
the enhancement of soft hadrons at small $z_\gamma$ and $z_{\rm

suppression of the fragmentation function, however, at large momentum fraction
$z_{\rm jet}$ relative to the transverse momentum of the reconstructed jet due
to trigger bias and medium modification of quark to gluon jet fraction. For

the trigger photon, the trigger bias can lead to enhancement of the jet

Numerous ongoing and upcoming missions are charting brightness fluctuations of

rotation period, evolutionary state (such as effective temperature and surface
gravity), and mass (via asteroseismic parameters). Here, we explore how well we
can predict these stellar properties, across different evolutionary states,
using only photometric time series data. To do this, we implement a
convolutional neural network, and with data-driven modeling we predict stellar
properties from light curves of various baselines and cadences. Based on a
single quarter of \textit{Kepler} data, we recover stellar properties,
including surface gravity for red giant stars (with an uncertainty of
$\lesssim$ 0.06 dex), and rotation period for main sequence stars (with an
uncertainty of $\lesssim$ 5.2 days, and unbiased from $\approx$5 to 40 days).
Shortening the \textit{Kepler} data to a 27-day TESS-like baseline, we recover
stellar properties with a small decrease in precision, $\sim$0.07 dex for log
$g$ and $\sim$5.5 days for $P_{\rm rot}$, unbiased from $\approx$5 to 35 days.
Our flexible data-driven approach leverages the full information content of the
data, requires minimal feature engineering, and can be generalized to other
surveys and datasets. This has the potential to provide stellar property
estimates for many millions of stars in current and future surveys.

strain tuning of its properties in thin-film form. In particular, at large
compressive strain, a supertetragonal (T) phase with giant polarization is
stabilized over the more common rhombohedral (R) structure. To utilize the
functionality of such metastable BFO phases in device applications, it is
essential to understand the ferroelectric phase evolution upon insertion in
nanoscale heterostructures. Here, we explore the emergence of ferroelectric
phases close to the morphotropic phase boundary in compressively strained BFO
during thin-film growth using in-situ optical second harmonic generation. We
find that the epitaxial films form at the growth temperature in the ideal T
phase without critical thickness for the polarization. Signatures of T-like and
R-like monoclinically distorted phases only appear upon sample cooling. We
furthermore demonstrate a robustness of single-domain polarization in the
high-temperature T phase during the growth of capacitor-like
metal|ferroelectric|metal heterostructures. Here, a reduction in tetragonality
of the T phase, rather than domain formation, lowers the electrostatic energy.
At this lower tetragonality, density-functional calculations and scanning
transmission electron microscopy point to the stabilization of a new metastable
R-like monoclinic structure upon cooling the heterostructure down to room
temperature. Our results thus show that the combination of strain and
electrostatic phase stabilization in BFO heterostructures yields a prominent
platform for exploring ferroelectric phases and realizing ultrathin
ferroelectric devices.

bifurcations. For cubic potentials this concerns the short axial orbits and in
galactic dynamics the resulting stable periodic orbits are called ""banana""
orbits. Galactic potentials are symmetric with respect to the co-ordinate
planes whence the potential -- and the normal form -- both have no cubic terms.
This $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry turns the 1:2 resonance into a
higher order resonance and one therefore also speaks of the 2:4 resonance. In
this paper we study the 2:4 resonance in its own right, not restricted to
natural Hamiltonian systems where $H = T + V$ would consist of kinetic and
(positional) potential energy. The short axial orbit then turns out to be

electron-phonon fluid, focusing on electronic transport under the conditions of
strong phonon drag. This regime occurs when the rate of phonon equilibration
due to e.g. umklapp scattering is much slower than the rate of normal
electron-phonon collisions. Then phonons and electrons form a coupled
out-of-equilibrium state where the total quasi-momentum of the electron-phonon
fluid is conserved. A joint flow-velocity emerges as a collective hydrodynamic
variable. We derive the equation of motion for this fluid from the underlying
microscopic kinetic theory and elucidate its effective viscosity and thermal
conductivity. In particular, we derive decay times of arbitrary harmonics of
the distribution function and reveal its corresponding super-diffusive
relaxation on the Fermi surface. We further consider several applications of
this theory to magneto-transport properties in the Hall-bar and Corbino-disk
geometries, relevant to experiments. In our analysis we allow for general
boundary conditions that cover the crossover from no-slip to no-stress flows.
Our approach also covers a crossover from the Stokes to the Ohmic regime under
the conditions of the Gurzhi effect. In addition, we consider the frequency
dependence of the surface impedance and non-equilibrium noise. For the latter,
we notice that in the diffusive regime, a Fokker-Planck approximation, applied
to the electron-phonon collision integral in the Eliashberg form, reduces it to
a differential operator with Burgers nonlinearity. As a result, the
non-equilibrium distribution function has a shock-wave structure in the energy

large number of optoelectronic applications, from solar cells to photodetectors
and light-emitting diodes, because of their excellent absorption, emission and
charge-transport properties. Unfortunately, their commercialization is still
hindered by an intrinsic instability towards classical environmental
conditions. Water in particular promotes fast decomposition, leading to a
drastic decrease in device performance. An innovative functional approach to
overcome this major issue could derive from integrating water-splitting active
species within charge extracting layers adjacent to the perovskite photoactive
layer, converting incoming water molecules into molecular oxygen and hydrogen
before they reach this last one, thus preserving device performance in time. In
this work we report for the first time on a perovskite-ancillary layer based on
CuSCN nanoplateletes dispersed in a p-type semiconducting polymeric matrix,
combining hole extraction/transport properties with good water-oxidation
activity, that transforms incoming water molecules and further triggers the in
situ p-doping of the conjugated polymer by means of the produced dioxygen,
further improving transport of photogenerated charges. This composite layer
enables the long-term stabilization of a mixed cation lead halide perovskite
within a direct solar cell architecture, maintaining a stable performance for
28 days in high-moisture simulated conditions. Our findings demonstrate that
the engineering of a hole extraction layer with water-splitting active
additives represent a valuable strategy to mitigate the degradation of
perovskite solar cells exposed to atmospheric humidity. A similar approach
could be employed in the future to improve stabilities of other optoelectronic

however, due to memory limitations they can only handle low-resolution inputs,
typically smaller than 1K. Meanwhile, the resolution of photos captured with
mobile devices increases up to 8K. Naive up-sampling of the low-resolution
inpainted result can merely yield a large yet blurry result. Whereas, adding a
high-frequency residual image onto the large blurry image can generate a sharp
result, rich in details and textures. Motivated by this, we propose a
Contextual Residual Aggregation (CRA) mechanism that can produce high-frequency
residuals for missing contents by weighted aggregating residuals from
contextual patches, thus only requiring a low-resolution prediction from the
network. Since convolutional layers of the neural network only need to operate
on low-resolution inputs and outputs, the cost of memory and computing power is
thus well suppressed. Moreover, the need for high-resolution training datasets
is alleviated. In our experiments, we train the proposed model on small images
with resolutions 512x512 and perform inference on high-resolution images,
achieving compelling inpainting quality. Our model can inpaint images as large
as 8K with considerable hole sizes, which is intractable with previous
learning-based approaches. We further elaborate on the light-weight design of
the network architecture, achieving real-time performance on 2K images on a GTX

different spaces using the interaction between a permanent magnet and a
magnetic material. The magnetic reluctance of the medium around the permanent
magnet is modulated to change the magnetic flux path. The nonlinear properties
of magnetic material as a critical phenomenon are used for effective
modulation. As a result, a time-variant field is generated by the modulation of
the permanent magnet flux. This non-resonant time-variant characterization
means that the transmitter is not bound to the fundamental limits of the
antennas and can transmit higher data rates. A prototype transmitter as a
prove-of-concept is designed and tested based on the proposed idea. Compared to
the rotating magnet, the prototyped transmitter can modulate $50\%$ of the
stored energy of the permanent magnet with much lower power consumption.

especially if the devices are dispersed over a large area. Thus, there is a
need for a reliable and scalable remote recovery mechanism that works even
after attackers have taken full control over devices, possibly misusing them or
trying to render them useless.
  To tackle this problem, we present Lazarus, a system that enables the remote
recovery of compromised IoT devices. With Lazarus, an IoT administrator can
remotely control the code running on IoT devices unconditionally and within a
guaranteed time bound. This makes recovery possible even in case of severe
corruption of the devices' software stack. We impose only minimal hardware
requirements, making Lazarus applicable even for low-end constrained
off-the-shelf IoT devices. We isolate Lazarus's minimal recovery trusted
computing base from untrusted software both in time and by using a trusted
execution environment. The temporal isolation prevents secrets from being
leaked through side-channels to untrusted software. Inside the trusted
execution environment, we place minimal functionality that constrains untrusted
software at runtime.
  We implement Lazarus on an ARM Cortex-M33-based microcontroller in a full
setup with an IoT hub, device provisioning and secure update functionality. Our
prototype can recover compromised embedded OSs and bare-metal applications and
prevents attackers from bricking devices, for example, through flash wear out.

of convex subsets of the symmetric group, we extend the study of balance
constants to convex subsets $C$ of any Coxeter group. Remarkably, we conjecture
that the lower bound of $1/3$ still applies in any finite Weyl group, with new

  We generalize several of the main results towards the $1/3$-$2/3$ Conjecture
to this new setting: we prove our conjecture when $C$ is a weak order interval

alternatives. In previous work we introduced an alternative picture for the
cosmological power spectra based on the nonperturbative features of the quantum
version of Einstein's gravity, instead of currently popular inflation models
based on scalar fields. The key ingredients in this new picture are the
appearance of a nontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate (directly related to
the observed cosmological constant), and a calculable renormalization group
running of Newton's G on cosmological scales. Results obtained previously were
largely based on a semi-analytical treatment, and often suffered from the
limitations of various approximations and simplifying assumptions. In this
work, we extend and refine our previous calculations by laying out an updated
and extended analysis, which now utilizes a set of suitably modified
state-of-the-art numerical programs (ISiTGR, MGCAMB and MGCLASS) developed for
observational cosmology. As a result, we are able to remove some of the
approximations employed in our previous studies, leading to a number of novel
and detailed physical predictions. These should help in potentially distinguish
the vacuum condensate picture of quantum gravity from that of other models such
as scalar field inflation. Here, besides the matter power spectrum P(k), we
work out in detail predictions for what are referred to as the TT, TE, EE, BB
angular spectra, as well as their closely related lensing spectra. However, the
current limited precision of observational data today (especially on large

metrics related to the response time of the flows. The input to the problem is
a sequence of flow requests on a switch, where the switch is represented by a
bipartite graph with a capacity on each vertex (or port), and a flow request is
an edge with associated demand. In each round, a subset of edges can be
scheduled subject to the constraint that the total demand of the scheduled
edges incident on any vertex is at most the capacity of the vertex. Previous
work has essentially settled the complexity of metrics based on {\em completion
time}. The objective of average or maximum {\em response time}, however, is
much more challenging.
  We present approximation algorithms for flow scheduling over a switch to
optimize response time based metrics. For the average response time metric,
whose NP-hardness follows directly from past work, we present an offline $O(1 +
O(\log(n))/c)$ approximation algorithm for unit flows, assuming that the port
capacities of the switch can be increased by a factor of $1 + c$, for any given
positive integer $c$. For the maximum response time metric, we first establish
that it is NP-hard to achieve an approximation factor of better than 4/3
without augmenting capacity. We then present an offline algorithm that achieves
{\em optimal maximum response time}, assuming the capacity of each port is
increased by at most $2 d_{max} - 1$, where $d_{max}$ is the maximum demand of
any flow. Both algorithms are based on linear programming relaxations. We also

Quantification), a novel approach to quantify fat fraction using asymmetries in
the phase-cycled bSSFP profile. Methods: SPARCQ uses phase-cycling to obtain
bSSFP frequency profiles, which display asymmetries in the presence of fat and
water at certain repetition times. For each voxel, the measured signal profile
is decomposed into a weighted sum of simulated profiles via multi-compartment
dictionary matching. Each dictionary entry represents a single-compartment
bSSFP profile with a specific off-resonance frequency and relaxation time
ratio. Using the results of dictionary matching, the fractions of the different
off-resonance components are extracted for each voxel, generating quantitative
maps of water and fat fraction and banding-artifact-free images for the entire
image volume. SPARCQ was validated using simulations, experiments in a
water-fat phantom and in knees of healthy volunteers. Experimental results were
compared with reference proton density fat fractions obtained with 1H-MRS
(phantoms) and with multiecho gradient-echo MRI (phantoms and volunteers).
SPARCQ repeatability was evaluated in six scan-rescan experiments. Results:
Simulations showed that fat fraction quantification is accurate and robust for
signal-to-noise ratios greater than 20. Phantom experiments demonstrated good
agreement between SPARCQ and gold standard fat fractions. In volunteers,
banding-artifact-free quantitative maps and water-fat-separated images obtained
with SPARCQ and ME-GRE demonstrated the expected contrast between fatty and
non-fatty tissues. The coefficient of repeatability of SPARCQ fat fraction was
0.0512. Conclusion: SPARCQ demonstrates potential for fat quantification using

  XXVII, SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing 2020",,"10.1117/12.2558091",,"eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a critical sensing technology that is
notably independent of the sensor-to-target distance and has numerous
cross-cutting applications, e.g., target recognition, mapping, surveillance,
oceanography, geology, forestry (biomass, deforestation), disaster monitoring
(volcano eruptions, oil spills, flooding), and infrastructure tracking (urban
growth, structure mapping). SAR uses a high-power antenna to illuminate target
locations with electromagnetic radiation, e.g., 10GHz radio waves, and
illuminated surface backscatter is sensed by the antenna which is then used to
generate images of structures. Real SAR data is difficult and costly to produce
and, for research, lacks a reliable source ground truth. This article proposes
a open source SAR simulator to compute phase histories for arbitrary 3D scenes
using newly available ray-tracing hardware made available commercially through
the NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards series. The OptiX GPU ray tracing library for
NVIDIA GPUs is used to calculate SAR phase histories at unprecedented
computational speeds. The simulation results are validated against existing SAR
simulation code for spotlight SAR illumination of point targets. The
computational performance of this approach provides orders of magnitude speed
increases over CPU simulation. An additional order of magnitude of GPU
acceleration when simulations are run on RTX GPUs which include hardware
specifically to accelerate OptiX ray tracing. The article describes the OptiX
simulator structure, processing framework and calculations that afford
execution on massively parallel GPU computation device. The shortcoming of the
OptiX library's restriction to single precision float representation is
discussed and modifications of sensitive calculations are proposed to reduce
truncation error thereby increasing the simulation accuracy under this
constraint.

to reveal a variety of wake structures generated for a range of aspect ratios
($sAR=0.5-4$), angles of attack ($\alpha=16^{\circ}-30^{\circ}$), and sweep
angles ($\Lambda=0^{\circ}-45^{\circ}$). Flows behind swept wings exhibit
increased complexity in their dynamical features compared to unswept-wing
wakes. For unswept wings, the wake dynamics are predominantly influenced by the
tip effects. Steady wakes are mainly limited to low-aspect-ratio wings.
Unsteady vortex shedding takes place near the midspan of higher-$AR$ wings due
to weakened downwash induced by the tip vortices. With increasing sweep angle,
the source of three dimensionality transitions from the tip to the midspan. A
pair of symmetric vortical structures forms along the two sides of the midspan,
imposing downward velocity upon each other in a manner similar to the downwash
induced by tip vortices. Such stabilizing midspan effects not only expand the
steady wake region to higher aspect ratios, but also enhance lift. At higher
aspect ratios, the midspan effects of swept wings diminish at outboard region,
allowing unsteady vortex shedding to develop near the tip. In the wakes of
highly swept wings, streamwise finger-like structures form repetitively along
the wing span, providing a stabilizing effect. The insights revealed from this
study can aid the design of high-lift devices and serve as a stepping stone for
understanding the complex wake dynamics at higher Reynolds numbers and those
generated by unsteady wing maneuvers.

treatment, the hazard ratio (an instantaneous measure) is often used to

interested in the difference in survival functions. We propose semiparametric
methods to estimate the causal effect of treatment among the treated with
respect to survival probability. The objective is to compare post-treatment
survival with the survival function that would have been observed in the
absence of treatment. For each patient, we compute a prognostic score (based on
the pre-treatment death hazard) and a propensity score (based on the treatment
hazard). Each treated patient is then matched with an alive, uncensored and
not-yet-treated patient with similar prognostic and/or propensity scores. The
experience of each treated and matched patient is weighted using a variant of
Inverse Probability of Censoring Weighting to account for the impact of
censoring. We propose estimators of the treatment-specific survival functions
(and their difference), computed through weighted Nelson-Aalen estimators.
Closed-form variance estimators are proposed which take into consideration the
potential replication of subjects across matched sets. The proposed methods are
evaluated through simulation, then applied to estimate the effect of kidney
transplantation on survival among end-stage renal disease patients using data

stabilization of nonlinear systems. To achieve this, we integrate Koopman
operator theory with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC). The main
idea is to transform nonlinear dynamics from state-space to function space
using Koopman eigenfunctions - for control affine systems this results in a
bilinear model in the (lifted) function space. Then, a predictive controller is
formulated in Koopman eigenfunction coordinates which uses an auxiliary Control
Lyapunov Function (CLF) based bounded controller as a constraint to ensure
stability of the Koopman system in the function space. Provided there exists a
continuously differentiable inverse mapping between the original state-space
and (lifted) function space, we show that the designed controller is capable of
translating the feedback stabilizability of the Koopman bilinear system to the
original nonlinear system. Remarkably, the feedback control design proposed in
this work remains completely data-driven and does not require any explicit
knowledge of the original system. Furthermore, due to the bilinear structure of
the Koopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark
numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control
design.

consisting of various classes of jobs. These classes differ in their arrival
rates, size distributions, and job parallelizability. With respect to
paralellizability, some jobs are elastic, meaning they can parallelize linearly
across many servers. Other jobs are inelastic, meaning they can only run on a
single server. Although job classes can differ drastically, they are typically
forced to share a single cluster. When sharing a cluster among heterogeneous
jobs, one must decide how to allocate servers to each job at every moment in
time. In this paper, we design and analyze allocation policies which aim to
minimize the mean response time across jobs, where a job's response time is the
time from when it arrives until it completes.
  We model this problem in a stochastic setting where each job may be elastic
or inelastic. Job sizes are drawn from exponential distributions, but are
unknown to the system. We show that, in the common case where elastic jobs are
larger on average than inelastic jobs, the optimal allocation policy is
Inelastic-First, giving inelastic jobs preemptive priority over elastic jobs.
We obtain this result by introducing a novel sample path argument. We also show
that there exist cases where Elastic-First (giving priority to elastic jobs)
performs better than Inelastic-First. We then provide the first analysis of
mean response time under both Elastic-First and Inelastic-First by leveraging
recent techniques for solving high-dimensional Markov chains.

adapting the conventional virtual memory framework to each possible system

non-trivial workarounds. To address these challenges, we propose a new virtual
memory framework, the Virtual Block Interface (VBI). We design VBI based on the
key idea that delegating memory management duties to hardware can reduce the
overheads and software complexity associated with virtual memory. VBI
introduces a set of variable-sized virtual blocks (VBs) to applications. Each
VB is a contiguous region of the globally-visible VBI address space, and an
application can allocate each semantically meaningful unit of information
(e.g., a data structure) in a separate VB. VBI decouples access protection from
memory allocation and address translation. While the OS controls which programs
have access to which VBs, dedicated hardware in the memory controller manages
the physical memory allocation and address translation of the VBs. This
approach enables several architectural optimizations to (1) efficiently and
flexibly cater to different and increasingly diverse system configurations, and
(2) eliminate key inefficiencies of conventional virtual memory. We demonstrate
the benefits of VBI with two important use cases: (1) reducing the overheads of
address translation (for both native execution and virtual machine
environments), as VBI reduces the number of translation requests and associated
memory accesses; and (2) two heterogeneous main memory architectures, where VBI
increases the effectiveness of managing fast memory regions. For both cases,
VBI significanttly improves performance over conventional virtual memory.

the structure and the dynamics on the attractors. With the aid of parameters,

estimating weights of individual participant profiles in a kidney exchange. We
first elicit from human subjects a list of patient attributes they consider

comparison queries between patient profiles and estimate weights in a

the nature of dark energy and an accurate value of the Hubble constant (H$_0$)

is necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the
use of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate
the utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will
be an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II
will be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy
Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and
spectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our
DES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method
(SCM), we construct the largest available Hubble diagram with SNe II in the
Hubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We
demonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardisation does not
reduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as
distance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their
utility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a
more standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate
more observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we

  Vehicle Communications","Licentiate thesis, Chalmers University of Technology",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Vehicle communication is one of the most important use cases in the fifth
generation of wireless networks (5G). The growing demand for quality of service
(QoS) characterized by performance metrics, such as spectrum efficiency, peak
data rate, and outage probability, is mainly limited by inaccurate
prediction/estimation of channel state information (CSI) of the rapidly
changing environment around moving vehicles. One way to increase the prediction
horizon of CSI in order to improve the QoS is deploying predictor antennas
(PAs). A PA system consists of two sets of antennas typically mounted on the
roof of a vehicle, where the PAs positioned at the front of the vehicle are
used to predict the CSI observed by the receive antennas (RAs) that are aligned
behind the PAs. In realistic PA systems, however, the actual benefit is
affected by a variety of factors, including spatial mismatch, antenna
utilization, temporal correlation of scattering environment, and CSI estimation
error. This thesis investigates different resource allocation schemes for the
PA systems under practical constraints.

enough to significantly deviate from sphericity ($\nu_* \sim$ 200--600 Hz). We
investigate the effects of rapid rotation on the observational appearance of a
NS. We propose analytical formulae relating gravitational mass and equatorial
radius of the rapidly rotating NS to the mass $M$ and radius $R$ of a
non-rotating NS of the same baryonic mass using accurate fully relativistic
computations. We compute spectra from an oblate rotating NS observed at
different inclination angles using the modified oblate Schwarzschild (MOS)
approximation, where light bending is computed in Schwarzschild metric, but
frame dragging and quadrupole moment of a NS are approximately accounted for in
the photon redshift calculations. We generalize the cooling tail method to the
case of a rapidly rotating NS to obtain the most probable values of $M$ and $R$
of the corresponding non-rotating NS with the same baryonic mass. We
approximate the local spectra from the NS surface by a diluted blackbody using
previously computed NS atmosphere models. We show that the NS radius could be
overestimated by 3--3.5 km for face-on stars of $R\approx 11$ km rotating at
$\nu_* =$ 700 Hz if the version of the cooling tail method for a non-rotating
NS is used. We apply the method to an X-ray burst observed from the NS rotating
at $\nu_* \approx$ 532 Hz in SAX J1810.8$-$2609. The resulting radius of the
non-rotating NS (assuming $M=1.5 M_\odot$) becomes $11.8\pm0.5$ km if it is
viewed at inclination i=60 deg and $R=11.2\pm0.5$ km for a face-on view, which
are smaller by 0.6 and 1.2 km than the radius obtained using standard cooling
tail method ignoring rotation. The corresponding equatorial radii of these
rapidly rotating NSs are 12.3$\pm 0.6$ km (for i=60 deg) and 11.6$\pm 0.6$\,km

confounding to obtain less biased effect estimates. However, we demonstrate
that alternative methods may give less biased estimates depending on the nature
of unmeasured confounding. Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g., physician
practices) are the most f6requently used instruments in instrumental variable
analyses (IVA). These preference-based IVAs are usually conducted on data
clustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured
confounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the
impact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in IVA, as
well as alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear
mixed models (LMM) and fixed effect models (FE) to study the effect of a
continuous exposure (e.g., treatment dose). We derive bias formulae of
estimators from these four methods in the presence of unmeasured within- and/or
between-cluster confounders. We show that IVAs can provide consistent estimates
when unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster
confounding exists. On the other hand, FEs and LMMs can provide consistent
estimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for
within-cluster confounding. Whether IVAs are advantageous in reducing bias over
FEs and LMMs depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding
relative to between-cluster confounding. Furthermore, the impact of unmeasured
between-cluster confounding on IVA estimates is larger than the impact of
unmeasured within-cluster confounding on FE and LMM estimates. We illustrate
these methods through data applications. Our findings provide guidance for
choosing appropriate methods to combat the dominant types of unmeasured

control UAV networks in an automated and scalable fashion in distributed,

control framework for UAV wireless networks based on distributed optimization
principles. In essence, SwarmControl provides the Network Operator (NO) with a
unified centralized abstraction of the networking and flight control
functionalities. High-level control directives are then automatically
decomposed and converted into distributed network control actions that are
executed through programmable software-radio protocol stacks. SwarmControl (i)
constructs a network control problem representation of the directives of the
NO; (ii) decomposes it into a set of distributed sub-problems; and (iii)
automatically generates numerical solution algorithms to be executed at
individual UAVs. We present a prototype of an SDR-based, fully reconfigurable
UAV network platform that implements the proposed control framework, based on
which we assess the effectiveness and flexibility of SwarmControl with
extensive flight experiments. Results indicate that the SwarmControl framework
enables swift reconfiguration of the network control functionalities, and it
can achieve an average throughput gain of 159% compared to the state-of-the-art

noise remediation to iteratively retrain a deployed model using
intelligently-chosen predictions from the model as the labels for new training
iterations. A key component of SUMER is the notion of error remediation as
self-labeled data can be susceptible to the propagation of errors. We
investigate the use of SUMER across various data sets and iterations. We find
that self-updating models (SUMs) generally perform better than models that do
not attempt to self-update when presented with additional previously-unseen
data. This performance gap is accentuated in cases where there is only limited
amounts of initial training data. We also find that the performance of SUMER is
generally better than the performance of SUMs, demonstrating a benefit in
applying error remediation. Consequently, SUMER can autonomously enhance the

measurements difficult. Here we explore the potential of using advanced
techniques in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) to non-destructively probe
irradiation damage at the surface of bulk materials. Electron channelling
contrast imaging (ECCI) is used to image nano-scale irradiation-induced defects
in 20 MeV self-ion irradiated tungsten, the main candidate material for fusion
reactor armour. The results show an evolution of the damage microstructure from
uniformly and randomly distributed nano-scale defects at 0.01 dpa (displacement
per atom) to string structures extending over hundreds of nanometres at 1 dpa.
Cross-correlation based high-resolution EBSD (HR-EBSD) is used to probe the
lattice strain fields associated with IIDs. While there is little strain
fluctuation at 0.01 dpa, significant heterogeneity in the lattice strains is
observed at 0.1 dpa, increasing with dose until saturation at 0.32 dpa. The
characteristic length scale of strain fluctuations is ~500 nm. Together, ECCI
and HR-EBSD reveal a transition from a structure where defects are disordered
to a structure with long-range order driven by elastic interactions between
pre-existing defects and new cascade damage. This study demonstrates that SEM
provides an attractive tool for rapid throughput, non-destructive, multi-scale

including a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic and a collapsed-tetragonal transition.
In particular, the widely-observed tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition is
believed to be a result of an electronic order that is coupled to the

is therefore a prominent feature of these materials, which signals the

yielded insights into the temporal behavior of such systems. However behavior
is influenced by context and environmental factors with a game-changing quality
(i.e., fitness maps are manipulated). This paper develops a principled
geometric approach to model and understand such influences by incorporating
replicator dynamics into a broader control-theoretic framework. Central to our
approach is the construction of a Lie algebra structure on the space of fitness
maps, mapping homomorphically to the Lie algebra of replicator vector fields.
This is akin to classical mechanics, where the Poisson bracket Lie algebra of
functions maps to associated Hamiltonian vector fields. We show, extending the
work of Svirezhev in 1972, that a trajectory of a replicator vector field is
the base integral curve of a solution to a Hamiltonian system defined on the
cotangent bundle of the simplex. Further, we exploit the Lie algebraic
structure of fitness maps to determine controllability properties of a class of

The merger rate densities of Pop III BBHs at $z=0$ ranges 3.34--21.2 $\rm
/yr/Gpc^3$ which is consistent with the aLIGO/aVIRGO result of 9.7--101 $\rm
/yr/Gpc^3$. These Pop III binaries might contribute to some part of the massive
BBH gravitational wave (GW) sources detected by aLIGO/aVIRGO. We also
calculated the redshift dependence of Pop III BBH mergers. We found that Pop
III low spin BBHs tend to merge at low redshift, while Pop III high spin BBHs
do at high redshift, which can be confirmed by future GW detectors such as ET,
CE, and DECIGO. These detectors can also check the redshift dependence of BBH
merger rate and spin distribution. Our results show that except for one model,
the mean effective spin $\left\langle \chi_{\rm eff} \right\rangle$ at $z=0$
ranges $0.02$--$0.3$ while at $z=10$ it does $0.16$--$0.64$. Therefore, massive
stellar-mass BBH detection by GWs will be a key for the stellar evolution study
in the early universe.

paper, we consider robust statistics in the presence of overwhelming outliers

unidentifiable. However, in their influential work, [CSV17] introduces a
polynomial time algorithm recovering the mean of distributions with bounded
covariance by outputting a succinct list of $O(1/\alpha)$ candidate solutions,
one of which is guaranteed to be close to the true distributional mean; a
direct analog of 'List Decoding' in the theory of error correcting codes. In
this work, we develop an algorithm for list decodable mean estimation in the

saddle-point optimization for which we design custom primal dual solvers for
generalized packing and covering SDP's under Ky-Fan norms, which may be of

retrieval of the fashion industry. Different from the matching in the general
domain, the fashion matching is required to pay much more attention to the
fine-grained information in the fashion images and texts. Pioneer approaches
detect the region of interests (i.e., RoIs) from images and use the RoI
embeddings as image representations. In general, RoIs tend to represent the
""object-level"" information in the fashion images, while fashion texts are prone
to describe more detailed information, e.g. styles, attributes. RoIs are thus
not fine-grained enough for fashion text and image matching. To this end, we
propose FashionBERT, which leverages patches as image features. With the
pre-trained BERT model as the backbone network, FashionBERT learns high level
representations of texts and images. Meanwhile, we propose an adaptive loss to
trade off multitask learning in the FashionBERT modeling. Two tasks (i.e., text

FashionBERT. On the public dataset, experiments demonstrate FashionBERT
achieves significant improvements in performances than the baseline and
state-of-the-art approaches. In practice, FashionBERT is applied in a concrete

(SARS-CoV-2) urgently calls for the design of drugs directed against this new
virus. Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease
Mpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against
SARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies
have identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro
inhibitors. Amongst these, Ebselen (2-Phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), a
glutathione peroxidase mimetic seleno-organic compound, is particularly
attractive. Recent experiments suggest that its effectiveness is higher than
that of other molecules that also act at the enzyme catalytic site. By relying
on extensive simulations with all-atom models, in this study we examine at a
molecular level the potential of Ebselen to decrease Mpro catalytic activity.
Our results indicate that Ebselen exhibits a distinct affinity for the
catalytic site cavity of Mpro. In addition, our molecular models reveal a
second, previously unkown binding site for Ebselen in the dimerization region
localized between the II and III domains of the protein. A detailed analysis of
the free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this
second binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic
site. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains
exerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access
through surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and
reconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could
interfere with normal enzymatic function. Taken together, these findings
provide a framework for the future design of more potent and specific Mpro
inhibitors, based on the Ebselen scaffold, that could lead to new therapeutic
strategies for COVID-19.

uses a Bernoulli distribution between PC images. The Bernoulli distribution is
derived from a stochastic model for the detector, which accurately represents
its noise characteristics. We show that our technique outperforms a previously
used GLRT method that relies on co-added images under a Gaussian noise
assumption and two detection algorithms based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
Furthermore, our method provides the maximum likelihood estimate of exoplanet
intensity and background intensity while doing detection. It can be applied
online, so it is possible to stop observations once a specified threshold is
reached, providing confidence for the existence (or absence) of planets. As a
result, the observation time is efficiently used. Besides the observation time,
the analysis of detection performance introduced in the paper also gives
quantitative guidance on the choice of imaging parameters, such as the
threshold. Lastly, though this work focuses on the example of detecting point

achieve quadratic approximation of conductance in the case of $p=2$ similar to
the Cheeger-type bounds of spectral methods, constant factor approximation when

off-policy} variants of MDPO, while emphasizing important design choices
motivated by the existing theory of MD in RL. We highlight the connections
between on-policy MDPO and two popular trust-region RL algorithms: TRPO and
PPO, and show that explicitly enforcing the trust-region constraint is in fact
{\em not} a necessity for high performance gains in TRPO. We then show how the
popular soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm can be derived by slight
modifications of off-policy MDPO. Overall, MDPO is derived from the MD
principles, offers a unified approach to viewing a number of popular RL
algorithms, and performs better than or on-par with TRPO, PPO, and SAC in a
number of continuous control tasks. Code is available at

Existing density map based methods excessively focus on the individuals'
localization which harms the crowd counting performance in highly congested

also ignored. In this paper, we propose Relevant Region Prediction (RRP) for
crowd counting, which consists of the Count Map and the Region Relation-Aware
Module (RRAM). Each pixel in the count map represents the number of heads
falling into the corresponding local area in the input image, which discards
the detailed spatial information and forces the network pay more attention to
counting rather than localizing individuals. Based on the Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN), Region Relation-Aware Module is proposed to capture and exploit
the important region dependency. The module builds a fully connected directed
graph between the regions of different density where each node (region) is
represented by weighted global pooled feature, and GCN is learned to map this
region graph to a set of relation-aware regions representations. Experimental
results on three datasets show that our method obviously outperforms other

momentum during the main sequence. We simulate the winds of Sun-like stars with
a range of rotation rates, covering the fast and slow magneto-rotator regimes,
including the transition between the two. We generalize an Alfv\'en-wave driven
solar wind model that builds on previous works by including the
magneto-centrifugal force explicitly. In this model, the surface-averaged open
magnetic flux is assumed to scale as $B_\ast f^{\rm open}_\ast \propto {\rm
Ro}^{-1.2}$, where $f^{\rm open}_\ast$ and ${\rm Ro}$ are the surface open-flux
filling factor and Rossby number, respectively. We find that, 1. the angular
momentum loss rate (torque) of the wind is described as $\tau_w \approx 2.59
\times 10^{30} {\rm \ erg} \ \left( \Omega_\ast / \Omega_\odot \right)^{2.82}$,
yielding a spin-down law $\Omega_\ast \propto t^{-0.55}$. 2. the mass-loss rate
saturates at $\dot{M}_w \sim 3.4 \times 10^{-14} M_\odot {\rm \ yr^{-1}}$, due
to the strong reflection and dissipation of Alfv\'en waves in the chromosphere.
This indicates that the chromosphere has a strong impact in connecting the
stellar surface and stellar wind. Meanwhile, the wind ram pressure scales as
$P_w \propto \Omega_\ast^{0.57}$, which is able to explain the lower-envelope
of the observed stellar winds by Wood et al. 3. the location of the Alfv\'en
radius is shown to scale in a way that is consistent with 1D analytic theory.
Additionally, the precise scaling of the Alfv\'en radius matches previous works
which used thermally-driven winds. Our results suggest that the Alfv\'en-wave
driven magnetic rotator wind plays a dominant role in the stellar spin-down
during the main-sequence.

polarization state of linearly polarized light at the single-photon level. The
detector array design is based on a division of focal plane sensor, in which
the orientation of each nanowire division (pixel) is offset by 45 degree. Each
single nanowire pixel operates as a combination of photon detector and almost
linear polarization filter, with an average polarization extinction ratio of
approximately 10. The total system detection efficiency with four pixels is
approximately 1% at a total dark count rate of 680 cps, when the detector array
is free-space coupled and illuminated with 1550 nm photons. The Stokes

feature-engineered models for the automated scoring of interactional and topic
development aspects of text dialog data. We conducted experiments on a
conversational database of text dialogs from human learners interacting with a
cloud-based dialog system, which were triple-scored along multiple dimensions

indispensable role in e-commerce, especially in shaping future sales and firm
equities. However, extant studies seldom examine their potential value for
sellers and producers in enhancing capabilities of providing better services
and products. For those who exploited the helpfulness of reviews in the view of
e-commerce keepers, the ranking approaches were developed for customers
instead. To fill this gap, in terms of combining description texts and emotion
polarities, the aim of the ranking method in this study is to provide the most
helpful negative reviews under a certain product attribute for online sellers
and producers. By applying a more reasonable evaluating procedure, experts with
related backgrounds are hired to vote for the ranking approaches. Our ranking
method turns out to be more reliable for ranking negative reviews for sellers
and producers, demonstrating a better performance than the baselines like BM25
with a result of 8% higher. In this paper, we also enrich the previous
understandings of emotions in valuing reviews. Specifically, it is surprisingly
found that positive emotions are more helpful rather than negative emotions in
ranking negative reviews. The unexpected strengthening from positive emotions
in ranking suggests that less polarized reviews on negative experience in fact
offer more rational feedbacks and thus more helpfulness to the sellers and
producers. The presented ranking method could provide e-commerce practitioners
with an efficient and effective way to leverage negative reviews from online

Quantum-OCT (QOCT), instead, employs the correlation properties of entangled

a joint-spectral amplitude with strict spectral anti-correlations. It has been

the blind signal processing area, an approach for jointly optimizing
dereverberation and source separation (DR+SS) has been proposed, however, this
approach requires huge computing cost, and has not been extended for
application to DN+DR+SS. To overcome the above limitations, this paper develops
new approaches for jointly optimizing DN+DR+SS in a computationally much more

a CBF for performing DN+DR+SS based on the maximum likelihood estimation, on an
assumption that the steering vectors of the target signals are given or can be
estimated, e.g., using a neural network. This paper refers to a CBF optimized
by this objective function as a weighted Minimum-Power Distortionless Response
(wMPDR) CBF. Then, we derive two algorithms for optimizing a wMPDR CBF based on
two different ways of factorizing a CBF into WPE filters and beamformers.
Experiments using noisy reverberant sound mixtures show that the proposed
optimization approaches greatly improve the performance of the speech
enhancement in comparison with the conventional cascade configuration in terms
of the signal distortion measures and ASR performance. It is also shown that
the proposed approaches can greatly reduce the computing cost with improved

simulations of unrestricted COVID-19 diffusion in 19 U.S cities, we conclude
that heterogeneity in population distribution can have large impacts on local
pandemic timing and severity, even when aggregate behavior at larger scales
mirrors a classic SIR-like pattern. Impacts observed include severe local
outbreaks with long lag time relative to the aggregate infection curve, and the
presence of numerous areas whose disease trajectories correlate poorly with
those of neighboring areas. A simple catchment model for hospital demand
illustrates potential implications for health care utilization, with
substantial disparities in the timing and extremity of impacts even without
distancing interventions. Likewise, analysis of social exposure to others who
are morbid or deceased shows considerable variation in how the epidemic can
appear to individuals on the ground, potentially affecting risk assessment and
compliance with mitigation measures. These results demonstrate the potential
for spatial network structure to generate highly non-uniform diffusion behavior

polarization response, which is seen to decrease with increasing ionic
strength. Comparison of the dielectric constant measured from polarization
response versus polarization fluctuations enables direct evaluation of the
dynamic contribution to this dielectric decrement, which we find to be small
but not insignificant. Using the constant $\mathbf{D}$ formulation, we also
rederive the Stillinger-Lovett conditions, which place strict constraints on
the coupling between solvent and ionic polarization fluctuations.

FS method from four candidate FS methods for any given dataset. This is
achieved by firstly constructing a large training data repository using data
synthesis. Six meta features that represent the characteristics of the training
dataset are then extracted. The best FS method for each of the training
datasets is used as the meta label. Both the meta features and the
corresponding meta labels are subsequently used to train a classification model
using a fuzzy similarity measure based framework. Finally the trained model is
used to recommend the most suitable FS method for a given unseen dataset. This
proposed method was evaluated based on eight public datasets of real-world
applications. It successfully recommended the best method for five datasets and
the second best method for one dataset, which outperformed any of the four
individual FS methods. Besides, the proposed method is computationally
efficient for algorithm selection, leading to negligible additional time for
the feature selection process. Thus, the paper contributes a novel method for
effectively recommending which feature selection method to use for any new

(DL) to generate virtual monochromatic CT (VMCT) images from a single-energy CT
(SECT) scan. Materials/Methods: The proposed data-driven VMCT imaging consists
of two steps: (i) using a supervised DL model trained with a large number of
100 kV and 140 kV dual-energy CT (DECT) image pairs to produce the
corresponding high-energy CT image from a low-energy image; and (ii)
reconstructing VMCT images with energy ranging from 40 to 150 keV. To evaluate
the performance of the method, we retrospectively studied 6,767 abdominal DECT
images. The VMCT images reconstructed using both DL-derived DECT (DL-DECT)
images and the images from DECT scanner were compared quantitatively.
Paired-sample t-tests were used for statistical analysis to show the
consistency and precision of calculated HU values. Results: Excellent agreement
was found between the DL-DECT and the ground truth DECT images (p values ranged
from 0.50 to 0.95). Noise reduction up to 68% (from 163 HU to 51 HU) was
achieved for DL-based VMCT imaging as compared to that obtained by using the
standard DECT. For the DL-based VMCT, the maximum iodine contrast-to-noise
ratio (CNR) for each patient (ranging from 15.1 to 16.6) was achieved at 40
keV. In addition to the enormous benefit of VMCT acquisition with merely a SECT
image, an improvement of CNR as high as 55% (from 10.7 to 16.6) was attained
with the proposed approach. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that
high-quality VMCT images can be obtained with only a SECT scan.

the example of the dynamics of social unrest. The model involves two

tension inhibiting and tension enhancing. These are characterized by
respectively a negative or a positivefeedback of the unrest on social tension.

development, the construction of such a brain atlas remains a significant
challenge. Moreover, using global intensity statistics leads to inaccurate
detection of major brain tissue classes due to substantial intensity variations
of MR signal within the constituent parts of early developing brain. In order
to overcome these methodological limitations we develop a local,
semi-supervised framework. It is based on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis
(KFDA) for pattern recognition, combined with an objective structural
similarity index (SSIM) for perceptual image quality assessment. The proposed
method performs optimal brain partitioning into subdomains having different

surfaces between the constituent brain parts. The classified image subdomains
are then stitched slice by slice via simulated annealing to form a global image

detection methods are offlline learning - the models are trained once using
historical data and used for all future predictions. In practice, new flight
data are accumulated continuously and analyzed every month at airlines.
Clustering such dynamically growing data is challenging for an offlline method
because it is memory and time intensive to re-train the model every time new
data come in. If the model is not re-trained, false alarms or missed detections
may increase since the model cannot reflect changes in data patterns. To
address this problem, we propose a novel incremental anomaly detection method
based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify common patterns and detect
outliers in flight operations from digital flight data. It is a probabilistic
clustering model of flight operations that can incrementally update its
clusters based on new data rather than to re-cluster all data from scratch. It
trains an initial GMM model based on historical offlline data. Then, it
continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model
parameters need to be saved. The proposed method was tested on three sets of
simulation data and two sets of real-world flight data. Compared with the
traditional offline GMM method, the proposed method can generate similar
clustering results with significantly reduced processing time (57 % - 99 % time
reduction in testing sets) and memory usage (91 % - 95 % memory usage reduction
in testing sets). Preliminary results indicate that the incremental learning
scheme is effective in dealing with dynamically growing data in flight data
analytics.

loop/arch that fans out from an X-ray jet. Using Hinode/EIS, we found that the
temperature increases with height to a value of over 10$^{7}$ K at the loop-top
during the flare. The measured Doppler velocity (redshifts of 100$-$500 km
s$^{-1}$) and the non-thermal velocity ($\geq$100 km s$^{-1}$) from Fe XXIV
also increase with loop height. The electron density increases from
$0.3\times10^{9}$ cm$^{-3}$ early in the flare rise to $1.3\times10^{9}$
cm$^{-3}$ after the flare peak. The 3-D structure of the loop derived with
STEREO/EUVI indicates that the strong redshift in the loop-top region is due to
upflowing plasma originating from the jet. Both hard X-ray and soft X-ray
emission from RHESSI were only seen as footpoint brightenings during the
impulsive phase of the flare, then, soft X-ray emission moves to the loop-top
in the decay phase. Based on the temperature and density measurements and
theoretical cooling models, the temperature evolution of the flare arch is
consistent with impulsive heating during the jet eruption followed by
conductive cooling via evaporation and minor prolonged heating in the top of
the fan loop. Investigating the magnetic field topology and squashing factor
map from SDO/HMI, we conclude that the observed magnetic-fan flaring arch is
mostly heated from low atmospheric reconnection accompanying the jet ejection,
instead of from reconnection above the arch as expected in the standard flare
model.

the contact angles of such mixtures on solid substrates are surprisingly large.
We experimentally reveal that the contact angle is determined by two separate

to support complicated tasks and to improve model accuracy. Correspondingly,
the amount of computations and required memory footprint increase as well.
Quantization is an efficient method to address such concerns by compressing
DNNs such that computations can be simplified while required storage footprint
is significantly reduced. Unfortunately, commercial CPUs and GPUs do not fully
support quantization because only fixed data transfers (such as 32 bits) are
allowed. As a result, even if weights are quantized into a few bits, CPUs and
GPUs cannot access multiple quantized weights without memory bandwidth waste.
Success of quantization in practice, hence, relies on an efficient computation
engine design, especially for matrix multiplication that is a basic computation
engine in most DNNs. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix multiplication
method, called BiQGEMM, dedicated to quantized DNNs. BiQGEMM can access
multiple quantized weights simultaneously in one instruction. In addition,
BiQGEMM pre-computes intermediate results that are highly redundant when
quantization leads to limited available computation space. Since pre-computed
values are stored in lookup tables and reused, BiQGEMM achieves lower amount of
overall computations. Our extensive experimental results show that BiQGEMM
presents higher performance than conventional schemes when DNNs are quantized.

Bayesian statistical framework which provides a posterior probability function

noise in the inputs, only in the observations. However, this is often not the
case in earth observation problems where an accurate assessment of the
measuring instrument error is typically available, and where there is huge
interest in characterizing the error propagation through the processing
pipeline. In this letter, we demonstrate how one can account for input noise
estimates using a GP model formulation which propagates the error terms using
the derivative of the predictive mean function. We analyze the resulting

periodically to send the measurement data. Conventionally, the wake-up function
is realized using a radio-frequency oscillator with an amplifier to recognize
an activating radio signal. Therefore, even during standby operation, the
sensor node utilizes a certain amount of energy, which can be critical for an
energy-harvesting source. In this study, we propose a novel approach of an
optical wake-up for autonomous sensor nodes, which employs a solar cell as a
wake-up signal detector. The bright light flash coming from another node or a
smartphone exposes a solar cell, which activates the sensor node. Unlike
photodiodes or RF-antennas, solar cells do not require any additional energy to
detect the light signal. Therefore, the proposed electric circuit allows the
sensor node to wake-up from a complete power-off state. The solar cell of the
novel wake-up receiver has a sensitive area of 8 mm x 10 mm. The wake-up signal
can be recognized from a maximal distance of 25 cm at ambient illumination from
0 to 1600 lx with a transmitter optical power of 20 mW. At power-off state the
power consumptions are the lowest among all existing off-the-shelf wake-up
receivers: 248 pW at 0 lx and 627 nW at 1600 lx.

and effectively estimates the performance of an architecture sampled from an

as it requires to train a large number of networks for evaluation, we propose a
Minimum Importance Pruning (MIP) approach. Given a dataset and a BPE search

subsequently prunes the minimum one from the next iteration. In this way, MIP
effectively prunes less important hyper-parameters to allocate more
computational resource on more important ones, thus achieving an effective
exploration. By combining BPE with various search algorithms including
reinforcement learning, evolution algorithm, random search, and differentiable

suitable prior specifications and inference methods to exploit its full

hyperparameter $\gamma_K$ of a symmetric Dirichlet prior on the weight
distribution depends on the number of components. We show that this model class
may be regarded as a Bayesian non-parametric mixture outside the class of
Gibbs-type priors. We emphasize the distinction between the number of
components $K$ of a mixture and the number of clusters $K_+$, i.e., the number
of filled components given the data. In the MFM model, $K_+$ is a random
variable and its prior depends on the prior on $K$ and on the hyperparameter
$\gamma_K$. We employ a flexible prior distribution for the number of
components $K$ and derive the corresponding prior on the number of clusters
$K_+$ for generalized MFMs. For posterior inference, we propose the novel
telescoping sampler which allows Bayesian inference for mixtures with arbitrary
component distributions without resorting to reversible jump Markov chain Monte

its edges. We give a recurrence relation and use it to obtain a (bivariate)

gives exact combinatorial expressions for $\mathbb{E}[X_n]$, which was stated
as an open problem by Yuster [\emph{Disc. Appl. Math.}, 2017]. We further
determine scaling constants in the limit laws for $X_n$. Define $\beta_{tr}(p)
:= \lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{\mathbb{E}[X_n]}{n-1}$. Using singularity analysis,
we show \[ \beta_{tr}(p) = \left(\sum_{n\geq 1}(1-p)^{{n\choose

less mode collapse compared to Wasserstein auto-encoder with generative
adversarial network (WAE-GAN). However, they are not very accurate in
approximating the target distribution in the latent space because they don't
have a discriminator to detect the minor difference between real and fake. To
this end, we develop a novel non-adversarial framework called Tessellated
Wasserstein Auto-encoders (TWAE) to tessellate the support of the target
distribution into a given number of regions by the centroidal Voronoi
tessellation (CVT) technique and design batches of data according to the
tessellation instead of random shuffling for accurate computation of
discrepancy. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the error of estimate to the
discrepancy decreases when the numbers of samples $n$ and regions $m$ of the
tessellation become larger with rates of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$ and
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}})$, respectively. Given fixed $n$ and $m$, a
necessary condition for the upper bound of measurement error to be minimized is
that the tessellation is the one determined by CVT. TWAE is very flexible to
different non-adversarial metrics and can substantially enhance their
generative performance in terms of Fr\'{e}chet inception distance (FID)

balance, we operationalize a new measure by utilizing semicycles that satisfy
the condition of transitivity. For subgroup-level balance, we propose measures
of cohesiveness (intra-group solidarity) and divisiveness (inter-group
antagonism) to capture balance within and among subgroups of the network using
the most fitting partition of nodes into two groups. For network-level balance,
we re-purpose the normalized line index to incorporate directionality, and
provide the proportion of edges whose position suits balance. Through extensive
computational analysis, we quantify and analyze patterns of social structure in
triads, subgroups, and the whole network across a range of social settings from
college students and Wikipedia editors to philosophers and Bitcoin traders. We
then apply our multilevel framework of analysis to examine balance in temporal

plane point sets. The extreme discrepancy is based on arbitrary rectangles as
test sets whereas the periodic discrepancy uses ""periodic intervals"", which can
be seen as intervals on the torus. The periodic $L_2$ discrepancy is, up to a
multiplicative factor, also known as diaphony. The main results are exact
formulas for these kinds of discrepancies for the Hammersley point set and for
rational lattices.
  In order to value the obtained results we also prove a general lower bound on
the extreme $L_2$ discrepancy for arbitrary point sets in dimension $d$, which
is of order of magnitude $(\log N)^{(d-1)/2}$, like the standard and periodic
$L_2$ discrepancies, respectively. Our results confirm that the extreme and
periodic $L_2$ discrepancies of the Hammersley point set are of best possible
asymptotic order of magnitude. This is in contrast to the standard $L_2$
discrepancy of the Hammersley point set. Furthermore our exact formulas show
that also the $L_2$ discrepancies of the Fibonacci lattice are of the optimal
order.
  We also prove that the extreme $L_2$ discrepancy is always dominated by the
standard $L_2$ discrepancy, a result that was already conjectured by Morokoff

characterization technique, has been extensively utilized to elucidate diverse
underlying physics of ferroelectricity. However, the intensive study of
conventional PFM has revealed a growing number of concerns and limitations
which are largely challenging its validity and application. Herein, we
developed a new advanced PFM technique, named Heterodyne Megasonic
Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (HM-PFM), which uniquely uses 106 to 108 Hz
high-frequency excitation and heterodyne method to measure the piezoelectric
strain at nanoscale. We report that HM-PFM can unambiguously provide standard
ferroelectric domain and hysteresis loop measurements, and an effective domain
characterization with excitation frequency up to ~110 MHz has been realized.
Most importantly, owing to the high-frequency and heterodyne scheme, the
contributions from both electrostatic force and electrochemical strain can be
significantly minimized in HM-PFM. Furthermore, a special difference-frequency
piezoresponse frequency spectrum (DFPFS) measurement is developed on HM-PFM and
a distinct DFPFS characteristic is observed on the materials with
piezoelectricity. It is believed that HM-PFM can be an excellent candidate for
the piezoelectric or ferroelectric studies where the conventional PFM results
are highly controversial.

der Waals were studied by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy
(STM/STS) techniques. By the STM method, the dark and light spots on the
surface were found, which intensities depend on the composition and
thermoelectric properties of solid solutions. The observed surface morphology
features in the solid solutions are explained by distortions of surface
electronic states originated by atomic substitutions, influence of doping
impurity, and formation of structural defects. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of
the morphology STM images of the (0001) surface were used to obtain the
interference patterns of the quasiparticles excitation caused by surface
electrons scattering by defects. The Dirac point energy and its fluctuations,
peak energies of surface defects, the positions of the valence and conduction
band edges, and the energy gap were determined from an analysis of tunneling
spectra. A correlation between the parameters of surface states of Dirac
fermions and thermoelectric properties was found. Thus, a contribution of the
fermions surface states increases with rise of the surface concentration in
solid solutions with high power factor, and the largest concentration value was
observed in the $Bi_{1.98}In_{0.02}Te_{2.85}Se_{0.15}$ composition. The
dependences of Fermi energy on the wave vector for different solid solutions
are described by a set of Dirac cone sections, which are close within the

attoclock, triggered a hot debate about the tunneling time, the role of time in
quantum mechanics, where the interaction with the laser pulse involves two
regimes of a different character, the multiphoton and the tunneling (field-)
ionization. In the adiabatic field calibration, one of us (O. K.) developed in
earlier works a real tunneling time model and showed that the model fits well
to the experimental data of Landsmann et al. (Optica {\bf 1}, 343 2014). In the
present work, it is shown that the model explains the experimental result in
the nonadiabatic field calibration, where one reaches a good agreement with the
experimental data of Hofmann et al. (J. of Mod. Opt. {\bf 66}, 1052, 2019).
Furthermore, we confirm the result with the numerical integration of the
time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation. The model is appealing because it offers
a clear picture of the multiphoton and tunneling field-ionization regimes. In
the nonadiabatic case (the nonadiabatic field calibration), the ionization is
mainly driven by multiphoton absorption. Surprisingly, at a field strength $F
\le F_a$ ($F_a$ is the atomic field strength) the model always predicts a time
delay with respect to the quantum limit $\tau_a$ at $F=F_a$. For an adiabatic
tunneling the saturation at the limit ($F=F_a$) explains the well-known Hartman
effect or Hartman paradox.

In
pragmatic settings of population protocols, self-stabilization is a highly
desired feature owing to its fault resilience and the benefit of initialization
freedom. However, the design of self-stabilizing leader election is possible
only under a strong assumption (i.e. the knowledge of the \emph{exact} size of
a network) and rich computational resources (i.e. the number of states).
Loose-stabilization, introduced by Sudo et al [Theoretical Computer Science,
2012], is a promising relaxed concept of self-stabilization to address the
aforementioned issue. Loose-stabilization guarantees that starting from any
configuration, the network will reach a safe configuration where a single
leader exists within a short time, and thereafter it will maintain the single
leader for a long time, but not forever. The main contribution of the paper is
a time-optimal loosely-stabilizing leader election protocol. While the shortest
convergence time achieved so far in loosely-stabilizing leader election is
$O(\log^3 n)$ parallel time, the proposed protocol with design parameter $\tau
\ge 1$ attains $O(\tau \log n)$ parallel convergence time and
$\Omega(n^{\tau})$ parallel holding time (i.e. the length of the period keeping
the unique leader), both in expectation. This protocol is time-optimal in the
sense of both the convergence and holding times in expectation because any
loosely-stabilizing leader election protocol with the same length of the
holding time is known to require $\Omega(\tau \log n)$ parallel time.

paper presents a route to school informational intervention that was developed
incorporating approaches and methods suggested in the literature for effective
behavioral interventions. The intervention was implemented using escorting
parents/guardians (N=104) of school children of Antwerp, Belgium to adopt
school routes with least exposure to pollutants. Collected data and its
analysis revealed that 60% participants (N= 62) could benefit themselves by
adopting the suggested cleanest routes to school, of whom a significant
proportion of participants (i.e. 34%, N= 35) have a difference of average NO2
concentration between the alternative and current route of around 10{\mu}g/m3.
This information about alternatives routes with their potential benefits was
presented to each participant via defined study protocols. 18 Based on the
feedback of participants that could potentially adopt suggested alternatives,
77% (N=48) have switched their routes. These results indicated that
intervention was effective, and it can bring higher benefits when implemented

we mimic a super-resolution case for the reconstructed image, in analogy to the
well-known STED technique in microscopy. The combination of multiple

known background is added to provide a phase reference. To characterize these
photonic quantum states, the complete phase wavefront is reconstructed through
a phase-shifting technique. Combined with a multipixel detector, the
acquisition can be parallelized, and only four interferograms are required to
reconstruct any pure qudit, independently of the dimension $d$. We tested the
method experimentally, for reconstructing states of dimension $d=6$ randomly

an experimental scheme that allows to estimate phase aberrations affecting the

sophisticated network structures and loss functions, showing impressive
performances. This paper provides a new insight on conventional SISR algorithm,
and proposes a substantially different approach relying on the iterative
optimization. A novel iterative super-resolution network (ISRN) is proposed on
top of the iterative optimization. We first analyze the observation model of
image SR problem, inspiring a feasible solution by mimicking and fusing each
iteration in a more general and efficient manner. Considering the drawbacks of
batch normalization, we propose a feature normalization (F-Norm, FN) method to
regulate the features in network. Furthermore, a novel block with FN is
developed to improve the network representation, termed as FNB.
Residual-in-residual structure is proposed to form a very deep network, which
groups FNBs with a long skip connection for better information delivery and
stabling the training phase. Extensive experimental results on testing
benchmarks with bicubic (BI) degradation show our ISRN can not only recover
more structural information, but also achieve competitive or better PSNR/SSIM
results with much fewer parameters compared to other works. Besides BI, we
simulate the real-world degradation with blur-downscale (BD) and
downscale-noise (DN). ISRN and its extension ISRN+ both achieve better
performance than others with BD and DN degradation models.

inhomogeneities on the spin-wave signals transmitted through thin films. We use
micromagnetic simulations to study the spin-wave dynamics in an in-plane
magnetized yttrium iron garnet thin film with a thickness in the nanometre
range in the presence of surface defects in the form of locally introduced
uniaxial anisotropies. These defects are used to demonstrate that the Backward
Volume Magnetostatic Spin Waves (BVMSW) are more responsive to backscattering
in comparison to Magnetostatic Surface Spin Waves (MSSWs). For this particular
defect type, the reason for this behavior can be quantitatively related to the
difference in the magnon band structures for the two types of spin waves. To
demonstrate this, we develop a quasi-analytical theory for the scattering
process. It shows an excellent agreement with the micromagnetic simulations,
sheds light on the backscattering processes and provides a new way to analyze
the spin-wave transmission rates in the presence of surface inhomogeneities in
sufficiently thin films, for which the role of exchange energy in the spin-wave
dynamics is significant. Our study paves the way to designing magnonic logic

mixture distribution of a small set of (simpler) distributions shared across
all states. Using tied-mixture observation distributions offers several
advantages. The mixtures act as a regularization for typically very sparse
problems, and they reduce the computational effort for the learning algorithm
since there are fewer distributions to be found. Using shared mixtures enables
sharing of statistical strength between the Markov states and thus transfer

that the Floquet Hamiltonian describing the Haldane model at stroboscopic

establish that in the stroboscopic steady state, the system reaches a thermal
state of the Floquet Hamiltonian at a controlled temperature. Further, it is
observed that even with a coupling to a quasi-local bath, remarkably a Chern
insulator can indeed be prepared in a Chern non-trivial pure steady state which
is expected to exhibit a stroboscopic bulk-boundary correspondence. Using the
non-uniqueness of the macroscopic bulk electric polarisation of a Chern
insulator in its topological phase, we propose a generalised Chern invariant
that reflects the topology of out-of-equilibrium many-body stroboscopic states
of the Haldane model even in a dissipative ambience. The generalised topology

However, the detection of oriented and densely packed objects remains
challenging because of following inherent reasons: (1) receptive fields of
neurons are all axis-aligned and of the same shape, whereas objects are usually
of diverse shapes and align along various directions; (2) detection models are
typically trained with generic knowledge and may not generalize well to handle
specific objects at test time; (3) the limited dataset hinders the development
on this task. To resolve the first two issues, we present a dynamic refinement
network that consists of two novel components, i.e., a feature selection module
(FSM) and a dynamic refinement head (DRH). Our FSM enables neurons to adjust
receptive fields in accordance with the shapes and orientations of target
objects, whereas the DRH empowers our model to refine the prediction
dynamically in an object-aware manner. To address the limited availability of
related benchmarks, we collect an extensive and fully annotated dataset,
namely, SKU110K-R, which is relabeled with oriented bounding boxes based on
SKU110K. We perform quantitative evaluations on several publicly available
benchmarks including DOTA, HRSC2016, SKU110K, and our own SKU110K-R dataset.
Experimental results show that our method achieves consistent and substantial
gains compared with baseline approaches. The code and dataset are available at

(SVC) modeling, which is popular in spatial statistics, non-spatially varying
coefficients (NVC) modeling has largely been unexplored in spatial fields.
Nevertheless, as we will explain, consideration of non-spatial variation is
needed not only to improve model accuracy but also to reduce spurious
correlation among varying coefficients, which is a major problem in SVC
modeling. We consider a Moran eigenvector approach modeling spatially and
non-spatially varying coefficients (S&NVC). A Monte Carlo simulation experiment
comparing our S&NVC model with existing SVC models suggests both modeling
accuracy and computational efficiency for our approach. Beyond that, somewhat
surprisingly, our approach identifies true and spurious correlations among
coefficients nearly perfectly, even when usual SVC models suffer from severe
spurious correlations. It implies that S&NVC model should be used even when the
analysis purpose is modeling SVCs. Finally, our S&NVC model is employed to
analyze a residential land price dataset. Its results suggest existence of both
spatial and non-spatial variation in regression coefficients in practice. The
S&NVC model is now implemented in the R package spmoran.

originate from accretion disc winds accelerated to more than 10 per cent of the

to or even drive galaxy-scale feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN).
However, the UFO spectral features are often weak due to high ionisation of the
outflowing material, and the inference of the wind physical properties can be
complicated by other spectral features in AGN such as relativistic reflection.
Here we study a highly accreting Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy PG 1448+273. We
apply an automated, systematic routine for detecting outflows in accreting
systems and achieve an unambiguous detection of a UFO in this AGN. The UFO
absorption is observed in both soft and hard X-ray bands with the XMM-Newton
observatory. The velocity of the outflow is (26900 +- 600) km/s (~0.09c), with
an ionisation parameter of log ({\xi} / erg cm s^-1)=4.03_{-0.08}^{+0.10} and a
column density above 10^23 cm^-2. At the same time, we detect weak warm
absorption features in the spectrum of the object. Our systematic outflow
search suggests the presence of further multi-phase wind structure, but we
cannot claim a significant detection considering the present data quality. The

correspondence, where the quantum fluctuations of an asymptotically AdS space

the AdS/CFT case. I focus on the case of quasi-local holography, i.e. for a
bounded region of space-time with a boundary at a finite distance. The
objective is to clarify the bulk-boundary relation in quantum gravity described
by the Ponzano-Regge model, defining a model for 3D gravity via a discrete path
integral.
  I present the first perturbative and exact computations of the Ponzano-Regge

general framework for the 3D amplitude in terms of the 2D boundary state, I
consider the 2D torus case, with application in the study of the thermodynamics
of the BTZ black hole. First, the 2D boundary is described by a coherent spin
network state in the semi-classical regime. The stationary phase approximation
allows to recover in the asymptotic limit the usual amplitude for 3D quantum
gravity as the character of the symmetry of asymptotically flat gravity, the
BMS group. Then I introduce a new type of coherent boundary state, which allows
an exact evaluation of the amplitude for 3D quantum gravity. I obtain a complex
regularization of the BMS character. The possibility of this exact computation
suggests the existence of a (quasi)-integrable structure, linked to the
symmetries of 3D quantum gravity with 2D finite boundary.

continuous system with multi-agent interactions. This continuous system
features various types of traffic agents (non-homogeneous) governed by
continuous-motion ordinary differential equations (differential-drive). Each
agent makes decisions independently that may lead to conflicts with the subject
vehicle (SV), as well as other participants (non-cooperative). A typical
vehicle safety evaluation procedure that uses various safety-critical scenarios
and observes resultant collisions (or near collisions), is not sufficient
enough to evaluate the performance of the ADS in terms of operational safety
status maintenance. In this paper, we introduce a Model Predictive
Instantaneous Safety Metric (MPrISM), which determines the safety status of the
SV, considering the worst-case safety scenario for a given traffic snapshot.
The method then analyzes the SV's closeness to a potential collision within a
certain evaluation time period. The described metric induces theoretical
guarantees of safety in terms of the time to collision under standard
assumptions. Through formulating the solution as a series of minimax quadratic
optimization problems of a specific structure, the method is tractable for
real-time safety evaluation applications. Its capabilities are demonstrated
with synthesized examples and cases derived from real-world tests.

recently, statistical physicists started to explore more complex forms of data,
such as equally-labelled points lying on (possibly low dimensional) object
manifolds. Here we provide a bridge between this recently-established research
area and the framework of statistical learning theory, a branch of mathematics
devoted to inference in machine learning. The overarching motivation is the
inadequacy of the classic rigorous results in explaining the remarkable
generalization properties of deep learning. We propose a way to integrate
physical models of data into statistical learning theory, and address, with
both combinatorial and statistical mechanics methods, the computation of the
Vapnik-Chervonenkis entropy, which counts the number of different binary
classifications compatible with the loss class. As a proof of concept, we focus
on kernel machines and on two simple realizations of data structure introduced
in recent physics literature: $k$-dimensional simplexes with prescribed
geometric relations and spherical manifolds (equivalent to margin
classification). Entropy, contrary to what happens for unstructured data, is
nonmonotonic in the sample size, in contrast with the rigorous bounds.
Moreover, data structure induces a novel transition beyond the storage
capacity, which we advocate as a proxy of the nonmonotonicity, and ultimately a
cue of low generalization error. The identification of a synaptic volume
vanishing at the transition allows a quantification of the impact of data
structure within replica theory, applicable in cases where combinatorial
methods are not available, as we demonstrate for margin learning.

approximates the trace of a large-scale matrix $B$ by computing the average of

positive definite (SPD) but a number of applications give rise to indefinite
$B$. Most notably, this is the case for log-determinant estimation, a task that
features prominently in statistical learning, for instance in maximum

These bounds significantly improve existing results for indefinite $B$,
reducing the the number of required samples by a factor $n$ or even more, where
$n$ is the size of $B$. Even for an SPD matrix, our work improves an existing

Alternatively, at fixed $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ metallicity increases as increasing

database systems, and the best studied in the literature. A seminal result of
Grohe, Schwentick, and Segoufin (STOC 2001) demonstrates that for every class
$G$ of graphs, the evaluation of all conjunctive queries whose underlying graph
is in $G$ is tractable if, and only if, $G$ has bounded treewidth. In this
work, we extend this characterization to the counting problem for conjunctive
queries. Specifically, for every class $C$ of conjunctive queries with bounded
treewidth, we introduce the first fully polynomial-time randomized
approximation scheme (FPRAS) for counting answers to a query in $C$, and the
first polynomial-time algorithm for sampling answers uniformly from a query in
$C$. As a corollary, it follows that for every class $G$ of graphs, the
counting problem for conjunctive queries whose underlying graph is in $G$
admits an FPRAS if, and only if, $G$ has bounded treewidth (unless $\text{BPP}
\neq \text{P}$)}. In fact, our FPRAS is more general, and also applies to
conjunctive queries with bounded hypertree width, as well as unions of such
queries.
  The key ingredient in our proof is the resolution of a fundamental counting
problem from automata theory. Specifically, we demonstrate the first FPRAS and
polynomial time sampler for the set of trees of size $n$ accepted by a tree
automaton, which improves the prior quasi-polynomial time randomized
approximation scheme (QPRAS) and sampling algorithm of Gore, Jerrum, Kannan,
Sweedyk, and Mahaney '97. We demonstrate how this algorithm can be used to
obtain an FPRAS for many hitherto open problems, such as counting solutions to
constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) with bounded hypertree-width, counting
the number of error threads in programs with nested call subroutines, and
counting valid assignments to structured DNNF circuits.

  Prior Images","10 pages, 9 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image reconstruction from insufficient data is common in computed tomography
(CT), e.g., image reconstruction from truncated data, limited-angle data and
sparse-view data. Deep learning has achieved impressive results in this field.
However, the robustness of deep learning methods is still a concern for
clinical applications due to the following two challenges: a) With limited
access to sufficient training data, a learned deep learning model may not
generalize well to unseen data; b) Deep learning models are sensitive to noise.
Therefore, the quality of images processed by neural networks only may be
inadequate. In this work, we investigate the robustness of deep learning in CT
image reconstruction by showing false negative and false positive lesion cases.
Since learning-based images with incorrect structures are likely not consistent
with measured projection data, we propose a data consistent reconstruction
(DCR) method to improve their image quality, which combines the advantages of
compressed sensing and deep learning: First, a prior image is generated by deep
learning. Afterwards, unmeasured projection data are inpainted by forward
projection of the prior image. Finally, iterative reconstruction with
reweighted total variation regularization is applied, integrating data
consistency for measured data and learned prior information for missing data.
The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in cone-beam CT with
truncated data, limited-angle data and sparse-view data, respectively. For
example, for truncated data, DCR achieves a mean root-mean-square error of 24
HU and a mean structure similarity index of 0.999 inside the field-of-view for
different patients in the noisy case, while the state-of-the-art U-Net method
achieves 55 HU and 0.995 respectively for these two metrics.

systematically evaluate several methods on five benchmark datasets using
multiple complementary performance metrics. Our experiments show that none of
the methods we tested is unequivocally superior to all others, and none
produces a particularly reliable ranking of errors across multiple datasets.
While we believe these results show that existing UQ methods are not sufficient

conclude with a practical recommendation as to which existing techniques seem

depressions or abnormal chemical concentrations). We show that the criteria
commonly used for determining which locations the UAV should visit are
ill-suited for this task. We introduce a number of novel criteria that guide
the UAV towards regions of strong anomalies by leveraging previously collected
information in a mathematically elegant and computationally tractable manner.
We demonstrate superiority of the proposed approach in several applications,
including reconstruction of seafloor topography from real-world bathymetry
data, as well as tracking of dynamic anomalies. A particularly attractive
property of our approach is its ability to overcome adversarial conditions,
that is, situations in which prior beliefs about the locations of the extremes
are imprecise or erroneous.

factor to improve word error rate in both cases is the use of an external

integration is straightforward with the clear separation of acoustic model and
language model in classical HMM-based modeling. In contrast, multiple
integration schemes have been proposed for attention models. In this work, we
present a novel method for language model integration into implicit-alignment
based sequence-to-sequence models. Log-linear model combination of acoustic and
language model is performed with a per-token renormalization. This allows us to
compute the full normalization term efficiently both in training and in
testing. This is compared to a global renormalization scheme which is
equivalent to applying shallow fusion in training. The proposed methods show
good improvements over standard model combination (shallow fusion) on our

on previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell
co-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy
against progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this
hypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we
generated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a
CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated
with COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many
of the biological processes that have been consistently associated with
COVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including
the downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous
transcriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the
response to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by
COVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a
significant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+
antigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production. Our

source-free volumes. To facilitate the use of surface currents in
magneto-quasistatic problems, we have implemented a set of computational tools
in a Python package named bfieldtools. In this work, we describe the physical
and computational principles of this toolset. To be able to work with surface
currents of arbitrary shape, we discretize the currents on triangle meshes
using piecewise-linear stream functions. We apply analytical discretizations of
integral equations to obtain the magnetic field and potentials associated with
the discrete stream function. In addition, we describe the computation of the
spherical multipole expansion and a novel surface-harmonic expansion for
surface currents, both of which are useful for representing the magnetic field
in source-free volumes with a small number of parameters. Last, we share
examples related to magnetic shielding and surface-coil design using the
presented tools.

that, in the absence of a legitimate RIS, transceiver spatial filtering and AN

Lower bounds of achievable rates for both D2D users (DUEs) and CF-mMIMO users

information. Next, in order to reduce pilot contamination, greedy and graph
coloring-based pilot allocation algorithms are proposed and analyzed for the

performance, two power control strategies are designed and their complexity and
convergence are also discussed. The first power control strategy aims at
maximizing CFUEs' sum spectral efficiency (SE) subject to quality of service
constraints on DUEs, while the second one maximizes the weighted product of
CFUEs' and DUEs' signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratios (SINRs). Numerical
results show that the proposed pilot and power allocations bring a considerable
improvement to the network SE. Also, it is revealed that the activation of D2D

offloading ensured by the D2D links overcomes the increased interference

Cholesky decomposition requires initial positive definite mode coupling

It is possible to force a decomposition where the range of the partner is
reduced but the characteristic supersymmetric intertwining is lost. As an
example, we construct the Cholesky isospectral partner and the square root of a

into nanopores partly suppresses crystallization and allows us to perform
measurements of supercooled water below 235 K, i.e. in water's so called ""no

around T1 = 145 K (P1) and T2 = 205 K (P2) for Gelsil 2.6 nm and Gelsil 5 nm at
0.2 Hz. Both peaks shift to higher T with increasing pore size d and change
with f in a systematic way, typical of an Arrhenius behaviour of the
corresponding relaxation times. For P1 we obtain an average activation energy
of Ea=0.47 eV, in good agreement with literature values. It is suggested that
P1 corresponds to the glass transition of supercooled water far from pore
walls, whereas P2 reflects the dynamics of water molecules near the surface of
the pores. The observation of a pronounced softening of the Young's modulus
around 165 K (for Gelsil 2.6 nm at 0.2 Hz) is in agreement with a
glass-to-liquid transition in the vicinity of P1. In addition we find a
clear-cut 1=d-dependence of the calculated glass transition temperatures which
extrapolates to Tg(1/d=0)=136 K, i.e. the traditional value of water.

learning to rank, one is interested in optimising the global ordering of a list
of items according to their utility for users.Popular approaches learn a
scoring function that scores items individually (i.e. without the context of
other items in the list) by optimising a pointwise, pairwise or listwise loss.
The list is then sorted in the descending order of the scores. Possible
interactions between items present in the same list are taken into account in
the training phase at the loss level. However, during inference, items are
scored individually, and possible interactions between them are not considered.
In this paper, we propose a context-aware neural network model that learns item
scores by applying a self-attention mechanism. The relevance of a given item is
thus determined in the context of all other items present in the list, both in
training and in inference. We empirically demonstrate significant performance
gains of self-attention based neural architecture over Multi-LayerPerceptron

But, strong correlation itself can also act to restrict available phase space.
Relaxation confined by strong correlation gives rise to scale invariance and
density distributions characteristic of self-organized criticality. For some
time, we have observed signs of self-organization in the avalanche, bifurcation
and quench of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide to form an
ultracold, strongly correlated ultracold plasma. The robust arrested relaxation
of this system forms a disordered state with quantum-mechanical properties that
appear to support a coherent destruction of transport. Work reported here
focuses on initial stages of avalanche and quench, using the mm-wave
spectroscopy of an embedded quantum probe to characterize the intermolecular
interaction dynamics associated with the evolution to plasma. Double-resonance
excitation prepares a Rydberg gas of nitric oxide composed of a single selected
state, $n_0f(2)$. Penning ionization, followed by an avalanche of
electron-Rydberg collisions, forms a plasma of NO$^+$ ions and weakly bound
electrons, in which a residual population of $n_0$ Rydberg molecules evolves to
high-$\ell$. At long times, $n_0\ell(2) \rightarrow (n_0 \pm 1)d(2)$ depletion
resonances signal collision-free energy redistribution in the basis of
central-field Rydberg states. The widths and asymmetries of Fano lineshapes
witness the degree to which coupling to the arrested bath broadens the bright
state as well as how bright-state predissociation mixes the network of levels
in the localized ensemble.

networks using softmax and cross entropy. In this work, we are curious to see
if introducing large-margins to neural language models would improve the
perplexity and consequently word error rate in automatic speech recognition.
Specifically, we first implement and test various types of conventional margins
following the previous works in face recognition. To address the distribution
of natural language data, we then compare different strategies for word vector
norm-scaling. After that, we apply the best norm-scaling setup in combination
with various margins and conduct neural language models rescoring experiments

deteriorated, neural language models with large-margin softmax can yield word
error rate similar to that of the standard softmax baseline. Finally, expected
margins are analyzed through visualization of word vectors, showing that the
syntactic and semantic relationships are also preserved.

In this work, we seek to quantify the impact of reducing segmentation

granularity (e.g., object masks vs. 2D bounding boxes). Our analysis uncovers
several practical insights into how segmentation-based visual abstractions can
be exploited in a more label efficient manner. Surprisingly, we find that
state-of-the-art driving performance can be achieved with orders of magnitude

low level of aggregation will be key inputs for such systems. We focus on
forecasting demand at the individual household level, which is more challenging
than forecasting aggregate demand, due to the lower signal-to-noise ratio and
to the heterogeneity of consumption patterns across households. We propose a
new ensemble method for probabilistic forecasting, which borrows strength
across the households while accommodating their individual idiosyncrasies. In
particular, we develop a set of models or 'experts' which capture different
demand dynamics and we fit each of them to the data from each household. Then
we construct an aggregation of experts where the ensemble weights are estimated
on the whole data set, the main innovation being that we let the weights vary
with the covariates by adopting an additive model structure. In particular, the
proposed aggregation method is an extension of regression stacking (Breiman,
1996) where the mixture weights are modelled using linear combinations of
parametric, smooth or random effects. The methods for building and fitting

Systematic errors of the Kalman filter, caused by intermediate changes in risk

measuring the residuals. By including an additional adjustment step in the

information) for recommendation is a trend in industry. Most existing methods
can be categorized as \emph{multi-view representation fusion}; they first build
one graph and then integrate multi-view data into a single compact
representation for each node in the graph. However, these methods are raising
concerns in both engineering and algorithm aspects: 1) multi-view data are
abundant and informative in industry and may exceed the capacity of one single
vector, and 2) inductive bias may be introduced as multi-view data are often
from different distributions. In this paper, we use a \emph{multi-view
representation alignment} approach to address this issue. Particularly, we
propose a multi-task multi-view graph representation learning framework (M2GRL)
to learn node representations from multi-view graphs for web-scale recommender
systems. M2GRL constructs one graph for each single-view data, learns multiple
separate representations from multiple graphs, and performs alignment to model
cross-view relations. M2GRL chooses a multi-task learning paradigm to learn
intra-view representations and cross-view relations jointly. Besides, M2GRL
applies homoscedastic uncertainty to adaptively tune the loss weights of tasks
during training. We deploy M2GRL at Taobao and train it on 57 billion examples.
According to offline metrics and online A/B tests, M2GRL significantly
outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Further exploration on diversity
recommendation in Taobao shows the effectiveness of utilizing multiple
representations produced by \method{}, which we argue is a promising direction
for various industrial recommendation tasks of different focus.

advancements in recent years, especially in data-abundant settings and with the
central aim of learning global models that can extract patterns across multiple
time series. While the crucial importance of appropriate data pre-processing
and scaling has often been noted in prior work, most studies focus on improving
model architectures. In this paper we empirically investigate the effect of
data input and output transformations on the predictive performance of several
neural forecasting architectures. In particular, we investigate the
effectiveness of several forms of data binning, i.e. converting real-valued
time series into categorical ones, when combined with feed-forward, recurrent
neural networks, and convolution-based sequence models. In many non-forecasting
applications where these models have been very successful, the model inputs and
outputs are categorical (e.g. words from a fixed vocabulary in natural language
processing applications or quantized pixel color intensities in computer
vision). For forecasting applications, where the time series are typically
real-valued, various ad-hoc data transformations have been proposed, but have
not been systematically compared. To remedy this, we evaluate the forecasting
accuracy of instances of the aforementioned model classes when combined with
different types of data scaling and binning. We find that binning almost always
improves performance (compared to using normalized real-valued inputs), but
that the particular type of binning chosen is of lesser importance.

operations like neural network and factorization machines to fuse the

neural network and factorization machines) are ignored. Intra-field information
is the information that features inside each field belong to the same field.
NON is proposed to take full advantage of intra-field information and
non-linear interactions. It consists of three components: field-wise network at
the bottom to capture the intra-field information, across field network in the
middle to choose suitable operations data-drivenly, and operation fusion
network on the top to fuse outputs of the chosen operations deeply. Extensive
experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate NON can outperform the

this initial estimate, the performance of the adaptive lasso critically depends
on the value of a hyperparameter, which controls the magnitude of the weighted
$L_1$-norm in the penalized criterion. As for other machine learning methods,
cross-validation is very popular for the calibration of the adaptive lasso,
that this for the selection of a data-driven optimal value of this

still overlook it. In this work, we recall appropriate cross-validation schemes

in unitary many-body theories, focusing a representative example on the driven
similarity renormalization group (DSRG). Starting from the least approximate
method - the linearized DSRG truncated to one-, two-, and three-body operators
[LDSRG(3)] - we develop several approximate LDSRG(3) models with reduced
computational cost. Through a perturbative analysis, we motivate a family of
iterative LDSRG(3)-$n$ and -$n'$ ($n=1,2,3,4$) methods that contain a subset of
the LDSRG(3) diagrams. Among these variants, the LDSRG(3)-2 scheme has the same
computational complexity of coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and
triples (CCSDT), but it outperforms CCSDT in the accuracy of the predicted
correlation energies. We also propose and implement two perturbative triples
corrections based on the linearized DSRG truncated to one- and two-body
operators augmented with recursive quadratic commutators [qDSRG(2)]. The
resulting qDSRG(2)+(T) approach matches the accuracy of the ""gold-standard""
coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples model on
the energetics of twenty-eight closed-shell atoms and small molecules.

subsequent hydrolysis of N$_2$O$_5$. We find that hydrolysis to nitric acid
proceeds through the coordinated fluctuation of intramolecular charge
separation and solvation, and its characteristic rate is 4.1 ns$^{-1}$, orders
of magnitude faster than traditionally assumed. This large rate calls into
question standard models of reactive uptake that envision local equilibration
between the gas and the bulk solution. We propose an alternative model based on

will be the first natural satellite outside our Solar System. Its
characteristics are nothing alike we know for a satellite. Kepler 1625b I is
expected to be as massive as Neptune and to orbit at 40 planetary radii around
a ten Jupiter mass planet. Because of its mass and wide orbit, this satellite
was firstly thought to be captured instead of formed in-situ. In this work, we
investigated the possibility of an in-situ formation of this exomoon candidate.
To do so, we performed N-body simulations to reproduce the late phases of
satellite formation and use a massive circum-planetary disc to explain the mass
of this satellite. Our setups started soon after the gaseous nebula
dissipation, when the satellite embryos are already formed. Also for selected
exomoon systems we take into account a post-formation tidal evolution. We found
that in-situ formation is viable to explain the origin of Kepler 1625b I, even
when different values for the star-planet separation are considered. We show
that for different star-planet separations the minimum amount of solids needed
in the circum-planetary disc to form such a satellite varies, the wider is this
separation more material is needed. In our simulations of satellite formation
many satellites were formed close to the planet, this scenario changed after
the tidal evolution of the systems. We concluded that if the Kepler1625 b
satellite system was formed in-situ, tidal evolution was an important mechanism

decorated hypergraphs with orientation, called Brauer configurations. In this
paper, we use the combinatorics of Brauer configurations to understand the
module category of symmetric special multiserial algebras via their
Auslander-Reiten quiver. In particular, we provide methods for determining the
existence and ranks of tubes in the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of symmetric
special multiserial algebras using only the information from the underlying
Brauer configuration. Firstly, we define a combinatorial walk around the Brauer
configuration, called a Green `hyperwalk', which generalises the existing
notion of a Green walk around a Brauer graph. Periodic Green hyperwalks are
then shown to correspond to periodic projective resolutions of certain classes
of string modules over the corresponding symmetric special multiserial algebra.
Periodic Green hyperwalks thus determine certain classes of tubes in the stable
Auslander-Reiten quiver, with the ranks of the tubes determined by the periods
of the walks. Finally, we provide a description of additional rank two tubes in
symmetric special multiserial algebras that do not arise from Green hyperwalks,
but which nevertheless contain string modules at the mouth. This includes an
explicit description of the space of extensions between string modules at the

not reaching consensus. We show that, under these assumptions, there is no

this means that there must always exist a \emph{failure pattern} (a description
of who fails, when they fail, and which agents they do not send messages to in
the round that they fail) and initial preferences for which an agent can gain
by deviating. On the other hand, if we assume that there is a distribution
$\pi$ on the failure patterns and initial preferences, then under minimal

profile, including range, Doppler, azimuth and elevation, over multiple

the range-Doppler spectrum sequence into a deep convolutional neural network
(CNN) connected with recurrent neural networks, the proposed framework takes
the aforementioned feature cube as input of a shallow CNN for gesture

hand activity detection (HAD) algorithm to automatize the detection of gestures

the proposed framework is able to detect and classify gestures at limited

determines the contribution of this user's rating data in the recommendation

acts as an important feature in the fraudster detection component. Thus, these
two components can mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments have been
conducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our GraphRfi in
the two tasks - robust rating prediction and fraudster detection. Furthermore,

  Out-of-Distribution Data",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While deep learning has resulted in major breakthroughs in many application
domains, the frameworks commonly used in deep learning remain fragile to
artificially-crafted and imperceptible changes in the data. In response to this
fragility, adversarial training has emerged as a principled approach for
enhancing the robustness of deep learning with respect to norm-bounded
perturbations. However, there are other sources of fragility for deep learning
that are arguably more common and less thoroughly studied. Indeed, natural
variation such as lighting or weather conditions can significantly degrade the
accuracy of trained neural networks, proving that such natural variation
presents a significant challenge for deep learning.
  In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from perturbation-based
adversarial robustness toward model-based robust deep learning. Our objective
is to provide general training algorithms that can be used to train deep neural
networks to be robust against natural variation in data. Critical to our
paradigm is first obtaining a model of natural variation which can be used to
vary data over a range of natural conditions. Such models may be either known a
priori or else learned from data. In the latter case, we show that deep
generative models can be used to learn models of natural variation that are
consistent with realistic conditions. We then exploit such models in three
novel model-based robust training algorithms in order to enhance the robustness
of deep learning with respect to the given model. Our extensive experiments
show that across a variety of naturally-occurring conditions and across various
datasets, deep neural networks trained with our model-based algorithms
significantly outperform both standard deep learning algorithms as well as
norm-bounded robust deep learning algorithms.

variational approximation by adding a prior on the variational parameters in
the form of a measure. We prove that for a rich family of functions $\Gamma$,
this algorithm leads at each step to a systematic decrease in the
$\alpha$-divergence and derive convergence results. Our framework recovers the
Entropic Mirror Descent algorithm and provides an alternative algorithm that we
call the Power Descent. Moreover, in its stochastic formulation, the $(\alpha,
\Gamma)$-descent allows to optimise the mixture weights of any given mixture
model without any information on the underlying distribution of the variational
parameters. This renders our method compatible with many choices of parameters
updates and applicable to a wide range of Machine Learning tasks. We
demonstrate empirically on both toy and real-world examples the benefit of
using the Power descent and going beyond the Entropic Mirror Descent framework,
which fails as the dimension grows.

communications between nodes. On $n$ machines, ADFS minimizes the objective
function with $nm$ samples in the same time it takes optimal algorithms to
optimize from $m$ samples on one machine. This scaling holds until a critical
network size is reached, which depends on communication delays, on the number
of samples $m$, and on the network topology. We give a lower bound of
complexity to show that ADFS is optimal among decentralized algorithms. To
derive ADFS, we first develop an extension of the accelerated proximal

expected to only be able to reconstruct normal images, allowing the
localization of anomalous pixels in an image via manipulating information
within the VAE ELBO loss. The ELBO consists of KL divergence loss (image-wise)
and reconstruction loss (pixel-wise). It is natural and straightforward to use
the later as the predictor. However, usually local anomaly added to a normal
image can deteriorate the whole reconstructed image, causing segmentation using
only naive pixel errors not accurate. Energy based projection was proposed to
increase the reconstruction accuracy of normal regions/pixels, which achieved
the state-of-the-art localization accuracy on simple natural images. Another
possible predictors are ELBO and its components gradients with respect to each

relations between entities such as friend/foe or trust/distrust. Recently,
several papers studied the construction of useful low-dimensional
representations (embeddings) of these networks for the prediction of missing
relations or signs. Existing embedding methods for sign prediction generally
enforce different notions of status or balance theories in their optimization
function. These theories, however, are often inaccurate or incomplete, which
negatively impacts method performance.
  In this context, we introduce conditional signed network embedding (CSNE).
Our probabilistic approach models structural information about the signs in the
network separately from fine-grained detail. Structural information is
represented in the form of a prior, while the embedding itself is used for
capturing fine-grained information. These components are then integrated in a
rigorous manner. CSNE's accuracy depends on the existence of sufficiently
powerful structural priors for modelling signed networks, currently unavailable
in the literature. Thus, as a second main contribution, which we find to be
highly valuable in its own right, we also introduce a novel approach to
construct priors based on the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle. These priors
can model the \emph{polarity} of nodes (degree to which their links are
positive) as well as signed \emph{triangle counts} (a measure of the degree
structural balance holds to in a network).
  Experiments on a variety of real-world networks confirm that CSNE outperforms
the state-of-the-art on the task of sign prediction. Moreover, the MaxEnt
priors on their own, while less accurate than full CSNE, achieve accuracies
competitive with the state-of-the-art at very limited computational cost, thus
providing an excellent runtime-accuracy trade-off in resource-constrained
situations.

applications in healthcare. It was perhaps inevitable that COVID-19, a global

attention and resources of the world's computer scientists in academia and
industry. The potential for AI to support the response to the pandemic has been
proposed across a wide range of clinical and societal challenges, including
disease forecasting, surveillance and antiviral drug discovery. This is likely
to continue as the impact of the pandemic unfolds on the world's people,
industries and economy but a surprising observation on the current pandemic has
been the limited impact AI has had to date in the management of COVID-19. This

bias via inverse propensity weighting, which provides a new perspective for
understanding the effectiveness of contrastive learning. Based on the
theoretical discovery, we design CLRec, a contrastive learning method to
improve DCG in terms of fairness, effectiveness and efficiency in recommender

the Jodel online social network. Our data set contains more than 40 million
sentences, of which 11 million sentences are annotated with a subset of the
Unicode 13.0 standard Emoji list. We explore semantic emoji associations
contained in this embedding by analyzing associations between emojis, between
emojis and text, and between text and emojis. Our investigations demonstrate
anecdotally that word-emoji embeddings trained on large scale messaging data
can reflect real-world semantic associations. To enable further research we
release the Jodel Emoji Embedding Dataset (JEED1488) containing 1488 emojis and
their embeddings along 300 dimensions.

function is to represent the locations of things around the animal. Neurons
couple to the wave as transmitters and receivers. The wave acts as an analogue
representation of local space. This has benefits over a purely neural
representation of space. Several lines of evidence support this hypothesis;
both theoretical, concerning efficient Bayesian inference in the brain, and
empirical, concerning the neuro-anatomy of the thalamus. Across all species,
the most basic function of the brain is to coordinate movements in space. To
represent positions in space only by neural firing rates would be complex and
inefficient. It is possible that that the brain represents 3D space in a direct
and natural way, by a 3D wave

similar or even better performance than the Adam optimizer adopted in neural
networks. In order to support our proposed AdaSwarm, a novel Exponentially
weighted Momentum Particle Swarm Optimizer (EMPSO), is proposed. The ability of
AdaSwarm to tackle optimization problems is attributed to its capability to
perform good gradient approximations. We show that, the gradient of any
function, differentiable or not, can be approximated by using the parameters of
EMPSO. This is a novel technique to simulate GD which lies at the boundary
between numerical methods and swarm intelligence. Mathematical proofs of the
gradient approximation produced are also provided. AdaSwarm competes closely
with several state-of-the-art (SOTA) optimizers. We also show that AdaSwarm is
able to handle a variety of loss functions during backpropagation, including
the maximum absolute error (MAE).

prepared by ball milling of Si, Ni$_{3.4}$Sn$_4$, Al and C. Silicon and carbon
contents are varied from 10 to 30 wt.% Si, and 0 to 20 wt.% C. The
microstructural and electrochemical properties of the composites have been
investigated by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and
electrochemical galvanostatic cycling up to 1000 cycles. Impact of silicon and
carbon contents on the phase occurrence, electrochemical capacity and
cycle-life are compared and discussed. For C-content comprised between 9 and 13
wt.% and Si-content >= 20 wt.%, Si nanoparticles are embedded in a
Ni$_{3.4}$Sn$_4$-Al-C matrix which is chemically homogeneous at the micrometric
scale. For other carbon contents and low Si-amount (10 wt.%), no homogeneous
matrix is formed around Si nanoparticles. When homogenous matrix is formed,
both Ni$_3$Sn$_4$ and Si participate to the reversible lithiation mechanism,
whereas no reaction between Ni$_3$Sn$_4$ and Li is observed for no homogenous
matrix. Moreover, best cycle-life performances are obtained when Si
nanoparticles are embedded in a homogenous matrix and Si-content is moderate
(<= 20 wt.%). Composites with carbon in the 9-13 wt.% range and 20 wt.% silicon
lead to the best balance between capacity and life duration upon cycling. This
work experimentally demonstrates that embedding Si in an intermetallic/carbon
matrix allows to efficiently accommodate Si volume changes on cycling to ensure
long cycle-life.

and mobile services has gotten more complex along with the composition of a
large number of atomic services. Different services are provided by mobile
cloud components to represent the non-functional properties as Quality of
Service (QoS), which is applied by a set of standards. On the other hand, the
growth of the energy-source heterogeneity in mobile clouds is an emerging
challenge according to the energy-saving problem in mobile nodes. To mobile
cloud service composition as an NP-Hard problem, an efficient selection method
should be taken by problem using optimal energy-aware methods that can extend
the deployment and interoperability of mobile cloud components. Also, an
energy-aware service composition mechanism is required to preserve high energy
saving scenarios for mobile cloud components. In this paper, an energy-aware
mechanism is applied to optimize mobile cloud service composition using a
hybrid Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm and Genetic Algorithm (SFGA).
Experimental results capture that the proposed mechanism improves the
feasibility of the service composition with minimum energy consumption,
response time, and cost for mobile cloud components against some current
algorithms.
