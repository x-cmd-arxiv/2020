originate from binary black hole (BBH) mergers. Among the different binary
evolution paths, the merger of BBHs in accretion discs of active galactic
nuclei (AGNs) is a possible source of GW detections. We consider an idealised
analytical model of the orbital evolution of BBHs embedded in an AGN accretion
disc. In this framework, the disc-binary interaction increases the orbital
eccentricity and decreases the orbital separation, driving the BBH into a
regime where GW emission eventually leads to coalescence. We compute the
resulting GW merger rate density from this channel based on a weighted average
of the merger timescales of a population of BBHs radially distributed within
the AGN accretion disc. The predicted merger rates broadly lie in the range
$\mathcal{R} \sim (0.002 - 18) \, \mathrm{Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$. We analyse the
dependence of the merger rate density on both the accretion disc and binary
orbital parameters, emphasising the important role of the orbital eccentricity.
We discuss the astrophysical implications of this particular BBH-in-AGN
formation channel in the broader context of binary evolution scenarios.

Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), leading to notable gains of average precision
(AP) and average recall (AR), without the sacrifice of inference efficiency. In
particular, we consider three geometric factors, i.e., overlap area, normalized
central point distance and aspect ratio, which are crucial for measuring
bounding box regression in object detection and instance segmentation. The
three geometric factors are then incorporated into CIoU loss for better
distinguishing difficult regression cases. The training of deep models using
CIoU loss results in consistent AP and AR improvements in comparison to widely
adopted $\ell_n$-norm loss and IoU-based loss. Furthermore, we propose
Cluster-NMS, where NMS during inference is done by implicitly clustering
detected boxes and usually requires less iterations. Cluster-NMS is very
efficient due to its pure GPU implementation, and geometric factors can be
incorporated to improve both AP and AR. In the experiments, CIoU loss and
Cluster-NMS have been applied to state-of-the-art instance segmentation (e.g.,
YOLACT and BlendMask-RT), and object detection (e.g., YOLO v3, SSD and Faster

discs which has been previously identified can be confirmed at high
significance. We compile a sample of 201 stars with known planets and existing
far infrared observations. The sample is larger than those studied previously
since we include targets from an unpublished Herschel survey of planet hosts.
We use spectral energy distribution modelling to characterise Kuiper belt
analogue debris discs within the sample, then compare the properties of the
discs against a control sample of 294 stars without known planets. Survival
analysis suggests that there is a significant ($p\sim 0.002$) difference
between the disc fractional luminosity distributions of the two samples.
However, this is largely a result of the fact that the control sample contains
a higher proportion of close binaries and of later-type stars; both of these
factors are known to reduce disc detection rates. Considering only Sun-like
stars without close binary companions in each sample greatly reduces the
significance of the difference ($p\sim 0.3$). We also find no evidence for a
difference in the disc fractional luminosities of stars hosting planets more or
less massive than Saturn ($p\sim 0.9$). Finally, we find that the planet hosts
have cooler discs than the control stars, but this is likely a detection bias,
since the warmest discs in the control sample are also the faintest, and would
thus be undetectable around the more distant planet hosts. Considering only
discs in each sample that could have been detected around a typical planet
host, we find $p\sim 0.07$ for the temperatures.

presence of the helical density substantially affects the phase diagram of
dense quark matter. A moderate helical density makes the chiral phase
transition softer while shifting the critical endpoint towards lower
temperatures and higher baryon chemical potentials. As the helical density
increases, the segment of the first-order transition disappears, and the chiral
transition becomes a soft crossover. At even higher helical chemical
potentials, the first-order transition reappears again at the zero-density
finite-temperature transition and extends into the interior of the phase
diagram. This evolution of the chiral transition reflects the existence of a
thermodynamic duality between helical and vector (baryonic) chemical
potentials. We also show that the presence of the helicity imbalance of quark

protoplanetary disk formation and evolution in the thin-disk limit, assuming
both magnetically layered and fully magnetorotational instability (MRI)-active
disk structure. In this paper, we characterize the nature of the outbursts
occurring in these simulations. The instability in the dead zone of a typical
layered disk results in ""MRI outbursts"". We explore their progression and their
dependence on the layered disk parameters as well as cloud core mass. The
simulations of fully MRI-active disks showed an instability analogous to the
classical thermal instability. This instability manifested at two
temperatures--above approximately 1400 K and 3500 K--due to the steep
dependence of Rosseland opacity on the temperature. The origin of these
thermally unstable regions is related to the bump in opacity resulting from
molecular absorption by water vapor and may be viewed as a novel mechanism
behind some of the shorter duration accretion events. Although we demonstrated
local thermal instability in the disk, more investigations are needed to
confirm that a large-scale global instability will ensue. We conclude that the
magnetic structure of a disk, its composition, as well as the stellar mass, can
significantly affect the nature of episodic accretion in young stellar objects.

that updates the policy weekly using model predictive control (MPC) leads to a

completion at the LHC, needs to be extended for various physical reasons,
including the cold dark matter (DM). Each extension comes with its scale and
mechanism, and typically lifts, at the loop level, the electroweak scale
towards its high scale. The problem is to keep the electroweak scale stable
while providing a room for the aforementioned heavy extensions. To this end, it
turns out that the SM Higgs sector remains stable in the presence of a heavy
scalar if their quartic couplings unify at a certain scale when their masses
are degenerate. Under this mass-degeneracy-driven unification (MDDU), the
scalar under concern is found to qualify as a viable DM candidate and to leave
the electroweak scale stable. Our detailed simulation studies explicitly show
that the MDDU parameter space agrees with current collider and astrophysical
bounds. Our work can be extended to other relevant scalars (like flavons,
inflaton and others) as a mechanism by which the electroweak scale is held
stable.

Differential Equations to the loss function. Our PINN is supervised with
realistic ultrasonic surface acoustic wave data acquired at a frequency of 5
MHz. The ultrasonic surface wave data is represented as a surface deformation
on the top surface of a metal plate, measured by using the method of laser
vibrometry. The PINN is physically informed by the acoustic wave equation and
its convergence is sped up using adaptive activation functions. The adaptive
activation function uses a scalable hyperparameter in the activation function,
which is optimized to achieve best performance of the network as it changes
dynamically the topology of the loss function involved in the optimization
process. The usage of adaptive activation function significantly improves the
convergence, notably observed in the current study. We use PINNs to estimate
the speed of sound of the metal plate, which we do with an error of 1\%, and
then, by allowing the speed of sound to be space dependent, we identify and
characterize the crack as the positions where the speed of sound has decreased.
Our study also shows the effect of sub-sampling of the data on the sensitivity

These are well localized in space and frequency and provide (Stevenson) frames
for the homogeneous Sobolev spaces $\dot{H}^{-r+1}( \Omega_{\nu}^{r} , S^2 )$
of differential $r$-forms. At the same time, they satisfy important properties
of the exterior calculus, such as the de Rahm complex and the Hodge-Helmholtz
decomposition. Through this, $\Psi\mathrm{ec}$ is tailored towards structure
preserving discretizations that can adapt to solutions with varying regularity.
The construction of $\Psi\mathrm{ec}$ is based on a novel spherical wavelet
frame for $L_2(S^2)$ that we obtain by introducing scalable reproducing kernel
frames. These extend scalable frames to weighted sampling expansions and
provide an alternative to quadrature rules for the discretization of

accurately learn the relationships between covariates and response at a fine
spatial scale. However, validating these high resolution predictions can be a
challenge, as often there is no data observed at this spatial scale. In this
study, disaggregation regression was performed on simulated data in various
settings and the resulting fine-scale predictions are compared to the simulated
ground truth. Performance was investigated with varying numbers of data points,
sizes of aggregated areas and levels of model misspecification. The
effectiveness of cross validation on the aggregate level as a measure of
fine-scale predictive performance was also investigated. Predictive performance
improved as the number of observations increased and as the size of the
aggregated areas decreased. When the model was well-specified, fine-scale
predictions were accurate even with small numbers of observations and large
aggregated areas. Under model misspecification predictive performance was
significantly worse for large aggregated areas but remained high when response
data was aggregated over smaller regions. Cross-validation correlation on the
aggregate level was a moderately good predictor of fine-scale predictive
performance. While the simulations are unlikely to capture the nuances of
real-life response data, this study gives insight into the effectiveness of

become costly due to non-trivial material parameters entering the equations,
multigrid codes requiring cascades of matrices that depend upon each other, or
dynamic adaptive mesh refinement that necessitates the recomputation of matrix
entries or the whole equation system throughout the solve. We propose that
these constructions can be performed concurrently with the multigrid cycles.
Initial geometric matrices and low accuracy integrations kickstart the
multigrid, while improved assembly data is fed to the solver as and when it
becomes available. The time to solution is improved as we eliminate an
expensive preparation phase traditionally delaying the actual computation. We
eliminate algorithmic latency. Furthermore, we desynchronise the assembly from
the solution process. This anarchic increase of the concurrency level improves
the scalability. Assembly routines are notoriously memory- and

without the need to pre-average the data in time or frequency. We demonstrate
the accuracy of the method using validation tests on mock observations. Using
small data sets with $\sim 10^3$ visibilities, we first compare our approach
with the more traditional direct Fourier transform (DFT) implementation and
direct linear solver. Our tests indicate that our source inversion is
indistinguishable from that of the DFT. Our method also infers lens parameters
to within 1 to 2 per cent of both the ground truth and DFT, given sufficiently
high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). When the SNR is as low as 5, both approaches
lead to errors of several tens of per cent in the lens parameters and a
severely disrupted source structure, indicating that this is related to the SNR
and choice of priors rather than the modelling technique itself. We then
analyze a large data set with $\sim 10^8$ visibilities and a SNR matching real
global Very Long Baseline Interferometry observations of the gravitational lens
system MG J0751+2716. The size of the data is such that it cannot be modelled
with traditional implementations. Using our novel technique, we find that we
can infer the lens parameters and the source brightness distribution,
respectively, with an RMS error of 0.25 and 0.97 per cent relative to the
ground truth.

space-time and the wavefunction of the universe in cosmology for a large class
of models. Their unique canonical forms, providing such quantum mechanical
observables, are characterised by having only logarithmic singularities along
all the boundaries of the positive geometry. However, physical observables have
logarithmic singularities just for a subset of theories. Thus, it becomes
crucial to understand whether a similar paradigm can underlie their structure
in more general cases. In this paper we start a systematic investigation of a
geometric-combinatorial characterisation of differential forms with
non-logarithmic singularities, focusing on projective polytopes and related
meromorphic forms with multiple poles. We introduce the notions of covariant
forms and covariant pairings. Covariant forms have poles only along the
boundaries of the given polytope; moreover, their leading Laurent coefficients
along any of the boundaries are still covariant forms on the specific boundary.
Whereas meromorphic forms in covariant pairing with a polytope are associated
to a specific (signed) triangulation, in which poles on spurious boundaries do
not cancel completely, but their order is lowered. These meromorphic forms can
be fully characterised if the polytope they are associated to is viewed as the
restriction of a higher dimensional one onto a hyperplane. The canonical form
of the latter can be mapped into a covariant form or a form in covariant
pairing via a covariant restriction. We show how the geometry of the higher
dimensional polytope determines the structure of these differential forms.
Finally, we discuss how these notions are related to Jeffrey-Kirwan residues
and cosmological polytopes.

Our model includes a stochastic component which can account for uncertainty in

different notions of an optimal path when there is uncertainty in the problem.

zero (and thus the viscosity in the equation tends to zero), the optimal path
tends toward the deterministic optimal path.

  Rebuttal""","New version with some minor corrections based on the reviews of the
  associated paper",,,,"cs.AI cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  In ASPIC-style structured argumentation an argument can rebut another
argument by attacking its conclusion. Two ways of formalizing rebuttal have
been proposed: In restricted rebuttal, the attacked conclusion must have been
arrived at with a defeasible rule, whereas in unrestricted rebuttal, it may
have been arrived at with a strict rule, as long as at least one of the
antecedents of this strict rule was already defeasible. One systematic way of
choosing between various possible definitions of a framework for structured
argumentation is to study what rationality postulates are satisfied by which
definition, for example whether the closure postulate holds, i.e. whether the
accepted conclusions are closed under strict rules. While having some benefits,
the proposal to use unrestricted rebuttal faces the problem that the closure
postulate only holds for the grounded semantics but fails when other
argumentation semantics are applied, whereas with restricted rebuttal the
closure postulate always holds. In this paper we propose that ASPIC-style
argumentation can benefit from keeping track not only of the attack relation
between arguments, but also the relation of deductive joint support that holds
between a set of arguments and an argument that was constructed from that set
using a strict rule. By taking this deductive joint support relation into
account while determining the extensions, the closure postulate holds with
unrestricted rebuttal under all admissibility-based semantics. We define the
semantics of deductive joint support through the flattening method.

limiting properties of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimates of the inverse
temperature and the magnetic field given a single realization from the $p$-spin
Curie-Weiss model, complementing the well-known results in the 2-spin case
(Comets and Gidas (1991)). Our results unearth various new phase transitions
and surprising limit theorems, such as the existence of a 'critical' curve in
the parameter space, where the limiting distribution of the ML estimates is a
mixture with both continuous and discrete components. The number of mixture
components is either two or three, depending on, among other things, the sign
of one of the parameters and the parity of $p$. Another interesting revelation
is the existence of certain 'special' points in the parameter space where the
ML estimates exhibit a superefficiency phenomenon, converging to a non-Gaussian
limiting distribution at rate $N^{\frac{3}{4}}$. Using these results we can
obtain asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the inverse temperature
and the magnetic field at all points in the parameter space where consistent
estimation is possible.

families have been identified in previous work, with four in the L$_4$ swarm,

swarms, with a particular focus on these collisional families. We find that the
members of Trojan swarms escape the population at a linear rate, with the
primordial L$_4$ (23.35% escape) and L$_5$ (24.89% escape) population sizes
likely 1.31 and 1.35 times larger than today. Given that the escape rates were
approximately equal between the two Trojan swarms, our results do not explain
the observed asymmetry between the two groups, suggesting that the numerical
differences are primordial in nature, supporting previous studies. Upon leaving
the Trojan population, the escaped objects move onto orbits that resemble those

Arkesilos and Ennomos families exhibit various degrees of instability. The
larger Eurybates family shows 18.81\% of simulated members escaping the Trojan

one-loop correlators become combinations of Lorentz traces in vector and spinor

One-loop numerators satisfying the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) duality for

known in the Universe. Their initial prompt flashes of MeV gamma rays are
followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission from radio waves to GeV gamma
rays. Emission at TeV energies had been theoretically predicted, but never
confirmed by observations. Here we report the detection of a huge signal from
GRB 190114C in the TeV energy range by the MAGIC imaging atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes. Starting one minute after the onset of the burst, gamma rays in the
energy range 0.2 -1 TeV were observed at more than 50 sigma level. This allowed
us to study the spectral and temporal development of the GRB, revealing a new
emission component in the afterglow with a power comparable to that of the
synchrotron component. We found a second peak in the spectral energy
distribution of the GRB at an energy of few hundred GeVs. Our modeling, based
on the data from the two dozen space- and ground-based instruments that
followed GRB 190114C at multiple wavelengths, supports the explanation that the
second peak is due to the Inverse Compton radiation mechanism. The two-peaked
structure of the spectral energy distribution allows us to constrain some of
the key physical parameters of the GRB as the bulk Lorentz factor, minimal
electron energy, the ratio of the radiation to magnetic field density. Recently
also the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope reported on a 5 sigma
gamma-ray signal from the GRB 180720B, measured in the afterglow phase, 10
hours after the onset of the explosion. These observations prove that the GRBs
are more powerful than assumed until recently. Because the observed GRBs did
not show peculiar properties, we believe that from now on detection of
gamma-ray signal from GRB afterglows at very high energies will become one of
the standard observations.

avoids exposure bias, can mitigate this. Our analysis explains why exposure
bias is more problematic under domain shift, and also links exposure bias to
the beam search problem, i.e. performance deterioration with increasing beam

bias: even if they do not increase performance on in-domain test sets, they can

exponentially over the past decade. Traditional anti-virus software are
ineffective against modern complex Malware. In order to address this challenge,
researchers have proposed Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) using
Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs). The HPCs are used to train a set of
Machine learning (ML) classifiers, which in turn, are used to distinguish
benign programs from Malware. Recently, adversarial attacks have been designed
by introducing perturbations in the HPC traces using an adversarial sample
predictor to misclassify a program for specific HPCs. These attacks are
designed with the basic assumption that the attacker is aware of the HPCs being
used to detect Malware. Since modern processors consist of hundreds of HPCs,
restricting to only a few of them for Malware detection aids the attacker. In
this paper, we propose a Moving target defense (MTD) for this adversarial
attack by designing multiple ML classifiers trained on different sets of HPCs.
The MTD randomly selects a classifier; thus, confusing the attacker about the
HPCs or the number of classifiers applied. We have developed an analytical
model which proves that the probability of an attacker to guess the perfect
HPC-classifier combination for MTD is extremely low (in the range of
$10^{-1864}$ for a system with 20 HPCs). Our experimental results prove that
the proposed defense is able to improve the classification accuracy of HPC
traces that have been modified through an adversarial sample generator by up to
31.5%, for a near perfect (99.4%) restoration of the original accuracy.

at least two distinct sequences, which have traditionally been associated with
the thin and thick disc components. The abundance distribution varies
systematically with location $R$ and $|z|$ across the Galaxy. Using an
analytical chemodynamical model that includes the effects of radial migration
and kinematic heating, we show that it is possible to reproduce the observed
abundance distribution at different locations. Unlike some earlier models, our
scheme does not require a distinct thick disc component emerging from a
separate evolutionary path. The proposed model has a continuous star formation
history and a continuous age velocity dispersion relation. Moreover,
[$\alpha$/Fe] is constant for stellar ages less than 8 Gyr, but increases
sharply for older stars over a time scale of 1.5 Gyr. The gap between the two
sequences is due to this sharp transition. We show that the high-[$\alpha$/Fe]
sequence at the low metallicity end is simply a pile-up of old stars. At the
high metallicity end, we find a sequence of stars having different ages with a
similar birth radius that originated in the inner disc. Our model successfully
explains the uniformity of the locus of the high-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence across
different locations. The low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence contains stars with
different birth radii that owes its existence to radial migration. For the
low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence, angular momentum is anti-correlated with [Fe/H],
and the model can reproduce this trend at different Galactic locations. If
radial migration is not included, the model fails to generate the double
sequence and instead shows only a single sequence. Our simple scheme has major
advantages over earlier chemodynamical models, as we show.

two-dimensional materials, and lead to peculiar two-dimensional structural
transformations under external fields, charge doping and/or temperature. The
most direct indicator of the ease of these transformations is an {\em elastic
energy barrier}, defined as the energy difference between the (degenerate)
structural ground state unit cell, and a unit cell with an increased structural
symmetry. Proximity of a two-dimensional material to a bulk substrate can
affect the magnitude of the critical fields and/or temperature at which these
transformations occur, with the first effect being a relative charge transfer,
which could trigger a structural quantum phase transition. With this physical
picture in mind, we report the effect of modest charge doping (within $-0.2$
and $+0.2$ electrons per unit cell) on the elastic energy barrier of
ferroelastic black phosphorene and nine ferroelectric monochalcogenide
monolayers. The elastic energy barrier $J_s$ is the energy needed to create a
$Pnm2_1\to P4/nmm$ two-dimensional structural transformation. Similar to the
effect on the elastic energy barrier of ferroelastic SnO monolayers, group-IV
monochalcogenide monolayers show a tunable elastic energy barrier for similar
amounts of doping: a decrease (increase) of $J_s$ can be engineered under a
modest hole (electron) doping of no more than one tenth of an electron or a

shared-control robots typically relies on the underlying autonomy's ability to
infer the user's needs and intentions, and the ability to do so unambiguously
is often a limiting factor for providing appropriate assistance confidently and

the idea of intent disambiguation via control mode selection, and present a
mathematical formalism for the same. Second, we develop a control mode
selection algorithm which selects the control mode in which the user-initiated
motion helps the autonomy to maximally disambiguate user intent. Third, we
present a pilot study with eight subjects to evaluate the efficacy of the
disambiguation algorithm. Our results suggest that the disambiguation system
(a) helps to significantly reduce task effort, as measured by number of button

image analysis, the proposed approach considers input data not as a 2D or 3D

clouds. We discovered that point cloud models require less memory and are
faster both in training and inference compared to traditional CNN 3D, they
achieve better performance and do not impose restrictions on the size of the

propose an algorithm for transforming 3D CT scan data to point cloud. In some
cases, the volume of the nodule candidate can be much smaller than the
surrounding context, for example, in the case of subpleural localization of the
nodule. Therefore, we developed an algorithm for sampling points from a point
cloud constructed from a 3D image of the candidate region. The algorithm is
able to guarantee the capture of both context and candidate information as part
of the point cloud of the nodule candidate. We designed and set up an
experiment in creating a dataset from an open LIDC-IDRI database for a feature
of the FPR task, and is herein described in detail. Data augmentation was
applied both to avoid overfitting and as an upsampling method. Experiments were
conducted with PointNet, PointNet++, and DGCNN. We show that the proposed
approach outperforms baseline CNN 3D models and resulted in 85.98 FROC versus
77.26 FROC for baseline models. We compare our algorithm with published SOTA

dramatically enhance our understanding of the early universe. In particular,
both the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn remain largely uncharted, and
the 21-cm signal is one of the few probes to reach them. The simplest 21-cm
measurement is the global signal (GS), which corresponds to the averaged
absorption or emission of 21-cm photons across the entire sky. While bright
radio foregrounds swamp the cosmic signal over the entire frequency range
observable, presenting a formidable hurdle, they can in principle be
subtracted, given enough sensitivity. Here, however, we point out an
additional---and irreducible---source of uncertainty for the 21-cm GS: cosmic
variance. The cosmic-variance noise arises from the finite volume of the
universe accessible to 21-cm experiments. Due to the cosmological redshifting
of 21-cm photons, each observed frequency probes our universe during a
particular cosmic age, corresponding to a narrow redshift slice. The presence
of large 21-cm fluctuations makes the GS within each slice different than the
GS averaged over the entire universe. We estimate the size of this
cosmic-variance noise, and find that for a standard scenario it has a size of
$\sim 0.1$ mK, which is $\sim 10\%$ of the size of the expected instrumental
noise of a year-long experiment. Interestingly, cosmic variance can overtake
instrumental noise for scenarios with extreme 21-cm fluctuations, such as those
suggested to explain the sharpness of the claimed EDGES detection. Moreover, as
large-scale 21-cm fluctuations are coherent over long distances, cosmic
variance correlates the measurements of the GS at nearby redshifts, leading to
off-diagonal uncertainties that have so far been neglected.

vapour to solid. These ""snow-lines"" can play vital roles in planet formation at
all scales, from dust coagulation to planetary migration. In the outer regions
of protoplanetary discs, the temperature profile is set by the absorption of
reprocessed stellar light by the solids. Further, the temperature profile sets
the distribution of solids through sublimation and condensation at various
snow-lines. Hence the snow-line position depends on the temperature profile and
vice-versa. We show that this coupling can be thermally unstable, such that a
patch of the disc at a snow-line will produce either run-away sublimation or
condensation. This thermal instability arises at moderate optical depths, where
heating by absorption of reprocessed stellar light from the disc's atmosphere
is optically thick, yet cooling is optically thin. Since volatiles in the solid
phase drift much faster than volatiles in the vapour phase, this thermal
instability results in a limit-cycle. The snow-line progressively moves in,
condensing volatiles, before receding, as the volatiles sublimate. Using
numerical simulations, we study the evolution of the CO snow-line. We find the
CO snow-line is thermally unstable under typical disc conditions and evolves
inwards from $\sim50$ to $\sim30$~AU on timescales from 1,000-10,000 years. The
CO snow-line spends between $\sim 10\%-50\%$ of its time at smaller
separations, where the exact value is sensitive to the total opacity and
turbulent viscosity. The evolving snow-line also creates ring-like structures
in the solid distribution interior to the snow-line. Multiple ring-like
structures created by moving snow-lines could potentially explain the
sub-structures seen in many {\it ALMA} images.

  Planetary Science Journal",,,,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The solar system's terrestrial planets are thought to have accreted over
millions of years out of a sea of smaller embryos and planetesimals. Because it
is impossible to know the surface density profile for solids and size frequency
distribution in the primordial solar nebula, distinguishing between the various
proposed evolutionary schemes has been historically difficult. Nearly all
previous simulations of terrestrial planet formation assume that Moon to Mars
massed embryos formed throughout the inner solar system during the primordial
gas-disk phase. However, validating this assumption through models of embryo
accretion is computationally challenging because of the large number of bodies
required. Here, we reevaluate this problem with GPU-accelerated, direct N-body
simulations of embryo growth starting from r~100 km planetesimals. We find that
embryos emerging from the primordial gas phase at a given radial distance
already have masses similar to the largest objects at the same semi-major axis
in the modern solar system. Thus, Earth and Venus attain ~50% of their modern
mass, Mars-massed embryos form in the Mars region, and Ceres-massed objects are
prevalent throughout asteroid belt. Consistent with other recent work, our new
initial conditions for terrestrial accretion models produce markedly improved
solar system analogs when evolved through the giant impact phase of planet
formation. However, we still conclude that an additional dynamical mechanism
such as giant planet migration is required to prevent Earth-massed Mars analogs
from growing.

average over the (Kozai-Lidov) oscillations in orbital parameters, which are
faster then the energy diffusion timescale. While similar random-walk models
were studied before, this work differs in two manners: (a) this is the first

graph-structured data. Graph representation learning methods have generally
fallen into three main categories, based on the availability of labeled data.
The first, network embedding (such as shallow graph embedding or graph
auto-encoders), focuses on learning unsupervised representations of relational
structure. The second, graph regularized neural networks, leverages graphs to
augment neural network losses with a regularization objective for
semi-supervised learning. The third, graph neural networks, aims to learn
differentiable functions over discrete topologies with arbitrary structure.
However, despite the popularity of these areas there has been surprisingly
little work on unifying the three paradigms. Here, we aim to bridge the gap
between graph neural networks, network embedding and graph regularization
models. We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of representation learning methods
for graph-structured data, aiming to unify several disparate bodies of work.
Specifically, we propose a Graph Encoder Decoder Model (GRAPHEDM), which
generalizes popular algorithms for semi-supervised learning on graphs (e.g.
GraphSage, Graph Convolutional Networks, Graph Attention Networks), and
unsupervised learning of graph representations (e.g. DeepWalk, node2vec, etc)

$d$ space dimensions. More concretely, one can ask whether there exist critical
points (CFTs) which break some global symmetry at arbitrary finite temperature.
The most familiar CFTs do not exhibit symmetry breaking at finite temperature,
and moreover, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, critical points at
finite temperature are described by an uncharged black brane which obeys a
no-hair theorem. Yet, we show that there exist CFTs which have some of their
internal symmetries broken at arbitrary finite temperature. Our main example is
a vector model which we study both in the epsilon expansion and arbitrary rank
as well as the large rank limit (and arbitrary dimension). The large rank limit
of the vector model displays a conformal manifold, a moduli space of vacua, and
a deformed moduli space of vacua at finite temperature. The appropriate
Nambu-Goldstone bosons including the dilaton-like particle are identified.
Using these tools we establish symmetry breaking at finite temperature for
finite small $\epsilon$. We also prove that a large class of other fixed
points, which describe some of the most common quantum magnets, indeed behave
as expected and do not break any global symmetry at finite temperature. We
discuss some of the consequences of finite temperature symmetry breaking for
the spectrum of local operators. Finally, we propose a class of fixed points

age-metallicity distribution of M54, the nucleus of the Sagittarius dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, from its integrated MUSE spectrum. We find a dominant old
(8-14 Gyr), metal-poor (-1.5 dex) and a young (1 Gyr), metal-rich (+0.25 dex)
component - consistent with the complex stellar populations measured from
individual stars in the same MUSE data set. There is excellent agreement
between the (mass-weighted) average age and metallicity of the resolved and
integrated analyses. Differences are only 3% in age and 0.2 dex metallicitiy.
By co-adding individual stars to create M54's integrated spectrum, we show that
the recovered age-metallicity distribution is insensitive to the magnitude
limit of the stars or the contribution of blue horizontal branch stars - even
when including additional blue wavelength coverage from the WAGGS survey.
However, we find that the brightest stars can induce the spurious recovery of
an old ($>8$ Gyr), metal-rich (+0.25 dex) stellar population, which is
otherwise not expected from our understanding of chemical enrichment in M54.
The overall derived stellar mass-to-light ratio of M54 is
M/L$_{\mathrm{V}}=1.46$ with a scatter of 0.22 across the field-of-view, which
we attribute to the stochastic contribution of a young, metal-rich component.
These findings provide strong evidence that complex stellar population
distributions can be reliably recovered from integrated spectra of
extragalactic systems.

relationship between the two major gas cooling lines and the total infrared
(TIR) dust continuum. We mapped the emission of gas and dust in M33 using the
far-infrared lines of [CII] and [OI](63um) and the TIR. The line maps were
observed with Herschel/PACS. These maps have 50pc resolution and form a ~370pc
wide stripe along its major axis covering the sites of bright HII regions, but
also more quiescent arm and inter-arm regions from the southern arm at 2kpc
galacto-centric distance to the south out to 5.7kpc distance to the north.
Full-galaxy maps of the continuum emission at 24um from Spitzer/MIPS, and at
70um, 100um, and 160um from PACS were combined to obtain a map of the TIR. TIR
and [CII] intensities are correlated over more than two orders of magnitude.
The range of TIR translates to a range of far ultraviolet (FUV) emission of
G0,obs~2 to 200 in units of the average Galactic radiation field. The binned
[CII]/TIR ratio drops with rising TIR, with large, but decreasing scatter. Fits
of modified black bodies (MBBs) to the continuum emission were used to estimate
dust mass surface densities and total gas column densities. A correction for
possible foreground absorption by cold gas was applied to the [OI] data before
comparing it with models of photon dominated regions (PDRs). Most of the ratios
of [CII]/[OI] and ([CII]+[OI])/TIR are consistent with two model solutions. The
median ratios are consistent with one solution at n~2x10^2 cm-3, G0~60, and and
a second low-FUV solution at n~10^4 cm-3, G0~1.5. The bulk of the gas along the
lines-of-sight is represented by a low-density, high-FUV phase with low beam

wavelength-dependent lags, $\tau(\lambda)$, generally follow the relation
$\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{4/3}$, as expected for the $T\propto R^{-3/4}$
profile of a steady-state optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk,
though can also be fit by $\tau(\lambda) \propto \lambda^{2}$, as expected for
a slim disk. The exceptions are the u and U band, where an excess lag is
observed, as has been observed in other AGN and attributed to continuum
emission arising in the broad-line region. Furthermore, we perform a flux-flux
analysis to separate the constant and variable components of the spectral
energy distribution, finding that the flux-dependence of the variable component
is consistent with the $f_\nu\propto\nu^{1/3}$ spectrum expected for a
geometrically-thin accretion disk. Moreover, the X-ray to UV lag is
significantly offset from an extrapolation of the UV/optical trend, with the
X-rays showing a poorer correlation with the UV than the UV does with the
optical. The magnitude of the UV/optical lags is consistent with a highly
super-Eddington accretion rate.

infinity of such self localized eigenstates for which the wave packet gets
trapped inside a characteristic cluster of atomic sites. An analytical
prescription to detect those dispersionless states has been demonstrated
elaborately. The states are localized over clusters of increasing sizes,
displaying the existence of a multitude of localization areas. The onset of
localization can, in principle, be delayed in space by an appropriate choice of
the energy of the electron. The response of the system with the modulation of
the anisotropy parameter is also studied. Supportive calculation of spectral

the analytical results. Variation of effective mass tensor cites re-entrant

the concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target
domains. However, in practice, it is common that the source images are not
available in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in
medical imaging, for instance, when the source and target images come from
different clinical sites. We propose a novel formulation for adapting
segmentation networks, which relaxes such a constraint. Our formulation is
based on minimizing a label-free entropy loss defined over target-domain data,
which we further guide with a domain invariant prior on the segmentation
regions. Many priors can be used, derived from anatomical information. Here, a
class-ratio prior is learned via an auxiliary network and integrated in the
form of a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in our overall loss function. We
show the effectiveness of our prior-aware entropy minimization in adapting
spine segmentation across different MRI modalities. Our method yields
comparable results to several state-of-the-art adaptation techniques, even
though is has access to less information, the source images being absent in the

route guidance and provides theoretical bases and technical support for
advanced traffic management and control. The state-of-the art procedure for
estimating arterial TTD commonly assumes that the path travel time follows a
certain distribution without considering segment correlation. However, this
approach is usually unrealistic as travel times on successive segments may be
dependent. In this study, copula functions are used to model arterial TTD as
copulas are able to incorporate for segment correlation. First, segment
correlation is empirically investigated using day-to-day GPS data provided by
BMW Group for one major urban arterial in Munich, Germany. Segment TTDs are
estimated using a finite Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Next, several copula
models are introduced, namely Gaussian, Student-t, Clayton, and Gumbel, to
model the dependent structure between segment TTDs. The parameters of each
copula model are obtained by Maximum Log Likelihood Estimation. Then, path TTDs
comprised of consecutive segment TTDs are estimated based on the copula models.
The scalability of the model is evaluated by investigating the performance for
an increasing number of aggregated links. The best fitting copula is determined
in terms of goodness-of-fit test. The results demonstrate the advantage of the
proposed copula model for an increasing number of aggregated segments, compared
to the convolution without incorporating segment correlations.

characterized by a phase in which the shocked gas becomes radiative with an
effective adiabatic index $\gamma \simeq 1$. Using the result that the
post-shock gas is compressed into a shell of width $\Delta R/R \simeq \delta$,

exploits this compressive behavior in the limit that $\gamma \rightarrow 1$

pressure, and velocity in the small quantity $\delta$. We demonstrate that the
leading-order (in $\delta$) solutions, which are increasingly accurate as
$\gamma \rightarrow 1$, can be written in simple, closed forms when the fluid
is still approximated to be in the energy-conserving regime (i.e., the
Sedov-Taylor limit), and that the density declines exponentially rapidly with
distance behind the shock. We also analyze the solutions for the bubble
surrounding a stellar or galactic wind that interacts with its surroundings,
and derive expressions for the location of the contact discontinuity that
separates the shocked ambient gas from the shocked wind. We discuss the

solely to the studies of relatively rare megaparsec-scale radio galaxies in the
Universe, called giant radio galaxies (GRGs). We have identified 162 new GRGs
primarily from the NVSS with sizes ranging from ~0.71 Mpc to 2.82 Mpc in the
redshift range of ~0.03 - 0.95, of which 23 are hosted by quasars (giant radio
quasars, GRQs). As part of the project SAGAN, we have created a database of all
known GRGs, the GRG catalogue, from the literature (including our new sample);
it includes 820 sources. For the first time, we present the multi-wavelength
properties of the largest sample of GRGs. Our results establish that the
distributions of the radio spectral index and the black hole mass of GRGs do
not differ from the corresponding distributions of normal-sized radio galaxies
(RGs). However, GRGs have a lower Eddington ratio (ER) than RGs. Using the
mid-infrared data, we classified GRGs in terms of their accretion mode: either
a high-power radiatively efficient high-excitation state, or a radiatively
inefficient low-excitation state. We find that GRGs in high-excitation state
statistically have larger sizes, stronger radio power, jet kinetic power, and
higher ER than those in low-excitation state. Our analysis reveals a strong
correlation between the ER and the scaled jet kinetic power, which suggests a
disc-jet coupling. Our environmental study reveals that ~10% of all GRGs may
reside at the centres of galaxy clusters, in a denser galactic environment,
while the majority appears to reside in a sparse environment. We find that the
probability of BCG as a GRG is quite low. We present new results for GRGs that
range from black hole mass to large-scale environment properties. We discuss
their formation and growth scenarios, highlighting the key physical factors
that cause them to reach their gigantic size. Abridged.

in observed intensity image shapes between the radio and optical bands. We also
show that the degree of the polarization spectrum undergoes a gradual variation
from the low- to the high-polarization regime above the intensity of the

two regimes is zero or 90 degrees. Thus, simultaneous multi-wave band
polarimetric observations of GRB afterglows would be a new determinative test

Using a scheme of Cercignani and Lampis and of Zaremba, we point out that the

amended to prevent the disappearance of charges at the surface. Different

macroscopic model, the assumption of specular reflection of Ritchie and
Marusak, a hydrodynamic model with a composite charge density (partially

brief, we first prove that the optimization objective in the dual linear
program of a finite CMDP is a piece-wise linear convex function (PWLC) with
respect to the Lagrange penalty multipliers. Next, we propose a novel two-level
Gradient-Aware Search (GAS) algorithm which exploits the PWLC structure to find
the optimal state-value function and Lagrange penalty multipliers of a finite
CMDP. The proposed algorithm is applied in two stochastic control problems with
constraints: robot navigation in a grid world and solar-powered unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV)-based wireless network management. We empirically compare the
convergence performance of the proposed GAS algorithm with binary search (BS),
Lagrangian primal-dual optimization (PDO), and Linear Programming (LP).
Compared with benchmark algorithms, it is shown that the proposed GAS algorithm
converges to the optimal solution faster, does not require hyper-parameter
tuning, and is not sensitive to initialization of the Lagrange penalty
multiplier.

the location of a wakefield-generating source. The methods presented derive the
longitudinal profile of a charged particle beam solely from measurement of the
time-resolved centroid energy change due to wakefield effects. The
reconstruction technique is based on a deconvolution algorithm that is fully
generalizable to any analytically or numerically calculable Green's function
for the wakefield excitation mechanism. This method is shown to yield precise
features in the longitudinal current distribution reconstruction. We
demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of this technique using simulations and
experimental examples, in both plasmas and dielectric structures, and compare
to the experimentally measured longitudinal beam parameters as available. The
limits of resolution and applicability to relevant scenarios are also examined.

($n$) is much smaller then the number of predictors ($p$) is a major challenge
in modern statistics. Sorted L-One Penalized Estimation (SLOPE), a
generalization of the lasso, is a promising method within this setting. Current
numerical procedures for SLOPE, however, lack the efficiency that respective
tools for the lasso enjoy, particularly in the context of estimating a complete
regularization path. A key component in the efficiency of the lasso is
predictor screening rules: rules that allow predictors to be discarded before
estimating the model. This is the first paper to establish such a rule for
SLOPE. We develop a screening rule for SLOPE by examining its subdifferential
and show that this rule is a generalization of the strong rule for the lasso.
Our rule is heuristic, which means that it may discard predictors erroneously.
We present conditions under which this may happen and show that such situations
are rare and easily safeguarded against by a simple check of the optimality
conditions. Our numerical experiments show that the rule performs well in
practice, leading to improvements by orders of magnitude for data in the $p \gg
n$ domain, as well as incurring no additional computational overhead when $n
\gg p$. We also examine the effect of correlation structures in the design
matrix on the rule and discuss algorithmic strategies for employing the rule.
Finally, we provide an efficient implementation of the rule in our R package
SLOPE.

most competitive constraint in this mass range. A crucial feature of the spin-2

to have followed the protocol. A dispute can be resolved if any third party can
unambiguously determine who is right. We systematically characterize all

known that generic modifications of teleparallel gravity are not invariant

computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches resolve of the flow fields on

study. However, closures must be introduced to reflect the underlying physics
in multiphase flow. Among them, the interfacial forces, including drag, lift,
turbulent-dispersion and wall-lubrication forces, play an important role in
bubble distribution and migration in liquid-vapor two-phase flows. Development
of those closures traditionally rely on the experimental data and analytical
derivation with simplified assumptions that usually cannot deliver a universal
solution across a wide range of flow conditions. In this paper, a data-driven
approach, named as feature-similarity measurement (FSM), is developed and
applied to improve the simulation capability of two-phase flow with coarse-mesh
CFD approach. Interfacial momentum transfer in adiabatic bubbly flow serves as
the focus of the present study. Both a mature and a simplified set of
interfacial closures are taken as the low-fidelity data. Validation data
(including relevant experimental data and validated fine-mesh CFD simulations
results) are adopted as high-fidelity data. Qualitative and quantitative
analysis are performed in this paper. These reveal that FSM can substantially
improve the prediction of the coarse-mesh CFD model, regardless of the choice
of interfacial closures, and it provides scalability and consistency across
discontinuous flow regimes. It demonstrates that data-driven methods can aid

an unbalanced power flow model. This method is applicable to aggregate only the

Accordingly, two power aggregation models with two-stage optimization are
developed: one focuses on aggregating active power and computes its optimal

elliptical feasible regions for the aggregate active-reactive power. By
leveraging the ARO technique, the disaggregation feasibility of the obtained

Neural Networks in terms of accuracy and training time [1]. While FPGA-based
inference accelerators for classic CNNs are widespread, literature is lacking
in a quantitative evaluation of their usability on inference for TCN models. In
this paper we present such an evaluation, considering a CNN accelerator with
specific features supporting TCN kernels as a reference and a set of
state-of-the-art TCNs as a benchmark. Experimental results show that, during
TCN execution, operational intensity can be critical for the overall
performance. We propose a convolution scheduling based on batch processing that
can boost efficiency up to 96% of theoretical peak performance. Overall we can
achieve up to 111,8 GOPS/s and power efficiency of 33,9 GOPS/s/W on an
Ultrascale+ ZU3EG (up to 10x speedup and 3x power efficiency improvement with
respect to pure software implementation).

perturbations that lead to a net torque and thus orbital migration of the body.
Linear theory has shown that this heating torque gives rise to a migration term
linear in the body's mass that can oppose or even reverse that arising from the
sum of gravitational Lindblad and co-orbital torques. We use high-resolution
local simulations in an unstratified disk to assess the accuracy and domain of
applicability of the linear theory. We find agreement between analytic and
simulation results to better than 10\% in the appropriate regime (low
luminosity, low thermal conductivity), but measure deviations in the non-linear
(high luminosity) regime and in the high thermal conductivity regime. In the
non-linear regime, linear theory overpredicts the acceleration due to the
heating torque, which we find to be due to the neglect of non-linear terms in
the heat flux. In the high thermal conductivity regime linear theory
underpredicts the acceleration, although here both non-linear and computational
constraints play a role. We discuss the impact of the heating torque for the
evolution of low-mass planets in protoplanetary disks, and for massive stars or
accreting compact objects embedded in AGN disks. For the latter case, we show
that the thermal torque is likely to be the dominant physical effect at disk
radii where the optical depth drops below a critical value.

the most appealing as it exploits its own knowledge and requires no extra
models. However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as
training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise
while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one
is better?
  To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions--deep
neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise [3] and minimum
entropy regularisation principle [10]--we propose a novel end-to-end method
named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy.
Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its
predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been
trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence).
For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is
better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner
toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments
in both clean and noisy settings. The source code is available at

quadrupole deformation of a nucleus and present a challenge for many nuclear
theories. Mirror nuclei in the vicinity of the line of $N=Z$ represent a
convenient laboratory for testing deficiencies in such models, making use of
the isospin-symmetry of the systems. Purpose: Uncertainties associated with
literature $E2$ strengths in \textsuperscript{23}Mg are some of the largest in
$T_z=\left|\frac{1}{2}\right|$ nuclei in the $sd$-shell. The purpose of the
present work is to improve the precision with which these values are known, to
enable better comparison with theoretical models. Methods: Coulomb-excitation
measurements of $^{23}$Mg and $^{23}$Na were performed at the TRIUMF-ISAC
facility using the TIGRESS spectrometer. They were used to determine the $E2$
matrix elements of mixed $E2$/$M1$ transitions. Results: Reduced $E2$
transition strengths, $B(E2)$, were extracted for \textsuperscript{23}Mg and
\textsuperscript{23}Na. Their precision was improved by factors of
approximately six for both isotopes, while agreeing within uncertainties with
previous measurements. Conclusions: A comparison was made with both shell-model
and {\it ab initio} valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group
calculations. Valence-space in-medium similarity-renormalization-group
calculations were found to underpredict the absolute $E2$ strength - in
agreement with previous studies.

noncooperative strategic interactions among the agents of a finite collection
of populations. Each agent selects one strategy at a time and revises it
repeatedly according to a protocol that typically prioritizes strategies whose
payoffs are either higher than that of the current strategy or exceed the
population average. The model is predicated on well-established research in
population and evolutionary games, and has two sub-components. The first is the
payoff dynamics model (PDM), which ascribes the payoff to each strategy
according to the proportions of every population adopting the available
strategies. The second sub-component is the evolutionary dynamics model (EDM)
that accounts for the revision process. In our model, the social state at
equilibrium is a best response to the payoff, and can be viewed as a Nash-like
solution that has predictive value when it is globally asymptotically stable
(GAS). We present a systematic methodology that ascertains GAS by checking
separately whether the EDM and PDM satisfy appropriately defined
system-theoretic dissipativity properties. Our work generalizes pioneering
methods based on notions of contractivity applicable to memoryless PDMs, and
more general system-theoretic passivity conditions. As demonstrated with
examples, the added flexibility afforded by our approach is particularly useful
when the contraction properties of the PDM are unequal across populations.

egocentric video. Existing video summarization algorithms can accelerate
browsing such videos by selecting (visually) interesting shots from them.
Nonetheless, since the system user still has to watch the summary videos,
browsing large video databases remain a challenge. Hence, in this work, we
propose to generate a textual synopsis, consisting of a few sentences
describing the most important events in a long egocentric videos. Users can
read the short text to gain insight about the video, and more importantly,
efficiently search through the content of a large video database using text
queries. Since egocentric videos are long and contain many activities and

many of which are incorrect. Therefore, we propose a multi-task learning scheme
to simultaneously generate descriptions for video segments and summarize the

and the network generates a text description for each shot. Next,
visual-language content matching unit that is trained with a weakly supervised
objective, identifies the correct descriptions. Finally, the last component of
our network, called purport network, evaluates the descriptions all together to
select the ones containing crucial information. Out of thousands of
descriptions generated for the video, a few informative sentences are returned

Furthermore, the mechanism by which the choice is made is opaque to the

we introduce Rocket, a Tinder-like User Interface for a general class of IESs.
Rocket provides a visual representation of Artificial Intelligence

decide whether the material meets their needs. The student can choose between
engaging with the material and receiving a new recommendation by swiping or
tapping. Rocket offers the following potential improvements for IES User

the vast number of possible states and measurements by characterizing its
essential function as a description of causality relations between initial

description of causality must involve non-positive statistical elements that
cannot be associated with any directly observable effects. The necessity of
non-positive elements is demonstrated by the uniquely defined mathematical
description of ideal correlations which explains the physics of maximally
entangled states, quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. The operator
formalism thus modifies the concept of causality by providing a universally
valid description of deterministic relations between initial states and
subsequent observations that cannot be expressed in terms of directly
observable measurement outcomes. Instead, the identifiable elements of
causality are necessarily non-positive and hence unobservable. The validity of
the operator algebra therefore indicates that a consistent explanation of the
various uncertainty limited phenomena associated with physical objects is only
possible if we learn to accept the fact that the elements of causality cannot
be reconciled with a continuation of observable reality in the physical object.

geometric orientation (similarity transform parameters) of the chest and

secondary particles moves toward the surface. Some of these secondary particles
are charged muons that subsequently enter Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) on
the ground. Many of these muons, traveling near the speed of light in vacuum,
are moving faster than the speed of light in water and so trigger isotropic
Cherenkov radiation in the WCDs. Inside many WCDs are photomultiplier tubes
(PMTs) that detect this Cherenkov radiation. When the radial component of the
speed of a muon toward a PMT drops from superluminal to subluminal, the PMT
will record Cherenkov light from a little-known optical phenomenon called
Relativistic Image Doubling (RID). Were the RID-detecting PMTs replaced by high

suddenly appear inside the tank, with one image moving with a velocity

Especially, automated severity assessment of COVID-19 in CT images plays an
essential role in identifying cases that are in great need of intensive
clinical care. However, it is often challenging to accurately assess the
severity of this disease in CT images, due to variable infection regions in the
lungs, similar imaging biomarkers, and large inter-case variations. To this
end, we propose a synergistic learning framework for automated severity
assessment of COVID-19 in 3D CT images, by jointly performing lung lobe
segmentation and multi-instance classification. Considering that only a few
infection regions in a CT image are related to the severity assessment, we
first represent each input image by a bag that contains a set of 2D image
patches (with each cropped from a specific slice). A multi-task multi-instance
deep network (called M$^2$UNet) is then developed to assess the severity of
COVID-19 patients and also segment the lung lobe simultaneously. Our M$^2$UNet
consists of a patch-level encoder, a segmentation sub-network for lung lobe
segmentation, and a classification sub-network for severity assessment (with a
unique hierarchical multi-instance learning strategy). Here, the context
information provided by segmentation can be implicitly employed to improve the
performance of severity assessment. Extensive experiments were performed on a
real COVID-19 CT image dataset consisting of 666 chest CT images, with results
suggesting the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to several
state-of-the-art methods.

propulsion via a sawtooth-like, rise-and-fall trajectory. Because gliders are
slow-moving relative to ocean currents, glider control must consider the effect
of oceanic flows. In previous work, we proposed a method to control underwater
vehicles in the (horizontal) plane by describing such oceanic flows in terms of
streamlines, which are the level sets of stream functions. However, the general
analytical form of streamlines in 3D is unknown. In this paper, we show how
streamline control can be used in 3D environments by assuming a 2.5D model of
ocean currents. We provide an efficient algorithm that acts as a steering
function for a single rise or dive component of the glider's sawtooth
trajectory, integrate this algorithm within a sampling-based motion planning
framework to support long-distance path planning, and provide several examples
in simulation in comparison with a baseline method. The key to our method's
computational efficiency is an elegant dimensionality reduction to a 1D control
region. Streamline-based control can be integrated within various
sampling-based frameworks and allows for online planning for gliders in
complicated oceanic flows.

study how the nonequilibrium environments (with different temperatures or
chemical potentials) influence the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. The
nonequilibrium environments can have constructive effects on the entanglement
and the Bell nonlocality. Nonequilibrium thermodynamic cost can sustain the
thermal energy or particle current and enhance the entanglement and the Bell
nonlocality. However, the nonequilibrium conditions (characterized by the
temperature differences or the thermodynamic cost quantified by the entropy
production rates) which give the maximal violation of the Bell inequalities are
different from the nonequilibrium conditions which give the maximal
entanglement. When the Bell inequality has asymmetric observables (between
Alice and Bob), for example the $I_{3322}$ inequality, such asymmetry can also
be reflected from the effects under the nonequilibrium environments. The
spatial asymmetric two-qubit system coupled with nonequilibrium bosonic
environments shows the thermal rectification effect, which can be witnessed by
the Bell nonlocality. Different spatial asymmetric factors can be linearly
cancelled with each other in the thermal rectification effect, which is also
reflected on the changes of the entanglement and the Bell nonlocality. Our
study demonstrates that the nonequilibrium environments are both valuable for
the entanglement and Bell nonlocality resources, based on different optimal

Probability-driven Black-box Attack (PPBA) to tackle this problem by reducing
the solution space and providing better optimization. For reducing the solution
space, we first model the adversarial perturbation optimization problem as a
process of recovering frequency-sparse perturbations with compressed sensing,
under the setting that random noise in the low-frequency space is more likely
to be adversarial. We then propose a simple method to construct a low-frequency
constrained sensing matrix, which works as a plug-and-play projection matrix to
reduce the dimensionality. Such a sensing matrix is shown to be flexible enough
to be integrated into existing methods like NES and Bandits$_{TD}$. For better
optimization, we perform a random walk with a probability-driven strategy,
which utilizes all queries over the whole progress to make full use of the
sensing matrix for a less query budget. Extensive experiments show that our
method requires at most 24% fewer queries with a higher attack success rate
compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Finally, the attack method is
evaluated on the real-world online service, i.e., Google Cloud Vision API,

symmetric move probabilities, and constant step duration) with an
origin-directed detachment bias. By tuning the time dependence of the
detachment bias, we find through analytical calculations and trajectory
simulations that the system can exhibit a broad range of anomalous diffusion,
extending beyond conventional diffusion to superdiffusion and even
superballistic motion. We analytically determine that protocols with a
time-increasing detachment lead to an ensemble-averaged velocity increasing in
time, thereby providing the effective acceleration that is required to push the

goals, Chile has implemented a $5 per tonne of CO2 emission tax, first of its
kind in Latin America. However, such a low price has proven to be insufficient.
In our work, we study an alternative approach for capping and pricing carbon
emissions in the Chilean electric sector; the cap and trade paradigm. We model
the Chilean electric market (generators and emissions auctioneer) as a two
stage capacity expansion equilibrium problem, where we allow future investment
and trading of emission permits among generator agents. The model studies
generation and future investments in the Chilean electric sector in two regimes
of demand: deterministic and stochastic. We show that the current Chilean
Greenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity pledge does not drive an important shift in
the future Chilean electric matrix. To encourage a shift to greener
technologies, a more stringent carbon budget must be considered, resulting in a
carbon price approximately ten times higher than the present one. We also show
that achieving the emissions reduction goal does not necessarily results in
further reductions of carbon generation, or phasing out coal in the longer

higher demand scenarios will relax the need for stringent carbon budgets to
achieve new renewable energy investments and hence meet the Chilean pledges.
These results suggest that some aspects of the Chilean pledge require further

each language has its own linguistic and pronunciation rules, the lip movements
of all languages share similar patterns due to the common structures of human

multilingual setting here. Phonemes are more closely related with the lip
movements than the alphabet letters. At the same time, similar phonemes always
lead to similar visual patterns no matter which type the target language is.
Then, a novel SBL block is proposed to learn the rules for each language in a
fill-in-the-blank way. Specifically, the model has to learn to infer the target
unit given its bidirectional context, which could represent the composition
rules of phonemes for each language. To make the learning process more targeted
at each particular language, an extra task of predicting the language identity
is introduced in the learning process. Finally, a thorough comparison on LRW

benefits from the synergized learning of different languages and also reports a

at least one wire from every qubit to the control electronics, leading to a
so-called wiring bottleneck for scaling. Demultiplexing via on-chip circuitry
offers an effective strategy to overcome this bottleneck. In the case of
gate-defined quantum dot arrays, specific static voltages need to be applied to
many gates simultaneously to realize electron confinement. When a
charge-locking structure is placed between the quantum device and the
demultiplexer, the voltage can be maintained locally. In this study, we
implement a switched-capacitor circuit for charge-locking and use it to float
the plunger gate of a single quantum dot. Parallel plate capacitors,
transistors and quantum dot devices are monolithically fabricated on a
Si/SiGe-based substrate to avoid complex off-chip routing. We experimentally
study the effects of the capacitor and transistor size on the voltage accuracy
of the floating node. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the electrochemical
potential of the quantum dot can follow a 100 Hz pulse signal while the dot is
partially floating, which is essential for applying this strategy in qubit
experiments.

In this paper, an efficient BNN inference flow is proposed to reduce the

About half of the computations could be eliminated compared to the traditional

Subsequently, in order to resolve the hardware resource limitations, a

orientation (latitude, longitude and azimuth angle) of a camera at ground level
given a large-scale database of geo-tagged aerial (e.g., satellite) images.
Existing approaches treat the task as a pure location estimation problem by
learning discriminative feature descriptors, but neglect orientation alignment.
It is well-recognized that knowing the orientation between ground and aerial
images can significantly reduce matching ambiguity between these two views,
especially when the ground-level images have a limited Field of View (FoV)
instead of a full field-of-view panorama. Therefore, we design a Dynamic
Similarity Matching network to estimate cross-view orientation alignment during
localization. In particular, we address the cross-view domain gap by applying a
polar transform to the aerial images to approximately align the images up to an
unknown azimuth angle. Then, a two-stream convolutional network is used to
learn deep features from the ground and polar-transformed aerial images.
Finally, we obtain the orientation by computing the correlation between
cross-view features, which also provides a more accurate measure of feature
similarity, improving location recall. Experiments on standard datasets
demonstrate that our method significantly improves state-of-the-art
performance. Remarkably, we improve the top-1 location recall rate on the CVUSA
dataset by a factor of 1.5x for panoramas with known orientation, by a factor
of 3.3x for panoramas with unknown orientation, and by a factor of 6x for
180-degree FoV images with unknown orientation.

utilize CNNs to translate histopathological images into precise diagnostics.
This is challenging since these complex biopsies are heterogeneous and require
multiple levels of assessment. This is mainly due to structural similarities in
different parts of the GI tract and shared features among different gut
diseases. Addressing this problem with a flat model that assumes all classes
(parts of the gut and their diseases) are equally difficult to distinguish
leads to an inadequate assessment of each class. Since the hierarchical model
restricts classification error to each sub-class, it leads to a more
informative model than a flat model. In this paper, we propose to apply the
hierarchical classification of biopsy images from different parts of the GI
tract and the receptive diseases within each. We embedded a class hierarchy
into the plain VGGNet to take advantage of its layers' hierarchical structure.
The proposed model was evaluated using an independent set of image patches from
373 whole slide images. The results indicate that the hierarchical model can
achieve better results than the flat model for multi-category diagnosis of GI

characteristic differences in their oscillator strength. It allows us to
quantitatively extract trion populations from time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements and monitor their dynamics after off-resonant optical injection.
At liquid helium temperature we observe pronounced non-equilibrium distribution
of the trions during their lifetime with comparatively slow equilibration that
occurs on time-scales up to several 100's of ps. In addition, we find an
intriguing regime of population inversion at lowest excitation densities that
builds up and is maintained during 10's of picoseconds. With increased lattice
temperature the equilibrium is established more rapidly and the inversion
disappears, highlighting the role of thermal activation for efficient
scattering between exchange-split trions.

  Folding","Accepted by CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point cloud completion aims to infer the complete geometries for missing
regions of 3D objects from incomplete ones. Previous methods usually predict
the complete point cloud based on the global shape representation extracted
from the incomplete input. However, the global representation often suffers
from the information loss of structure details on local regions of incomplete
point cloud. To address this problem, we propose Skip-Attention Network
(SA-Net) for 3D point cloud completion. Our main contributions lie in the
following two-folds. First, we propose a skip-attention mechanism to
effectively exploit the local structure details of incomplete point clouds
during the inference of missing parts. The skip-attention mechanism selectively
conveys geometric information from the local regions of incomplete point clouds
for the generation of complete ones at different resolutions, where the
skip-attention reveals the completion process in an interpretable way. Second,
in order to fully utilize the selected geometric information encoded by
skip-attention mechanism at different resolutions, we propose a novel
structure-preserving decoder with hierarchical folding for complete shape
generation. The hierarchical folding preserves the structure of complete point
cloud generated in upper layer by progressively detailing the local regions,
using the skip-attentioned geometry at the same resolution. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets, which demonstrate
that the proposed SA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art point cloud
completion methods.

aerial access points (APs) owing to better aerodynamic performance and longer
flight endurance. However, the inherent hovering feature of fixed-wing UAVs may
result in discontinuity of connections and frequent handover of ground users
(GUs). In this work, we model and evaluate the performance of a fixed-wing UAV
network, where UAV APs provide coverage to GUs with millimeter wave backhaul.
Firstly, it reveals that network spatial throughput (ST) is independent of the
hover radius under real-time closest-UAV association, while linearly decreases
with the hover radius if GUs are associated with the UAVs, whose hover center
is the closest. Secondly, network ST is shown to be greatly degraded with the
over-deployment of UAV APs due to the growing air-to-ground interference under
excessive overlap of UAV cells. Finally, aiming to alleviate the interference,
a projection area equivalence (PAE) rule is designed to tune the UAV beamwidth.
Especially, network ST can be sustainably increased with growing UAV density
and independent of UAV flight altitude if UAV beamwidth inversely grows with
the square of UAV density under PAE.

us to study the nonclassical rotational inertia, which can lead to a negative
superfluid fraction in the case of fermions [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{112},

results for a more advanced center-two particle correlation function [Phys.
Rev. E \textbf{91}, 043104 (2015)], which allows to detect differences between
Fermi- and Bose-systems that do not manifest in other observables like the
density. Overall, we find that bosonic systems sensitively react to even small
values of the dipole--dipole coupling strength, whereas such a weak interaction
is effectively masked for fermions by the Pauli exclusion principle. In
addition, the abnormal superfluid fraction for fermions is not reflected by the
structural properties of the system, which are equal to the bosonic case even
though the moments of inertia diverge from each other. Lastly, we have
demonstrated that fermionic PIMC simulations of quantum dipole systems are
feasible despite the notorious fermion sign problem, which opens up new avenues

trends and limitations with respect to carrier mobilities, conductivities, p-
and n-type doping. Undoped diamond is an insulator with conductivities
significantly smaller than 10^-17 Ohmcm at room temperature. Mostly, these
insulating films show conductivity activation energies of 1.7 eV, an indication
that small amounts of substitutional nitrogen dominates the Fermi-level. The
electron and hole mobilities are very high (> 20.000 cm2/Vs at T = 80 K) and
are limited by acoustic phonon scattering. By phosphorus and boron doping
diamond becomes semiconducting with an n-type donor activation energy
(phosphorus) of 600 meV and an acceptor activation energy (boron) of 370 meV.
Both dopands are hydrogen-like in nature. Due to the deep donor levels
conductivity at room temperature is limited, electronic application will
therefore be high-temperature devices. Both, electrons and holes show nearly
the same mobilities which is promising for bi-polar applications, however, due
to the very different doping levels low temperature devices will be governed by
holes with increasing contribution of electrons towards higher temperatures.
The effect of temperature on the carrier activation from donors and acceptors,
on carrier scattering as well as on transport via hopping is shown in
combination with some basic physical models and descriptions. The results
confirm the superior electronic properties of diamond which makes it very
promising for future electronic applications.

combination of other data points have achieved great success in computer vision
applications such as motion segmentation, face and digit clustering. In face
clustering, the subspaces are linear and subspace clustering methods can be
applied directly. In motion segmentation, the subspaces are affine and an
additional affine constraint on the coefficients is often enforced. However,
since affine subspaces can always be embedded into linear subspaces of one
extra dimension, it is unclear if the affine constraint is really necessary.
This paper shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when the dimension
of the ambient space is high relative to the sum of the dimensions of the
affine subspaces, the affine constraint has a negligible effect on clustering
performance. Specifically, our analysis provides conditions that guarantee the
correctness of affine subspace clustering methods both with and without the
affine constraint, and shows that these conditions are satisfied for
high-dimensional data. Underlying our analysis is the notion of affinely
independent subspaces, which not only provides geometrically interpretable
correctness conditions, but also clarifies the relationships between existing
results for affine subspace clustering.

singularly perturbed two-well models for materials undergoing solid-solid phase
transitions in any space dimensions, and we perform a simultaneous passage to
sharp-interface and small-strain limits. Sequences of deformations with
equibounded energies are decomposed via suitable Caccioppoli partitions into
the sum of piecewise constant rigid movements and suitably rescaled
displacements. These converge to limiting partitions, deformations, and
displacements, respectively. Whereas limiting deformations are simple laminates
whose gradients only attain two values, the limiting displacements belong to
the class of special functions with bounded variation (SBV). The latter feature
elastic contributions measuring the distance to simple laminates, as well as
jumps associated to two consecutive phase transitions having vanishing
distance, and thus not being detected by the limiting deformations. By
Gamma-convergence we identify an effective limiting model given by the sum of a
quadratic linearized elastic energy in terms of displacements along with two
surface terms. The first one is proportional to the total length of interfaces
created by jumps in the gradient of the limiting deformation. The second one is
proportional to twice the total length of interfaces created by jumps in the
limiting displacement, as well as by the boundaries of limiting partitions. A
main tool of our analysis is a novel two-well rigidity estimate which has been

simultaneously provide robust fat suppression and efficient T2 preparation
without requiring an additional fat suppression module for T2-weighted imaging
at 3T. Methods: The tip-down RF pulse of an adiabatic T2 preparation (T2-Prep)
module was replaced by a custom-designed RF excitation pulse that induces a
phase difference between water and fat, resulting in a simultaneous T2
preparation of water signals and the suppression of fat signals at the end of
the module (now called a phaser adiabatic T2-Prep). Using numerical
simulations, in vitro and in vivo ECG-triggered navigator gated acquisitions of
the human heart, the blood, myocardium and fat signal-to-noise ratio and right
coronary artery (RCA) vessel sharpness using this approach were compared
against previously published conventional adiabatic T2-Prep approaches Results:
Numerical simulations predicted an increased fat suppression bandwidth and
decreased sensitivity against transmit magnetic field inhomogeneities using the
proposed approach, while preserving the water T2 preparation capabilities. This
was confirmed by the tissue signals acquired on the phantom and the in vivo
MRA, which show similar blood and myocardium SNR and CNR and significantly
reduced fat SNR compared to the other methods tested. As a result, the RCA
conspicuity was significantly increased and the motion artifacts were visually
decreased. Conclusion: A novel fat-suppressing T2-preparation method was
developed and implemented that demonstrated robust fat suppression and
increased vessel sharpness compared with conventional techniques, while

electrically induced magnetization precession in the ""free"" layer of MTJ, which
generates the spin pumping into a metallic or semiconducting overlayer. We
theoretically describe the spin and charge dynamics in the
CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Au(GaAs) heterostructures. First, the magnedynamics in the free
CoFeB layer is quantified with the account of a spin-transfer torque and a
voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the
magnetodynamics equation, we determine dependences of the precession amplitude
on the frequency $f$ and magnitude $V_\mathrm{max}$ of the ac voltage applied
to the MTJ. It is found that the frequency dependence changes drastically above
the threshold amplitude $V_\mathrm{max} \approx 200$mV, exhibiting a break at
the resonance frequency $f_\mathrm{res}$ due to nonlinear effects. The results
obtained for the magnetization dynamics are used to describe the spin injection
and pumping into the Au and GaAs overlayers. Since the generated spin current
creates additional charge current owing to the inverse spin Hall effect, we
also calculate distribution of the electric potential in the thick Au
overlayer. The calculations show that the arising transverse voltage becomes
experimentally measurable at $f = f_\mathrm{res}$. Finally, we evaluate the
spin accumulation in a long n$^+$-GaAs bar coupled to the MTJ and determine its
temporal variation and spatial distribution along the bar. It is found that the
spin accumulation under resonant excitation is large enough for experimental

Nevertheless, the evaluation of such an automatic analysis is often incomplete
or simply wrong. Algorithms are often only tested on small and biased datasets,
and cross-dataset evaluations are rarely performed. A clear understanding of
evaluation metrics and machine learning models with cross datasets is crucial
to bring research in the field to a new quality level. Towards this goal, we
present comprehensive evaluations of five distinct machine learning models
using Global Features and Deep Neural Networks that can classify 16 different
key types of GI tract conditions, including pathological findings, anatomical
landmarks, polyp removal conditions, and normal findings from images captured
by common GI tract examination instruments. In our evaluation, we introduce
performance hexagons using six performance metrics such as recall, precision,
specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient to
demonstrate how to determine the real capabilities of models rather than
evaluating them shallowly. Furthermore, we perform cross-dataset evaluations
using different datasets for training and testing. With these cross-dataset
evaluations, we demonstrate the challenge of actually building a generalizable
model that could be used across different hospitals. Our experiments clearly
show that more sophisticated performance metrics and evaluation methods need to
be applied to get reliable models rather than depending on evaluations of the
splits of the same dataset, i.e., the performance metrics should always be
interpreted together rather than relying on a single metric.

Then, the fraction of the confined states, which plays an important role for

the introduction of the Coulomb interactions immediately induces the finite

challenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because regular
CNNs can only exploit translation invariance, ignoring further inherent
symmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and reflections. To
mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation
framework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise
representations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on
every orientation, which can effectively address the gaps of learning
symmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally
equivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layerwise symmetry
constraints. By exploiting further symmetries, novel segmentation CNNs can
dramatically reduce the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters (by
roughly 2/3) over regular CNNs. More importantly, based on our novel framework,
we show that a newly built GER-UNet outperforms its regular CNN-based
counterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods on real-world
clinical data. Specifically, the group layers of our segmentation framework can
be seamlessly integrated into any popular CNN-based segmentation architectures.

value which is very close to the 1D estimate provided by the Bethe ansatz and a
good agreement between the finite size scaling of the energies. The spin-spin

on systems that can be described by the nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation
(NLSE), by making use of the phase-space predictions of the three-wave
truncation of the spectrum. In the latter, only the fundamental frequency and
the upper and lower sidebands are retained. Plane wave solutions to the NLSE
exhibit modulation instability (MI) within a frequency band determined by a
linear stability analysis. For modulation frequencies inside the MI-band, we
experimentally demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing
during the evolution. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which
are better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We
therefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are
general. When the system is damped by the viscosity of the water, it is pulled
outside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of
the envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou
recurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside
the separatrix. Furthermore, for modulation frequencies outside the
conventional MI-band, we experimentally demonstrate that contrary to the linear
prediction, we do observe a growth and decay cycle of the plane-wave
modulation. Finally, we give a theoretical demonstration that forcing the NLSE
system can induce symmetry breaking during the evolution.

analysis of reset controllers including ones based on CgLp is mainly carried
out in the frequency domain using describing function with the assumption that

proposed to reduce memory and FLOPs of CNNs, they often involve special network

tasks with time series sensor signals, due to remarkable discrepancy.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop lightweight deep models to perform HAR.
As filter is the basic unit in constructing CNNs, it deserves further research
whether re-designing smaller filters is applicable for deep HAR. In the paper,
inspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR.
A set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for

local loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first
paper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable

specified region in the complex plane, e.g. for stabilization or oscillation
damping. The approach exploits singular value optimization in the frequency

systems. The efficiency of the approach is shown on three systems of increasing

first high-performance single stage face mask detector. First, to solve the

Second, we proposed a context attention module to focus on learning
discriminated features associated with face mask wearing states. Third, we
transferred the knowledge from the face detection task, inspired by how humans
improve their ability via learning from similar tasks. Ablation studies showed
the advantages of the proposed model. Experimental findings on both the public

an important challenge as several experiments are now delving into the

signal predictions rely on the knowledge of the DM velocity
distribution---direct searches, capture by stars, p-wave-suppressed or
Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation rate, microlensing of primordial black holes,
etc.---it is necessary to assess the accuracy of our current theoretical
handle. Beyond Maxwellian approximations or ad-hoc extrapolations of fits on
cosmological simulations, approaches have been proposed to self-consistently
derive the DM phase-space distribution only from the detailed mass content of
the Galaxy and some symmetry assumptions (e.g. the Eddington inversion and its
anisotropic extensions). Although theoretically sound, these methods are still
based on simplifying assumptions and their relevance to real galaxies can be
questioned. In this paper, we use zoomed-in cosmological simulations to
quantify the associated uncertainties. Assuming isotropy, we predict the speed
distribution and its moments from the DM and baryonic content measured in
simulations, and compare them with the true ones. Taking as input galactic mass
models fitted on full simulation data, we reach a predictivity down to ~ 10%
for some velocity-related observables, significantly better than some
Maxwellian models. This moderate theoretical error is particularly encouraging
at a time when stellar surveys like the Gaia mission should allow us to improve
constraints on Galactic mass models.

the other electron is oriented like the molecular axis in the former case and
if the electrons are distinguishable by their energy. In both scenarios, the
circularly polarized photon defines a plane with a sense of rotation and an
additional axis is defined by the CO molecule or one electron. This is
sufficient to establish an unambiguous coordinate frame of well-defined

ubiquitous, i.e., all existing algorithms more or less exhibit such

words outside vocabulary and segmentation-based decoders perform well in

the hydrogeological characterization of the subsurface up to depths of about
150m. Recently, SNMR has been adapted to investigate also the shallow
unsaturated zone with small surface loop setups. Due to the decreased volume, a
pre-polarization (PP) field prior to the classical spin excitation is applied
to enhance the measured response signal. Depending on the strength and
orientation of the applied PP-field, the enhancement can often reach several
orders of magnitude in the vicinity of the PP-loop. The theoretically
achievable enhancement depends on the assumption of an adiabatic, i.e. perfect,
switch-off of the corresponding PP-field. To study the effect of imperfect
switch-off, we incorporate full spin dynamics simulations into the SNMR forward
modeling. The affected subsurface volume strongly depends on the chosen PP
switch-off ramp and the geometry of the loop setup. Due to the imperfect
switch-off, the resulting SNMR sounding curves can have significantly decreased
signal amplitudes. For comparison, the signal amplitudes of either a 1ms
exponential or linear switch-off ramp are reduced by 17% and 65%, respectively.
Disregarding this effect would therefore yield an underestimation of the
corresponding subsurface water content of similar magnitude.

processes as graphs, whose structure is informative of biological function at
multiple scales. Simultaneously, omics technologies measure the variation or
activity of genes, proteins, or metabolites across individuals or experimental
conditions. Integrating the complementary viewpoints of biological networks and
omics data is an important task in bioinformatics, but existing methods treat
networks as discrete structures, which are intrinsically difficult to integrate
with continuous node features or activity measures. Graph neural networks map
graph nodes into a low-dimensional vector space representation, and can be
trained to preserve both the local graph structure and the similarity between
node features.
  Results: We studied the representation of transcriptional, protein-protein
and genetic interaction networks in E. Coli and mouse using graph neural
networks. We found that such representations explain a large proportion of
variation in gene expression data, and that using gene expression data as node
features improves the reconstruction of the graph from the embedding. We
further proposed a new end-to-end graph feature auto-encoder which is trained
on the feature reconstruction task, and showed that it performs better at
predicting unobserved node features than auto-encoders that are trained on the
graph reconstruction task before learning to predict node features. When
applied to the problem of imputing missing data in single-cell RNAseq data, our
graph feature auto-encoder outperformed a state-of-the-art imputation method
that does not use protein interaction information, showing the benefit of
integrating biological networks and omics data using graph representation
learning.

However most of the work on this topic tends to use the Pearson correlation
coefficient, which relies on the assumption of normality and can be brittle to
the presence of outliers, neither of which is ideal for the study of financial
returns. In this paper we study the inference of MSTs from daily US, UK and
German financial returns using Pearson and two rank correlation methods,
Spearman and Kendall's $\tau$. MSTs constructed using these rank methods tend
to be more stable and maintain more edges over the dataset than those
constructed using Pearson correlation. The edge agreement between the Pearson
and rank MSTs varies significantly depending on the state of the markets, but
the rank MSTs generally show strong agreement at all times. Deviation from
univariate normality can be related to changes in the correlation matrices but
is more difficult to connect to changes in the MSTs. Irrelevant of coefficient,
the trees tend to have similar topologies. Portfolios constructed from the MST
correlation matrices have a smaller turnover than those from the full
covariance matrix for the larger markets, but not for the smaller German
market. Using a bootstrap method we find that the correlation matrices

line-core and bisector velocities, which were contrasted with velocities
inferred from Cloud Model inversions. The SDO provided additional continuum
images, line-of-sight (LOS) magnetograms, and UV/EUV images, which link the
different solar atmospheric layers. The active region started as a bipolar
region with continuous flux emergence when a new flux system emerged in the
leading part during the VTT observations, resulting in two homologous surges.
While flux cancellation at the base of the surges provided the energy for
ejecting the cool plasma, strong proper motions of the leading pores changed
the magnetic field topology making the region susceptible for surging. Despite
the surge activity in the leading part, an arch filament system in the trailing
part of the old flux remained stable. Thus, stable and violently expelled
mass-loaded ascending magnetic structures can co-exist in close proximity.
Investigating the height dependence of LOS velocities revealed the existence of
neighboring strong up- and downflows. However, downflows occur with a time lag.
The opacity of the ejected cool plasma decreases with distance from the base of
the surge while the speed of the ejecta increases. The location at which the
surge becomes invisible in H$\alpha$ corresponds to the interface where the
surge brightens in He II 304. Broad-shoulders and dual-lobed H$\alpha$ profiles
suggest accelerated/decelerated and highly structured LOS plasma flows.
Significantly broadened H$\alpha$ profiles imply significant heating at the
base of the surges, which is also supported by bright kernels in UV/EUV images

disruptions to financial and economic markets around the globe, leading
eventually to fast stock market declines. In the past, markets have recovered
after any economic disruption. On this basis, we focus on the outbreak of
COVID-19 as a case study of an exogenous risk and analyze its impact on the
Standard and Poor's 500 (S\&P500) index. We assumed that the S\&P500 index
reaches a minimum before rising again in the not-too-distant future. Here we
present two cases to forecast the S\&P500 index. The first case uses an
estimation of expected deaths released on 02/04/2020 by the University of
Washington. For the second case, it is assumed that the peak number of deaths
will occur 2-months since the first confirmed case occurred in the USA. The
decline and recovery in the index were estimated for the following three months
after the initial point of the predicted trend. The forecast is a projection of
a prediction with stochastic fluctuations described by $q$-gaussian diffusion
process with three spatio-temporal regimes. Our forecast was made on the
premise that any market response can be decomposed into an overall
deterministic trend and a stochastic term. The prediction was based on the
deterministic part and for this case study is approximated by the extrapolation
of the S\&P500 data trend in the initial stages of the outbreak. The stochastic
fluctuations have the same structure as the one derived from the past 24 years.
A reasonable forecast was achieved with 85\% of accuracy.

be performed routinely upon maintenance and modification of mechanical systems.
An automated data-driven method for cascaded controller tuning based on
Bayesian optimization is proposed. The method is tested on a linear axis drive,
modeled using a combination of first principles model and system
identification. A custom cost function based on performance indicators derived
from system data at different candidate configurations of controller parameters
is modeled by a Gaussian process. It is further optimized by minimization of an
acquisition function which serves as a sampling criterion to determine the
subsequent candidate configuration for experimental trial and improvement of
the cost model iteratively, until a minimum according to a termination
criterion is found. This results in a data-efficient procedure that can be
easily adapted to varying loads or mechanical modifications of the system. The
method is further compared to several classical methods for auto-tuning, and
demonstrates higher performance according to the defined data-driven
performance indicators. The influence of the training data on a cost prior on
the number of iterations required to reach optimum is studied, demonstrating
the efficiency of the Bayesian optimization tuning method.

(TMR) ratio. However, with integrating AOS with an MTJ in prospect, the
annealing effects on single-pulse AOS and domain wall (DW) dynamics in the
Pt/Co/Gd stacks haven't been systematically investigated yet. In this study, we
experimentally explore the annealing effect on AOS and field-induced DW motion
in Pt/Co/Gd stacks. The results show that the threshold fluence (F_0) for AOS
is reduced significantly as a function of annealing temperature (T_a) ranging
from 100C to 300C. Specifically, a 28% reduction of F_0 can be observed upon
annealing at 300C, which is a critical T_a for MTJ fabrication. Lastly, we also
demonstrate a significant increase of the DW velocity in the creep regime upon
annealing, which is attributed to annealing-induced Co/Gd interface
intermixing. Our findings show that annealed Pt/Co/Gd system facilitates
ultrafast and energy-efficient AOS, as well as enhanced DW velocity, which is
highly suitable towards opto-spintronic memory applications.

including six videos with a total length of 167 seconds and 3927 labeled
pistachios. Unlike many other works, our model counts pistachios in videos, not
images. Counting objects in videos need assigning each object between the video
frames so that each object be counted once. The main two challenges in our work
are the existence of pistachios' occlusion and deformation of pistachios in
different frames because open-mouth pistachios that move and roll on the
transportation line may appear as closed-mouth in some frames and open-mouth in
other frames. Our novel model first is trained on the RetinaNet object detector
network using our dataset to detect different types of pistachios in video
frames. After gathering the detections, we apply them to a new counter
algorithm based on a new tracker to assign pistachios in consecutive frames
with high accuracy. Our model is able to assign pistachios that turn and change
their appearance (e.g., open-mouth pistachios that look closed-mouth) to each

The Baldwin effect between the CIV rest-frame equivalent width (REW) and the

(QCs) of Haar uniformly generated random two-qubit input states with different
ranks -- either one of the qubits (single-sided) or both the qubits
independently (double-sided) are passed through noisy channels. Under dephasing
and depolarizing channels with varying non-Markovian strength, entanglement and
quantum discord of the output states collapse and revive with the increase of
noise. We find that in case of the depolarizing double-sided channel, both the
QCs of random states show a higher number of revivals on average than that of
the single-sided ones with a fixed non-Markovianity strength, irrespective of
the rank of the states -- we call such a counter-intuitive event as a
constructive feedback of non-Markovianity. Consequently, the average noise at
which QCs of random states show first revival decreases with the increase of
the strength of non-Markovian noise, thereby indicating the role of
non-Markovian channels on the regenerations of QCs even in presence of a high
amount of noise. However, we observe that non-Markovianity does not play any
role to increase the robustness in random quantum states which can be measured
by the mean value of critical noise at which quantum correlations first
collapse. Moreover, we observe that the tendency of a state to show
regeneration increases with the increase of average QCs of the random input
states along with non-Markovianity.

hard when data is high-dimensional, but additional information, like domain
knowledge and previously published studies, may be helpful to improve
predictions. Such complementary data, or co-data, provide information on the
covariates, such as genomic location or p-values from external studies. Our
method enables exploiting multiple and various co-data sources to improve
predictions. We use discrete or continuous co-data to define possibly
overlapping or hierarchically structured groups of covariates. These are then
used to estimate adaptive multi-group ridge penalties for generalised linear
and Cox models. We combine empirical Bayes estimation of group penalty
hyperparameters with an extra level of shrinkage. This renders a uniquely
flexible framework as any type of shrinkage can be used on the group level. The
hyperparameter shrinkage learns how relevant a specific co-data source is,
counters overfitting of hyperparameters for many groups, and accounts for
structured co-data. We describe various types of co-data and propose suitable
forms of hypershrinkage. The method is very versatile, as it allows for
integration and weighting of multiple co-data sets, inclusion of unpenalised
covariates and posterior variable selection. We demonstrate it on two cancer
genomics applications and show that it may improve the performance of other
dense and parsimonious prognostic models substantially, and stabilises variable
selection.

since it came in sight in December 2019. It has already caused thousands of
causalities and infected several millions worldwide. Any technological tool
that can be provided to healthcare practitioners to save time, effort, and
possibly lives has crucial importance. The main tools practitioners currently
use to diagnose Covid-19 are Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain reaction

we propose a novel approach for Covid-19 recognition from chest X-ray images.
Despite the importance of the problem, recent studies in this domain produced
not so satisfactory results due to the limited datasets available for training.
Recall that Deep Learning techniques can generally provide state-of-the-art
performance in many classification tasks when trained properly over large
datasets, such data scarcity can be a crucial obstacle when using them for
Covid-19 detection. Alternative approaches such as representation-based
classification (collaborative or sparse representation) might provide
satisfactory performance with limited size datasets, but they generally fall
short in performance or speed compared to Machine Learning methods. To address
this deficiency, Convolution Support Estimation Network (CSEN) has recently
been proposed as a bridge between model-based and Deep Learning approaches by
providing a non-iterative real-time mapping from query sample to ideally sparse
representation coefficient' support, which is critical information for class

suddenly or gradually start executing a process differently in order to adjust
to changes in workload, season, or other external factors. Early detection of
business process changes enables managers to identify and act upon changes that
may otherwise affect process performance. Business process drift detection
refers to a family of methods to detect changes in a business process by
analyzing event logs extracted from the systems that support the execution of
the process. Existing methods for business process drift detection are based on
an explorative analysis of a potentially large feature space and in some cases
they require users to manually identify specific features that characterize the
drift. Depending on the explored feature space, these methods miss various
types of changes. Moreover, they are either designed to detect sudden drifts or
gradual drifts but not both. This paper proposes an automated and statistically
grounded method for detecting sudden and gradual business process drifts under
a unified framework. An empirical evaluation shows that the method detects
typical change patterns with significantly higher accuracy and lower detection
delay than existing methods, while accurately distinguishing between sudden and
gradual drifts.

continuously changing quantities and discretely occurring events. The coupling
between these measurements may provide insights into key underlying mechanisms
of the systems under study. To better extract this information, we investigate
the asymptotic statistical properties of coupling measures between continuous
signals and point processes. We first introduce martingale stochastic
integration theory as a mathematical model for a family of statistical
quantities that include the Phase Locking Value, a classical coupling measure
to characterize complex dynamics. Based on the martingale Central Limit
Theorem, we can then derive the asymptotic Gaussian distribution of estimates
of such coupling measure, that can be exploited for statistical testing.
Second, based on multivariate extensions of this result and Random Matrix
Theory, we establish a principled way to analyze the low rank coupling between
a large number of point processes and continuous signals. For a null hypothesis
of no coupling, we establish sufficient conditions for the empirical
distribution of squared singular values of the matrix to converge, as the
number of measured signals increases, to the well-known Marchenko-Pastur (MP)
law, and the largest squared singular value converges to the upper end of the
MPs support. This justifies a simple thresholding approach to assess the
significance of multivariate coupling. Finally, we illustrate with simulations

neural time series, addressing how to reliably quantify the interplay between
multi channel Local Field Potential signals and the spiking activity of a large

literature, however, focuses on the case of single-winner elections. In this
paper, we define the election control problem in social networks for
""multi-winner elections"" with the aim of modeling parliamentarian elections.
Differently from the single-winner case, we show that the multi-winner election
control problem is NP-hard to approximate within any factor in both
constructive and destructive cases. We then study a relaxation of the problem
where votes are aggregated on the basis of parties (instead of single
candidates), which is a variation of the so-called ""straight-party voting"" used
in some real parliamentarian elections. We show that the latter problem remains
NP-hard but can be approximated within a constant factor.

transitions from a steady state of an abstract nonlinear dissipative system. To
shed light on the formation of mixed mode patterns such as the hexagonal
pattern, we consider the case where the linearized operator of the system has
two critical real eigenvalues, at a critical value $\lambda_c$ of a control
parameter $\lambda$ with associated eigenmodes having a roll and rectangular
pattern. By using center manifold reduction, we obtain the reduced equations of
the system near the critical transition value $\lambda_c$. By a through
analysis of these equations, we fully characterize all possible transition
scenarios when the coefficients of the quadratic part of the reduced equations
do not vanish. We consider three problems, two variants of the 2D
Swift-Hohenberg equation and the 3D surface tension driven convection, to
demonstrate that all the main theoretical results we obtain here are indeed

conducted in order to investigate the enhancement of the turbulent flame speed
and modifications to the reaction layer structure associated with the
systematic increase of the integral scale of turbulence $l$ while the Karlovitz
number and the Kolmogorov scale are kept constant. Four turbulent slot jet
flames are simulated at increasing Reynolds number and up to $Re \approx
22000$, defined based on the bulk velocity, slot width, and the reactants'
properties. The turbulent flame speed $S_T$ is evaluated locally at select
streamwise locations and it is observed to increase both in the streamwise
direction for each flame and across flames for increasing Reynolds number, in
line with a corresponding increase of the turbulent integral scale. In
particular, the turbulent flame speed $S_T$ increases exponentially with the
integral scale for $l$ up to about 6 laminar flame thicknesses, while the
scaling becomes a power-law for larger values of $l$. These trends cannot be
ascribed completely to the increase in the flame surface, since the turbulent
flame speed looses its proportionality to the flame area as the integral scale
increases; in particular, it is found that the ratio of turbulent flame speed
to area attains a power-law scaling $l^{0.2}$. This is caused by an overall
broadening of the reaction layer for increasing integral scale, which is not
associated with a corresponding decrease of the reaction rate, causing a net
enhancement of the overall burning rate. This observation is significant since
it suggests that a continuous increase in the size of the largest scales of
turbulence might be responsible for progressively stronger modifications of the
flame's inner layers even if the smallest scales, i.e., the Karlovitz number,
are kept constant.

41, 405203 (2008)] for two-terminal junctions: the transmission does possess
two pairs of doubly-degenerate eigenvalues as required by the theorem. The
spin-filtering effect is explicitly demonstrated for a two-terminal chiral
molecular junction, modeled by a two-orbital tight-binding chain with
intra-atomic spin-orbit interactions (SOI). In the context of transport through

time-reversal symmetry: the intra-atomic SOI induces concomitant spin and
orbital flips. Examining these transitions from the point of view of the Bloch

devise a new technique to recover the distribution of these parameters using
spatially resolved, line-of-sight averaged data. Our chemodynamical method is
based on the made-to-measure (M2M) framework and results in an $N$-body model
for the abundance distribution. We test our method on a mock data set and find
that the radial and azimuthal profiles are well-recovered, however only the
overall shape of the vertical profile matches the true profile. We apply our
procedure to spatially resolved maps of mean [Z/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] for the
Andromeda Galaxy, using an earlier barred dynamical model of M31. We find that
the metallicity is enhanced along the bar, with possible maxima at the ansae.
In the edge-on view the [Z/H] distribution has an X shape due to the
boxy/peanut bulge; the average vertical metallicity gradient is equal to
$-0.133\pm0.006$ dex/kpc. We identify a metallicity-enhanced ring around the
bar, which also has relatively lower [$\alpha$/Fe]. The highest [$\alpha$/Fe]
is found in the centre, due to the classical bulge. Away from the centre, the
$\alpha$-overabundance in the bar region increases with height, which could be
an indication of a thick disc. We argue that the galaxy assembly resulted in a
sharp peak of metallicity in the central few hundred parsecs and a more gentle
negative gradient in the remaining disc, but no [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient. The
formation of the bar lead to the re-arrangement of the [Z/H] distribution,
causing a flat gradient along the bar. Subsequent star formation close to the
bar ends may have produced the metallicity enhancements at the ansae and the
[Z/H] enhanced lower-$\alpha$ ring.

which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate.
To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing
the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for
infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns,
locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\sim 1.5-4$
the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations
compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to
the population density. For $R_0\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase of

tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the

universally associated with the Clausius inequality that lower bounds a change
in entropy by the ratio of supplied heat and temperature. However, this result
presupposes that a system is in contact with a heat bath that drives it to a
thermal state. For isolated systems that are moved from an initial equilibrium
state by a dissipative heat exchange, the Clausius inequality has been
predicted to be reversed. We here experimentally investigate the nonequilibrium
thermodynamics of an isolated dilute gas of ultracold Cesium atoms that can be
either thermalized or pushed out of equilibrium by means of laser cooling
techniques. We determine in both cases the phase-space dynamics by tracing the
evolution of the gas with position-resolved fluorescence imaging, from which we
evaluate all relevant thermodynamic quantities. Our results confirm the
validity of the usual Clausius inequality for the first process and of the
reversed Clausius inequality for the second transformation.

tracker named TSDM is proposed, which is composed of a Mask-generator (M-g),
SiamRPN++ and a Depth-refiner (D-r). The M-g generates the background masks,
and updates them as the target 3D position changes. The D-r optimizes the
target bounding box estimated by SiamRPN++, based on the spatial depth
distribution difference between the target and the surrounding background.
Extensive evaluation on the Princeton Tracking Benchmark and the Visual Object

run at 31 FPS and thus it is practical for real world applications. Code and

  Learned Image Compression (CLIC)",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  When training end-to-end learned models for lossy compression, one has to
balance the rate and distortion losses. This is typically done by manually
setting a tradeoff parameter $\beta$, an approach called $\beta$-VAE. Using
this approach it is difficult to target a specific rate or distortion value,
because the result can be very sensitive to $\beta$, and the appropriate value
for $\beta$ depends on the model and problem setup. As a result, model
comparison requires extensive per-model $\beta$-tuning, and producing a whole
rate-distortion curve (by varying $\beta$) for each model to be compared. We
argue that the constrained optimization method of Rezende and Viola, 2018 is a
lot more appropriate for training lossy compression models because it allows us
to obtain the best possible rate subject to a distortion constraint. This
enables pointwise model comparisons, by training two models with the same
distortion target and comparing their rate. We show that the method does manage
to satisfy the constraint on a realistic image compression task, outperforms a
constrained optimization method based on a hinge-loss, and is more practical to
use for model selection than a $\beta$-VAE.

$F:\{0,1\}^n\times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$ in the memoryless

\{0,1\}^n$ and their goal is to compute F(x,y) subject to the following
constraint: at every round, Alice receives a message from Bob and her reply to
Bob solely depends on the message received and her input x; the same applies to
Bob. The cost of computing F in this model is the maximum number of bits
exchanged in any round between Alice and Bob (on the worst case input x,y). In
this paper, we also consider variants of our memoryless model wherein one party
is allowed to have memory, the parties are allowed to communicate quantum bits,
only one player is allowed to send messages. We show that our memoryless
communication model capture the garden-hose model of computation by Buhrman et
al. (ITCS'13), space bounded communication complexity by Brody et al. (ITCS'13)
and the overlay communication complexity by Papakonstantinou et al. (CCC'14).
Thus the memoryless communication complexity model provides a unified framework
to study space-bounded communication models. We establish the following: (1) We
show that the memoryless communication complexity of F equals the logarithm of
the size of the smallest bipartite branching program computing F (up to a
factor 2); (2) We show that memoryless communication complexity equals
garden-hose complexity; (3) We exhibit various exponential separations between
these memoryless communication models.
  We end with an intriguing open question: can we find an explicit function F
and universal constant c>1 for which the memoryless communication complexity is
at least $c \log n$? Note that $c\geq 2+\varepsilon$ would imply a
$\Omega(n^{2+\varepsilon})$ lower bound for general formula size, improving
upon the best lower bound by Ne\v{c}iporuk in 1966.

schemes, a structured Lyapunov matrix and a distributed terminal controller,
respecting the distributed structure of the system, are computed offline.
However, in this scheme, a distributed positively invariant terminal set is
computed online and updated at each time instant taking into consideration the
current state of the system. In particular, we consider ellipsoidal terminal
sets as they are easy to compute for large-scale systems. The size and the
center of these terminal sets, together with the predicted state and input
trajectories, are considered as decision variables in the online phase.
Determining the terminal set center online is found to be useful specifically

resulting online optimal control problem is provided. The efficacy of the
proposed scheme is illustrated in simulation by comparing it to a recent

perspective is transformed to a bird's eye view (BEV). For flat surfaces,
Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can accurately transform images to a BEV.
Three-dimensional objects such as vehicles and vulnerable road users are
distorted by this transformation making it difficult to estimate their position
relative to the sensor. This paper describes a methodology to obtain a
corrected 360{\deg} BEV image given images from multiple vehicle-mounted
cameras. The corrected BEV image is segmented into semantic classes and
includes a prediction of occluded areas. The neural network approach does not
rely on manually labeled data, but is trained on a synthetic dataset in such a
way that it generalizes well to real-world data. By using semantically
segmented images as input, we reduce the reality gap between simulated and

description of electromagnetic (EM) response is compatible with our approach,
while atomistic descriptions in our approach are based on effective electronic
and nuclear oscillator degrees of freedom, encapsulating dissipation,
short-range electronic correlations, and collective nuclear vibrations
(phonons). While our previous works using this approach have focused on
presenting novel results, this work focuses on the derivations underlying these
methods. First, we show how the distinction between ""atomic"" and ""macroscopic""
bodies is ultimately somewhat arbitrary, as formulas for vdW free energies and
RHT look very similar regardless of how the distinction is drawn. Next, we
demonstrate that the atomistic description of material response in our approach
yields EM interaction matrix elements which are expressed in terms of
analytical formulas for compact bodies or semianalytical formulas based on
Ewald summation for periodic media; we use this to compute vdW interaction free
energies as well as RHT powers among small biological molecules in the presence
of a metallic plate as well as between parallel graphene sheets in vacuum,
showing strong deviations from conventional macroscopic theories due to the
confluence of geometry, phonons, and EM retardation effects. Finally, we
propose formulas for efficient computation of FED interactions among material
bodies in which those that are treated atomistically as well as those treated
through continuum methods may have arbitrary shapes, extending previous

across different domains. This method assumes that specific information
regarding to which domain each instance belongs is known. This paper helps to
extend the capability of transfer learning for linear regression problems to
situations where the domain information is uncertain or unknown; in fact, the
framework can be extended to classification problems. For normal datasets, we
assume that some latent domain information is available for transfer learning.
The instances in each domain can be inferred by different parameters. We obtain
this domain information from the distribution of the regression coefficients
corresponding to the explanatory variable $x$ as well as the response variable
$y$ based on a Dirichlet process, which is more reasonable. As a result, we
transfer not only variable $x$ as usual but also variable $y$, which is
challenging since the testing data have no response value. Previous work mainly
overcomes the problem via pseudo-labelling based on transductive learning,
which introduces serious bias. We provide a novel framework for analysing the
problem and considering this general situation: the joint distribution of
variable $x$ and variable $y$. Furthermore, our method controls the bias well
compared with previous work. We perform linear regression on the new feature
space that consists of different latent domains and the target domain, which is
from the testing data. The experimental results show that the proposed model

peptides imply interaction with cell envelope. Comprehensive understanding of
peculiarities of interactions of antimicrobial peptides with cell envelope is
necessary to perform the task-oriented design of new biotherapeutics, against
which for microbes it is hard to work out resistance. In order to enable a de
novo design with low costs and in high throughput, in silico predictive models
have to be required. To develop the performant predictive model, comprehensive
knowledge on mechanisms of action of AMPs has to be possessed. The last
knowledge will allow us to encode amino acid sequences expressively and to get
success to the choosing of the accurate classifier of AMPs. A shared protective
layer of microbial cells is inner, plasmatic membrane. The interaction of AMP
with a biological membrane (native and/or artificial) is the most
comprehensively studied. We provide a review of mechanisms and results of
interaction of AMP with the cell membrane, relying on the survey of
physicochemical, aggregative and structural features of AMPs. Potency and
mechanism of action of AMP have presented in the terms of amino acid
compositions and distributions of the polar and apolar residues along the
chain, that is in such physicochemical features of peptides as the
hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and amphiphilicity. Many different approaches
were used to classify AMPs. The survey of the knowledge on sequences,
structures, and modes of actions of AMP, allows concluding that, only the
physicochemical features of AMPs give the capability to perform the unambiguous
classification. Comprehensive knowledge of physicochemical features of AMP is
necessary to develop task-oriented methods of design of peptide-based

source density of $>\sim 0.5$ per square arcminutes and $\sim 200$ pixels in

absorption in each pixel the noise in the lensing potential is higher, but for
reasonable numbers of sources and noise levels and a high fidelity map the
lensing potential is obtainable. The lensing estimator could also be applied to

elegantly. Then the label propagation is adopted to propagate the labels from
those limited labeled source samples to the whole unlabeled data progressively,
so that the cluster labels are revealed correctly. Finally, we jointly align
the marginal and conditional distributions to mitigate the cross-domain
mismatch problem, and optimize those three procedures iteratively. However, it
is nontrivial to incorporate those three procedures into a unified optimization
framework seamlessly since some variables to be optimized are implicitly
involved in their formulas, thus they could not promote to each other.
Remarkably, we prove that the projected clustering and conditional distribution
alignment could be reformulated as different expressions, thus the implicit
variables are revealed in different optimization steps. As such, the variables
related to those three quantities could be optimized in a unified optimization
framework and facilitate to each other, to improve the recognition performance
obviously.

Model Predictive Control (MPC) implemented using constrained neural networks.
Recent studies have proposed to use neural networks with differentiable convex
optimization layers to implement model predictive controllers. The motivation
is to replace real-time optimization in safety critical feedback control
systems with learnt mappings in the form of neural networks with optimization
layers. Such mappings take as the input the state vector and predict the
control law as the output. The learning takes place using training data
generated from off-line MPC simulations. However, a general framework for
characterization of learning approaches in terms of both model validation and
efficient training data generation is lacking in literature. In this paper, we
take the first steps towards developing such a coherent framework. We discuss
how the learning problem has similarities with system identification, in
particular input design, model structure selection and model validation. We
consider the study of neural network architectures in PyTorch with the explicit
MPC constraints implemented as a differentiable optimization layer using CVXPY.
We propose an efficient approach of generating MPC input samples subject to the
MPC model constraints using a hit-and-run sampler. The corresponding true
outputs are generated by solving the MPC offline using OSOP. We propose
different metrics to validate the resulting approaches. Our study further aims
to explore the advantages of incorporating domain knowledge into the network
structure from a training and evaluation perspective. Different model
structures are numerically tested using the proposed framework in order to
obtain more insights in the properties of constrained neural networks based
MPC.

larger $m \times n$ complex matrix according to a probability distribution
related to the permanents of the submatrices. Experimental systems exploiting
quantum photonic effects can in principle perform the task at great speed. In
the framework of classical computing, Aaronson and Arkhipov (2011) showed that
exact Boson Sampling problem cannot be solved in polynomial time unless the
polynomial hierarchy collapses to the third level. Indeed for a number of years
the fastest known exact classical algorithm ran in $O({m+n-1 \choose n} n 2^n

computing the permanent of a single matrix when $m$ is polynomial in $n$.

time complexity is much faster when $m$ is proportional to $n$. In particular,
when $m = n$ our algorithm runs in approximately $O(n\cdot1.69^n)$ time on
average. This result further increases the problem size needed to establish

that perfect synchronization of legitimate oscillators can be guaranteed in the
presence of multiple Byzantine attackers who can emit attack pulses arbitrarily

number of pulses from an attacker to be finite. The new mechanism can guarantee
synchronization even when the initial phases of all legitimate oscillators are
arbitrarily distributed in the entire oscillation period, which is in distinct

vulnerable components in IoT networks. In this paper, we propose an integrated
defense technique to achieve intrusion prevention by leveraging cyberdeception
(i.e., a decoy system) and moving target defense (i.e., network topology
shuffling). We verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
technique analytically based on a graphical security model in a software
defined networking (SDN)-based IoT network. We develop four strategies (i.e.,
fixed/random and adaptive/hybrid) to address ""when"" to perform network topology
shuffling and three strategies (i.e., genetic algorithm/decoy attack path-based
optimization/random) to address ""how"" to perform network topology shuffling on
a decoy-populated IoT network, and analyze which strategy can best achieve a
system goal such as prolonging the system lifetime, maximizing deception
effectiveness, maximizing service availability, or minimizing defense cost. Our
results demonstrate that a software defined IoT network running our intrusion
prevention technique at the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime,
increases attack complexity of compromising critical nodes, and maintains
superior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network without
running our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal

availability while minimizing the defense cost) as input, the best combination
of ""how"" and ""how"" strategies is identified for executing our proposed

plasmoid chains in the high Lundquist number ($S$) regime is investigated using
a recently developed adaptive finite-element magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) code. We
employ a two-dimensional incompressible model with a set of reduced
visco-resistive MHD equations. The tilt instability setup is chosen to provide
a three-step mechanism, where two curved current sheets initially form on an
Alfv\'enic time scale followed by a second phase of super-Alfv\'enic growth of
plasmoid chains for $S \ge S_c$ (Baty 2020). A third phase is reached where an
ensuing stochastic time-dependent reconnection regime with a fast time-averaged
rate independent of $S$ is obtained. We reveal the multi-scale current
structures during magnetic reconnection, where merging events of plasmoids give
rise to monster plasmoids with shocks bounding the outflow regions. At high
enough $S$ values (typically for $S \sim 100 S_c$), a dynamical Petschek-type
reconnection is achieved with pairs of slow-mode shocks emanating from a small
central region containing a few plasmoids. Finally, we briefly discuss the

the periodic orbits in each of the sub-regions, interact with the discontinuity

modulation) with accuracy levels that are hardly attainable with traditional
techniques. Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial
challenges in wireless deep learning is to counteract the channel action, which
may significantly alter the waveform features. The problem is further
exacerbated by the fact that deep learning algorithms are hardly re-trainable
in real time due to their sheer size. This paper proposes DeepFIR, a framework
to counteract the channel action in wireless deep learning algorithms without
retraining the underlying deep learning model. The key intuition is that
through the application of a carefully-optimized digital finite input response
filter (FIR) at the transmitter's side, we can apply tiny modifications to the
waveform to strengthen its features according to the current channel
conditions. We mathematically formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP)
as the problem of finding the optimum FIR to be used on a waveform to improve
the classifier's accuracy. We also propose a data-driven methodology to train
the FIRs directly with dataset inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepFIR on a
experimental testbed of 20 software-defined radios, as well as on two datasets
made up by 500 ADS-B devices and by 500 WiFi devices and a 24-class modulation
dataset. Experimental results show that our approach (i) increases the accuracy
of the radio fingerprinting models by about 35%, 50% and 58%; (ii) decreases an
adversary's accuracy by about 54% when trying to imitate other device's
fingerprints by using their filters; (iii) achieves 27% improvement over the

the usage of atomic web services. Particularly, the goal is to build workflows
of services that solve specific queries, which cannot be resolved by any single
service from a known repository. Each of these services is described
independently by their providers that can have no interaction with each other,
therefore some common standards have been developed, such as WSDL, BPEL, OWL-S.
Our proposal is to use such standards together with JSON-LD to model a next
level of semantics, mainly based on binary relations between parameters of
services. Services relate to a public ontology to describe their functionality.
Binary relations can be specified between input and/or output parameters in
service definition. The ontology includes some relations and inference rules
that help to deduce new relations between parameters of services. To our
knowledge, it is for the first time that parameters are matched not only based
on their type, but on a more meaningful semantic context considering such type
of relations. This enables the automation of a large part of the reasoning that
a human person would do when manually building a composition. Moreover, the
proposed model and the composition algorithm can work with multiple objects of
the same type, a fundamental feature that was not possible before. We believe
that the poor model expressiveness is what is keeping service composition from
reaching large-scale application in practice.

cloaking for Kirchhoff-Love plates and elastic plates with both the in-plane

boundary-value problem of an isotropic and homogeneous elastic plate (virtual
problem) to that of an anisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic plate with a hole
surrounded by a cloak that is to be designed (physical problem). For
Kirchhoff-Love plates, the (out-of-plane) governing equations of the virtual
plate is transformed to those of the physical plate up to an unknown scalar
field. In doing so, one finds the initial stress and the initial tangential
body force for the physical plate, along with a set of constraints that we call
cloaking compatibility equations. These constraints involve the cloaking
transformation, the unknown scalar field, and the elastic constants of the
virtual plate. It is noted that the cloaking map needs to satisfy certain
conditions on the outer boundary of the cloak and the surface of the hole. In
particular, the cloaking map needs to fix the outer boundary of the cloak up to
the third order. Assuming a generic radial cloaking map, we show that cloaking
a circular hole in Kirchoff-Love plates is not possible; the cloaking
compatibility equations and the boundary conditions that the cloaking map needs
to satisfy are the obstruction to cloaking. Next, relaxing the pure bending
assumption, the transformation cloaking problem of an elastic plate in the
presence of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements is formulated. In this
case, there are two sets of governing equations that need to be simultaneously
transformed under the cloaking map. We show that cloaking a circular hole is

equations and the boundary conditions that the cloaking map needs to satisfy
obstruct cloaking.

brings challenges to storage and processing. For some traditional data mining
algorithms, machine learning algorithms and data profiling tasks, it is very
difficult to handle such a large amount of data. The large amount of data is
highly demanding hardware resources and time consuming. Sampling methods can
effectively reduce the amount of data and help speed up data processing. Hence,
sampling technology has been widely studied and used in big data context, e.g.,
methods for determining sample size, combining sampling with big data
processing frameworks. Data profiling is the activity that finds metadata of
data set and has many use cases, e.g., performing data profiling tasks on
relational data, graph data, and time series data for anomaly detection and
data repair. However, data profiling is computationally expensive, especially
for large data sets. Therefore, this paper focuses on researching sampling and
profiling in big data context and investigates the application of sampling in
different categories of data profiling tasks. From the experimental results of
these studies, the results got from the sampled data are close to or even

tasks sequentially. The issue of forgetting the previously learned tasks in
continual learning is known as catastrophic forgetting or interference. When
the input data or the goal of learning change, a continual model will learn and
adapt to the new status. However, the model will not remember or recognise any
revisits to the previous states. This causes performance reduction and
re-training curves in dealing with periodic or irregularly reoccurring changes
in the data or goals. The changes in goals or data are referred to as new tasks
in a continual learning model. Most of the continual learning methods have a
task-known setup in which the task identities are known in advance to the
learning model. We propose Multi-view Task Conditional Neural Networks
(Mv-TCNN) that does not require to known the reoccurring tasks in advance. We
evaluate our model on standard datasets using MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and
also a real-world dataset that we have collected in a remote healthcare
monitoring study (i.e. TIHM dataset). The proposed model outperforms the
state-of-the-art solutions in continual learning and adapting to new tasks that

drive, the anomalous Floquet phase coexistence between zero and pi modes can
produce the period-doubling (2T, two cycles of the drive) that breaks the
spontaneously, leading to the subharmonic response ($\omega/2$, half the drive
frequency). The rigid period-oscillation is topologically-protected against
perturbations due to both non-trivially opening of 0 and $\pi$-gaps in the
quasienergy spectrum, thus, as a result, can be viewed as a specific ""Rabi
oscillation"" between two Floquet eigenstates with certain quasienergy splitting
$\pi/T$. Our modeling of the time-crystalline 'ground state' can be easily
realized in experimental platforms such as topological photonics and ultracold

contexts such as art therapy where human therapists are scarce, by making art
such as paintings together with people in a way that is emotionally contingent
and creative. However, current art-making robots are typically either
contingent, controlled as a tool by a human artist, or creative, programmed to
paint independently, possibly because some complex and idiosyncratic concepts
related to art, such as emotion and creativity, are not yet well understood.
For example, the role of personalized taste in forming beauty evaluations has
been studied in empirical aesthetics, but how to generate art that appears to
an individual to express certain emotions such as happiness or sadness is less
clear. In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz
approach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and
personalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify
tricky concepts. As a result of conducting an exploratory user study,
participants indicated some preference for a robot art-making strategy
involving ""visual metaphors"" to balance exogenous and endogenous components,
and personalized representational sketches were reported to convey emotion more
clearly than generic sketches. The article closes by discussing personalized
abstract art as well as suggestions for richer art-making strategies and user
models. Thus, the main conceptual advance of the current work lies in
suggesting how an interactive robot can visually express emotions through
personalized art; the general aim is that this could help to inform next steps
in this promising area and facilitate technological acceptance of robots in
everyday human environments.

contextuality vs. incompatibility. One has to distinguish two different notions
of contextuality, {\it Bohr-contextuality} and {\it Bell-contextuality}. The
latter is defined operationally via violation of noncontextuality (Bell type)
inequalities. This sort of contextuality will be compared with incompatibility.
It is easy to show that, for quantum observables, there is {\it no
contextuality without incompatibility.} The natural question arises: What is
contextuality without incompatibility? (What is ""dry-residue""?) Generally this
is the very complex question. We concentrated on contextuality for four quantum
observables. We shown that in the CHSH-scenarios (for ""natural quantum
observables"") {\it contextuality is reduced to incompatibility.} However,
generally contextuality without incompatibility may have some physical content.
We found a mathematical constraint extracting the contextuality component from
incompatibility. However, the physical meaning of this constraint is not clear.
In appendix 1, we briefly discuss another sort of contextuality based on the
Bohr's complementarity principle which is treated as the {\it
contextuality-incompatibility principle}. Bohr-contextuality plays the crucial
role in quantum foundations. Incompatibility is, in fact, a consequence of
Bohr-contextuality. Finally, we remark that outside of physics, e.g., in
cognitive psychology and decision making Bell-contextuality cleaned of
incompatibility can play the important role.

from the hybrid methods combining bidirectional and unidirectional ones;
second, we use a more elaborate attention mechanism to learn short-term and
long-term periodic temporal dependencies; and finally, we collect the weather
conditions and events as the external features to further improve the
prediction precision. The experimental results show that the proposed model
improves the prediction precision by approximately 3-7 percent on the NYC-Taxi

useful tool for the urban traffic prediction.

formulation of higher spin gauge field theories, along with a Chern-Simons (CS)
like term for fields of higher spins is presented. Through this setup, general
features of theories describing massless/massive fields of higher spin in
arbitrary dimensions is discussed. In 2+1 dimensions, the existence of multiple
mass-generating mechanisms i.e. metric-based masses and topological masses,
offers the possibility for gauge bosons to acquire mixed masses. This scenario
is first introduced in a theory of photons where both Proca mass term and CS
mass term is simultaneously present. The mass-mixing which occurs in this
theory is further analysed through the St\""uckelberg formalism. Motivated by
these results, a theory of massive gravity where gravitons obtain masses from
both Fierz-Pauli mass term and CS mass term is studied. This theory allows for
3 propagating massive graviton modes, and their masses have undergone
considerable mixing. This mass-mixing is made explicit through a St\""uckelberg
analysis. The bimetric theory of gravity is a non-trivial generalization of the
theory of General Relativity. This theory provides a consistent non-linear
theory of massive gravity which is studied in detail. In this thesis, the
bimetric theory of gravity is extended in 2+1 dimensiosn to the theory of
Topologically Massive Bimetric Gravity (TMBG). In the theory of TMBG, the
mass-mixing which arises from the interaction of the two metrics and their
corresponding CS terms occurs at the nonlinear stage itself. For the version of
TMBG studied in this thesis, the linearized theory shows that there are 3
massive graviton modes, which corresponds to the same 3 modes found earlier.
Finally, quantum loop corrections to the graviton propagator from massive
photons (which acquire mass from both CS and Proca mechanism) is calculated.

shadow images of the Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole. To achieve this goal, we have
considered two density profiles for the baryonic matter described by the
spherical exponential profile and the power law profile including a special
case describing a totally dominated dark matter galaxy (TDDMG). Using the
present values for the parameters of the superfluid dark matter and baryonic
density profiles for the Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole, we find that the effects of
the superfluid dark matter and baryonic matter on the size of shadows are
almost negligible compared to the Kerr vacuum black hole. In addition, we find
that by increasing the baryonic mass the shadow size increases considerably.
This result can be linked to the matter distribution in the galaxy, namely the
baryonic matter is mostly located in the galactic center and therefore, by
increasing the baryonic matter can affect the size of black hole shadow
compared to the totally dominated dark matter galaxy where we observe an
increase of the angular diameter of the Sgr A$^{*}$ black hole of the magnitude
$10^{-5} \mu$arcsec.

transparency information concerning which tasks pay fairly or which requesters
are unreliable. Researchers believe that a key reason why crowd workers earn
low wages is due to this lack of transparency. As a result, tools have been
developed to provide more transparency within crowd markets to help workers.
However, while most workers use these tools, they still earn less than minimum
wage. We argue that the missing element is guidance on how to use transparency
information. In this paper, we explore how novice workers can improve their
earnings by following the transparency criteria of Super Turkers, i.e., crowd
workers who earn higher salaries on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). We believe
that Super Turkers have developed effective processes for using transparency
information. Therefore, by having novices follow a Super Turker criteria (one
that is simple and popular among Super Turkers), we can help novices increase
their wages. For this purpose, we: (i) conducted a survey and data analysis to
computationally identify a simple yet common criteria that Super Turkers use
for handling transparency tools; (ii) deployed a two-week field experiment with
novices who followed this Super Turker criteria to find better work on MTurk.
Novices in our study viewed over 25,000 tasks by 1,394 requesters. We found
that novices who utilized this Super Turkers' criteria earned better wages than
other novices. Our results highlight that tool development to support crowd
workers should be paired with educational opportunities that teach workers how
to effectively use the tools and their related metrics (e.g., transparency
values). We finish with design recommendations for empowering crowd workers to
earn higher salaries.

specific values of the model parameters involved. Two models are of special

deceleration in the past to acceleration at late-times. The model parameters
are constrained with $57$ points of Hubble datasets together with the $580$
points of Union $2.1$ compilation supernovae datasets and baryonic acoustic

parameters, both the models are analyzed and compared with the standard
$\Lambda $CDM model and showing nice fit to the datasets. Two different

general scalar field $\phi $ and their dynamics are discussed on the
geometrical base built. The geometrical and physical interpretations of the two

(NICUs) is of primary importance for assessing infants' health status and
motor/cognitive development. Herein, we propose a new approach to preterm
infants' limb pose estimation that features spatio-temporal information to
detect and track limb joints from depth videos with high reliability. Methods:
Limb-pose estimation is performed using a deep-learning framework consisting of
a detection and a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) for rough and
precise joint localization, respectively. The CNNs are implemented to encode
connectivity in the temporal direction through 3D convolution. Assessment of
the proposed framework is performed through a comprehensive study with sixteen
depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice from sixteen preterm
infants (the babyPose dataset). Results: When applied to pose estimation, the
median root mean squared distance, computed among all limbs, between the
estimated and the ground-truth pose was 9.06 pixels, overcoming approaches
based on spatial features only (11.27pixels). Conclusion: Results showed that
the spatio-temporal features had a significant influence on the pose-estimation
performance, especially in challenging cases (e.g., homogeneous image
intensity). Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in
automatic assessment of preterm infants' health status by introducing the use
of spatio-temporal features for limb detection and tracking, and by being the
first study to use depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice for
limb-pose estimation. The babyPose dataset has been released as the first
annotated dataset for infants' pose estimation.
