  Bellur","Better Late than Never; Scaling Computation in Blockchains by Delaying
  Execution",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Proof-of-Work~(PoW) based blockchains typically allocate only a tiny fraction
(e.g., less than 1% for Ethereum) of the average interarrival
time~($\mathbb{I}$) between blocks for validating transactions. A trivial
increase in validation time~($\tau$) introduces the popularly known Verifier's
Dilemma, and as we demonstrate, causes more forking and increases unfairness.
Large $\tau$ also reduces the tolerance for safety against a Byzantine
adversary. Solutions that offload validation to a set of non-chain nodes
(a.k.a. off-chain approaches) suffer from trust issues that are non-trivial to
resolve.
  In this paper, we present Tuxedo, the first on-chain protocol to
theoretically scale $\tau/\mathbb{I} \approx 1$ in PoW blockchains. The key
innovation in Tuxedo is to separate the consensus on the ordering of
transactions from their execution. We achieve this by allowing miners to delay
validation of transactions in a block by up to $\zeta$ blocks, where $\zeta$ is
a system parameter. We perform security analysis of Tuxedo considering all
possible adversarial strategies in a synchronous network with end-to-end delay
$\Delta$ and demonstrate that Tuxedo achieves security equivalent to known
results for longest chain PoW Nakamoto consensus. Additionally, we also suggest
a principled approach for practical choices of parameter $\zeta$ as per the
application requirement. Our prototype implementation of Tuxedo atop Ethereum
demonstrates that it can scale $\tau$ without suffering the harmful effects of
naive scaling in existing blockchains.

controller is used to control the motion of the crane tip and at the same time
compensate for payload oscillations. The oscillations of the payload are
measured with three cameras that are fixed to the crane king and are used to
track two spherical markers fixed to the payload cable. Based on color and size
information, each camera identifies the image points corresponding to the
markers. The payload angles are then determined using linear triangulation of
the image points. An extended Kalman filter is used for estimation of payload
angles and angular velocity. The length of the payload cable is also estimated
using a least squares technique with projection. The crane is controlled by a
linear cascade controller where the inner control loop is designed to damp out
the pendulum oscillation, and the crane tip is controlled by the outer loop.
The control variable of the controller is the commanded crane tip acceleration,
which is converted to a velocity command using a velocity loop. The performance
of the control system is studied experimentally using a scaled laboratory
version of a knuckle boom crane.

not only for applications in photonic quantum technologies but also for testing

area is the scattering of photons with subnatural linewidth from a two-level
system under resonant continuous wave excitation. In particular, an open
question is whether these subnatural linewidth photons exhibit simultaneously
antibunching as an evidence of single-photon emission. Here, we demonstrate
that this simultaneous observation of subnatural linewidth and antibunching is
not possible with simple resonant excitation. First, we independently confirm
single-photon character and subnatural linewidth by demonstrating antibunching
in a Hanbury Brown and Twiss type setup and using high-resolution spectroscopy,
respectively. However, when filtering the coherently scattered photons with
filter bandwidths on the order of the homogeneous linewidth of the excited
state of the two-level system, the antibunching dip vanishes in the correlation
measurement. Our experimental work is consistent with recent theoretical
findings, that explain antibunching from photon-interferences between the
coherent scattering and a weak incoherent signal in a skewed squeezed state.

the (bulklike) epitaxial strain imposed by the large lattice mismatch,
rendering the CaVO$_3$ film insulating due to the enhanced orbital polarization
related to the strong level splitting between the t$_{\mathrm{2g}}$ orbitals.
In contrast, at the polar CaVO$_3$/LaAlO$_3$ interface, the presence of the

the specific interface termination as well as the specific boundary conditions
imposed by the multilayer geometry. We compare three different approaches to

Minimizer (ERM) and contain an extra logarithmic factor $\log(1/{\epsilon})$

by Hanneke (2016) that the optimal sample complexity of PAC learning for any VC
class C is achieved by a particular improper learning algorithm, which outputs
a specific majority-vote of hypotheses in C. This leaves the question of when
this bound can be achieved by proper learning algorithms, which are restricted
to always output a hypothesis from C.
  In this paper we aim to characterize the classes for which the optimal sample
complexity can be achieved by a proper learning algorithm. We identify that
these classes can be characterized by the dual Helly number, which is a
combinatorial parameter that arises in discrete geometry and abstract
convexity. In particular, under general conditions on C, we show that the dual
Helly number is bounded if and only if there is a proper learner that obtains
the optimal joint dependence on $\epsilon$ and $\delta$.
  As further implications of our techniques we resolve a long-standing open
problem posed by Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1974) on the performance of the
Support Vector Machine by proving that the sample complexity of SVM in the
realizable case is $\Theta((n/{\epsilon})+(1/{\epsilon})\log(1/{\delta}))$,

Halfspaces achieved by a proper learning algorithm, and moreover is

50 Mpc in front and behind clusters and seen in projection, as well as
instrumental systematics including noise and smoothing. In addition to CNNs for
all the four observables, we also train a `multi-channel' CNN by combining the
four observational tracers. The learning curves of all the five CNNs converge
within 1000 epochs. The resulting predictions are especially precise for halo
masses in the range $10^{13.25}M_{\odot}<M<10^{14.5}M_{\odot}$, where all five

inversion of surface wave dispersion data. SWinvert encourages analysts to
investigate inversion uncertainty and non-uniqueness in shear wave velocity
(Vs) by providing a systematic procedure and open-source tools for surface wave
inversion. In particular, the workflow enables the use of multiple layering
parameterizations to address the inversion's non-uniqueness, multiple global
searches for each parameterization to address the inverse problem's
non-linearity, and quantification of Vs uncertainty in the resulting profiles.
To encourage its adoption, the SWinvert workflow is supported by an open-source
Python package, SWprepost, for surface wave inversion pre- and post-processing
and an application on the DesignSafe-CyberInfracture, SWbatch, that enlists
high-performance computing for performing batch-style surface wave inversion
through an intuitive and easy-to-use web interface. While the workflow uses the
Dinver module of the popular open-source Geopsy software as its inversion
engine, the principles presented can be readily extended to other inversion
programs. To illustrate the effectiveness of the SWinvert workflow and to
develop a set of benchmarks for use in future surface wave inversion studies,
synthetic experimental dispersion data for 12 subsurface models of varying
complexity are inverted. While the effects of inversion uncertainty and
non-uniqueness are shown to be minimal for simple subsurface models
characterized by broadband dispersion data, these effects cannot be ignored in
the Vs profiles derived for more complex models with band-limited dispersion
data. The SWinvert workflow is shown to provide a methodical procedure and a
powerful set of tools for performing rigorous surface wave inversions and
quantifying the uncertainty in the resulting Vs profiles.

activated sites is usually denoted as the excursion set. The connected
components of this set, the level clusters, define a one-parameter ($H$) family
of percolation models with long-range correlation in the site occupation. The
level clusters percolate at a finite value $h=h_c$ and for $H\leq-\frac{3}{4}$
the phase transition is expected to remain in the same universality class of
the pure (i.e. uncorrelated) percolation. For $-\frac{3}{4}<H< 0$ instead,
there is a line of critical points with continously varying exponents. The
universality class of these points, in particular concerning the conformal
invariance of the level clusters, is poorly understood. By combining the
Conformal Field Theory and the numerical approach, we provide new insights on
these phases. We focus on the connectivity function, defined as the probability
that two sites belong to the same level cluster. In our simulations, the
surfaces are defined on a lattice torus of size $M\times N$. We show that the
topological effects on the connectivity function make manifest the conformal
invariance for all the critical line $H<0$. In particular, exploiting the
anisotropy of the rectangular torus ($M\neq N$), we directly test the presence
of the two components of the traceless stress-energy tensor. Moreover, we probe
the spectrum and the structure constants of the underlying Conformal Field
Theory. Finally, we observed that the corrections to the scaling clearly point
out a breaking of integrability moving from the pure percolation point to the
long-range correlated one.

management. In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a novel generative
adversarial network integrated with perceptual supervision to derive
instantaneous volumetric images from a single 2D projection. Our proposed
network, named TransNet, consists of three modules, i.e., encoding,
transformation and decoding modules. Rather than only using image distance loss
between the generated 3D images and the ground truth 3D CT images to supervise
the network, perceptual loss in feature space is integrated into loss function
to force the TransNet to yield accurate lung boundary. Adversarial supervision
is also used to improve the realism of generated 3D images. We conducted a
simulation study on 20 patient cases, who had received lung SBRT treatments in
our institution and undergone 4D-CT simulation, and evaluated the efficacy and
consistency of our method for four different projection angles, i.e., 0, 30, 60
and 90 degree. For each 3D CT image set of a breathing phase, we simulated its
2D projections at these angles.Then for each projection angle, a patient's 3D
CT images of 9 phases and the corresponding 2D projection data were used for
training, with the remaining phase used for testing. The mean absolute error,
normalized MAE, peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index

our recent contribution [Physical Review D 101, 106015 (2020)], intended to
investigate the approximation schemes compatibles with Ward identities and
constraints between $2n$-points observables in the large $N$-limit. We consider
separately two different approximations: In the first one, we try to construct
a local potential approximation from a slight modification of the Litim
regulator, so that it remains optimal in the usual sense, and preserves the
boundary conditions in deep UV and deep IR limits. In the second one, we
introduce derivative couplings in the truncations and show that the
compatibility with Ward identities implies strong relations between
$\beta$-functions, allowing to close the infinite hierarchy of flow equations
in the non-branching sector, up to a given order in the derivative expansion.
Finally, using exact relation between correlations functions in large
$N$-limit, we show that strictly local truncations are insufficient to reach
the exact value for the critical exponent, highlighting the role played by
these strong relations between observables taking into account the behavior of
the flow; and the role played by the multi-trace operators, discussed in the
two different approximation schemes. In both cases, we compare our conclusions
to the results obtained in the literature and conclude that, at a given order,
taking into account the exact functional relations between observables like
Ward identities in a systematic way we can strongly improve the physical
relevance of the approximation for exact RG equation.

properties of neutron stars - such as their size, maximum mass and spins - and
black holes. However, the presence of matter and the high mass ratio makes
generating long and accurate waveforms from these systems hard to do with
numerical relativity, and not much is known about systematic uncertainties due
to waveform modeling. We simulate gravitational waves from neutron star black
hole mergers by hybridizing numerical relativity waveforms produced with the
SpEC code with a recent numerical relativity surrogate NRHybSur3dq8Tidal. These
signals are analyzed using a range of available waveform families, and
statistical and systematic errors are reported. We find that at a network
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 30, statistical uncertainties are usually larger
than systematic offsets, while at an SNR of 70 the two become comparable. The
individual black hole and neutron star masses, as well as the mass ratios, are
typically measured very precisely, though not always accurately at high SNR. At
a SNR of 30 the neutron star tidal deformability can only be bound from above,
while for louder sources it can be measured and constrained away from zero. All
neutron stars in our simulations are non-spinning, but in no case we can
constrain the neutron star spin to be smaller than $\sim0.4$ (90% credible
interval). Waveform families whose late inspiral has been tuned specifically
for neutron star black hole signals typically yield the most accurate
characterization of the source parameters. Their measurements are in tension
with those obtained using waveform families tuned against binary neutron stars,
even for mass ratios that could be relevant for both binary neutron stars and
neutron star black holes mergers.

more pressing than ever. Chest X-rays provide a non-invasive (potentially
bedside) tool to monitor the progression of the disease. In this study, we
present a severity score prediction model for COVID-19 pneumonia for frontal
chest X-ray images. Such a tool can gauge severity of COVID-19 lung infections
(and pneumonia in general) that can be used for escalation or de-escalation of
care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in the ICU.
  Methods: Images from a public COVID-19 database were scored retrospectively
by three blinded experts in terms of the extent of lung involvement as well as
the degree of opacity. A neural network model that was pre-trained on large
(non-COVID-19) chest X-ray datasets is used to construct features for COVID-19
images which are predictive for our task.
  Results: This study finds that training a regression model on a subset of the
outputs from an this pre-trained chest X-ray model predicts our geographic
extent score (range 0-8) with 1.14 mean absolute error (MAE) and our lung
opacity score (range 0-6) with 0.78 MAE.
  Conclusions: These results indicate that our model's ability to gauge
severity of COVID-19 lung infections could be used for escalation or
de-escalation of care as well as monitoring treatment efficacy, especially in
the intensive care unit (ICU). A proper clinical trial is needed to evaluate
efficacy. To enable this we make our code, labels, and data available online at

science of weather and climate. Meteorology, long based on extrapolating
patterns in space and time, gave way to computational methods in a decade of
advances in numerical weather forecasting. Those same methods also gave rise to
computational climate science, studying the behaviour of those same numerical
equations over intervals much longer than weather events, and changes in
external boundary conditions. Several subsequent decades of exponential growth
in computational power have brought us to the present day, where models ever
grow in resolution and complexity, capable of mastery of many small-scale
phenomena with global repercussions, and ever more intricate feedbacks in the
Earth system.
  The current juncture in computing, seven decades later, heralds an end to
what is called Dennard scaling, the physics behind ever smaller computational
units and ever faster arithmetic. This is prompting a fundamental change in our
approach to the simulation of weather and climate, potentially as revolutionary
as that wrought by John von Neumann in the 1950s. One approach could return us
to an earlier era of pattern recognition and extrapolation, this time aided by
computational power. Another approach could lead us to insights that continue
to be expressed in mathematical equations. In either approach, or any synthesis
of those, it is clearly no longer the steady march of the last few decades,
continuing to add detail to ever more elaborate models. In this prospectus, we

These are described as an axially symmetric core to which a nucleon is coupled.
In the coordinate system fixed to the core the nucleon is subject to an axially
symmetric potential. Power counting is based on the separation of scales
between low-lying rotations and higher-lying states of the core. In leading
order, core and nucleon are coupled by universal derivative terms. These
comprise a covariant derivative and gauge potentials which account for Coriolis
forces and relate to Berry-phase phenomena. At leading order, the EFT combines
the particle-rotor and Nilsson models. We work out the EFT up to
next-to-leading order and illustrate the results in $^{239}$Pu and $^{187}$Os.
At leading order, odd-mass nuclei with rotational band heads that are close in
energy and differ by one unit of angular momentum are triaxially deformed. For
band heads that are well separated in energy, triaxiality becomes a subleading
effect. The EFT developed in this paper presents a model-independent approach

from the Fermi level of the electrodes, the electron transport is in the
thermionic-assisted tunneling procedure (TATP). In this regime, $G_e$ in
band-like situation and $S$ in atom-like situation can happen simultaneously.
We have demonstrated that the enhancement of $G_e$ with an increasing number of
electronic states will not suppress $S$ in the TATP.

can be easily achieved at the window of optomechanically induced transparency,

single leader and single follower. Unlike most Stackelberg game literature, the
state to be controlled is characterized by a backward stochastic differential
equation (BSDE) for which the terminal- instead initial-condition is specified
as a priori; the decisions of leader consist of a static terminal-perturbation
and a dynamic linear-quadratic control. In addition, the terminal control is
subject to (convex-closed) pointwise and (affine) expectation constraints. Both
constraints are arising from real applications such as mathematical finance.
For information pattern: the leader announces both terminal and open-loop
dynamic decisions at the initial time while takes account the best response of
follower. Then, two interrelated optimization problems are sequentially solved
by the follower (a backward linear-quadratic (BLQ) problem) and the leader (a
mixed terminal-perturbation and backward-forward LQ (BFLQ) problem). Our
open-loop Stackelberg equilibrium is represented by some coupled
backward-forward stochastic differential equations (BFSDEs) with mixed
initial-terminal conditions. Our BFSDEs also involve nonlinear projection
operator (due to pointwise constraint) combining with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker
(KKT) system (due to expectation constraint) via Lagrange multiplier. The
global solvability of such BFSDEs is also discussed in some nontrivial cases.
Our results are applied to one financial example.

  neural networks",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A traditional approach to initialization in deep neural networks (DNNs) is to
sample the network weights randomly for preserving the variance of
pre-activations. On the other hand, several studies show that during the
training process, the distribution of stochastic gradients can be heavy-tailed
especially for small batch sizes. In this case, weights and therefore
pre-activations can be modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution that has an
infinite variance but has a finite (non-integer) fractional moment of order $s$
with $s<2$. Motivated by this fact, we develop initialization schemes for fully
connected feed-forward networks that can provably preserve any given moment of
order $s \in (0, 2]$ over the layers for a class of activations including ReLU,
Leaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU, and linear activations. These generalized
schemes recover traditional initialization schemes in the limit $s \to 2$ and
serve as part of a principled theory for initialization. For all these schemes,
we show that the network output admits a finite almost sure limit as the number
of layers grows, and the limit is heavy-tailed in some settings. This sheds
further light into the origins of heavy tail during signal propagation in DNNs.
We prove that the logarithm of the norm of the network outputs, if properly
scaled, will converge to a Gaussian distribution with an explicit mean and
variance we can compute depending on the activation used, the value of s chosen
and the network width. We also prove that our initialization scheme avoids
small network output values more frequently compared to traditional approaches.
Furthermore, the proposed initialization strategy does not have an extra cost
during the training procedure. We show through numerical experiments that our
initialization can improve the training and test performance.

the CK matrices across layers, and may be described by recursive fixed-point

radially propagating density waves. These striking systems provide key
snapshots for dissecting galactic disks and are studied extensively in the
local Universe. However, not much is known about distant (z>0.1) collisional
rings. Here we present a detailed study of a ring galaxy at a look-back time of
10.8 Gyr (z=2.19). Compared with our Milky Way, this galaxy has a similar
stellar mass, but has a stellar half-light radius that is 1.5-2.2 times larger
and is forming stars 50 times faster. The large, diffuse stellar light outside
the star-forming ring, combined with a radial velocity on the ring and an
intruder galaxy nearby, provides evidence for this galaxy hosting a collisional
ring. If the ring is secularly evolved, the implied large bar in a giant disk
would be inconsistent with the current understanding of the earliest formation
of barred spirals. Contrary to previous predictions, this work suggests that
massive collisional rings were as rare 11 Gyr ago as they are today. Our
discovery offers a unique pathway for studying density waves in young galaxies,
as well as constraining the cosmic evolution of spiral disks and galaxy groups.

downlink information transmissions from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a

optimization of the AP's active beamforming and the IRS's passive beamforming.
Due to uncertain channel conditions, we formulate a robust power minimization
problem subject to the receiver's signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirement and
the IRS's power budget constraint. We propose a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) approach that can adapt the beamforming strategies from past experiences.
To improve the learning performance, we derive a convex approximation as a
lower bound on the robust problem, which is integrated into the DRL framework
and thus promoting a novel optimization-driven deep deterministic policy
gradient (DDPG) approach. In particular, when the DDPG algorithm generates a
part of the action (e.g., passive beamforming), we can use the model-based
convex approximation to optimize the other part (e.g., active beamforming) of
the action more efficiently. Our simulation results demonstrate that the
optimization-driven DDPG algorithm can improve both the learning rate and
reward performance significantly compared to the conventional model-free DDPG
algorithm.

extraction and multi-user preference simulation to overcome the drawbacks of
previous methods. There are two modules in AutoSUM: extractor and simulator.
The extractor module operates automatic feature extraction based on a BiLSTM
with a combined input representation including word embeddings and graph
embeddings. Meanwhile, the simulator module automates multi-user preference
simulation based on a well-designed two-phase attention mechanism (i.e.,
entity-phase attention and user-phase attention). Experimental results
demonstrate that AutoSUM produces state-of-the-art performance on two widely
used datasets (i.e., DBpedia and LinkedMDB) in both F-measure and MAP.

neutrino dark energy theories. As the $\rm{eV}$ sterile states naturally become
non-relativistic before the Matter Radiation Equality (MRE), we show that the
neutrino-scalar fluid develops strong perturbative instability followed by the
formation of neutrino-nuggets and the early dark energy behaviour disappears
around MRE. The stability of the nugget is achieved when the Fermi pressure
balances the attractive scalar force and we numerically find the mass and
radius of heavy cold nuggets by solving for the static configuration for the
scalar field. We find that for the case when DM nugget density is sub-dominant
and most of the early DE energy goes into scalar field dynamics, it can in
principle relax the Hubble anomaly. Especially when a kinetic energy dominated
phase appears after the phase transition, the DE density dilutes faster than
radiation and satisfy the requirements for solving $H_0$ anomaly. In our
scenario, unlike in originally proposed early dark energy theory, the dark
energy density is controlled by ($\rm{eV}$) neutrino mass and it does not
require a fine tuned EDE scale. We perform a MCMC analysis and confront our
model with Planck + SHOES and BAO data and find an evidence for non-zero
neutrino-scalar EDE density during MRE. Our analysis shows that this model is
in agreement of nearly 1.3$\sigma$ with SHOES measurement which is $H_0 = 74.03

minimum code redundancy of irregular array codes and the smallest code

on reaching specific targets (e.g., the bug-prone zone) without wasting

method helps the smoothing of noisy retinotopic maps and obtains
neurophysiological insights in human vision systems. One key element of the
approach is the Error-Tolerant Teichmuller Map, which uniforms the angle
distortion and maximizes the alignments to self-contradicting landmarks. We
validated our overall approach with synthetic and real retinotopic mapping
datasets. The experimental results show the proposed approach is superior in
accuracy and compatibility. Although we focus on retinotopic mapping, the
proposed framework is general and can be applied to process other human sensory
maps.

  JavaScript Signatures",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Content blocking is an important part of a performant, user-serving, privacy
respecting web. Most content blockers build trust labels over URLs. While
useful, this approach has well understood shortcomings. Attackers may avoid
detection by changing URLs or domains, bundling unwanted code with benign code,
or inlining code in pages. The common flaw in existing approaches is that they
evaluate code based on its delivery mechanism, not its behavior. In this work
we address this problem with a system for generating signatures of the
privacy-and-security relevant behavior of executed JavaScript. Our system
considers script behavior during each turn on the JavaScript event loop.
Focusing on event loop turns allows us to build signatures that are robust
against code obfuscation, code bundling, URL modification, and other common
evasions, as well as handle unique aspects of web applications. This work makes
the following contributions to improving content blocking: First, implement a
novel system to build per-event-loop-turn signatures of JavaScript code by
instrumenting the Blink and V8 runtimes. Second, we apply these signatures to
measure filter list evasion, by using EasyList and EasyPrivacy as ground truth
and finding other code that behaves identically. We build ~2m signatures of
privacy-and-security behaviors from 11,212 unique scripts blocked by filter
lists, and find 3,589 more unique scripts including the same harmful code,
affecting 12.48% of websites measured. Third, we taxonomize common filter list
evasion techniques. Finally, we present defenses; filter list additions where
possible, and a proposed, signature based system in other cases. We share the
implementation of our signature-generation system, the dataset from applying
our system to the Alexa 100K, and 586 AdBlock Plus compatible filter list rules
to block instances of currently blocked code being moved to new URLs.

size, scale, and complexity of data grow exponentially. A seminal step in
leveraging these rich datasets for downstream inference is understanding the
characteristics of the data which are repeatable -- the aspects of the data
that are able to be identified under a duplicated analysis. Conflictingly, the
utility of traditional repeatability measures, such as the intraclass
correlation coefficient, under these settings is limited. In recent work, novel
data repeatability measures have been introduced in the context where a set of
subjects are measured twice or more, including: fingerprinting, rank sums, and
generalizations of the intraclass correlation coefficient. However, the
relationships between, and the best practices among these measures remains
largely unknown. In this manuscript, we formalize a novel repeatability
measure, discriminability. We show that it is deterministically linked with the
correlation coefficient under univariate random effect models, and has desired
property of optimal accuracy for inferential tasks using multivariate
measurements. Additionally, we overview and systematically compare
repeatability statistics using both theoretical results and simulations. We
show that the rank sum statistic is deterministically linked to a consistent
estimator of discriminability. The power of permutation tests derived from
these measures are compared numerically under Gaussian and non-Gaussian
settings, with and without simulated batch effects. Motivated by both
theoretical and empirical results, we provide methodological recommendations
for each benchmark setting to serve as a resource for future analyses. We
believe these recommendations will play an important role towards improving
repeatability in fields such as functional magnetic resonance imaging,

learn complex nonlinear transformations of multiple views (more than two) of
data such that the resulting representations are linearly correlated in high
order. The high-order correlation of given multiple views is modeled by
covariance tensor, which is different from most CCA formulations relying solely
on the pairwise correlations. Parameters of transformations of each view are
jointly learned by maximizing the high-order canonical correlation. To solve
the resulting problem, we reformulate it as the best sum of rank-1
approximation, which can be efficiently solved by existing tensor decomposition
method. DTCCA is a nonlinear extension of tensor CCA (TCCA) via deep networks.
The transformations of DTCCA are parametric functions, which are very different
from implicit mapping in the form of kernel function. Comparing with kernel
TCCA, DTCCA not only can deal with arbitrary dimensions of the input data, but
also does not need to maintain the training data for computing representations
of any given data point. Hence, DTCCA as a unified model can efficiently
overcome the scalable issue of TCCA for either high-dimensional multi-view data

nonlinear representation. Extensive experiments on three multi-view data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual

in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago. In other
morphological types, the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for
present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our

the least massive galaxies reached this stage as late as 4 Gyr ago (the

collective excitations in a polariton condensate under the resonant pumping has
been investigated with the emphasis on the role of reservoir of long-lived
excitons in determining the superfluidity. Inspired by such an experimental
advance, we study the superfluidity of a exciton-polaritonn condensate under
non-resonant pumping by calculating the drag force exerted on a classical
impurity moving in a polariton condensate. For a non-resonant pumped polariton
condensate prepared in the gapped phase, due to the reservoir's modes, the drag
force can be large when the velocity of the impurity is small. Besides, as the
velocity increases, the drag force can decrease. For not very large velocity,
the drag force is enhanced if the condensate is tuned to be more dissipative.
When the condensate is close to the transition point between the gapped phase
and the gapless one, the drag force is similar to that of the equilibrium
superfluid. Our present work reveals the effects of the reservoir's modes on
the superfluidity properties of a polariton condensate with the non-resonant

Mean Field Game (MFG) model where every agent controls the drift of a
trajectory subject to Brownian diffusion, trying to escape a given bounded
domain $\Omega$ in minimal expected time. Agents are constrained by a bound on
the drift depending on the density of other agents at their location. Existence
for a finite time horizon $T$ is proven via a fixed point argument, but the
natural setting for this problem is in infinite time horizon. Estimates are
needed to treat the limit $T\to\infty$, and the asymptotic behavior of the
solution obtained in this way is also studied. This passes through classical
parabolic arguments and specific computations for MFGs. Both the Fokker--Planck
equation on the density of agents and the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation on
the value function display Dirichlet boundary conditions as a consequence of
the fact that agents stop as soon as they reach $\partial\Omega$. The initial
datum for the density is given, and the long-time limit of the value function
is characterized as the solution of a stationary problem.

cold atom cloud to simultaneously measure one axis of acceleration and two axes
of rotation from the phase, orientation, and period of atomic interference
fringe images. For practical applications in inertial sensing and precision
measurement, it is important to be able to measure a wide range of system
rotation rates, corresponding to interferograms with far less than one full
interference fringe to very many fringes. The interferogram analysis techniques
used previously for PSI are not sensitive to low rotation rates, which
generates less one full interference fringe across the cloud, limiting the
dynamic range of the instrument. We introduce an experimental method, new to
atom interferometry and closely related to optical phase-shifting
interferometry, that is effective in extracting rotation values from signals
consisting of fractional fringes as well as many fringes without prior
knowledge of the rotation rate. Our method uses four interferograms, each with
a controlled Raman laser phase shift, to reconstruct the underlying atomic
interferometer phase map.

researchers use when labelled training data are scarce is domain adaptation
(DA) -- where data from an alternate region, known as the source domain, are
used to train a classifier and this model is adapted to map the study region,
or target domain. The scenario we address in this paper is known as
semi-supervised DA, where some labelled samples are available in the target
domain. In this paper we present Sourcerer, a Bayesian-inspired, deep
learning-based, semi-supervised DA technique for producing land cover maps from
SITS data. The technique takes a convolutional neural network trained on a
source domain and then trains further on the available target domain with a
novel regularizer applied to the model weights. The regularizer adjusts the
degree to which the model is modified to fit the target data, limiting the
degree of change when the target data are few in number and increasing it as
target data quantity increases. Our experiments on Sentinel-2 time series

It is
used in many different areas to describe the properties of a physical system
which has been isolated from its environment. The interaction with the
`outside' is then usually reduced to a scattering process, in which incoming
radiation interacts with the system, which in turn emits outgoing radiation. In
Einstein's theory of gravitation isolated systems are modeled as asymptotically
flat space-times. They provide the appropriate paradigm for the study of
gravitational waves and their interaction with a material system or even only
with themselves. In view of the emerging era of gravitational wave astronomy,
in which gravitational wave signals from many different astrophysical sources
are detected and interpreted, it is necessary to have a foundation for the
theoretical and numerical treatments of these signals. Furthermore, from a
purely mathematical point of view, it is important to have a full understanding
of the implications of imposing the condition of asymptotic flatness onto
solutions of the Einstein equations. While it is known that there exists a
large class of asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein's equations, it is not
known what the necessary and sufficient conditions at infinity are that have to
be imposed on initial data so that they evolve into regular asymptotically flat
space-times. The crux lies in the region near space-like infinity $i^0$ where
incoming and outgoing radiation `meet'. In this paper we review the current
knowledge and some of the analytical and numerical work that has gone into the
attempt to understand the structure of asymptotically flat space-times near
space-like and null-infinity.

propensity estimation methods assume that user click behavior follows the PBM

user clicks often follow the CM, where users scan search results from top to
bottom and where each next click depends on the previous one. In this cascade
scenario, PBM-based estimates of propensities are not accurate, which, in turn,
hurts CLTR performance. In this paper, we propose a propensity estimation
method for the cascade scenario, called CM-IPS. We show that CM-IPS keeps CLTR
performance close to the full-information performance in case the user clicks
follow the CM, while PBM-based CLTR has a significant gap towards the
full-information. The opposite is true if the user clicks follow PBM instead of
the CM. Finally, we suggest a way to select between CM- and PBM-based

compositions have been proposed, including metal oxides and sulphides, iron,
chromium, sulphur, and hydrocarbons. However, the relative contributions of
these species to exoplanet aerosol opacity is unknown. Here we show that the
aerosol composition of giant exoplanets observed in transmission is dominated
by silicates and hydrocarbons. By constraining an aerosol microphysics model
with trends in giant exoplanet transmission spectra, we find that silicates
dominate aerosol opacity above planetary equilibrium temperatures of 950 K due
to low nucleation energy barriers and high elemental abundances, while
hydrocarbon aerosols dominate below 950 K due to an increase in methane
abundance. Our results are robust to variations in planet gravity and
atmospheric metallicity within the range of most giant transiting exoplanets.
We predict that spectral signatures of condensed silicates in the mid-infrared

progressively shifts the band structure of hBN to higher binding energies due
to the induction of a variable electric potential originating from electronic
charge donation by alkali atoms. At small coverages, Li atoms preferably
intercalate under the hBN layer, where they are highly charged and give rise to
a large initial shift of the band structure. Additionally, intercalated Li
atoms effectively decouple hBN from the substrate and consequently reduce its
moir\'e corrugation. As the deposition progresses further, Li atoms also adsorb
on top of hBN, and the average effective charge of both intercalated and
adsorbed Li atoms progressively diminishes due to the Coulomb repulsion
penalty, which is partially screened by the metal substrate in the intercalated
subsystem. This gives rise to a saturation of the respective electric potential
and the band structure shift, and elaborates on the pathways and limitations of

  Leveraging Novel Anti-Phone Modeling","Accepted by Interspeech2020",,,,"eess.AS cs.CL cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Mispronunciation detection and diagnosis (MDD) is a core component of
computer-assisted pronunciation training (CAPT). Most of the existing MDD
approaches focus on dealing with categorical errors (viz. one canonical phone
is substituted by another one, aside from those mispronunciations caused by
deletions or insertions). However, accurate detection and diagnosis of
non-categorial or distortion errors (viz. approximating L2 phones with L1
(first-language) phones, or erroneous pronunciations in between) still seems
out of reach. In view of this, we propose to conduct MDD with a novel end-
to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-based ASR) approach. In particular, we
expand the original L2 phone set with their corresponding anti-phone set,
making the E2E-based MDD approach have a better capability to take in both
categorical and non-categorial mispronunciations, aiming to provide better
mispronunciation detection and diagnosis feedback. Furthermore, a novel
transfer-learning paradigm is devised to obtain the initial model estimate of
the E2E-based MDD system without resource to any phonological rules. Extensive
sets of experimental results on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our best system
can outperform the existing E2E baseline system and pronunciation scoring based
method (GOP) in terms of the F1-score, by 11.05% and 27.71%, respectively.

concerted, large-amplitude peristaltic body deformations. This remarkable
behaviour has been known for centuries. Yet, its function remains
controversial, and is even viewed as a functionless ancestral vestige. Here, by
examining swimming Euglena gracilis in environments of controlled crowding and
geometry, we show that this behaviour is triggered by confinement. Under these
conditions, it allows cells to switch from unviable flagellar swimming to a new
and highly robust mode of fast crawling, which can deal with extreme geometric
confinement and turn both frictional and hydraulic resistance into propulsive
forces. To understand how a single cell can control such an adaptable and
robust mode of locomotion, we developed a computational model of the motile
apparatus of Euglena cells consisting of an active striated cell envelope. Our
modelling shows that gait adaptability does not require specific
mechanosensitive feedback but instead can be explained by the mechanical
self-regulation of an elastic and extended motor system. Our study thus
identifies a locomotory function and the operating principles of the adaptable
peristaltic body deformation of Euglena cells.

coinciding with compact ionized gas emission previously observed at radio
wavelengths (A1 and A2), confirming the long-known radio sources as
protostellar. The emission towards A2 is resolved and traces a dust disk with a
FWHM size of ~12 au, while the emission towards A1 sets a limit to the FWHM
size of the dust disk of ~4 au. We also detect spatially resolved molecular
kinematic tracers near the protostellar disks. Several lines of the J=5-4
rotational transition of HNCO, NH2CHO and t-HCOOH are detected, with which we
derived individual line-of-sight velocities. Using these together with the CS
(J=2-1), we fit Keplerian profiles towards the individual compact sources and
derive masses of the central protostars. The kinematic analysis indicates that
A1 and A2 are a bound binary system. Using this new context for the previous 30
years of VLA observations, we fit orbital parameters to the relative motion
between A1 and A2 and find the combined protostellar mass derived from the
orbit is consistent with the masses derived from the gas kinematics. Both
estimations indicate masses consistently higher (0.5< M1<M2<2 Msun) than

performing the potential analysis on the confining D3- and D4-brane background

account into a fundamental string and a single flavor brane respectively. The
two confining backgrounds with D-instantons are obtained from the black
D(-1)-D3 and D0-D4 solution with a double Wick rotation. The total potential
and pair production/decay rate in the Schwinger effect are calculated
numerically by examining the NG action of a fundamental string and the DBI
action of a single flavor brane all in the presence of an electric field. In
both backgrounds our numerical calculation agrees with the critical electric
field evaluated from the DBI action and shows the potential barrier is
increased by the presence of the D-instantons, thus the production/decay rate
is suppressed by the D-instantons. Our interpretation is that particles in the
dual field theory could acquire an effective mass through the Chern-Simons
interaction or the theta term due to the presence of D-instantons so that the
pair production/decay rate in Schwinger effect is suppressed since it behaves
as $e^{-m^{2}}$. Our conclusion is in agreement with the previous results
obtained in the deconfined D(-1)-D3 background at zero temperature limit and
from the approach of the flavor brane in the D0-D4 background. In this sense,
this work may be also remarkable to study the phase transition in

risks due to the collection and releasing of sensitive user data (e.g., user

people's willingness to install six different contact-tracing apps after
informing them of the risks and benefits of each design option (with a
U.S.-only sample on Amazon Mechanical Turk, $N=208$). The six app designs
covered two major design dimensions (centralized vs decentralized, basic
contact tracing vs. also providing hotspot information), grounded in our
analysis of existing contact-tracing app proposals.
  Contrary to assumptions of some prior work, we found that the majority of
people in our sample preferred to install apps that use a centralized server
for contact tracing, as they are more willing to allow a centralized authority
to access the identity of app users rather than allowing tech-savvy users to
infer the identity of diagnosed users. We also found that the majority of our
sample preferred to install apps that share diagnosed users' recent locations
in public places to show hotspots of infection. Our results suggest that apps
using a centralized architecture with strong security protection to do basic
contact tracing and providing users with other useful information such as
hotspots of infection in public places may achieve a high adoption rate in the

ground-based (0.3-0.6"" resolution) mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectroscopy. The cold
molecular gas is traced by ALMA and NOEMA high (0.2-1.1"") angular resolution
observations of the CO(2-1) transition. Galaxies with a nuclear detection of
the $11.3\,\mu$m PAH feature contain more cold molecular gas (median $1.6\times

10^{23}\,{\rm cm}^{-2}$) over the regions sampled by the mid-IR slits than
those without a detection. This suggests that molecular gas plays a role in
shielding the PAH molecules in the harsh environments of Seyfert nuclei.
Choosing the PAH molecule naphthalene as an illustration, we compute its
half-life in the nuclear regions of our sample when exposed to 2.5keV hard
X-ray photons. We estimate shorter half-lives for naphthalene in nuclei without
a $11.3\,\mu$m PAH detection than in those with a detection. The Spitzer/IRS
PAH ratios on circumnuclear scales ($\sim$ 4"" $\sim$ 0.25-1.3kpc) are in
between model predictions for neutral and partly ionized PAHs. However, Seyfert
galaxies in our sample with the highest nuclear H$_2$ column densities are not
generally closer to the neutral PAH tracks. This is because in the majority of
our sample galaxies, the CO(2-1) emission in the inner $\sim$ 4"" is not
centrally peaked and in some galaxies traces circumnuclear sites of strong star
formation activity. Spatially resolved observations with the MIRI
medium-resolution spectrograph (MRS) on the James Webb Space Telescope will be
able to distinguish the effects of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and star
formation on the PAH emission in nearby AGN.

inequalities in terms of payoff differences are generated in competitive
societies. It is shown that increasing levels of envy lead inevitably to a
self-induced separation into a lower and an upper class. Class stratification
is Nash stable and strict, with members of the same class receiving identical
rewards. Upper class agents play exclusively pure strategies, all lower class
agents the same mixed strategy. The fraction of upper class agents decreases
progressively with larger levels of envy, until a single upper class agent is
left. Numerical simulations and a complete analytic treatment of a basic
reference model, the shopping trouble model, are presented. The properties of
the class-stratified society are universal and only indirectly controllable
through the underlying utility function, which implies that class stratified
societies are intrinsically resistant to political control. Implications for
human societies are discussed. It is pointed out that the repercussions of envy
are amplified when societies become increasingly competitive.

that, as a common feature, spectra of this kind can exhibit a situation in

large fluctuations. By combining extensions of the standard Random Matrix

unstable state, fluctuates because of the shot noises of the reactions and
diffusion. Under certain conditions these fluctuations can be described as a
diffusion process in the reference frame moving with the average velocity of
the front. Here we address pushed fronts, where the front velocity in the
deterministic limit is affected by higher-order reactions and is therefore
larger than the linear spread velocity. For a subclass of these fronts --
strongly pushed fronts -- the effective diffusion constant $D_f\sim 1/N$ of the
front can be calculated, in the leading order, via a perturbation theory in
$1/N \ll 1$, where $N\gg 1$ is the typical number of particles in the
transition region. This perturbation theory, however, overestimates the
contribution of a few fast particles in the leading edge of the front. We
suggest a more consistent calculation by introducing a spatial integration
cutoff at a distance beyond which the average number of particles is of order
1. This leads to a non-perturbative correction to $D_f$ which even becomes
dominant close to the transition point between the strongly and weakly pushed
fronts. At the transition point we obtain a logarithmic correction to the $1/N$
scaling of $D_f$. We also uncover another, and quite surprising, effect of the
fast particles in the leading edge of the front. Because of these particles,
the position fluctuations of the front can be described as a diffusion process
only on very long time intervals with a duration $\Delta t \gg \tau_N$, where
$\tau_N$ scales as $N$. At intermediate times the position fluctuations of the
front are anomalously large and non-diffusive. Our extensive Monte-Carlo
simulations of a particular reacting lattice gas model support these
conclusions.

the existence of large areas with low ionization and weak coupling between the

important. In this work we investigate the gas and dust structure and dynamics
for a typical T Tauri system under the influence of the vertical shear
instability (VSI). We use global 3D radiation hydrodynamics simulations
covering all $360^\circ$ of azimuth with embedded particles of 0.1 and 1mm
size, evolved for 400 orbits. Stellar irradiation heating is included with
opacities for 0.1- to 10-$\mu$m-sized dust. Saturated VSI turbulence produces a
stress-to-pressure ratio of $\alpha \simeq 10^{-4}$. The value of $\alpha$ is
lowest within 30~au of the star, where thermal relaxation is slower relative to
the orbital period and approaches the rate below which VSI is cut off. The rise
in $\alpha$ from 20 to 30~au causes a dip in the surface density near 35~au,
leading to Rossby wave instability and the generation of a stationary,
long-lived vortex spanning about 4~au in radius and 40~au in azimuth. Our
results confirm previous findings that mm size grains are strongly vertically
mixed by the VSI. The scale height aspect ratio for 1mm grains is determined to
be 0.037, much higher than the value $H/r=0.007$ obtained from millimeter-wave
observations of the HL~Tau system. The measured aspect ratio is better fit by
non-ideal MHD models. In our VSI turbulence model, the mm grains drift radially
inwards and many are trapped and concentrated inside the vortex. The turbulence
induces a velocity dispersion of $\sim 12$~m/s for the mm grains, indicating
that grain-grain collisions could lead to fragmentation.

Maxwell demon (MD) paradox, a thought experiment proposed in 1867 by J. C.
Maxwell to violate the second law of thermodynamics. A variant of the classical
MD is the Szilard engine proposed by L. Szilard in 1926 in which the demon
observes, at a given time, the compartment occupied by a single molecule in a
vessel and extracts work by operating a pulley device. Here we introduce the
Continuous Maxwell Demon (CMD), a device capable of extracting arbitrarily
large amounts of work per cycle by repeated measurements of the state of a
system, and experimentally test it in single DNA hairpin pulling experiments.
In the CMD the demon monitors the state of the DNA hairpin (folded or unfolded)
by observing it at equally spaced time intervals but extracts work only when
the molecule changes state. We demonstrate that the average maximum work per
cycle that can be extracted by the CMD is limited by the information-content of
the stored sequences, in agreement with the second law. Work extraction
efficiency is found to be maximal in the large information-content limit where
work extraction is fuelled by rare events.

a fixed probability $p\in(0,1)$, $\hat U_{n+1}$ is sampled uniformly from $\hat
U_1, \ldots, \hat U_n$, and with complementary probability $1-p$, $\hat
U_{n+1}$ is a new independent uniform variable. The Glivenko-Cantelli theorem
remains valid for the reinforced empirical measure, but not the Donsker
theorem. Specifically, we show that the sequence of empirical processes
converges in law to a Brownian bridge only up to a constant factor when
$p<1/2$, and that a further rescaling is needed when $p>1/2$ and the limit is
then a bridge with exchangeable increments and discontinuous paths. This is
related to earlier limit theorems for correlated Bernoulli processes, the
so-called elephant random walk, and more generally step reinforced random

any dedicated hardware for eye gaze tracking. The eye gaze tracker is used to
develop a video see through based AR (augmented reality) display that controls
a robotic device with eye gaze and deployed for a fabric printing task.

evaluated the web cam based gaze tracker and the video see through based human
robot interaction involving users with SSMI. We also reported a user study on
manipulating a robotic arm with webcam based eye gaze tracker.
  Results: Using our bespoke eye gaze controlled interface, able bodied users

length, irregularly sampled sequences or sequences with missing values. Our
algorithm is fully unsupervised, however, can be readily extended to supervised
or semisupervised cases when the anomaly labels are present as remarked
throughout the paper. Our approach uses the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)
networks in order to extract temporal features and find the most relevant
feature vectors for anomaly detection. We incorporate the sampling time
information to our model by modulating the standard LSTM model with time
modulation gates. After obtaining the most relevant features from the LSTM, we
label the sequences using a Support Vector Data Descriptor (SVDD) model. We
introduce a loss function and then jointly optimize the feature extraction and
sequence processing mechanisms in an end-to-end manner. Through this joint
optimization, the LSTM extracts the most relevant features for anomaly
detection later to be used in the SVDD, hence completely removes the need for
feature selection by expert knowledge. Furthermore, we provide a training
algorithm for the online setup, where we optimize our model parameters with
individual sequences as the new data arrives. Finally, on real-life datasets,
we show that our model significantly outperforms the standard approaches thanks
to its combination of LSTM with SVDD and joint optimization.

for probing the dense matter physics present in NS crusts. During accretion
outbursts in LMXBs, exothermic reactions may heat the NS crust, disrupting the
crust-core equilibrium. When the outburst ceases, the crust cools to restore
thermal equilibrium with the core. Monitoring this evolution allows us to probe
the dense matter physics in the crust. Properties of the deeper crustal layers
can be probed at later times after the end of the outburst. We report on the
unexpected late-time temperature evolution (>2000 days after the end of their
outbursts) of two NSs in LMXBs, XTE J1701-462 and EXO 0748-676. Although both
these sources exhibited very different outbursts (in terms of duration and the
average accretion rate), they exhibit an unusually steep decay of ~7 eV in the
observed effective temperature (occurring in a time span of ~700 days) around
~2000 days after the end of their outbursts. Furthermore, they both showed an
even more unexpected rise of ~3 eV in temperature (over a time period of
~500-2000 days) after this steep decay. This rise was significant at the
2.4{\sigma} and 8.5{\sigma} level for XTE J1701-462 and EXO 0748-676,
respectively. The physical explanation for such behaviour is unknown and cannot
be straightforwardly be explained within the cooling hypothesis. In addition,
this observed evolution cannot be well explained by low-level accretion either
without invoking many assumptions. We investigate the potential pathways in the
theoretical heating and cooling models that could reproduce this unusual
behaviour, which so far has been observed in two crust-cooling sources. Such a
temperature increase has not been observed in the other NS crust-cooling
sources at similarly late times, although it cannot be excluded that this might
be a result of the inadequate sampling obtained at such late times.

matter density. We first consider the simplified vertical Jeans equation which
ignores the tilt term and assumes a flat rotation curve. Under a Gaussian prior
on the total stellar surface density, the local dark matter density inferred
from Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations is $0.0133_{-0.0022}^{+0.0024}\ {\rm

an azimuthal angle range of $-10^{\circ} < \phi < 5^{\circ}$ are consistent
within their 1$\sigma$ errors. However, the northern and southern subsamples
show a large discrepancy due to plateaux in the northern and southern vertical
velocity dispersion profiles. These plateaux may be the cause of the different
estimates of the dark matter density between the north and south. Taking the
tilt term into account has little effect on the parameter estimations and does
not explain the north and south asymmetry. Taking half of the difference of

measurements for the northern and southern subsamples. We discuss the influence
of the vertical data range, the scale height of the tracer population, the

and users show preferences to items. The attribute information describes
users'(items') characteristics and has a wide range of applications, such as
user profiling, item annotation, and feature-enhanced recommendation. As
annotating user (item) attributes is a labor intensive task, the attribute
values are often incomplete with many missing attribute values. Therefore, item
recommendation and attribute inference have become two main tasks in these
platforms. Researchers have long converged that user (item) attributes and the
preference behavior are highly correlated. Some researchers proposed to
leverage one kind of data for the remaining task, and showed to improve
performance. Nevertheless, these models either neglected the incompleteness of
user (item) attributes or regarded the correlation of the two tasks with simple
models, leading to suboptimal performance of these two tasks. To this end, in
this paper, we define these two tasks in an attributed user-item bipartite
graph, and propose an Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN) approach for
joint item recommendation and attribute inference. The key idea of AGCN is to
iteratively perform two parts: 1) Learning graph embedding parameters with
previously learned approximated attribute values to facilitate two tasks; 2)
Sending the approximated updated attribute values back to the attributed graph
for better graph embedding learning. Therefore, AGCN could adaptively adjust
the graph embedding learning parameters by incorporating both the given
attributes and the estimated attribute values, in order to provide weakly
supervised information to refine the two tasks. Extensive experimental results
on three real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed

counterexample to Borsuk's conjecture from any strongly regular graph whose
vertex set is not the union of at most $f+1$ cliques (sets of pairwise adjacent
vertices) where $f$ is the multiplicity of the second-largest eigenvalue of its
adjacency matrix.
  He applied that construction to those two graphs that he had been able to
prove to fulfill the condition: From the $G_2(4)$ graph (on 416 vertices) he
got a 65-dimensional two-distance counterexample. From the $Fi_{23}$ graph (on
31671 vertices) he got a 782-dimensional one and, by considering certain
induced subgraphs, counterexamples in dimensions 781, 780 and 779.
  This article presents two other strongly regular graphs fulfilling the
condition, on 28431 and on 2401, resp., vertices. It gives dedicated
counterexamples in dimensions from 781 down to 764 derived from the bigger
graph (that turned out to be an induced subgraph of the $Fi_{23}$ graph) and a
240-dimensional counterexample derived from the smaller graph.

quantum advantage from those that cannot is of crucial importance. From the
fundamental point of view, establishing such a boundary is akin to pinpointing
the resources for quantum advantage; from the technological point of view, it
is essential for the design of non-trivial quantum computing architectures.
Wigner negativity is known to be a necessary resource for computational
advantage in several quantum-computing architectures, including those based on
continuous variables (CVs). However, it is not a sufficient resource, and it is
an open question under which conditions CV circuits displaying Wigner
negativity offer the potential for quantum advantage. In this work we identify
vast families of circuits that display large, possibly unbounded, Wigner
negativity, and yet are classically efficiently simulatable, although they are
not recognized as such by previously available theorems. These families of
circuits employ bosonic codes based on either translational or rotational
symmetries (e.g., Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill or cat codes), and can include both
Gaussian and non-Gaussian gates and measurements. Crucially, within these
encodings, the computational basis states are described by intrinsically
negative Wigner functions, even though they are stabilizer states if considered
as codewords belonging to a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. We derive our
results by establishing a link between the simulatability of high-dimensional
discrete-variable quantum circuits and bosonic codes.

manufacturing products, and product information is indispensable for the item
distribution system. While most products are given barcodes to the exterior
surfaces, research on embedding barcodes inside products is underway. This is
because additive manufacturing makes it possible to carry out manufacturing and
information adding at the same time, and embedding information inside does not
impair the exterior appearance of the product. However, products that have not
been embedded information can not be identified, and embedded information can
not be rewritten later. In this study, we have developed a product
identification system that does not require embedding barcodes inside. This
system uses a transmission image of the product which contains information of
each product such as different inner support structures and manufacturing
errors. We have shown through experiments that if datasets of transmission
images are available, objects can be identified with an accuracy of over 90%.
This result suggests that our approach can be useful for identifying objects
without embedded information.

mostly rely on analytic modelling of galaxy profiles and suffer from the lack
of flexible yet accurate models. We propose to use generative models based on
deep neural networks, namely variational autoencoders (VAE), to learn
probabilistic models directly from data. We train a VAE on images of centred,
isolated galaxies, which we reuse, as a prior, in a second VAE-like neural
network in charge of deblending galaxies. We train our networks on simulated
images including six LSST bandpass filters and the visible and near-infrared
bands of the Euclid satellite, as our method naturally generalises to multiple

reconstruction errors on ellipticities and $r$-band magnitude between
$\pm{0.01}$ and $\pm{0.05}$ respectively in most cases, and ellipticity
multiplicative bias of 1.6% for blended objects in the optimal configuration.
We also study the impact of decentring and prove the method to be robust. This
method only requires the approximate centre of each target galaxy, but no
assumptions about the number of surrounding objects, pointing to an iterative
detection/deblending procedure we leave for future work. Finally, we discuss
future challenges about training on real data and obtain encouraging results

in the I$\Lambda$CDM scenario. To avoid the large-scale instability problem in
interacting dark energy models, we employ the extended parameterized
post-Friedmann method for interacting dark energy to calculate the perturbation
evolution of dark energy in these models. The observational data used in this
work include the cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from the Planck

I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ models. When considering the three mass
hierarchies of neutrinos, the constraints on $\sum m_{\nu}$ are tightest in the
degenerate hierarchy case and loosest in the inverted hierarchy case. In
addition, in the four I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ models, the values of
coupling parameter $\beta$ are larger using the CMB+BAO+SN+$H_{0}$ data
combination than that using the CMB+BAO+SN data combination, and $\beta>0$ is
favored at more than 1$\sigma$ level when using CMB+BAO+SN+$H_{0}$ data
combination. The issue of the $H_{0}$ tension is also discussed in this paper.
We find that, compared with the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ model, the $H_{0}$
tension can be alleviated in the I$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_{\nu}$ model to some

distributions of target-source and target-fake pairs on feature level. Adequate
experiments are conducted on several benchmarks including constrained and
unconstrained palmprint databases. The results demonstrate that our JPFA
outperforms other models to achieve the state-of-the-arts. Compared with

28.10% and the Equal Error Rate (EER) of cross-dataset verification is reduced
by up to 4.69%. To make our results reproducible, the codes are publicly

paper, we present WiFiTrace, a network-centric approach for contact tracing
that relies on passive WiFi sensing with no client-side involvement. Our
approach exploits WiFi network logs gathered by enterprise networks for
performance and security monitoring, and utilizes them for reconstructing
device trajectories for contact tracing. Our approach is specifically designed
to enhance the efficacy of traditional methods, rather than to supplant them
with new technology. We designed an efficient graph algorithm to scale our
approach to large networks with tens of thousands of users. The graph-based
approach outperforms an indexed PostgresSQL in memory by at least 4.5X without
any index update overheads or blocking. We have implemented a full prototype of
our system and deployed it on two large university campuses. We validated our
approach and demonstrate its efficacy using case studies and detailed
experiments using real-world WiFi datasets.

high thermal conductivity, the mechanical properties of graphene, and in
general of all 2D materials, are still elusive. The harmonic theory predicts a
quadratic dispersion for the flexural acoustic vibrational mode, which leads
the unphysical result that long wavelength in-plane acoustic modes decay before
vibrating one period, preventing the propagation of sound. The robustness of
the quadratic dispersion has been questioned by arguing that the anharmonic
phonon-phonon interaction linearizes it. However, this implies a divergent
bending rigidity in the long wavelength limit not reproduced experimentally.
Here we show that rotational symmetry protects the quadratic flexural
dispersion against phonon-phonon interactions and that, consequently, the
bending stiffness is non-divergent irrespective of the temperature. Our
non-perturbative anharmonic calculations also determine that sound propagation
coexists with a quadratic dispersion. We also show that the temperature
dependence of the height fluctuations of the membrane, known as ripples, is
fully determined by thermal or quantum fluctuations, but without the anharmonic
suppression of their amplitude previously assumed. The universality of our
conclusions reconcile experimental evidence and theory not just in graphene,
but all 2D materials.

non-crossing partitions are unshuffle Hopf algebras (in a $2$-monoidal sense).
The two relate by mean of a map of unshuffle bialgebras (in a $2$-monoidal

affine transformations of the tangent and cotangent bundles of a

geometry (CWIG), there are two generalizations here: interactions with an
arbitrary dark field, and, anisotropic dilation. It means that CWIG already has

Maxwell's equations and its sub-sets, the conservation, hyperbolic, and

Moreover, by using a notion analogous to Penrose conformal infinity, one can
impose boundary conditions canonically on these equations. As a prime example,
we did it for the elliptic equation, where we obtained a singularity-free

possibility i) to learn the normative range of structural and functional brain

applying normative modeling as a medical tool for the diagnosis and prognosis

$(r,cr,p_1,p_2)$-sensitive, if two data-points with a distance less than $r$
collide with probability at least $p_1$ while data points with a distance
greater than $cr$ collide with probability at most $p_2$. These functions form
the basis of the successful Indyk-Motwani algorithm (STOC 1998) for nearest
neighbour problems. In particular one may build a $c$-approximate nearest
neighbour data structure with query time $\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1)$ where
$\rho=\frac{\log1/p_1}{\log1/p_2}\in(0,1)$. That is, sub-linear time, as long
as $p_1$ is not too small. This is significant since most high dimensional
nearest neighbour problems suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and can't
be solved exact, faster than a brute force linear-time scan of the database.
  Unfortunately, the best LSH functions tend to have very low collision
probabilities, $p_1$ and $p_2$. Including the best functions for Cosine and
Jaccard Similarity. This means that the $n^\rho/p_1$ query time of LSH is often
not sub-linear after all, even for approximate nearest neighbours!
  In this paper, we improve the general Indyk-Motwani algorithm to reduce the
query time of LSH to $\tilde O(n^\rho/p_1^{1-\rho})$ (and the space usage
correspondingly.) Since $n^\rho p_1^{\rho-1} < n \Leftrightarrow p_1 > n^{-1}$,
our algorithm always obtains sublinear query time, for any collision
probabilities at least $1/n$. For $p_1$ and $p_2$ small enough, our improvement
over all previous methods can be \emph{up to a factor $n$} in both query time
and space.
  The improvement comes from a simple change to the Indyk-Motwani algorithm,
which can easily be implemented in existing software packages.

detecting when MW occurs can prevent us from those negative outcomes resulting
from MW, such as failing to keep track of course during learning. In this work,
we first collect a multi-modal Sustained Attention to Response Task (MM-SART)
database for detecting MW. Eighty-two participants' data are collected in our
experiments. For each participant, we collect measures of 32-channels
electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, photoplethysmography (PPG) signals,
galvanic skin response (GSR) signals, eye tracker signals, and several
questionnaires for detailed analyses. Then, we propose an effective MW
detection system based on the collected EEG signals. To explore the non-linear
characteristics of EEG signals, we utilize the entropy-based features in time,
frequency, and wavelet domains. The experimental results show that we can reach
0.712 AUC score by using the random forest (RF) classifier with the
leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Moreover, to lower the overall
computational complexity of the MW detection system, we apply techniques of
channel selection and feature selection. By using the only two most significant
EEG channels, we can reduce the training time of the classifier by 44.16%. By
performing correlation importance feature elimination (CIFE) on the feature
set, we can further improve the AUC score to 0.725 but with only 14.6% of the
selection time compared with the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. By
proposing the MW detection engine, current work can be applied to educational
scenarios, especially in the era of remote learning nowadays.

leptogenesis leading to baryon asymmetry of the universe can be realised by two
heavy Higgs triplets which also provide type-II seesaw ansatz for neutrino
masses. In this work we discuss this model for hierarchical neutrino masses in
concordance with recently determined cosmologocal bounds and oscillation data
including $\theta_{23}$ in the second octant and large Dirac CP phases. We also
address the issues on dark matter and vacuum stability of the scalar potential
in a minimal extension of this model. We find that for both normal and inverted
orderings the model fits the oscillation data with the sum of the three
neutrino masses consistent with cosmological bounds determined from Planck
satellite data. In addition using this model ansatz for CP-asymmetry and
solutions of Boltzmann equations, we also show how successful prediction of
baryon asymmetry emerges in the cases of both unflavoured and two-flavoured
leptogeneses. With additional $Z_2$ discrete symmetry, a minimal extension of
this model is shown to be capable of predicting a scalar singlet WIMP dark
matter in agreement with direct and indirect observations. Whereas in the
original model, the renormalization group running of the scalar potential
renders it negatve leading to vacuum instability, the presence of the dark
matter in the minimally extended model ensures stability. Although the combined
constraints due to relic density and direct detection cross section allow this
scalar singlet dark matter mass to be $m_{\xi}=750$ GeV, the additional vacuum
stability constraint pushes this limiting value to $m_{\xi}=1.3$ TeV which is
verifiable by ongoing experiments. We also dicuss constraint on the model
parameters for the radiative stability of the standard Higgs mass.

luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}$ or $L_{\rm TIR}$) and the molecular line luminosities
of $J=1-0$ transitions of H$^{13}$CN, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCN, and HCO$^+$ with
data obtained from ACA observations in the ""ATOMS"" survey of 146 active
Galactic star forming regions. The correlations between $L_{\rm bol}$ and
molecular line luminosities $L'_{\rm mol}$ of the four transitions all appear
to be approximately linear. Line emission of isotopologues shows as large
scatters in $L_{\rm bol}$-$L'_{\rm mol}$ relations as their main line emission.
The log($L_{\rm bol}$/$L'_{\rm mol}$) for different molecular line tracers have
similar distributions. The $L_{\rm bol}$-to-$L'_{\rm mol}$ ratios do not change
with galactocentric distances ($R_{\rm GC}$) and clump masses ($M_{\rm
clump}$). The molecular line luminosity ratios (HCN-to-HCO$^+$,
H$^{13}$CN-to-H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HCN-to-H$^{13}$CN and HCO$^+$-to-H$^{13}$CO$^+$)
all appear constant against $L_{\rm bol}$, dust temperature ($T_{\rm d}$),
$M_{\rm clump}$ and $R_{\rm GC}$. Our studies suggest that both the main lines
and isotopologue lines are good tracers of the total masses of dense gas in
Galactic molecular clumps. The large optical depths of main lines do not affect
the interpretation of the slopes in star formation relations. We find that the
mean star formation efficiency (SFE) of massive Galactic clumps in the ""ATOMS""
survey is reasonably consistent with other measures of the SFE for dense gas,
even those using very different tracers or examining very different spatial
scales.

inspired by the famous ""two cultures"" discussion instigated by C.P. Snow over
60 years ago. He saw a chasm between different academic disciplines and I see a
chasm between academics and professional services, bound into contact through
competing targets. This paper draws on my personal experience and experiences
recounted to me by colleagues in different universities in the UK. It is aimed
at igniting discussions amongst people interested in improving the academic

Following
the previous studies dedicated to extended Fornax cluster members, we present
the catalogs of compact stellar systems in the Fornax cluster as well as
extended background sources and point-like sources. We derive ugri photometry
of ~1.7 million sources over the $\sim$21 sq. degree area of FDS centered on
NGC1399. For a wider area, of $\sim$27 sq. degs extending in the direction of
NGC1316, we provide gri data for ~3.1 million sources. To improve the
morphological characterization of sources we generate multi-band image stacks
by coadding the best seeing gri-band single exposures with a cut at FWHM<=0.9
arcsec. We use the multi-band stacks as detection frames. The identification of
compact sources is obtained from a combination of photometric and morphometric
selection criteria taking as reference the properties of sources with
well-defined classification from the literature. We present a preliminary
analysis of globular cluster (GC) distributions in the Fornax area. The study
confirms and extends further previous results. We observe the inter-galactic
population of GCs, a population of mainly blue GCs centered on NGC1399, extends
over $\sim$0.9Mpc, with an ellipticity $\sim$0.65. Several sub-structures
extend over $\sim$0.5Mpc along various directions. Two of these structures do
not cross any bright galaxy; one of them appears to be connected to NGC1404, a
bright galaxy close to the cluster core and particularly poor of GCs. Using the
gri catalogs we analyze the GC distribution over the extended FDS area, and do
not find any obvious GC sub-structure bridging the two brightest cluster
galaxies, NGC1316 and NGC1399. Although NGC1316 is twice brighter of NGC1399 in
optical bands we estimate a factor of 3-4 richer GC population around NGC1399

stages in non-parallel datasets. The first stage is to delete attribute markers
of a sentence directly through a classifier. The second stage is to generate a
transferred sentence by combining the content tokens and the target style. We
experiment on two benchmark datasets and evaluate context, style, fluency, and
semantic. It is difficult to select the best system using only these automatic
metrics, but it is possible to select stable systems. We consider only robust
systems in all automatic evaluation metrics to be the minimum conditions that
can be used in real applications. Many previous systems are difficult to use in
certain situations because performance is significantly lower in several
evaluation metrics. However, our system is stable in all automatic evaluation
metrics and has results comparable to other models. Also, we compare the
performance results of our system and the unstable system through human
evaluation. Our code and data are available at the link

The main conclusions are: the basic interconnectivity means arise no serious

face-to-face one; online jury-competitors interactivity is poorer than
face-to-face interactivity; human factors, higher uncertainties in the
organization process, and less time to spend in the process for the local

evaluation fairness are higher; involuntary gender discrimination seems lower,

differential privacy; some peculiarities of the presented topics and of the

intimately related to the analyzed case, some are general enough for being

interest lies on investigating the feasibility of using these correlations to
certify multipartite entanglement in a device-independent setting. In contrast
to previous works, our numerical results up to the eight-partite scenario
suggest that if each triad is randomly but uniformly chosen according to the
Haar measure, one always (except possibly for a set of measure zero) finds
Bell-inequality-violating correlations. In fact, a substantial fraction of
these is even sufficient to reveal, in a device-independent manner, various
higher-order entanglement. In particular, for the specific cases of three
parties and four parties, our results---obtained from semidefinite
programming---suggest that these randomly generated correlations always reveal,
even in the presence of a non-negligible amount of white noise, the genuine
multipartite entanglement possessed by these states. In other words, provided
local calibration can be carried out to good precision, a device-independent
certification of the genuine multipartite entanglement contained in these
states can, in principle, also be carried out in an experimental situation
without sharing a global reference frame.

this study, the coarse-grained analysis of subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulent
kinetic energy $K_{sgs}$ budget is fully analyzed for constructing one-equation
SGS model in the compressible large eddy simulation (LES). The DNS on a much
higher turbulent Mach number up to $Ma_{t} = 2.0$ has been obtained by HGKS,
which confirms the super robustness of HGKS. Then, the exact compressible SGS
turbulent kinetic energy $K_{sgs}$ transport equation is derived with density
weighted filtering process. Based on the compressible $K_{sgs}$ transport
equation, the coarse-grained processes are implemented on three sets of
unresolved grids with the Box filter. The coarse-grained analysis of
compressible $K_{sgs}$ budgets shows that all unresolved source terms are
dominant terms in current system. Especially, the magnitude of SGS
pressure-dilation term is in the order of SGS solenoidal dissipation term
within the initial acoustic time scale. Therefore, it can be concluded that the
SGS pressure-dilation term cannot be neglected as the previous work. The
delicate coarse-grained analysis of SGS diffusion terms in compressible
$K_{sgs}$ equation confirms that both the fluctuation velocity triple
correlation term and the pressure-velocity correlation term are dominant terms.
Current coarse-grained analysis gives an indication of the order of magnitude
of all SGS terms in compressible $K_{sgs}$ budget, which provides a solid basis
for compressible LES modeling in high Mach number turbulent flow.

island effect (IE). On the current generation of telescopes, the IE becomes a
severe problem when the ground wind speed is below a few meters per second.
This is referred to as the low-wind effect (LWE). The LWE severely distorts the
point spread function (PSF), significantly lowering the Strehl ratio and
degrading the contrast. In this article, we aim to show that the focal-plane
wavefront sensing (FPWFS) algorithm, Fast and Furious (F&F), can be used to
measure and correct the IE/LWE. We deployed the algorithm on the SCExAO HCI
instrument at the Subaru Telescope using the internal near-infrared camera in
H-band. We tested F&F with the internal source, and it was deployed on-sky to
test its performance with the full end-to-end system and atmospheric
turbulence. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by two metrics based
on the PSF quality: 1) the Strehl ratio approximation ($SRA$), and 2) variance
of the normalized first Airy ring ($VAR$). Random LWE phase screens with a
peak-to-valley wavefront error between 0.4 $\mu$m and 2 $\mu$m were all
corrected to a $SRA$ $>$90\% and an $VAR\lessapprox0.05$. Furthermore, the
on-sky results show that F&F is able to improve the PSF quality during very
challenging atmospheric conditions (1.3-1.4'' seeing at 500 nm). Closed-loop
tests show that F&F is able to improve the $VAR$ from 0.27 to 0.03 and
therefore significantly improve the symmetry of the PSF. Simultaneous
observations of the PSF in the {optical} ($\lambda = $ 750 nm, $\Delta \lambda
=$ 50 nm) show that during these tests we were correcting aberrations common to
the optical and NIR paths within SCExAO. Going forward, the algorithm is
suitable for incorporation into observing modes, which will enable PSFs of
higher quality and stability during science observations.

Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the probability distribution of
extreme values of intermittent random sequences, a common problem in
geophysical and environmental science settings. The approach presented here
relaxes the asymptotic assumption typical of the traditional extreme value (EV)
theory, and accounts for the possible underlying variability in the
distribution of event magnitudes and occurrences, which are described through a
latent temporal process. Focusing on daily rainfall extremes, the structure of
the proposed model lends itself to incorporating prior geo-physical
understanding of the rainfall process. By means of an extensive simulation
study, we show that this methodology can significantly reduce estimation
uncertainty with respect to Bayesian formulations of traditional asymptotic EV
methods, particularly in the case of relatively small samples. The benefits of
the approach are further illustrated with an application to a large data set of
479 long daily rainfall historical records from across the continental United
States. By comparing measures of in-sample and out-of-sample predictive
accuracy, we find that the model structure developed here, combined with the
use of all available observations for inference, significantly improves
robustness with respect to overfitting to the specific sample.

Particularly, we focus on the enhancement of training and evaluation

proposed method which we term as Gradient Monitoring(GM), is an approach to
steer the learning in the weight parameters of a neural network based on the
dynamic development and feedback from the training process itself. We propose
different variants of the GM methodology which have been proven to increase the
underlying performance of the model. The one of the proposed variant, Momentum
with Gradient Monitoring (M-WGM), allows for a continuous adjustment of the
quantum of back-propagated gradients in the network based on certain learning
parameters. We further enhance the method with Adaptive Momentum with Gradient
Monitoring (AM-WGM) method which allows for automatic adjustment between
focused learning of certain weights versus a more dispersed learning depending
on the feedback from the rewards collected. As a by-product, it also allows for
automatic derivation of the required deep network sizes during training as the
algorithm automatically freezes trained weights. The approach is applied to two
discrete (Multi-Robot Co-ordination problem and Atari games) and one continuous

0.13 Me. In the combined dataset we measure a period of 11.18427 $\pm$ 0.00070
days with a minimum mass of 1.173 $\pm$ 0.086 Me. We find no evidence of
stellar activity as a potential cause for the 11.2 days signal. We find some
evidence for the presence of a second short-period signal, at 5.15 days with a
semi-amplitude of merely 40 cm/s. If caused by a planetary companion, it would
correspond to a minimum mass of 0.29 $\pm$ 0.08 Me. We find that the FWHM of
the CCF can be used as a proxy for the brightness changes and that its gradient
with time can be used to successfully detrend the radial velocity data from
part of the influence of stellar activity. The activity-induced radial velocity
signal in the ESPRESSO data shows a trend in amplitude towards redder
wavelengths. Velocities measured using the red end of the spectrograph are less
affected by activity, suggesting that the stellar activity is spot-dominated.
The data collected excludes the presence of extra companions with masses above
0.6 Me at periods shorter than 50 days.

NLP classification tasks has accompanied the need for generating some form of
natural language explanation of the predicted labels. Such generated natural
language (NL) explanations are expected to be faithful, i.e., they should
correlate well with the model's internal decision making. In this work, we
focus on the task of natural language inference (NLI) and address the following
question: can we build NLI systems which produce labels with high accuracy,
while also generating faithful explanations of its decisions? We propose
Natural-language Inference over Label-specific Explanations (NILE), a novel NLI
method which utilizes auto-generated label-specific NL explanations to produce
labels along with its faithful explanation. We demonstrate NILE's effectiveness
over previously reported methods through automated and human evaluation of the
produced labels and explanations. Our evaluation of NILE also supports the
claim that accurate systems capable of providing testable explanations of their
decisions can be designed. We discuss the faithfulness of NILE's explanations
in terms of sensitivity of the decisions to the corresponding explanations. We
argue that explicit evaluation of faithfulness, in addition to label and
explanation accuracy, is an important step in evaluating model's explanations.
Further, we demonstrate that task-specific probes are necessary to establish
such sensitivity.

magnetically-active cataclysmic variable DQ Her and the shell around it ejected

confirms previous claims on the presence of extended X-ray emission around DQ
Her and reveals that it actually corresponds to a bipolar jet-like structure
extending $\simeq$32$''$ along a direction from NE to SW. Therefore, this X-ray
emission extends beyond the optical nova shell and is perpendicular to its
major axis. The XMM-Newton observations confirm the presence of the extended
X-ray emission detected by Chandra, suggesting the additional presence of a
diffuse X-ray emission from a hot bubble filling the nova shell. This hot
bubble was very likely produced by the explosion that created the nebular shell
detected in optical images. The bipolar feature can be modelled by the
combination of an optically thin plasma emission component with temperature
$T\approx2\times10^{6}$ K and a power law component with a photon index of
$\Gamma=1.1\pm0.9$. Its X-ray luminosity in the 0.3 - 5 keV energy range is
$L_\mathrm{X}=(2.1\pm1.3)\times10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$, for an electron density

anisotropies are usually computed from a Boltzmann hierarchy coupled to the
perturbed Einstein equations. In this setup, one set of multipoles describes
the temperature anisotropies, while two other sets, of electric and magnetic
types, describe the polarization anisotropies. In order to reduce the number of
multipoles types needed for polarization, and thus to speed up the numerical
resolution, an optimal hierarchy has been proposed in the literature for
Einstein-Boltzmann codes. However, it has been recently shown that the
separability between directional and orbital eigenfunctions employed in the
optimal hierarchy is not correct in the presence of spatial curvature. We
investigate how the assumption of separability affects the optimal hierarchy,
and show that it introduces relative errors of order $\Omega_K$ with respect to
the full hierarchy. Despite of that, we show that the optimal hierarchy still
gives extremely good results for temperature and polarization angular spectra,
with relative errors that are much smaller than cosmic variance even for
curvatures as large as $|\Omega_K|=0.1$. Still, we find that the polarization
angular spectra from tensor perturbations are significantly altered when using
the optimal hierarchy, leading to errors that are typically of order $50

the Sinkhorn algorithm. Since FROT finds the transport plan from selected

propose using the FROT algorithm for the layer selection problem in deep neural

integration of knowledge. Existing EA solutions mainly rely on structural
information to align entities, typically through KG embedding. Nonetheless, in
real-life KGs, only a few entities are densely connected to others, and the
rest majority possess rather sparse neighborhood structure. We refer to the
latter as long-tail entities, and observe that such phenomenon arguably limits
the use of structural information for EA. To mitigate the issue, we revisit and
investigate into the conventional EA pipeline in pursuit of elegant
performance. For pre-alignment, we propose to amplify long-tail entities, which
are of relatively weak structural information, with entity name information
that is generally available (but overlooked) in the form of concatenated power
mean word embeddings. For alignment, under a novel complementary framework of
consolidating structural and name signals, we identify entity's degree as
important guidance to effectively fuse two different sources of information. To
this end, a degree-aware co-attention network is conceived, which dynamically
adjusts the significance of features in a degree-aware manner. For
post-alignment, we propose to complement original KGs with facts from their
counterparts by using confident EA results as anchors via iterative training.
Comprehensive experimental evaluations validate the superiority of our proposed

the form of two-dimentional greyscale patterns with the pulse longitude and
polarization angle (PA) on the horizontal and vertical axis, respectively. Such
diagrams reveal several enigmatic polarization effects: 1) bifurcations and
loops of PA curve under central pulse components, 2) vertical spread of flux at
all PA values, 3) exchange of power content between PA tracks of two orthogonal
polarization modes (OPMs), and 4) peripherically-flat PA swings that span more
than 180 degrees. It is shown that all these phenomena result from passage of
observed polarization state near the pure-V pole of Poincare sphere. Much of
their complexity results from cartographic transformation from Poincare sphere
to the longitude-PA plane. An odd number of near-pole passage produces apparent
replacement of OPMs power in the profile wings, although the same amount of
flux keeps staying in each modal patch on the Poincare sphere. The fitting of
pulsar PA curves should therefore allow for transitions between the primary
(strong) and secondary (weak) PA track. The Stokes-space (or Poincare-sphere)
representation of pulsar polarization data contains crucial polarization
information and needs to accompany the traditional viewing if the published
figures are to be fully useful for interpretation.

quadratic splines, is not suitable for time-optimal control problems due to
constraint violation and inherent oscillations. However, choosing constant or
linear control splines points out to be very effective. A major advantage is
that the implicit solution of the system dynamics is suited for stiff systems

rough hard spheres under simple shear flow are determined from the Boltzmann
kinetic equation. The influence of the interstitial gas on rough hard spheres
is modeled via a Fokker-Planck generalized equation for rotating spheres
accounting for the coupling of both the translational and rotational degrees of
freedom of grains with the background viscous gas. The generalized
Fokker-Planck term is the sum of two ordinary Fokker-Planck differential
operators in linear $\mathbf{v}$ and angular $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ velocity
space. As usual, each Fokker-Planck operator is constituted by a drag force
term (proportional to $\mathbf{v}$ and/or $\boldsymbol{\omega}$) plus a
stochastic Langevin term defined in terms of the background temperature
$T_\text{ex}$. The Boltzmann equation is solved by two different but
complementary approaches: (i) by means of Grad's moment method, and (ii) by
using a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK)-type kinetic model adapted to inelastic
rough hard spheres. As occurs in the case of \emph{smooth} inelastic hard
spheres, our results show that both the temperature and the non-Newtonian
viscosity increase drastically with increasing the shear rate (discontinuous
shear thickening effect) while the fourth-degree velocity moments also exhibit
an $S$-shape. In particular, while high levels of roughness may slightly
attenuate the jump of the viscosity in comparison to the smooth case, the
opposite happens for the rotational temperature. As an application of these
results, a linear stability analysis of the steady simple shear flow solution
is also carried out showing that there are regions of the parameter space where
the steady solution becomes linearly unstable.

agent is strategic and jumps to empty nodes of the graph aiming to maximize her
utility, defined as the ratio of her friends in her neighborhood over the
neighborhood size including herself. This is in contrast to the related
literature on Schelling games which typically assumes that an agent is excluded
from her neighborhood whilst computing its size. Our model enables the utility
function to capture likely cases where agents would rather be around a lot of
friends instead of just a few, an aspect that was partially ignored in previous
work. We provide a thorough analysis of the (in)efficiency of equilibria that
arise in such modified Schelling games, by bounding the price of anarchy and

In the first phase, an active network topology is created by selecting a

optimized by finding an optimal ordering of transmission sets. In this paper,
we are proposing a feedback loop from transmission set generation to topology

directly imaged extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) exhibit rich evidence of
large-scale weather. Cloud radiative feedback has been proposed as a potential
mechanism driving the vigorous atmospheric circulation on BDs and directly
imaged EGPs, and yet it has not been demonstrated in three-dimensional
dynamical models at relevant conditions. Here we present a series of
atmospheric circulation models that self-consistently coupled dynamics with
idealized cloud formation and its radiative effects. We demonstrate that
vigorous atmospheric circulation can be triggered and self-maintained by cloud
radiative feedback. Typical isobaric temperature variation could reach over 100
K and horizontally averaged wind speed could be several hundred m/s. The
circulation is dominated by cloud-forming and clear-sky vortices that evolve
over timescales from several to tens of hours. The typical horizontal
lengthscale of dominant vortices is closed to the Rossby deformation radius,
showing a linear dependence on the inverse of rotation rate. Stronger rotation
tends to weaken the vertical transport of vapor and clouds, leading to overall
thinner clouds. Domain-mean outgoing radiative flux exhibits variability over
timescales of tens of hours due to the statistical evolution of storms.
Different bottom boundary conditions in the models could lead to qualitatively
different circulation near the observable layer. The circulation driven by
cloud radiative feedback represents a robust mechanism generating significant
surface inhomogeneity as well as irregular flux time variability. Our results
have important implications for near-IR colors of dusty BDs and EGPs, including
the scatter in the near-IR color-magnitude diagram and the viewing-geometry
dependent near-IR colors.

field games on a finite state space and, in this respect, to show that
equilibria that do not minimize the corresponding mean field control problem
should be ruled out. Our strategy is a tailored-made version of the vanishing
viscosity method for partial differential equations. Here, the viscosity has to
be understood as the square intensity of a common noise that is inserted in the
mean field game or, equivalently, as the diffusivity parameter in the related
parabolic version of the master equation. As established recently, the randomly
forced mean field game becomes indeed uniquely solvable for a relevant choice
of a Wright-Fisher common noise, the counterpart of which in the master
equation is a Kimura operator on the simplex. We here elaborate on this idea to
make the mean field game with common noise both uniquely solvable and
potential, meaning that its unique solution is in fact equal to the unique
minimizer of a suitable stochastic mean field control problem. Taking the limit
as the intensity of the common noise vanishes, we obtain a rigorous proof of
the aforementioned selection principle. As a byproduct, we get that the
classical solution to the viscous master equation associated with the mean
field game with common noise converges to the gradient of the value function of
the mean field control problem without common noise; we hence select a
particular weak solution of the master equation of the original mean field
game. Lastly, we establish an intrinsic uniqueness criterion for this solution
within a suitable class.

offering a unified formulation for diverse human motion systems. Moreover, a
novel deep network is designed to parameterize this system, which jointly

blockchain. Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be
modified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting
target for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing
millions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety
of tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on
symbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation.
Recently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts.
However, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less
effective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving
low code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to
achieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination
of symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on
smart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart
contracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a
smart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex
conditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts.
Moreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently
generate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract
states in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius
by comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for
smart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and 21K

is known as a powerful probe of cosmology. Observations of large-scale RSD have
given tight constraints on the linear growth rate of the large-scale structures
in the universe. On the other hand, the small-scale RSD, caused by galaxy
random motions inside clusters, has not been much used in cosmology, but also
has cosmological information because universes with different cosmological
parameters have different halo mass functions and virialized velocities. We
focus on the projected correlation function $w(r_p)$ and the multipole moments
$\xi_l$ on small scales ($1.4$ to $30\ h^{-1}\rm{Mpc}$). Using simulated galaxy
samples generated from a physically motivated most bound particle (MBP)-galaxy
correspondence scheme in the Multiverse Simulation, we examine the dependence
of the small-scale RSD on the cosmological matter density parameter $\Omega_m$,
the satellite velocity bias with respect to MBPs, $b_v^s$, and the
merger-time-scale parameter $\alpha$. We find that $\alpha=1.5$ gives an
excellent fit to the $w(r_p)$ and $\xi_l$ measured from the SDSS-KIAS value
added galaxy catalog. We also define the ``strength'' of Fingers-of-God as the
ratio of the parallel and perpendicular size of the contour in the two-point
correlation function set by a specific threshold value and show that the
strength parameter helps constraining $(\Omega_m, b_v^s, \alpha)$ by breaking
the degeneracy among them. The resulting parameter values from all measurements
are $(\Omega_m,b_v^s)=(0.272\pm0.013,0.982\pm0.040)$, indicating a slight
reduction of satellite galaxy velocity relative to the MBP. However,
considering that the average MBP speed inside haloes is $0.94$ times the dark
matter velocity dispersion, the main drivers behind the galaxy velocity bias
are gravitational interactions, rather than baryonic effects.

  Bursts","Submitted to Nature Astronomy, May 18, 2020",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are short (millisecond) radio pulses originating
from enigmatic sources at extragalactic distances so far lacking a detection in
other energy bands. Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered
as the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because
of differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar
characteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE
satellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very
bright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected
by AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is
spectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~
$10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first
time that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like
radio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit
X-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be
discovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR
1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of
repeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may
power the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique
occasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on
the X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs. Our detection enlightens and constrains
the physical process leading to FRBs: contrary to previous expectations,
high-brightness temperature radio emission coexists with spectrally-cutoff
X-ray radiation.

model-free, neural--network based machine-learning technique -- to forecast the
upcoming solar cycle, sunspot cycle 25. The standard algorithm forecasts that
solar cycle 25 is going to last about ten years, the maxima is going to appear
in the year 2024 and the maximum number of sunspots is going to be 113

forecasts for duration and peak timing matches that of the standard algorithm,
but whose peak amplitude forecast is 124 ($\pm2$) -- within the upper bound of
the standard reservoir computing algorithm. We conclude that sunspot cycle 25
is likely to be a weak, lower than average solar cycle, somewhat similar in

upfront. The more challenging online setting has received less attention. No
samples from the target user are available in advance, but they arrive
sequentially. Additionally, the motion pattern of users may change over time.
Thus, adapting to new and forgetting old information must be traded off.
Finally, the target user should not have to do any work to use the recognition
system by, say, labeling any activities. Our work addresses all of these
challenges by proposing an unsupervised online domain adaptation algorithm.
Both classification and personalization happen continuously and incrementally
in real time. Our solution works by aligning the feature distributions of all
subjects, be they sources or the target, in hidden neural network layers. To
this end, we normalize the input of a layer with user-specific mean and
variance statistics. During training, these statistics are computed over
user-specific batches. In the online phase, they are estimated incrementally
for any new target user.

electronic correlations and crystal structure exhibiting multiple first order

theoretical description of this temperature dependent electronic-structural
interplay in the vicinity of a Mott transition is still a challenge. Here we
address this issue by simultaneously considering both structural and electronic
degrees of freedom, within a self-consistent density functional theory with
embedded dynamical mean field theory. Our results show the existence of novel
electronic states characterized by coexistence of insulating, semi-metallic and
metallic orbitals. This state is in agreement with resonant X-ray scattering.
We also show that electronic entropy plays a decisive role in both electronic
and structural phase transitions. By self-consistent determination of both, the
electronic state and the corresponding crystal structure, we show that the
temperature evolution of these phases can be quantitatively explained from
first principles, thus demonstrating the predictive power of the theoretical
method for both the structural and the electronic properties.

The main aim is to identify an optimal height range, if any, in the interface
region between the photosphere and lower corona, where the flare onset time
prediction capability of WGM is best exploited. The optimal height is where
flare prediction, by means of the WGM method, is achieved earlier than at the
photospheric level. 3D magnetic structures, based on potential and non-linear
force-free field extrapolations, are constructed to study a vertical range from
the photosphere up to the low corona with a 45 km step size. The WGM method is
applied as a function of height to all 13 flaring AR cases that are subject to
certain selection criteria. We found that applying the WGM method between 1000

onset time by around 2-8 hours.Certain caveats and an outlook for future work

inconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous

  Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks
for constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material
point level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks
(TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the
network's architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to
compute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In
this way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their
relation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the
network. Consequently, our network does not have to identify the underlying
pattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large
data-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the
predictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain
thermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features,
TANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling
with neural networks.
  We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic
materials, with strain hardening and strain softening. Detailed comparisons
show that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs. TANNs '
architecture is general, enabling applications to materials with different or
more complex behavior, without any modification.

Interestingly, not all types of mosquitoes spread diseases, but rather, a
select few alone are competent enough to do so. In the case of any disease
outbreak, an important first step is surveillance of vectors (i.e., those
mosquitoes capable of spreading diseases). To do this today, public health
workers lay several mosquito traps in the area of interest. Hundreds of
mosquitoes will get trapped. Naturally, among these hundreds, taxonomists have
to identify only the vectors to gauge their density. This process today is
manual, requires complex expertise/ training, and is based on visual inspection
of each trapped specimen under a microscope. It is long, stressful and
self-limiting. This paper presents an innovative solution to this problem. Our
technique assumes the presence of an embedded camera (similar to those in
smart-phones) that can take pictures of trapped mosquitoes. Our techniques
proposed here will then process these images to automatically classify the
genus and species type. Our CNN model based on Inception-ResNet V2 and Transfer
Learning yielded an overall accuracy of 80% in classifying mosquitoes when
trained on 25,867 images of 250 trapped mosquito vector specimens captured via
many smart-phone cameras. In particular, the accuracy of our model in
classifying Aedes aegypti and Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (both of which are
deadly vectors) is amongst the highest. We present important lessons learned
and practical impact of our techniques towards the end of the paper.

COVID-QF uses Hadoop HDFS/Map Reduce and Apache Spark. The COVID-QF consists of
three Layers: data collection layer, storage layer, and query Processing layer.
The data is collected in the data collection layer. The storage layer divides
data into collection of data-saving and processing blocks, and it connects the
Connector of the spark with different databases engine to reduce time of saving
and retrieving. While the Processing layer executes the request query and sends
results. The proposed framework used three datasets increased for time for

astrong set of CNNs that exploit dependencies among abnormality labels and used
the labelsmoothing regularization (LSR) for a better handling of uncertain

the best of our knowledge, this is the highest AUC score yetreported to date.
More importantly, the proposed method was also evaluated on an inde-pendent

gauge-invariant scalar and tensor perturbations under the general extended
disformal transformation, namely, $g_{\mu\nu} \rightarrow A(X,Y,Z)g_{\mu\nu} +
\Phi_\mu\Phi_\nu$, where $X \equiv -\tfrac{1}{2}\phi^{;\mu}\phi_{;\mu}, Y

$(\phi,X,Y,Z)$. We find that the tensor perturbation is invariant under this
transformation. On the other hand, the scalar curvature perturbation receives a
correction due the conformal term only; it is independent of the disformal term
at least up to linear order. Within the framework of the full Horndeski theory,
the correction terms turn out to depend linearly on the gauge-invariant
comoving density perturbation and the first time-derivative thereof. In the
superhorizon limit, all these correction terms vanish, leaving only the
original scalar curvature perturbation. In other words, it is invariant under
the general extended disformal transformation in the superhorizon limit, in the

studies on the transformation or invariance of the primordial cosmological
perturbations, generalizing their results under our general extended disformal

In this paper, we (1) present a generic framework that can enable any image
codec to leverage high-level semantics and (2) study the joint optimization of

high-level semantics to augment the low-level visual features extracted by it
and produce essentially a new, semantic-aware codec. We propose a three-phase
training scheme that teaches semantic-aware codecs to leverage the power of
semantic to jointly optimize rate-perception-distortion (R-PD) performance. As
an additional benefit, semantic-aware codecs also boost the performance of
downstream computer vision algorithms. To validate our claim, we perform
extensive empirical evaluations and provide both quantitative and qualitative
results.

distributed equally in the extracellular matrix. Distributions of those

To keep similarity with the biological tumor environment, we have formulated
initial distributions of the chemical and non-chemical factors accordingly. We

question of how floating wind systems can be optimized to operate smoothly in

integrated optimization was conducted, where the hull shape of a
semi-submersible, as well as the wind turbine controller were varied with the
goal of finding a cost-efficient design, which does not respond to wind and
wave excitations, resulting in small structural fatigue and extreme loads. The
optimum design was found to have a remarkably low tower-base fatigue load
response and small rotor fore-aft amplitudes. Further investigations showed
that the reason for the good dynamic behavior is a particularly favorable
response to first-order wave loads: The floating wind turbine rotates in
pitch-direction about a point close to the rotor hub and the rotor fore-aft
motion is almost unaffected by the wave excitation. As a result, the power
production and the blade loads are not influenced by the waves. A comparable
effect was so far known for Tension Leg Platforms but not for semi-submersible
wind turbines. The methodology builds on a low-order simulation model, coupled
to a parametric panel code model, a detailed viscous drag model and an
individually tuned blade pitch controller. The results are confirmed by the
higher-fidelity model FAST. A new indicator to express the optimal behavior
through a single design criterion has been developed.

to model the occurrence of deaths due to COVID-19 and the model is calibrated
using data of daily death counts in combination with a snapshot of the the
proportion of individuals with an active infection, performed in Stockholm in

that the estimated proportion of the population who has been infected is around
13.5% in Stockholm, by 2020-05-15, and ranges between 2.5% - 15.6% in the other

novel applications ranging from narrow-linewidth lasers, microwave photonics,
to chip-scale optical frequency combs and quantum frequency conversion. To
translate these results into a widespread technology, attaining ultralow
optical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent
advances in fabrication of integrated Si3N4 photonics have shown that
ultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered microresonators can be attained at
die-level throughput. For emerging nonlinear applications such as integrated
travelling-wave parametric amplifiers and mode-locked lasers, PICs of length
scales of up to a meter are required, placing stringent demands on yield and
performance that have not been met with current fabrication techniques. Here we
overcome these challenges and demonstrate a fabrication technology which meets
all these requirements on wafer-level yield, performance and length scale.
Photonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 million,
corresponding to a linear propagation loss of 1.0 dB/m, are obtained over full
4-inch wafers, as determined from a statistical analysis of tens of thousands
of optical resonances and cavity ringdown with 19 ns photon storage time. The
process operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long spiral
waveguides with 2.4 dB/m loss in dies of only 5x5 mm size. Using a modulation
response measurement self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that,
strikingly, the intrinsic absorption-limited Q factor of our Si3N4
microresonators exceeds a billion. Transferring the present Si3N4 photonics
technology to standard commercial foundries, and merging it with silicon

Schr\""odinger, the philosophy of the Upanishads, and the evolutionary
philosophy of Sri Aurobindo. Central to it is that reality is relative to
consciousness or experience. Instead of a single mind-independent reality,
there are different poises of consciousness, including a consciousness to which
``we are all really only various aspects of the One'' (Schr\""odinger). This
ontology helps clear up unresolved issues in the philosophy of science, such as
arise from the reification of either instruments or calculational tools, or
from a disregard of the universal context of science, which is human
experience. It further helps clear up unresolved issues in the philosophy of
mind, among them the problem of intentionality and the dilemma posed by the
mutual inclusion of self and world (Husserl's paradox of human subjectivity).

  Quantification",,,,,"eess.AS cs.CR cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning systems and also, specifically, automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, where an attacker
maliciously changes the input. In the case of ASR systems, the most interesting
cases are targeted attacks, in which an attacker aims to force the system into
recognizing given target transcriptions in an arbitrary audio sample. The
increasing number of sophisticated, quasi imperceptible attacks raises the
question of countermeasures. In this paper, we focus on hybrid ASR systems and
compare four acoustic models regarding their ability to indicate uncertainty
under attack: a feed-forward neural network and three neural networks
specifically designed for uncertainty quantification, namely a Bayesian neural
network, Monte Carlo dropout, and a deep ensemble. We employ uncertainty
measures of the acoustic model to construct a simple one-class classification
model for assessing whether inputs are benign or adversarial. Based on this
approach, we are able to detect adversarial examples with an area under the
receiving operator curve score of more than 0.99. The neural networks for
uncertainty quantification simultaneously diminish the vulnerability to the
attack, which is reflected in a lower recognition accuracy of the malicious
target text in comparison to a standard hybrid ASR system.

hypotheses derived from an empirical study in a human-robot interaction and to
verify if they are validated in the same way for children as for a basic
reinforcement learning algorithm. Thus, we check whether receiving help from an
expert when solving a simple close-ended task (the Towers of Hano\""i) allows to
accelerate or not the learning of this task, depending on whether the
intervention is canonical or requested by the player. Our experiences have
allowed us to conclude that, whether requested or not, a Q-learning algorithm
benefits in the same way from expert help as children do.

  Can They Be?","12 pages",,,,"math.LO math.OA math.RA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Commutative totally ordered monoids abound, number systems for example. When
the monoid is not assumed commutative, one may be hard pressed to find an
example. One suggested by Professor Orr Shalit are the countable ordinals with
addition.
  In this note we attempt an introductory investigation of totally (also
partially) ordered monoids, not assumed commutative (still writing them
additively), and taking them as positive, i.e.\ every element is greater than
the unit element. That, in the usual commutative cases, allows the ordering to
be defined via the algebraic structure, namely, as divisibility (in our
additive sense): $a\le b$ defined as $\exists\,c\,\,(b=a+c)$. The
noncommutative case offers several ways to generalize that.
  First we try to follow the divisibility definition (on the right or on the
left). Then, alternatively, we insist on the ordering being compatible with the
operation both on the left and on the right, but strict inequality may not
carry over -- again refer to the ordinals example. We try to see what axiom(s)
such requirements impose on the monoid structure, and some facts are
established.
  Focusing especially on the totally ordered case, one finds that necessarily
the noncommutativity is somewhat limited. One may partly emulate here the
commutative case, speaking about infinitely grater vs.\ Archimedean to each
other elements, and in the Archimedean case even emulate Euclid's Elements'
theory of `ratios' -- all that imposing some partial commutativity.

To find the solution, we carry out the inverse transformation by convolving the
original coordinate vector with Dirac delta functions and changing integration
variables from the original coordinates to new coordinates. As a byproduct, we
derive a generalized version of Cramer's rule that applies to a partial set of
variables, which is new to our best knowledge. Our formulation of finding a
transformation rule for multi-variable functions shall be particularly useful
in changing a partial set of generalized coordinates of a mechanical system.

performance, Quality of Service (QoS), and Quality of Experience (QoE). The
discussions in the seminar focused on how crowdsourcing will support vendors,
operators, and regulators to determine the Quality of Experience in new 5G
networks that enable various new applications and network architectures. As a
result of the discussions, the need for a white paper manifested, with the goal
of providing a scientific discussion of the terms ""crowdsourced network

cases for such crowdsourced data, and its underlying challenges. During the
seminar, those main topics were identified, intensively discussed in break-out
groups, and brought back into the plenum several times. The outcome of the
seminar is this white paper at hand which is - to our knowledge - the first one
covering the topic of crowdsourced network and QoE measurements.
