W1 waveguide, have been designed to have lossless propagation modes, they are
prone to disorder-induced losses and backscattering. Topological structures
have been proposed to help mitigate this effect as their photonic edge states
may allow for topological protection. However, the intrinsic propagation losses
of these structures are not well understood and the concept of the light line
can become blurred. For four example topological edge state structures,
photonic band diagrams, loss parameters, and electromagnetic fields of the
guided modes are computed. Two of these structures, based on armchair edge
states, are found to have significant intrinsic losses for modes inside the
photonic band gap, more than 100 dB/cm, which is comparable to or larger than
typical disorder-induced losses using slow-light modes in conventional photonic
crystal waveguides, while the other two structures, using the valley Hall
effect and inversion symmetry, are found to have a good bandwidth for
exploiting lossless propagation modes below the light line.

Gran Sasso (Italy) has a unique opportunity to detect them directly thanks to
the detector's radiopurity and the precise understanding of the detector

based on the strategies we adopted to constrain the rates of the two most
relevant background sources, pep neutrinos from the solar pp-chain and Bi-210
beta decays originating in the intrinsic contamination of the liquid
scintillator with Pb-210.
  Assuming the CNO flux predicted by the high-metallicity Standard Solar Model
and an exposure of 1000 daysx71.3 t, Borexino has a median sensitivity to CNO
neutrino higher than 3 sigma. With the same hypothesis the expected
experimental uncertainty on the CNO neutrino flux is 23%, provided the
uncertainty on the independent estimate of the Bi-210 interaction rate is 1.5
cpd/100t.
  Finally, we evaluated the expected uncertainty of the C and N abundances and
the expected discrimination significance between the high and low metallicity
Standard Solar Models (HZ and LZ) with future more precise measurement of the
CNO solar neutrino flux.

structures of the associated quantum fields. We analyze the example of 4d

We extend this analysis to the case of 7d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SYM theory, where we
recover it from a mixed 't Hooft anomaly among the electric 1-form center
symmetry and the magnetic 4-form center symmetry in the defect group. The case
of five-dimensional SCFTs from M-theory on toric singularities is discussed in
detail. In that context we determine the corresponding 1-form and 2-form defect
groups and we explain how to determine the corresponding mixed 't Hooft
anomalies from flux non-commutativity. Several predictions for non-conventional
5d SCFTs are obtained. The matching of discrete higher-form symmetries and
their anomalies provides an interesting consistency check for 5d dualities.

tracts in large datasets and in clinical practice it is essential to have
methodology that is fast and easy to apply. This work therefore presents a new
approach for WM tract segmentation: Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct
extraction of WM tracts from diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural
network (CNN). This 3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in
aging individuals from a large population-based study (N=9752, 1.5T MRI). The
proposed method showed good segmentation performance and high reproducibility,
i.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, k = 0.72 ~ 0.83) and a low
scan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion measures (e.g., fractional
anisotropy: error = 1% ~ 5%). The reproducibility of the proposed method was
higher than that of a tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being
orders of magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed
that the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an external
dementia dataset (N=58, 3T MRI). In two proof-of-principle experiments, we
associated WM microstructure obtained using the proposed method with age in a
normal elderly population, and with disease subtypes in a dementia cohort. In
concordance with the literature, results showed a widespread reduction of
microstructural organization with aging and substantial group-wise
microstructure differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we
presented a highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that
has the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical practice.

enhancements in close proximity to the X-region (P2), which is observed to have
higher intensities for spectral lines formed at log T[K] =6.20 and voids at
other higher temperatures. The electron densities and temperatures in the
X-region (and P2) are maintained steadily at log N_e =8.5-8.7 /cc and log T[K]
=6.20, respectively. Doppler velocities in the X-region show predominant
redshifts by about 5-8 km/s when closer to the disk centre but blueshifts
(along with some zero-velocity pixels) when away from the centre. The
Full-Width-Half-Maxima (FWHM) maps reveal non-thermal velocities of about 27-30
km/s for Fe XII, Fe XIII and Fe XV lines. However, the brightest pixels have
non-thermal velocities of about 62 km/s for Fe XII and Fe XIII lines. On the
contrary, the dark X-region for Fe XV line have the highest non-thermal
velocity (roughly 115 km/s). We conclude that the TELs are formed due to
magnetic reconnection. We further note that the TELs themselves undergo
magnetic reconnection leading to reformation of loops of individual ARs.
Moreover, this study, for the first time, provides measurements of plasma
parameters in X-regions thereby providing essential constraints for theoretical
studies.

to be elliptical gives modelers the option of deforming it to more accurately
match the physical environment of the specific period or location to be
analyzed.
  Methods. A numerical solver is presented that solves Laplace's equation on a
three-dimensional grid using finite differences. The solver is capable of
working on structured spherical grids that can be deformed to create elliptical
source surfaces.
  Results. The configurations of the coronal magnetic field are presented using
this new solver. Three-dimensional renderings are complemented by
Carrington-like synoptic maps of the magnetic configuration at different
heights in the solar corona. Differences in the magnetic configuration computed
by the spherical and elliptical models are illustrated.

output the best fitting ReLU with respect to square loss given access to draws
from some unknown distribution. We give the first efficient, constant-factor
approximation algorithm for this problem assuming the underlying distribution
satisfies some weak concentration and anti-concentration conditions (and
includes, for example, all log-concave distributions). This solves the main
open problem of Goel et al., who proved hardness results for any exact
algorithm for ReLU regression (up to an additive $\epsilon$). Using more
sophisticated techniques, we can improve our results and obtain a
polynomial-time approximation scheme for any subgaussian distribution. Given
the aforementioned hardness results, these guarantees can not be substantially
improved.
  Our main insight is a new characterization of surrogate losses for nonconvex
activations. While prior work had established the existence of convex
surrogates for monotone activations, we show that properties of the underlying
distribution actually induce strong convexity for the loss, allowing us to
relate the global minimum to the activation's Chow parameters.

  scoring of chest X-rays for SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity","8 pages",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: A critical step in effective care and treatment planning for
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the
COVID-19 pandemic, is the assessment of the severity of disease progression.
Chest x-rays (CXRs) are often used to assess SARS-CoV-2 severity, with two
important assessment metrics being extent of lung involvement and degree of
opacity. In this proof-of-concept study, we assess the feasibility of
computer-aided scoring of CXRs of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity using a deep
learning system.
  Materials and Methods: Data consisted of 396 CXRs from SARS-CoV-2 positive
patient cases. Geographic extent and opacity extent were scored by two
board-certified expert chest radiologists (with 20+ years of experience) and a
2nd-year radiology resident. The deep neural networks used in this study, which
we name COVID-Net S, are based on a COVID-Net network architecture. 100
versions of the network were independently learned (50 to perform geographic
extent scoring and 50 to perform opacity extent scoring) using random subsets
of CXRs from the study, and we evaluated the networks using stratified Monte
Carlo cross-validation experiments.
  Findings: The COVID-Net S deep neural networks yielded R$^2$ of 0.664 $\pm$
0.032 and 0.635 $\pm$ 0.044 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for
geographic extent and opacity extent, respectively, in stratified Monte Carlo
cross-validation experiments. The best performing networks achieved R$^2$ of
0.739 and 0.741 between predicted scores and radiologist scores for geographic
extent and opacity extent, respectively.
  Interpretation: The results are promising and suggest that the use of deep
neural networks on CXRs could be an effective tool for computer-aided
assessment of SARS-CoV-2 lung disease severity, although additional studies are
needed before adoption for routine clinical use.

notion of intrinsic topological entropy for subsets of the fractal. A
generalized notion of Bowen's entropy associated to any increasing sequence of

used to describe the self-exciting nature of earthquake occurrences. While
traditional inference methods provide only point estimates of the model
parameters, we aim at a full Bayesian treatment of model inference, allowing
naturally to incorporate prior knowledge and uncertainty quantification of the
resulting estimates. Therefore, we introduce a highly flexible, non-parametric
representation for the spatially varying ETAS background intensity through a
Gaussian process (GP) prior. Combined with classical triggering functions this
results in a new model formulation, namely the GP-ETAS model. We enable
tractable and efficient Gibbs sampling by deriving an augmented form of the
GP-ETAS inference problem. This novel sampling approach allows us to assess the
posterior model variables conditioned on observed earthquake catalogues, i.e.,
the spatial background intensity and the parameters of the triggering function.
Empirical results on two synthetic data sets indicate that GP-ETAS outperforms
standard models and thus demonstrate the predictive power for observed
earthquake catalogues including uncertainty quantification for the estimated
parameters. Finally, a case study for the l'Aquila region, Italy, with the
devastating event on 6 April 2009, is presented.

asteroid belt (MB) and used it to study the contribution of the different
regions of the MB to the near-earth asteroids (NEAs). Methods. We built a
statistical code called ACDC that simulates the collisional evolution of the MB
split into six regions (namely Inner, Middle, Pristine, Outer, Cybele and
High-Inclination belts) according to the positions of the major resonances
present there ($\nu_{6}$, 3:1J, 5:2J, 7:3J and 2:1J). We consider the Yarkovsky
effect and the mentioned resonances as the main mechanism that removes
asteroids from the different regions of the MB and delivers them to the NEA
region. We calculated the evolution of the NEAs coming from the different
source regions by considering the bodies delivered by the resonances and mean
dynamical timescales in the NEA population. Results. Our model is in agreement
with the major observational constraints associated with the MB, such as the
size distributions of the different regions of the MB and the number of large
asteroid families. It is also able to reproduce the observed NEAs with H < 16
and agrees with recent estimations for H < 20, but deviates for smaller sizes.
We find that most sources make a significant contribution to the NEAs; however
the Inner and Middle belts stand out as the most important source of NEAs
followed by the Outer belt. The contributions of the Pristine and Cybele
regions are minor. The High-Inclination belt is the source of only a fraction
of the actual observed NEAs with high inclination, as there are dynamical
processes in that region that enable asteroids to increase and decrease their
inclinations.

interstellar ices and their structure. Some molecules have been identified
within the interstellar ices either as pure, mixed, or even as layered
structures. Absorption band features of water ice can significantly change with
the presence of different types of impurities (CO, CO2, CH3OH, H2CO, etc.). In
this work, we carried out a theoretical investigation to understand the
behavior of water band frequency, and strength in the presence of impurities.
The computational study has been supported and complemented by some infrared
spectroscopy experiments aimed at verifying the effect of HCOOH, NH3 , and CH3
OH on the band profiles of pure H2O ice. Specifically, we explored the effect
on the band strength of libration, bending, bulk stretching, and free-OH
stretching modes. Computed band strength profiles have been compared with our
new and existing experimental results, thus pointing out that vibrational modes
of H2O and their intensities can change considerably in the presence of
impurities at different concentrations. In most cases, the bulk stretching mode
is the most affected vibration, while the bending is the least affected mode.
HCOOH was found to have a strong influence on the libration, bending, and bulk
stretching band profiles. In the case of NH3, the free-OH stretching band
disappears when the impurity concentration becomes 50%. This work will

the analytical evolution equations of two vortex identification criteria. The
two criteria used are vorticity and the swirling strength. Vorticity can be
biased in the presence of shear flows, but its dynamical equation is well
known; the swirling strength is a more precise criterion for the identification
of vortical flows, but its evolution equation is not known yet. Therefore, we
explore the possibility of deriving a dynamical equation for the swirling
strength. We then apply the two equations to analyze radiative MHD simulations
of the solar atmosphere produced with the CO5BOLD code. We present a detailed
review of the swirling strength criterion and the mathematical derivation of
its evolution equation. This equation did not exist in the literature before
and it constitutes a novel tool that is suitable for the analysis of a wide
range of problems in (magneto-)hydrodynamics. By applying this equation to
numerical models, we find that hydrodynamical and magnetic baroclinicities are
the driving physical processes responsible for vortex generation in the
convection zone and the photosphere. Higher up in the chromosphere, the
magnetic terms alone dominate. Moreover, we find that the swirling strength is
produced at small scales in a chaotic fashion, especially inside magnetic flux
concentrations. The swirling strength represents an appropriate criterion for
the identification of vortices in turbulent flows, such as those in the solar
atmosphere. Moreover, its evolution equation, which is derived in this paper,
is pivotal for obtaining precise information about the dynamics of these
vortices and the physical mechanisms responsible for their production and
evolution. Since this equation is available, the swirling strength is now the
ideal quantity to study the dynamics of vortices in (magneto-)hydrodynamics.

simple and does not require a specialized library, unlike many other modern

redshifts through the imprints of tidal effects in GW waveforms. We find for
these events, the observations of electromagnetic counterparts in low-redshift
range $z < 0.1$ are important for constraining the tidal effects. Considering
17 different EOSs of NSs or quark-stars, we find GW observations have strong
capability to determine the EOS. Applying the events as standard sirens, and
considering the constraints of NS's EOS derived from low-redshift observations
as prior, we can constrain the dark-energy EOS parameters $w_0$ and $w_a$. In
3G era, the potential constraints are $\Delta w_0\in (0.0006,0.004)$ and
$\Delta w_a\in(0.004,0.02)$, which are 1-3 orders smaller than those from
traditional methods, including Type Ia supernovas and baryon acoustic
oscillations. The constraints are also 1 order smaller than the method of GW
standard siren by fixing the redshifts through short-hard $\gamma$-ray bursts,
due to more available GW events in this method. Therefore, GW standard sirens,
based on the tidal effect measurement, provide a realizable and much more

scattering amplitudes has revealed deep structures in QFTs. It has been
developed in great depth at the tree- and loop-level amplitudes in
$\mathcal{N}=4~\text{SYM}$ theory and has been extended to the scalar $\phi^3$
and $\phi^4$ theories at tree-level. In this paper, we use the generalized BCFW
recursion relations for massless planar $\phi^4$ theory to constrain the
weights of a class of geometric objects called Stokes polytopes, which manifest
in the geometric formulation of $\phi^4$ amplitudes. We see that the weights of
the Stokes polytopes are intricately tied to the boundary terms in $\phi^4$
theories. We compute the weights of $N=1,2$, and $3$ dimensional Stokes
polytopes corresponding to six-, eight- and ten-point amplitudes respectively.
We generalize our results to higher-point amplitudes and show that the

Uranus (Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon). We find that the most
recent major mean-motion resonance (MMR) between any two moons, the
Ariel-Umbriel 5:3 MMR, had a large effect on the whole system. Our results
suggest that this resonance is responsible for the current 4.3$^{\circ}$
inclination of Miranda (instead of previously proposed 3:1 Miranda-Umbriel
MMR), and that all five moons had their inclinations excited during this
resonance. Miranda experienced significant tidal heating during the
Ariel-Umbriel 5:3 MMR due to its eccentricity being excited by Ariel's secular
perturbations. This tidal heating draws energy from shrinking of Miranda's
orbit, rather than Ariel's outward evolution, and can generate heat flows in
excess of 100 mW m$^{-2}$, sufficient to produce young coronae on Miranda. We
find that this MMR was followed by a sequence of secular resonances, which
reshuffled the moons' eccentricities and inclinations. We also find that the
precession of Oberon's spin axis is close to a resonance with the precession of
Umbriel's orbital plane, and that this spin-orbit resonance was likely excited
during the Ariel-Umbriel 5:3 MMR. After the exit from the MMR, subsequent
Ariel-Umbriel secular resonance and Oberon-Umbriel spin-orbit resonance may be
able to explain the current low inclinations of Ariel and Umbriel. The age of
Miranda's surface features tentatively suggests Uranian tidal
$Q=15,000-20,000$, which can be further refined in future work.

analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called
rare events. In practice, since rare events are by definition atypical, they
are often difficult to access in a statistically significant way. What are
required are strategies to ""make rare events typical"" so that they can be
generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively
construct a dynamics that efficiently samples atypical events. We do so by
exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set
of machine learning techniques aimed at finding the optimal behaviour to
maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general
perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are
described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between
a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics
we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate
the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple
illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random
walker, for the case of rare events with a finite time horizon; and the problem
of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for
the case of an infinite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the
ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, first
passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.

indicator of distance assuming that DM in excess of the expected amount within
the Milky Way in the direction of each FRB arise mostly from the inter-galactic
medium. However, the assumption might not be true if, for example, most FRB
progenitors are embedded in ionized circumstellar material (CSM, e.g. supernova
remnant). In this study, we jointly analyze distributions of DM, flux density,
and fluence of the FRB samples observed by the Parkes telescope and the
Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) using analytical models of
FRBs, to constrain fractions of various DM components that shape the overall DM
distribution and emission properties of FRBs. Comparing the model predictions
with the observations we find that the typical amount of DM in each FRB host
galaxy is $\sim 120$ cm$^{-3}$pc which is naturally explained as a combination
of interstellar medium (ISM) and halo of an ordinary galaxy, without additional
contribution from ionized CSM that is directly associated with an FRB
progenitor. Furthermore, we also find that observed flux densities of FRBs do
not statistically suffer strong $K$-correction, i.e. the typical luminosity
density of FRBs does not significantly change within the range of emitting

Specifically, we investigate an effective class of approaches that associate a
weak localization with each category either in terms of the bounding box or
segmentation mask. Doing so improves the accuracy of multi-label
categorization. The approach we adopt is one of active learning, i.e.,
incrementally selecting a set of samples that need supervision based on the
current model, obtaining supervision for these samples, retraining the model
with the additional set of supervised samples and proceeding again to select
the next set of samples. A crucial concern is the choice of the set of samples.
In doing so, we provide a novel insight, and no specific measure succeeds in
obtaining a consistently improved selection criterion. We, therefore, provide a
selection criterion that consistently improves the overall baseline criterion
by choosing the top k set of samples for a varied set of criteria. Using this
criterion, we are able to show that we can retain more than 98% of the fully

uplink distributed MIMO cloud radio access networks (C-RAN) with an overall
excess of receive antennas, in which users are jointly served by distributed
multi-antenna receivers connected to a central processor via individual
finite-capacity fronthaul links. We first show that, under quantization
noise-limited operation, applying linear dimension reduction at each receiver
before compressing locally with a uniform quantization noise level results in a
sum capacity that scales approximately linearly with fronthaul capacity, and
can come within a fixed gap of the cut-set bound. The dimension reduction
filters that maximize joint mutual information are then shown to be truncated
forms of the conditional Karhunen-Loeve transform, with a block coordinate
ascent algorithm for finding a stationary point given. Analysis and numerical
results indicate that the signal dimension can be reduced without significant
loss of information, particularly at high signal-to-noise ratio, preserving the
benefits of using excess antennas. The method is then adapted for the case of
imperfect channel state information at the receivers. The scheme significantly
outperforms conventional local signal compression at all fronthaul rates, and
with complexity linear in network size represents a scalable solution for
distributed MIMO C-RAN systems.

prior works tackling this problem, a complete picture of the trade-offs between
sample complexity and statistical accuracy is yet to be determined. In
particular, all prior results suffer from a severe sample size barrier, in the
sense that their claimed statistical guarantees hold only when the sample size

paper overcomes this barrier by certifying the minimax optimality of two
algorithms -- a perturbed model-based algorithm and a conservative model-based
algorithm -- as soon as the sample size exceeds the order of
$\frac{|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|}{1-\gamma}$ (modulo some log factor). Moving
beyond infinite-horizon MDPs, we further study time-inhomogeneous

suffices to achieve minimax-optimal sample complexity given any target accuracy
level. To the best of our knowledge, this work delivers the first
minimax-optimal guarantees that accommodate the entire range of sample sizes

errors that do not converge to the weighted Bayes risk, which motivates our
consideration of robust risks. We define a robust risk that minimizes risk over
a set of weightings and show excess risk bounds for this problem. Finally, we
show that particular choices of the weighting set leads to a special instance
of conditional value at risk (CVaR) from stochastic programming, which we call
label conditional value at risk (LCVaR). Additionally, we generalize this
weighting to derive a new robust risk problem that we call label heterogeneous
conditional value at risk (LHCVaR). Finally, we empirically demonstrate the
efficacy of LCVaR and LHCVaR on improving class conditional risks.

multiphase ISM is not yet well understood. We address this question using a set
of FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-mass disk galaxies, in
which a multiphase ISM is self-consistently shaped by gravity, cooling, and
stellar feedback. We analyze how gravity determines the vertical pressure
profile as well as how the total ISM pressure is partitioned between different
phases and components (thermal, dispersion/turbulence, and bulk flows). We show
that, on average and consistent with previous more idealized simulations, the
total ISM pressure balances the weight of the overlying gas. Deviations from
vertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and
with decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total
pressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal
pressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases,
which dominate the total pressure near the midplane. Bulk flows (e.g., inflows
and fountains) are important at a few disk scale heights, while thermal
pressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights. Overall, the total midplane
pressure is well-predicted by the weight of the disk gas, and we show that it
also scales linearly with the star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR).
These results support the notion that the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation arises
because Sigma_SFR and the gas surface density (Sigma_g) are connected via the
ISM midplane pressure.

galaxy halos (e.g. dwarf galaxies) is a powerful probe of the nature of DM. We
propose a novel scheme to probe the inner profiles of galaxy subhalos using
stellar streams. We show that the present day morphological and dynamical
properties of accreted globular cluster (GC) streams - those produced from
tidal stripping of GCs that initially evolved within satellite galaxies and
later merged with the Milky Way (MW) - are sensitive to the central DM density
profile and mass of their parent satellites. GCs that accrete within cuspy CDM
subhalos produce streams that are physically wider and dynamically hotter than
streams that accrete inside cored subhalos. A first comparison of MW streams
""GD-1"" and ""Jhelum"" (likely of accreted GC origin) with our simulations
indicates a preference for cored subhalos. If these results hold up in future
data, the implication is that either the DM cusps were erased by baryonic
feedback, or their subhalos naturally possessed cored density profiles implying
DM models beyond CDM. Moreover, accreted GC streams are highly structured and
exhibit complex morphological features (e.g., parallel structures and ""spurs"").
This implies that the accretion scenario can naturally explain the recently
observed peculiarities in some of the MW streams. We also propose a novel
mechanism for forming ""gaps"" in streams when the remnant of the parent subhalo
later passes through the stream. This encounter can last a longer time (and
have more of an impact) than the random encounters with DM subhalos previously
considered, because the GC stream and its parent subhalo are on similar orbits
with small relative velocities. Current and future surveys of the MW halo will
uncover numerous faint stellar streams and provide the data needed to
substantiate our preliminary tests with this new probe of DM.

Band 6 (1.3 mm) in full polarization mode to map the polarized emission from
dust grains at a physical scale of $\sim$2700 au in the massive protocluster
W43-MM1. We used these data to measure the orientation of the magnetic field at
the core scale. Then, we examined the relative orientations of the core-scale
magnetic field, of the protostellar outflows determined from CO molecular line
emission, and of the major axis of the dense cores determined from 2D Gaussian
fit in the continuum emission. We found that the orientation of the dense cores
is not random with respect to the magnetic field. Instead, the dense cores are
compatible with being oriented 20-50$^\deg$ with respect to the magnetic field.
The outflows could be oriented 50-70$^\deg$ with respect to the magnetic field,
or randomly oriented with respect to the magnetic field, similar to current
results in low-mass star-forming regions. In conclusion, the observed alignment
of the position angle of the cores with respect to the magnetic field lines
shows that the magnetic field is well coupled with the dense material; however,
the 20-50$^\deg$ preferential orientation contradicts the predictions of the
magnetically-controlled core-collapse models. The potential correlation of the
outflow directions with respect to the magnetic field suggests that, in some
cases, the magnetic field is strong enough to control the angular momentum
distribution from the core scale down to the inner part of the circumstellar
disks where outflows are triggered.

coupled. This makes it non-straightforward to derive a universal ef effective

such number is not conserved are described inclusively by allowing for
imaginary parts in the Wilson coefficients. Thus, while the symmetry is

around late-type galaxies, the origin of the gas is uncertain with suggestions
that galactic feedback could be the dominant source of energy powering the
emission. We investigate the origin and X-ray properties of the hot gas that
surrounds galaxies of halo mass, $(10^{11}-10^{14}) \mathrm{M}_\odot$, in the
cosmological hydrodynamical EAGLE simulations. We find that the central X-ray
emission, $\leq 0.10 R_{\mathrm{vir}}$, of halos of mass $\leq 10^{13}
\mathrm{M}_\odot$ originates from gas heated by supernovae (SNe). However,
beyond this region, a quasi-hydrostatic, accreted atmosphere dominates the
X-ray emission in halos of mass $\geq 10^{12} \mathrm{M}_\odot$. We predict
that a dependence on halo mass of the hot gas to dark matter mass fraction can
significantly change the slope of the $L_{\mathrm{X}}-M_{\mathrm{vir}}$
relation (which is typically assumed to be $4/3$ for clusters) and we derive
the scaling law appropriate to this case. As the gas fraction in halos
increases with halo mass, we find a steeper slope for the
$L_{\mathrm{X}}-M_{\mathrm{vir}}$ in lower mass halos, $\leq 10^{14}

nuclei (AGN) feedback. We also identify the physical origin of the so-called

Lagrangian perturbation theory (LPT), which improves over noise problems and
interpolation requirements of LPT. It furthermore allows for a manifestly

manifolds, the compactness of which is established for 4 of them. We show that
all our de Sitter solutions are perturbatively unstable, using a restricted 4d
effective theory of four scalar fields. We finally analyse whether our
solutions can be promoted to classical string backgrounds. Several of them
appear as good candidates, as they satisfy all requirements imposed so far.

emitters (LAEs) samples caused by the miss-identification of the Lyman-$\alpha$

Ly$\alpha$ line profiles from our previous LAE theoretical model that includes
radiative transfer in the interstellar and intergalactic mediums. We introduce
a novel approach to measure the systemic redshift of LAEs from their Ly$\alpha$
line using neural networks. In detail, we assume that, for a fraction of the
whole LAE population their systemic redshift is determined precisely through
other spectral features. We then use this subset to train a neural network that
predicts the Ly$\alpha$ wavelength given a Ly$\alpha$ line profile. We test two
different training sets: i) the LAEs are selected homogeneously and ii) only
the brightest LAEs are selected. In comparison with previous approaches in the
literature, our methodology improves significantly both accuracy and precision
in determining the Ly$\alpha$ wavelength. In fact, after applying our algorithm
in ideal Ly$\alpha$ line profiles, we recover the clustering unperturbed down
to 1cMpc/h. Then, we test the performance of our methodology in realistic
Ly$\alpha$ line profiles by downgrading their quality. The machine learning
techniques work well even if the Ly$\alpha$ line profile quality is decreased
considerably. We conclude that LAE surveys such as HETDEX would benefit from
determining with high accuracy the systemic redshift of a subpopulation and
applying our methodology to estimate the systemic redshift of the rest of the
galaxy sample.

going back over two decades has advanced the idea that collapsed dark matter
haloes have simple and approximately universal forms for their mass density and
pseudo-phase space density (PPSD) distributions. However, a general consensus
on the physical origin of these results has not yet been reached. In the
present study, we explore to what extent the apparent universality of these
forms holds when we vary the initial conditions (i.e., the primordial power
spectrum of density fluctuations) away from the standard CMB-normalised case,
but still within the context of LCDM with a fixed expansion history. Using
simulations that vary the initial amplitude and shape, we show that the
structure of dark matter haloes retains a clear memory of the initial
conditions. Specifically, increasing (lowering) the amplitude of fluctuations
increases (decreases) the concentration of haloes and, if pushed far enough,
the density profiles deviate strongly from the NFW form that is a good
approximation for the CMB-normalised case. Although, an Einasto form works
well. Rather than being universal, the slope of the PPSD (or pseudo-entropy)
profile steepens (flattens) with increasing (decreasing) power spectrum
amplitude and can exhibit a strong halo mass dependence. Our results therefore
indicate that the previously identified universality of the structure of dark
matter haloes is mostly a consequence of adopting a narrow range of
(CMB-normalised) initial conditions for the simulations. Our new suite provides
a useful test-bench against which physical models for the origin of halo
structure can be validated.

properties of many-body systems, but also the crucial resource enabling quantum
advantages in practical information processing tasks. While previous works on
entanglement formation and networking focus on discrete-variable systems,
light---as the only travelling carrier of quantum information in a network---is
bosonic and thus requires a continuous-variable description in general. In this
work, we extend the study to continuous-variable quantum networks. By mapping
the ensemble-averaged entanglement dynamics on an arbitrary network to a
random-walk process on a graph, we are able to exactly solve the entanglement
dynamics and reveal unique phenomena. We identify squeezing as the source of
entanglement generation, which triggers a diffusive spread of entanglement with
a parabolic light cone. The entanglement distribution is directly connected to
the probability distribution of the random walk, while the scrambling time is
determined by the mixing time of the random walk. The dynamics of bipartite
entanglement is determined by the boundary of the bipartition; An operational
witness of multipartite entanglement, based on advantages in sensing tasks, is
introduced to characterize the multipartite entanglement growth. A surprising
linear superposition law in the entanglement growth is predicted by the theory
and numerically verified, when the squeezers are sparse in space-time, despite
the nonlinear nature of the entanglement dynamics. We also give exact solution
to the equilibrium entanglement distribution (Page curves), including its
fluctuations, and found various shapes dependent on the average squeezing
density and strength.

to integrate out the massive Kaluza-Klein modes in a way that preserves 6d

sufficient. Since such field-dependent Chern-Simons terms do not arise in the

constrained by unitarity and locality. Off-shell, no gauge symmetries are

factorisation is trivial. Instead a useful classification scheme for scalars is
based on the symmetries they can non-linearly realise. Motivated by the
breaking of Lorentz boosts in cosmology, in this paper we classify the possible
symmetries of a shift-symmetric scalar that is assumed to non-linearly realise
Lorentz boosts as, for example, in the EFT of inflation. Our classification
method is algebraic; guided by the coset construction and inverse Higgs
constraints. We rediscover some known phonon theories within the superfluid and
galileid classes, and discover a new galileid theory which we call the
$\textit{extended galileid}$. Generic galileids correspond to the broken phase
of galileon scalar EFTs and our extended galileids correspond to special
subsets where each galileon coupling is fixed by an additional symmetry. We
discuss the broken phase of theories that also admit a perturbation theory
around Poincar\'{e} invariant vacua and we show that the so-called exceptional
EFTs, the DBI scalar and special galileon, do not admit such a broken phase.
Concentrating on DBI we provide a detailed account of this showing that the
scattering amplitudes are secretly Poincar\'{e} invariant when the theory is
expanded around the superfluid background used in the EFT of inflation. We
point out that DBI is an exception to the common lore that the residue of the
total energy pole of cosmological correlators is proportional to the amplitude.
We also discuss the inevitability of poles in $2 \rightarrow 2$ scattering
amplitudes when boost are spontaneously broken meaning that such theories do
not admit Adler zeros and generalisations even in the presence of a shift
symmetry.

wave functions and recently developed methods to assess the low-energy

under the conservative assumption $\theta_{34}=0$; and $\sin^2(2\theta_{24})$
vs. $\sin^2 (2\theta_{34})$ given sufficiently large $\Delta m^2_{41}$ that
fast oscillation features are unresolvable. Detailed discussions of the event
selection, systematic uncertainties, and fitting procedures are presented. No
strong evidence for sterile neutrinos is found, and the best-fit likelihood is
consistent with the no sterile neutrino hypothesis with a p-value of 8\% in the
first analysis space and 19\% in the second.

scaling the nontraditional Coriolis term (NCT) in the zonal momentum equation.
To demonstrate the scaling, this study simulates large-scale flow forced by a
prescribed heat source mimicking the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)
using a linearized forced-dissipative model. The model solves two similar
equations between which the only difference is inclusion of NCTs. The equations
are derived using the following approximations: anelastic, equatorial
beta-plane, linearized, zonally symmetric, steady, and a constant dissipation
coefficient. The large-scale flows simulated with and without NCTs are compared
in terms of the meridional-vertical circulation, the zonal wind, and the
potential temperature. Both results appear like the Hadley circulation. With
the model parameters controlled, the results without NCTs minus with NCTs are
linear biases due to omitting NCTs. The most prominent bias is a westerly wind
bias in the ITCZ heating region that emerges because omitting NCTs prevents the
associated westward acceleration when heating-induced vertical motion is
present. The zonal wind bias divided by the zonal wind with NCTs is 0.120 $\pm$
0.007 in terms of the westerly maximum and 0.0452 $\pm$ 0.0005 in terms of the
root mean square (RMS) when the prescribed ITCZ mimics the observed ITCZ in May
over the East Pacific. These normalized measures of the zonal wind bias
increase with a narrower ITCZ or an ITCZ closer to the equator because of a
weaker subtropical jet stream given the same vertical heating profile. This
difference can be traced by a nondimensional parameter scaling the ratio of the
NCT to the traditional Coriolis term. The scaling encourages restoring NCTs
into global models.

chiral magnetic textures such as skyrmions and spin spirals. The property of
these magnets is that each subsequent layer can possess a different
Dzyaloshniskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) originating from the local inversion
symmetry breaking. Given that new candidates of such systems are emerging, with
the Van der Waals crystals and magnetic multilayer systems, it is interesting
to investigate how the chiral magnetic textures depend on the number of layers
and the coupling between them. In this article, we model the magnetic layers
with a classical Heisenberg spin model, where the sign of the DMI alternates
for each consecutive layer. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine chiral
magnetic textures and show that the pitch of magnetic spirals is influenced by
the interlayer coupling and the number of layers. We observe even-odd effects
in the number of layers, where we observe a suppression of the spin spirals for
even layer numbers. We give an explanation for our findings by proposing a net
DMI in systems with strongly coupled layers. Our results can be used to
determine the DMI in systems with a known number of layers, and for new
technologies based on the tunability of the spiral wave length.

into how disks form and evolve. We use a high-resolution, cosmological
zoom-simulation of a Milky Way-mass disk galaxy h277 to tie together local disk
kinematics and the evolution of the disk over time. The present-day stellar
age-velocity relationship (AVR) of h277 is nearly identical to that of the
analogous solar-neighborhood measurement in the Milky Way. A crucial element of
this success is the simulation's dynamically cold multi-phase ISM, which allows
young stars to form with a low velocity dispersion
($\sigma_{\mathrm{birth}}$$\sim 6 - 8\ \mathrm{km}\, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$) at late
times. Older stars are born kinematically hotter (i.e., the disk settles over
time in an ""upside-down"" formation scenario), and are subsequently heated after
birth. The disk also grows ""inside-out"", and many of the older stars in the
solar neighborhood at $z=0$ are present because of radial mixing. We
demonstrate that the evolution of $\sigma_{\mathrm{birth}}$ in h277 can be
explained by the same model used to describe the general decrease in velocity
dispersion observed in disk galaxies from $z\sim 2-3$ to the present-day, in
which the disk evolves in quasi-stable equilibrium and the ISM velocity
dispersion decreases over time due to a decreasing gas fraction. Thus, our
results tie together local observations of the Milky Way's AVR with observed
kinematics of high $z$ disk galaxies.

structure with a total size of $\sim$33 kpc, with a sharp kink at the base of
the more extended western jet, and bending of the shorter eastern jet as it
enters the lobe. The 235$-$610 MHz spectral index map shows that both radio
lobes have steep spectral indices ($\alpha_{235}^{610}\geq-1.5$) indicating the
presence of an old electron population. The X-ray images reveal an asymmetric
structure in the hot gas correlated with the radio structure, as well as
potential cavities coincident with the radio lobes, with rims and arms of gas
that may have been uplifted by the cavity expansion. The X-ray residual map
reveals an arc shaped structure to the east that resembles a sloshing cold
front. Radio spectral analysis suggests a radiative age of about 33 Myr for the
source, comparable to the sloshing timescale and dynamical estimates of the age
of the lobes. An estimate of the mechanical energy required to inflate the
cavities suggests that the AGN of NGC 1550 is capable of balancing radiative
losses from the intragroup medium (IGM) and preventing excessive cooling,
providing that the AGN jets are efficiently coupled to the IGM gas. In
conclusion, we find evidence of sloshing motions from both radio and X-ray
structures, suggesting that NGC 1550 was perturbed by a minor merger or
infalling galaxy about 33 Myr ago.

high-pressure structural and vibrational properties of terbium sesquioxide
(Tb2O3). Powder x-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements show that
cubic (C-type) Tb2O3 undergoes two phase transitions up to 25 GPa. We observe a
first irreversible reconstructive transition to the monoclinic (B-type) phase
at ~7 GPa and a subsequent reversible displacive transition from the monoclinic
to the trigonal (A-type) phase at ~12 GPa. Thus, Tb2O3 is found to follow the
well-known C-B-A phase transition found in other cubic rare-earth sesquioxides
with cations of larger atomic mass than Tb. Our ab initio theoretical
calculations predict phase transition pressures and bulk moduli for the three
phases in rather good agreement with experimental results. Moreover,
Raman-active modes of the three phases have been monitored as a function of
pressure and lattice-dynamics calculations have allowed us to confirm the
assignment of the experimental phonon modes in the C-type phase as well as to
make a tentative assignment of the symmetry of most vibrational modes in the B-
and A-type phases. Finally, we extract the bulk moduli and the Raman-active
modes frequencies together with their pressure coefficients for the three
phases of Tb2O3. These results are thoroughly compared and discussed in
relation to those reported for rare-earth and other related sesquioxides. It is
concluded that the evolution of the volume and bulk modulus of all the three
phases of these technologically relevant compounds exhibit a nearly linear
trend with respect to the third power of the ionic radii of the cations.

proton-lead ($p{\rm Pb}$) collisions. Such a process is very intriguing in the
sense of tailoring to explore the double parton structure of nucleons and to
determine the geometry of partons in nuclei. In order to interpret the existing
$pp$ data with the LHCb detector at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV,
we introduce two overlooked mechanisms for the double parton scattering (DPS)
and single parton scattering (SPS) processes. Besides the conventional DPS
mode, where the two mesons are produced almost independently in the two
separate scattering subprocesses, we propose a novel DPS mechanism that the two
constituent (heavy) quarks stemming from two hard scatterings can form into a
composite particle, like the $J/\psi$ meson, during the hadronization phase.
However, it turns out the corresponding contribution is small in
$J/\psi+c\bar{c}$ hadroproduction. On the contrary, we point out that the
resummation of the initial state logarithms due to gluon splitting into a charm
quark pair is crucial to understand the LHCb measurement, which was overlooked
in the literature. We perform a proper matching between the perturbative
calculations in different initial-quark flavor number schemes, generically
referring to the variable flavor number scheme. The new variable flavor number
scheme calculation for the process strongly enhance the SPS cross sections,
almost closing the discrepancies between theory and experiment. Finally, we
present our predictions for the forthcoming LHCb measurement in $p{\rm Pb}$
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=8.16$ TeV. Some interesting observables are
exploited to set up the control regions of the DPS signal and to probe the
impact-parameter dependent parton densities in lead.

intervention is an abstraction: an agent embedded in a physical environment
(perhaps modeled as a Markov decision process) does not typically come equipped
with the notion of an intervention -- its action space is typically
ego-centric, without actions of the form `intervene on X'. Such a
correspondence between ego-centric actions and interventions would be
challenging to hard-code. It would instead be better if an agent learnt which
sequence of actions allow it to make targeted manipulations of the environment,
and learnt corresponding representations that permitted learning from
observation. Here we show how a meta-learning approach can be used to perform
causal learning in this challenging setting, where the action-space is not a
set of interventions and the observation space is a high-dimensional space with
a latent causal structure. A meta-reinforcement learning algorithm is used to
learn relationships that transfer on observational causal learning tasks. This
work shows how advances in deep reinforcement learning and meta-learning can
provide intervention-centric causal learning in high-dimensional environments
with a latent causal structure.

to compare the motions (induced by a spin-polarized current) of these objects

factors which are able to give breath to the competitors, impelling them to
remain in the race for longer distances before their annihilation at the

results to more general situations. First, we obtain general expressions of

Bayesian nonparametric approach to regression and classification. In spite of
their success, GPs have limited use in some applications, for example, in some
cases a symmetric distribution with respect to its mean is an unreasonable

the mean and median in an asymmetric (skewed) distribution can be different
numbers. In this paper, we propose Skew-Gaussian processes (SkewGPs) as a
non-parametric prior over functions. A SkewGP extends the multivariate Unified
Skew-Normal distribution over finite dimensional vectors to a stochastic
processes. The SkewGP class of distributions includes GPs and, therefore,
SkewGPs inherit all good properties of GPs and increase their flexibility by
allowing asymmetry in the probabilistic model. By exploiting the fact that
SkewGP and probit likelihood are conjugate model, we derive closed form
expressions for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of this new
nonparametric classifier. We verify empirically that the proposed SkewGP

efficacy and safety in chronic mental illness. In many such studies, treatment
changes may be initiated by either the patient or by their clinician and can
thus vary widely across patients in their timing, number, and type. Indeed, in
the observational longitudinal pathway of the STEP-BD study of bipolar
depression, one of the motivations for this work, no two patients have the same
treatment history even after coarsening clinic visits to a weekly time-scale.
Estimation of an optimal treatment regime using such data is challenging as one
cannot naively pool together patients with the same treatment history, as is
required by methods based on inverse probability weighting, nor is it possible
to apply backwards induction over the decision points, as is done in Q-learning
and its variants. Thus, additional structure is needed to effectively pool
information across patients and within a patient over time. Current scientific
theory for many chronic mental illnesses maintains that a patient's disease
status can be conceptualized as transitioning among a small number of discrete
states. We use this theory to inform the construction of a partially observable
Markov decision process model of patient health trajectories wherein observed
health outcomes are dictated by a patient's latent health state. Using this
model, we derive and evaluate estimators of an optimal treatment regime under
two common paradigms for quantifying long-term patient health. The finite
sample performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated through a series
of simulation experiments and application to the observational pathway of the
STEP-BD study. We find that the proposed method provides high-quality estimates
of an optimal treatment strategy in settings where existing approaches cannot
be applied without ad hoc modifications.

set of simulations of tidally-locked terrestrial planets orbiting three
different host stars to isolate the effect of the stellar spectra on the
simulated climate. Specifically, we perform simulations based on TRAPPIST-1e,
adopting an Earth-like atmosphere and using the UK Met Office Unified Model in
an idealised 'aqua-planet' configuration. Whilst holding the planetary
parameters constant, including the total stellar flux (900 W/m$^2$) and orbital
period (6.10 Earth days), we compare results between simulations where the
stellar spectrum is that of a quiescent TRAPPIST-1, Proxima Centauri and the
Sun. The simulations with cooler host stars had an increased proportion of
incident stellar radiation absorbed directly by the troposphere compared to the
surface. This, in turn, led to an increase in the stability against convection,
a reduction in overall cloud coverage on the dayside (reducing scattering),
leading to warmer surface temperatures. The increased direct heating of the
troposphere also led to more efficient heat transport from the dayside to the
nightside and, therefore, a reduced day-night temperature contrast. We inferred
that planets with an Earth-like atmosphere orbiting cooler stars had lower
dayside cloud coverage, potentially allowing habitable conditions at increased
orbital radii, compared to similar planets orbiting hotter stars for a given
planetary rotation rate.

work by Fruchart et al. [Nature, 577, 2020], who specialized the notion of
duality to the mechanistic problem of kagome lattices and linked it to the
existence of duality transformations between configurations that are
symmetrically located across a critical transition point in configuration

spectra between dual configurations manifest in terms of observable wavefield
characteristics. To this end, we explore the possibility to aggregate dual
kagome configurations into bi-domain lattices that are geometrically
heterogeneous but retain a mechanically homogeneous response. Our second
objective is to extend the analysis to structural lattices of beams, which are
representative of realistic cellular metamaterials. We show that, in this case,
the symmetry of the phonon landscape across the duality boundary is broken,
implying that the conditions for dual behavior do not merely depend on the
geometry, but also on the dominant mechanisms of the cell, suggesting a
dichotomy between geometric and functional duality.

applications on the internet. We begin by giving a unified framework, called
general search, of which which all search and social media products can be seen
as instances.
  DimensionRank is our main contribution. This is an algorithm for personalized
general search, based on neural networks. DimensionRank's bold innovation is to
model and represent each user using their own unique personal neural
representation vector, a learned representation in a real-valued
multidimensional vector space. This is the first internet service we are aware
of that to model each user with their own independent representation vector.
This is also the first service we are aware of to attempt personalization for
general web search. Also, neural representations allows us to present the first
Reddit-style algorithm, that is immune to the problem of ""brigading"". We
believe personalized general search will yield a search product orders of
magnitude better than Google's one-size-fits-all web search algorithm.
  Finally, we announce Deep Revelations, a new search and social network
internet application based on DimensionRank.

written as a model of $2d$ interacting Majorana fermions, has a spectral flow
that is reminiscent of the Maldacena-Qi (MQ) model, and its spectrum at
$\phi=0$, actually coincides with the coupling term of the MQ model. As was
already shown by Parisi, at leading order in $1/d$ , the spectral density of
this model is given by the density function of the Q-Hermite polynomials, which
is also the spectral density of the double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model.
Parisi demonstrated this by mapping the moments of the HC model to $Q$-weighted
sums on chord diagrams. We point out that the subleading moments of the HC
model can also be mapped to weighted sums on chord diagrams, in a manner that
descends from the leading moments. The HC model has a magnetic inversion
symmetry that depends on both the magnitude and the orientation of the magnetic
flux through the faces of the hypercube. The spectrum for fixed quantum number
of this symmetry exhibits a transition from regular spectra at $\phi=0$ to
chaotic spectra with spectral statistics given by the Gaussian Unitary
Ensembles (GUE) for larger values of $\phi$. For small magnetic flux, the
ground state is gapped and is close to a Thermofield Double (TFD) state.

of an elastically mounted sphere in the vicinity of a free surface at
subcritical Reynolds numbers. To begin, We verify and analyze the mode
transitions and the motion trajectories of a fully submerged sphere vibrating
freely in all directions for the Reynolds number up to $30\,000$. Next, the
response dynamics of a transversely vibrating sphere is studied for three
values of normalized immersion ratio ($h^*=h/D$, where $h$ is the distance from
the top of the sphere to undisturbed free-surface level and $D$ is the sphere
diameter), at $h^*=1$ (fully submerged sphere with no free-surface effect),
$h^*=0$ (where the top of the sphere touches the free surface) and $h^*=-0.25$
(where the sphere pierces the free surface). At the lock-in range, we observe
that the amplitude response at $h^*=0$ is decreased significantly compared to
the case at $h^*=1$. It is found that the vorticity flux is diffused due to the
free-surface boundary and the free surface acts as a sink of energy that leads
to a reduction in the transverse force and amplitude response. When the sphere
pierces the free surface at $h^*=-0.25$, the amplitude response at the lock-in
state is found to be greater than all the submerged cases studied with the
maximum peak-to-peak amplitude of $\sim2D$. We find that the interaction of the
piercing sphere with the air-water interface causes a relatively large surface
deformation and has a significant impact on the synchronization of the vortex
shedding and the vibration frequency. Increased streamwise vorticity gives rise
to a relatively larger transverse force to the piercing sphere at $h^*=-0.25$,
resulting in greater positive energy transfer per cycle to sustain the
large-amplitude vibration. Lasty, we study the sensitivity of FIV response on
the mass ratio, $m^*$, and Froude number, $Fr$, at the lock-in state.

varying vehicle densities. The collision risk of a certain vehicle is computed

of Sturmian sequences like low factor complexity and good local discrepancy
properties. Inspired by Rauzy's approach we construct such codings in terms of
multidimensional continued fraction algorithms that are realized by sequences
of substitutions. In particular, given any exponentially convergent continued
fraction algorithm, these sequences lead to renormalization schemes which
produce symbolic codings of toral translations and bounded remainder sets at
all scales in a natural way.
  The exponential convergence properties of a continued fraction algorithm can
be viewed in terms of a Pisot type condition imposed on an attached symbolic
dynamical system. Using this fact, our approach provides a systematic way to
confirm purely discrete spectrum results for wide classes of symbolic dynamical
systems. Indeed, as our examples illustrate, we are able to confirm the Pisot
conjecture for many well-known families of sequences of substitutions. These
examples comprise classical algorithms like the Jacobi--Perron, Brun,
Cassaigne--Selmer, and Arnoux--Rauzy algorithms.
  As a consequence, we gain symbolic codings of almost all translations of the
$2$-dimensional torus having factor complexity $2n+1$ that are balanced for
words, which leads to multiscale bounded remainder sets. Using the Brun
algorithm, we also give symbolic codings of almost all $3$-dimensional toral

features. Most training images are only labeled by (rough) partial masks, which
do not contain exact object boundaries, rather than by their full segmentation
masks. During the training phase, the approximation task learns the statistics
of these partial masks, and the partial regions are recursively increased
towards object boundaries aided by the learned information from the
segmentation task in a fully data-driven fashion. The network is trained on an
extremely small amount of precisely segmented images and a large set of coarse
labels. Annotations can thus be obtained in a cheap way. We demonstrate the
efficiency of our approach in three applications with microscopy images and
ultrasound images.

memory effect in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K and a freezing
temperature T_s ~ 68 K. Moreover, the analysis of uSR spectra indicates two
magnetic processes characterized by remarkably different relaxation rates: a
slowly-relaxing signal, resulting from paramagnetic fluctuations of Pr/Ni ions,
and a fast-relaxing signal, whose relaxation rate increases substantially below
~ 70 K which can be ascribed to the presence of short-range correlated regions.
We conclude that the complex spin-freezing process in Pr4Ni3O8 is governed by
these multiple magnetic interactions. It is possible that the complex magnetism

then investigate the geometrical properties and physical meaning of the ratios

energy consumption is managed to promote fidelity remains incomplete. In our
work, we introduce an alternative conceptual scheme called 'the piston model of
proofreading' where enzyme activation through hydrolysis is replaced with
allosteric activation achieved through mechanical work performed by a piston on
regulatory ligands. Inspired by Feynman's ratchet and pawl mechanism, we
consider a mechanical engine designed to drive the piston actions powered by a
lowering weight, whose function is analogous to that of ATP synthase in cells.
Thanks to its mechanical design, the piston model allows us to tune the 'knobs'
of the driving engine and probe the graded changes and trade-offs between
speed, fidelity and energy dissipation. It provides an intuitive explanation of
the conditions necessary for optimal proofreading and reveals the unexpected
capability of allosteric molecules to beat the Hopfield limit of fidelity by
leveraging the diversity of states available to them. The framework that we
built for the piston model can also serve as a basis for additional studies of
driven biochemical systems.

less pronounced. These results are applicable in hardware co-design and in
choosing efficient qudit encodings for a given set of near-term quantum

present work, BINNs are trained in a supervised learning framework to
approximate in vitro cell biology assay experiments while respecting a
generalized form of the governing reaction-diffusion partial differential
equation (PDE). By allowing the diffusion and reaction terms to be multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs), the nonlinear forms of these terms can be learned while
simultaneously converging to the solution of the governing PDE. Further, the
trained MLPs are used to guide the selection of biologically interpretable
mechanistic forms of the PDE terms which provides new insights into the
biological and physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the observed
system. The method is evaluated on sparse real-world data from wound healing
assays with varying initial cell densities [2].

typically by less than 10 degrees. The smooth, systematic polarization
structure in the outflow lobes suggests a well ordered magnetic field on scales

People spend a significant amount of time every day on emails to exchange
information, manage tasks and schedule events. Previous work has studied
different ways for improving email productivity by prioritizing emails,
suggesting automatic replies or identifying intents to recommend appropriate
actions. The problem has been mostly posed as a supervised learning problem
where models of different complexities were proposed to classify an email
message into a predefined taxonomy of intents or classes. The need for labeled
data has always been one of the largest bottlenecks in training supervised
models. This is especially the case for many real-world tasks, such as email
intent classification, where large scale annotated examples are either hard to
acquire or unavailable due to privacy or data access constraints. Email users
often take actions in response to intents expressed in an email (e.g., setting
up a meeting in response to an email with a scheduling request). Such actions
can be inferred from user interaction logs. In this paper, we propose to
leverage user actions as a source of weak supervision, in addition to a limited
set of annotated examples, to detect intents in emails. We develop an
end-to-end robust deep neural network model for email intent identification
that leverages both clean annotated data and noisy weak supervision along with
a self-paced learning mechanism. Extensive experiments on three different

We identified vulnerabilities in individual components of the TE model and then
made use of these to generate combinatorial attacks to damage the safety of the
system, and to cause economic loss. Results were compared against random
attacks, and the performance of the EMO algorithms were evaluated using
hypervolume, spread and inverted generational distance (IGD) metrics. A defence
against these attacks in the form of a novel intrusion detection system was
developed, using a number of machine learning algorithms. Designed approach was
further tested against the developed detection methods. Results demonstrate
that EMO algorithms are a promising tool in the identification of the most
vulnerable components of ICS, and weaknesses of any existing detection systems
in place to protect the system. The proposed approach can be used by control
and security engineers to design security aware control, and test the
effectiveness of security mechanisms, both during design, and later during

whose tails behave like ${\|x\|^\alpha}$ for ${\alpha \in [1,2]}$, and has
$\beta$-H\""older continuous gradient, we prove that ${\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}

are sufficient to reach the $\epsilon $-neighborhood of a $d$-dimensional
target distribution $\nu_*$ in KL-divergence. This convergence rate, in terms
of $\epsilon$ dependency, is not directly influenced by the tail growth rate
$\alpha$ of the potential function as long as its growth is at least linear,
and it only relies on the order of smoothness $\beta$. One notable consequence
of this result is that for potentials with Lipschitz gradient, i.e. $\beta=1$,
our rate recovers the best known rate
${\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\epsilon^{-1})}$ which was established for strongly
convex potentials in terms of $\epsilon$ dependency, but we show that the same
rate is achievable for a wider class of potentials that are degenerately convex
at infinity. The growth rate $\alpha$ starts to have an effect on the
established rate in high dimensions where $d$ is large; furthermore, it
recovers the best-known dimension dependency when the tail growth of the
potential is quadratic, i.e. ${\alpha = 2}$, in the current setup. Our
framework allows for finite perturbations, and any order of smoothness
${\beta\in(0,1]}$; consequently, our results are applicable to a wide class of
non-convex potentials that are weakly smooth and exhibit at least linear tail

To avoid the degradation of device performance and reliability induced by the

reports a scalable thermal management strategy to heterogeneously integrate
wafer-scale monocrystalline \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thin films on high thermal
conductivity SiC substrates by ion-cutting technique. The thermal boundary
conductance (TBC) of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3-SiC interfaces and thermal conductivity
of the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thin films were measured by Time-domain Thermoreflectance
(TDTR) to evaluate the effects of interlayer thickness and thermal annealing.
Materials characterizations were performed to understand the mechanisms of
thermal transport in these structures. The results show that the
\b{eta}-Ga2O3-SiC TBC values increase with decreasing interlayer thickness and
the \b{eta}-Ga2O3 thermal conductivity increases more than twice after
annealing at 800 oC due to the removal of implantation-induced strain in the

conductivity. Small spot-to-spot variations of both TBC and Ga2O3 thermal

for influenza epidemics in an interactive human society in the presence of
modeling uncertainties. Interactive society is influenced by the random
entrance of individuals from other human societies whose effects can be modeled
as a non-Gaussian noise. Since only the number of exposed and infected humans
can be measured, states of the influenza epidemics are first estimated by an
extended maximum correntropy Kalman filter (EMCKF) to provide a robust state
estimation in the presence of the non-Gaussian noise. An online quadratic
program (QP) optimization is then synthesized subject to a robust control
Lyapunov function (RCLF) to minimize susceptible and infected humans, while
minimizing and bounding the rates of vaccination and antiviral treatment. The
joint QP-RCLF-EMCKF meets multiple design specifications such as state
estimation, tracking, pointwise control optimality, and robustness to parameter
uncertainty and state estimation errors that have not been achieved
simultaneously in previous studies. The uniform ultimate boundedness
(UUB)/convergence of error trajectories is guaranteed using a Lyapunov
stability argument. The soundness of the proposed approach is validated on the
influenza epidemics of an interactive human society with a population of 16000.
Simulation results show that the QP-RCLF-EMCKF achieves appropriate tracking
and state estimation performance. The robustness of the proposed controller is
finally illustrated in the presence of modeling error and non-Gaussian noise.

that this local normal feature in conjunction with classical features not only
improves performance for binary road segmentation on full resolution point

Meanwhile, the quantum walk with the Grover coin tends to be localized around
the initial node, not over a community. The probability of the classical random
walk on the same network converges to the uniform distribution with a
relaxation time generally a priori. We thus claim that the time average of the
probability of the Fourier-coin quantum walk on complex networks reveals the

has been recognized for decades, the mechanism through which this happens has
never been explained. Here, we show that the volumes of kidneys, pancreas, and
liver are strongly correlated (median correlation = 0.625; P-value<10-47) with
the body mass index (BMI) of an individual. We also find a significant
relationship between the increase in organ volume and the increase in cancer
risk (P-value<10-12). These results provide a mechanism explaining why obese
individuals have higher cancer risk in several organs: the larger the organ
volume the more cells at risk of becoming cancerous. These findings are
important for a better understanding of the effects obesity has on cancer risk
and, more generally, for the development of better preventive strategies to
limit the mortality caused by obesity.

dramatically impact human life. To accurately forecast these events and
characterize their climatology requires specialized mathematical techniques to
fully leverage the limited data that are available. Here we describe
\emph{transition path theory} (TPT), a framework originally developed for
molecular simulation, and argue that it is a useful paradigm for developing
mechanistic understanding of rare climate events. TPT provides a method to
calculate statistical properties of the paths into the event. As an initial
demonstration of the utility of TPT, we analyze a low-order model of sudden
stratospheric warming (SSW), a dramatic disturbance to the polar vortex which
can induce extreme cold spells at the surface in the midlatitudes. SSW events
pose a major challenge for seasonal weather prediction because of their rapid,
complex onset and development. Climate models struggle to capture the long-term
statistics of SSW, owing to their diversity and intermittent nature. We use a
stochastically forced Holton-Mass-type model with two stable states,
corresponding to radiative equilibrium and a vacillating SSW-like regime. In
this stochastic bistable setting, from certain probabilistic forecasts TPT
facilitates estimation of dominant transition pathways and return times of
transitions. These ""dynamical statistics"" are obtained by solving partial
differential equations in the model's phase space. With future application to
more complex models, TPT and its constituent quantities promise to improve the
predictability of extreme weather events, through both generation and
principled evaluation of forecasts.

results and speed up inference. However, no previous works are explicitly

named Object-QA to assess high-reliable quality scores for object images.
Concretely, Object-QA first employs a well-designed relative quality assessing
module that learns the intra-class-level quality scores by referring to the
difference between object images and their estimated templates. Then an
absolute quality assessing module is designed to generate the final quality
scores by aligning the quality score distributions in inter-class. Besides,
Object-QA can be implemented with only object-level annotations, and is also
easily deployed to a variety of object recognition tasks. To our best knowledge
this is the first work to put forward the definition of this problem and
conduct quantitative evaluations. Validations on 5 different datasets show that
Object-QA can not only assess high-reliable quality scores according with human

Performance analysis shows that FEC coding improves the communications aware

application is radio frequency spectrum sensing. While evasion attacks have
proven particularly successful in this area, they have done so at the detriment
of the signal's intended purpose. More specifically, for real-world
applications of interest, the resulting perturbed signal that is transmitted to
evade an eavesdropper must not deviate far from the original signal, less the
intended information is destroyed. Recent work by the authors and others has
demonstrated an attack framework that allows for intelligent balancing between
these conflicting goals of evasion and communication. However, while these
methodologies consider creating adversarial signals that minimize
communications degradation, they have been shown to do so at the expense of the
spectral shape of the signal. This opens the adversarial signal up to defenses
at the eavesdropper such as filtering, which could render the attack
ineffective. To remedy this, this work introduces a new spectral deception loss
metric that can be implemented during the training process to force the
spectral shape to be more in-line with the original signal. As an initial proof
of concept, a variety of methods are presented that provide a starting point
for this proposed loss. Through performance analysis, it is shown that these

completed by human visually. But this process is very time-consuming and
error-prone. Few studies in literature developed automated pig counting method.
Existing methods only focused on pig counting using single image, and its
accuracy is challenged by several factors, including pig movements, occlusion
and overlapping. Especially, the field of view of a single image is very
limited, and could not meet the requirements of pig counting for large pig
grouping houses. To that end, we presented a real-time automated pig counting
system in crowds using only one monocular fisheye camera with an inspection
robot. Our system showed that it produces accurate results surpassing human.
Our pipeline began with a novel bottom-up pig detection algorithm to avoid
false negatives due to overlapping, occlusion and deformation of pigs. A deep
convolution neural network (CNN) is designed to detect keypoints of pig body
part and associate the keypoints to identify individual pigs. After that, an
efficient on-line tracking method is used to associate pigs across video
frames. Finally, a novel spatial-aware temporal response filtering (STRF)
method is proposed to predict the counts of pigs, which is effective to
suppress false positives caused by pig or camera movements or tracking
failures. The whole pipeline has been deployed in an edge computing device, and
demonstrated the effectiveness.

Using first-principles techniques, we developed a three-orbital tight-binding

Including Hubbard and Hund couplings and studying the model via the density
matrix renormalization group and Lanczos methods, we constructed the ground

because of the complex interactions among the agents and their interactions
with the surrounding scenes. In this paper, we present a novel method for the
robust trajectory forecasting of multiple intelligent agents in dynamic scenes.
The proposed method consists of three major interrelated components: an
interaction net for global spatiotemporal interactive feature extraction, an
environment net for decoding dynamic scenes (i.e., the surrounding road
topology of an agent), and a prediction net that combines the spatiotemporal
feature, the scene feature, the past trajectories of agents and some random
noise for the robust trajectory prediction of agents. Experiments on
pedestrian-walking and vehicle-pedestrian heterogeneous datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art prediction methods in

to design precoding vectors to maximize the ergodic rate (e.g., sum rate,
minimum rate and etc.) subject to a total transmit power constraint. To
maximize an upper bound of the ergodic rate, we leverage the corresponding
Lagrangian formulation and identify the structural characteristics of the
optimal precoder as the solution to a generalized eigenvalue problem. As such,
the high-dimensional precoder design problem turns into a low-dimensional power
control problem. The Lagrange multipliers play a crucial role in determining
both precoder directions and power parameters, yet are challenging to be solved
directly. To figure out the Lagrange multipliers, we develop a general
framework underpinned by a properly designed neural network that learns
directly from CSI. To further relieve the computational burden, we obtain a
low-complexity framework by decomposing the original problem into
computationally efficient subproblems with instantaneous and statistical CSI
handled separately. With the off-line pretrained neural network, the online
computational complexity of precoding is substantially reduced compared with
the existing iterative algorithm while maintaining nearly the same performance.

Various point neural networks have been developed with isotropic filters or

convolutional operation (PAI-Conv) that calculates soft-permutation matrices

distributed kernel points on a sphere's surface and performs shared anisotropic
filters. In fact, dot product with kernel points is by analogy with the
dot-product with keys in Transformer as widely used in natural language

transformer for point clouds, which is physically meaningful and is robust to
cooperate with the efficient random point sampling method. Comprehensive

dimension reduction is performed at each receiver by matched filtering the
received signal with a subset of the local user channel vectors. By choosing
these matched filter vectors based on global channel information, a high
proportion of the potential capacity may be captured by a small number of
signal components, which can then be compressed efficiently using local signal
compression. We outline a greedy algorithm for selecting the matched filtering
vectors for each receiver, and a local transform coding approach for quantising
them, giving expressions for the resulting system sum and user capacities. We
then show that the scheme is easily modified to account for imperfect CSI at
the receivers. Numerical results show that with a low signal dimension the
scheme is able to operate very close to the cut-set bound in the
fronthaul-limited regime, and demonstrates significant improvements in
rate-capacity trade-off versus local compression at all operating points,

strengthen the 'incubation system'. This involves incorporating targeted SDGs

pairs of neighbors interact independently at rate one if and only if the
distance between their opinions does not exceed a certain confidence threshold,
with each interaction resulting in the neighbors' opinions getting closer to
each other. All the mathematical results collected so far about this model
assume that the individuals are located on the integers. In contrast, we study
the more realistic case where the social network can be any finite connected

vision have been shown to learn representations that perform remarkably well on
transfer tasks. We show that this family of algorithms maximizes a lower bound
on the mutual information between two or more ""views"" of an image where typical
views come from a composition of image augmentations. Our bound generalizes the
InfoNCE objective to support negative sampling from a restricted region of
""difficult"" contrasts. We find that the choice of negative samples and views
are critical to the success of these algorithms. Reformulating previous
learning objectives in terms of mutual information also simplifies and
stabilizes them. In practice, our new objectives yield representations that
outperform those learned with previous approaches for transfer to
classification, bounding box detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint
detection. % experiments show that choosing more difficult negative samples
results in a stronger representation, outperforming those learned with IR, LA,
and CMC in classification, bounding box detection, instance segmentation, and
keypoint detection. The mutual information framework provides a unifying
comparison of approaches to contrastive learning and uncovers the choices that
impact representation learning.

encasing an axon, is a geometrical invariant that has high functional relevance
because of its importance in determining neuronal conduction velocity. Advances
in MRI data acquisition and signal modelling have put in vivo mapping of the
g-ratio, across the entire white matter, within our reach. This capacity would
greatly increase our knowledge of the nervous system: how it functions, and how
it is impacted by disease. This is the second review on the topic of g-ratio
mapping using MRI. As such, it summarizes the most recent developments in the
field, while also providing methodological background pertinent to aggregate
g-ratio weighted mapping, and discussing pitfalls associated with these
approaches. Using simulations based on recently published data, this review
demonstrates the relevance of the calibration step for three myelin-markers
(macromolecular tissue volume, myelin water fraction, and bound pool fraction).
It highlights the need to estimate both the slope and offset of the
relationship between these MRI-based markers and the true myelin volume
fraction if we are really to achieve the goal of precise, high sensitivity
g-ratio mapping in vivo. Other challenges discussed in this review further
evidence the need for gold standard measurements of human brain tissue from ex
vivo histology. We conclude that the quest to find the most appropriate MRI
biomarkers to enable in vivo g-ratio mapping is ongoing, with the potential of
many novel techniques yet to be investigated.

a broad range of representative polymers into four proposed categories based on
the quantitative analysis of molecular order based on the paracrystalline

(2020) perform a detailed analysis of the ultraviolet and optical emission of

first study of its kind. Combining KCWI observations and public SDSS data, we
estimate the expected cosmic dispersion measure $DM_{cosmic}$ along the

in intervening virialized halos ($DM_{halos} \approx 7-28$ $pc/cm^3$). Then,
using the Monte Carlo Physarum Machine (MCPM) methodology, we produce a 3D map
of ionized gas in cosmic web filaments and compute the DM contribution from
matter outside halos ($DM_{IGM} \approx 91-126$ $pc/cm^3$). This implies a
greater fraction of ionized gas along this sightline is extant outside
virialized halos. We also investigate whether the intervening halos can account
for the large FRB rotation measure and pulse width and conclude that it is
implausible. Both the pulse broadening and the large Faraday rotation likely
arise from the progenitor environment or the host galaxy.

calculate the maximum time since star-formation for a progenitor using the

partially because of the typical difficulty in localising FRBs to host
galaxies. Accurate localisations delivered by the Commensal Real-time ASKAP
Fast Transients (CRAFT) survey now provide an opportunity to study the host

After subtracting these images no optical counterparts were identified in the
associated FRB host galaxies, so we instead place limits on the brightness of
any potential optical transients. A Monte Carlo approach, in which supernova
light curves were modelled and their base properties randomised, was used to
estimate the probability of a supernova associated with each FRB going

star-formation rate. The FRBs localized by ASKAP typically lie in the outskirts
of their host galaxies, which appears to rule out FRB progenitor models that
invoke active galactic nuclei (AGN) or free-floating cosmic strings. The
stellar population seen in these host galaxies also disfavors models in which
all FRBs arise from young magnetars produced by superluminous supernovae

highly diffuse state that is difficult to observe, with only a small fraction
directly observed in galaxies and galaxy clusters. Censuses of the nearby
Universe have used absorption line spectroscopy to observe these invisible
baryons, but these measurements rely on large and uncertain corrections and are
insensitive to the majority of the volume, and likely mass. Specifically,
quasar spectroscopy is sensitive either to only the very trace amounts of
Hydrogen that exists in the atomic state, or highly ionized and enriched gas in
denser regions near galaxies. Sunyaev-Zel'dovich analyses provide evidence of
some of the gas in filamentary structures and studies of X-ray emission are
most sensitive to gas near galaxy clusters. Here we report the direct
measurement of the baryon content of the Universe using the dispersion of a
sample of localized fast radio bursts (FRBs), thus utilizing an effect that
measures the electron column density along each sight line and accounts for
every ionised baryon. We augment the sample of published arcsecond-localized
FRBs with a further four new localizations to host galaxies which have measured
redshifts of 0.291, 0.118, 0.378 and 0.522, completing a sample sufficiently

the results published for the previously studied ASKAP FRB~181112. We find that
every FRB is highly polarised, with polarisation fractions ranging from 80 --
100\%, and that they are generally dominated by linear polarisation. While some
FRBs in our sample exhibit properties associated with an emerging archetype
(i.e., repeating or apparently non-repeating), others exhibit characteristic
features of both, implying the existence of a continuum of FRB properties. When
examined at high time resolution, we find that all FRBs in our sample have
evidence for multiple sub-components and for scattering at a level greater than
expected from the Milky Way. We find no correlation between the diverse range
of FRB properties (e.g., scattering time, intrinsic width, and rotation
measure) and any global property of their host galaxy. The most heavily
scattered bursts reside in the outskirts of their host galaxies, suggesting
that the source-local environment rather than the host interstellar medium is

to its many potential benefits for both companies and employees (e.g.,
increasing job satisfaction and retention of employees). Many previous studies
have investigated the impact of working from home on the productivity of
employees. However, most of these studies usually use a qualitative analysis
method such as survey and interview, and the studied participants do not work
from home for a long continuing time. Due to the outbreak of coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), a large number of companies asked their employees to
work from home, which provides us an opportunity to investigate whether working
from home affects their productivity.
  In this study, to investigate the difference of developer productivity
between working from home and working onsite, we conduct a quantitative
analysis based on a dataset of developers' daily activities from Baidu Inc, one
of the largest IT companies in China. In total, we collected approximately four
thousand records of 139 developers' activities of 138 working days. Out of
these records, 1,103 records are submitted when developers work from home due
to COVID-19 pandemic. We find that WFH has both positive and negative impacts
on developer productivity in terms of different metrics, e.g., the number of
builds/commits/code reviews. We also notice that working from home has
different impacts on projects with different characteristics including
programming language, project type/age/size. For example, working from home has
a negative impact on developer productivity for large projects. Additionally,
we find that productivity varies for different developers. Based on these
findings, we get some feedbacks from developers of Baidu and understand some
reasons why WFH has different impacts on developer productivity.

predict AKI by means of Convolutional Neural Network on Electronic Health
Record (EHR) data. The data sets used in this research are two public
Electronic Health Record (EHR) databases: MIMIC-III and eICU database. In this
study, we take several Convolutional Neural Network models to train and test
our AKI predictor, which can precisely predict whether a certain patient will
suffer from AKI after admission in ICU according to the last measurements of
the 16 blood gas and demographic features. The research is based on Kidney
Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria for AKI definition. Our work
greatly improves the AKI prediction precision, and the best AUROC is up to
0.988 on MIMIC-III data set and 0.936 on eICU data set, both of which
outperform the state-of-art predictors. And the dimension of the input vector
used in this predictor is much fewer than that used in other existing
researches. Compared with the existing AKI predictors, the predictor in this
work greatly improves the precision of early prediction of AKI by using the
Convolutional Neural Network architecture and a more concise input vector.
Early and precise prediction of AKI will bring much benefit to the decision of
treatment, so it is believed that our work is a very helpful clinical
application.

boundary and compare that distance to the inradius of the relevant domain.
  For the torsional rigidity function, the obtained bound only depends on the
space dimension. The more general case of a boundary which is not mean convex
is also considered. However, the estimates also depend on some geometrical
quantities such as the diameter and the radius of the largest exterior
osculating ball to the relevant domain, or the minimum of the mean curvature of
the boundary.
  Also in the case of the first mode, the relevant bound only depends on the
space dimension. Moreover, it largely improves on an earlier estimate obtained
by the first author and co-authors, for convex domains. The bound related to
the temperature depends on time and the initial distribution of temperature.
Such a bound is substantially consistent with what one obtains in the
stationary situation.

and generalizable two-stage framework that enables improved pixel-wise image
segmentation given misaligned and missing annotations. First, we introduce the

crowded venues is proposed. MmWave communications suffer from severe blockage
caused by obstacles such as the human body, especially in a dense region. Thus,
a detailed method for modeling the blockage events in the in-venue scenarios is
introduced. Also, several mmWave access points are considered in different
locations. To maximize the network sum rate, the resource allocation problem is
formulated as a mixed integer non-linear programming, which is NP-hard in
general. Hence, a three-stage low-complex solution is proposed to solve the
problem. At first, a user scheduling algorithm, i.e., modified worst connection
swapping (MWCS), is proposed. Secondly, the antenna allocation problem is
solved using the simulated annealing algorithm. Afterward, to maximize the
network sum rate and guarantee the quality of service constraints, a non-convex
power allocation optimization problem is solved by adopting the difference of
convex programming approach. The simulation results show that, under the
blockage effect, the proposed mmWave-NOMA scheme performs on average 23% better
than the conventional mmWave-orthogonal multiple access scheme. Moreover, the
performance of proposed solution is 11.4% lower than the optimal value while
reducing complexity by 96%.

learning effective task-specific representations of nodes in graphs. However,
regarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN
methods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore
all possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object,
which hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to
generate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high
computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an
interpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN)
to learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a
hierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first,
followed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically
extract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within
a length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce
the computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and
neighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed
ie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its
connection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time
complexity. Extensive experiments on three real network datasets demonstrate
the superiority of ie-HGCN over the state-of-the-art methods.

we determine that the atmospheric ion escape rates are potentially a few orders
of magnitude higher than the inner Solar system planets, but TOI-700 d is
nevertheless capable of retaining a $1$ bar atmosphere over gigayear timescales
for certain regions of the parameter space. The simulations show that the
unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1 bar Earth-like atmosphere could be stripped
away rather quickly ($<$ 1 gigayear), while the unmagnetized TOI-700 d with a 1
bar CO$_2$-dominated atmosphere could persist for many billions of years; we
find that the magnetized Earth-like case falls in between these two scenarios.

programming model to achieve high scalability is reported for particle tracking
in direct numerical simulations of turbulent flow. The work is motivated by the
desire to obtain Lagrangian information necessary for the study of turbulent
dispersion at the largest problem sizes feasible on current and next-generation
multi-petaflop supercomputers. A large population of fluid particles is
distributed among parallel processes dynamically, based on instantaneous
particle positions such that all of the interpolation information needed for
each particle is available either locally on its host process or neighboring
processes holding adjacent sub-domains of the velocity field. With cubic
splines as the preferred interpolation method, the new algorithm is designed to
minimize the need for communication, by transferring between adjacent processes
only those spline coefficients determined to be necessary for specific
particles. This transfer is implemented very efficiently as a one-sided
communication, using Co-Array Fortran (CAF) features which facilitate small
data movements between different local partitions of a large global array.
Detailed benchmarks are obtained on the Cray petascale supercomputer Blue
Waters at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. For operations on the
particles in a $8192^3$ simulation ($0.55$ trillion grid points) on $262,144$
Cray XE6 cores, the new algorithm is found to be orders of magnitude faster
relative to a prior algorithm in which each particle is tracked by the same
parallel process at all times. Improving support of PGAS models on major
compilers suggests that this algorithm will be of wider applicability on most
upcoming supercomputers.

GHFB+AMP. We should take the upper and the lower bound of GHFB+AMP and cGHFB.
The result $r_{\rm skin}^{48}=0.159-0.190$fm consists with the $r_{\rm

psychological research. From a Bayesian perspective, various approaches to
model comparison and selection have been proposed in the literature. However,
the applicability of these approaches strongly depends on the assumptions about
the model space $\mathcal{M}$, the so-called model view. Furthermore,
traditional methods like leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) estimate the
expected log predictive density (ELPD) of a model to investigate how the model
generalises out-of-sample, which quickly becomes computationally inefficient
when sample size becomes large. Here, we provide a tutorial on approximate
Pareto-smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO),
a computationally efficient method for Bayesian model comparison. First, we
discuss several model views and the available Bayesian model comparison methods
in each. We then use Bayesian logistic regression as a running example how to
apply the method in practice, and show that it outperforms other methods like
LOO-CV or information criteria in terms of computational effort while providing
similarly accurate ELPD estimates. In a second step, we show how even
large-scale models can be compared efficiently by using posterior
approximations in combination with probability-proportional-to-size
subsampling. We show how to compare competing models based on the ELPD
estimates provided, and how to conduct posterior predictive checks to safeguard
against overconfidence in one of the models under consideration. We conclude
that the method is attractive for mathematical psychologists who aim at
comparing several competing statistical models, which are possibly
high-dimensional and in the big-data regime.

in Earth and other planetary objects suggest the existence of increasing,
decreasing and cessation phases of major volcanic activity over geological time
scales. We have extended the existing scale of measuring intensity of volcanic
eruptions based on Earth based observations to accommodate intense and extreme
volcanic activity. The mass of a rocky planetary object is found to be related
to the magnitude of the internal heat, occurrences of Large Igneous Provinces
and the duration of major volcanic activity from relevant data available for
the inner solar system. The internal heat magnitude may also decide the
intensity of volcanism in these planetary objects. The time evolution of
volcanism in Earth and Mars has probably influenced the origin of life and

co-heterogenous and adaptive segmentation (CHASe), which only requires a small

pseudo-labeling. We also introduce co-heterogeneous training, which is a novel

CHASe using a clinically comprehensive and challenging dataset of multi-phase
computed tomography (CT) imaging studies (1147 patients and 4577 3D volumes).
Compared to previous state-of-the-art baselines, CHASe can further improve
pathological liver mask Dice-Sorensen coefficients by ranges of $4.2\% \sim

large-scale and complex networks because of its programmable, abstract,

the current SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms require network managers
to fully understand the underlying configurations of network. Facing the
increasingly complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security
policy management mechanism which can be completely transparent to any
underlying information. That is it can permit network managers to define
upper-level security policies without containing any underlying information of
network, and by means of model transformation system, these upper-level
security policies can be transformed into their corresponding lower-level
policies containing underlying information automatically. Moreover, it should
ensure system model updated by the generated lower-level policies can hold all

insights, we propose a security policy model transformation and verification
approach for SDN in this paper. We first present the formal definition of a
security policy model (SPM) which can be used to specify the security policies
used in SDN. Then, we propose a model transformation system based on SDN system
model and mapping rules, which can enable network managers to convert SPM model
into corresponding underlying network configuration policies automatically,
i.e., flow table model (FTM). In order to verify SDN system model updated by
the generated FTM models can hold the security properties defined in SPM
models, we design a security policy verification system based on model
checking. Finally, we utilize a comprehensive case to illustrate the
feasibility of the proposed approach.

left-to-right decoding cannot consider the future output context, and it is not
always optimal for ASR. One of the non-left-to-right models is known as
non-autoregressive Transformer (NAT) and has been intensively investigated in
the area of neural machine translation (NMT) research. One NAT model,
mask-predict, has been applied to ASR but the model needs some heuristics or
additional component to estimate the length of the output token sequence. This
paper proposes to apply another type of NAT called insertion-based models, that
were originally proposed for NMT, to ASR tasks. Insertion-based models solve
the above mask-predict issues and can generate an arbitrary generation order of

the detailed content structure information. Style transfer approaches would
initially learn content and style representations of the content and style
references and then generate the stylized images guided by these
representations. In this paper, we propose the multi-adaptation network which
involves two self-adaptation (SA) modules and one co-adaptation (CA) module:
the SA modules adaptively disentangle the content and style representations,
i.e., content SA module uses position-wise self-attention to enhance content
representation and style SA module uses channel-wise self-attention to enhance
style representation; the CA module rearranges the distribution of style
representation based on content representation distribution by calculating the
local similarity between the disentangled content and style features in a
non-local fashion. Moreover, a new disentanglement loss function enables our
network to extract main style patterns and exact content structures to adapt to

better results than the state-of-the-art style transfer methods.

(ETCs) was boosted by the discovery of thousands of exoplanets. We turn to the
classification of ETCs for new considerations that may help to design better
strategies for ETCs searches. We take a basic taxonomic approach to ETCs and
investigate the implications of the new classification on ETCs observational
patterns. We use as a counter-example to our qualitative classification the
quantitative scheme of Kardashev. We propose a classification based on the
abilities of ETCs to modify their environment and to integrate with it: Class 0
uses the environment as it is, Class 1 modifies the it to fit its needs, Class
2 modifies itself to fit the environment and Class 3 ETC is fully integrated
with the environment. Combined with the classical Kardashev's scale our scheme
forms a 2d scheme for interpreting ETC properties. The new framework makes it
obvious that the available energy is not an unique measure of ETCs, it may not
even correlate with how well that energy is used. The possibility for progress
without increased energy consumption implies lower detectability, so the
existence of a Kardashev Type III ETC in the Milky Way cannot be ruled out.
This reasoning weakens the Fermi paradox, allowing the existence of advanced,
yet not energy hungry, low detectability ETCs. The integration of ETCs with
environment makes it impossible to tell apart technosignatures from natural
phenomena. Thus, the most likely opportunity for SETI searches is to look for
beacons, specifically set up by them for young civilizations like us (if they
want to do that is a matter of speculation). The other SETI window is to search
for ETCs at technological level close to ours. To rephrase the saying of A.
Clarke, sufficiently advanced civilizations are indistinguishable from nature.

at each planning iteration, which represents the obstacle-free region based on
locally-sensed environment information. A collision-free path is computed by
sampling points in the generalized shape and is used to generate a smooth,
time-parametrized trajectory by minimizing snap. The generated trajectories are
constrained to lie within the generalized shape, which ensures the agent
maneuvers in the locally obstacle-free space. As the agent reaches boundary of
'sensing shape' in a planning iteration, a re-plan is triggered by receding
horizon planning mechanism that also enables initialization of the next
planning iteration. Theoretical guarantee of probabilistic completeness over
the entire environment and of completely collision-free trajectory generation
is provided. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation on complex 3-D
environments with varied obstacle-densities. We observe that each re-planing
computation takes $\sim$1.4 milliseconds on a single thread of an Intel Core

recover governing equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from noisy state

Dynamics (SINDy) approach of {\it [Brunton et al., PNAS, 113 (15) (2016)
3932-3937]}, which relies on two main assumptions: the state variables are
known {\it a priori} and the governing equations lend themselves to sparse,
linear expansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables. The aim of
this work is to improve the accuracy and robustness of SINDy in the presence of
state measurement noise. To this end, a reweighted $\ell_1$-regularized least
squares solver is developed, wherein the regularization parameter is selected
from the corner point of a Pareto curve. The idea behind using weighted
$\ell_1$-norm for regularization -- instead of the standard $\ell_1$-norm -- is
to better promote sparsity in the recovery of the governing equations and, in
turn, mitigate the effect of noise in the state variables. We also present a
method to recover single physical constraints from state measurements. Through
several examples of well-known nonlinear dynamical systems, we demonstrate
empirically the accuracy and robustness of the reweighted $\ell_1$-regularized
least squares strategy with respect to state measurement noise, thus
illustrating its viability for a wide range of potential applications.

uncoordinated with those of their neighbors, unlike the highly ordered motion
of bird flocks. However, it has been observed that insects may transiently form
pairs with synchronized relative motion while moving through the swarm. The
origin of this phenomenon remains an open question. In particular, it is not
known if pairing is a new behavioral process or whether it is a natural
byproduct of typical swarming behavior. Here, using an ""adaptive-gravity"" model
that proposes that insects interact via long-range gravity-like acoustic
attractions that are modulated by the total background sound (via ""adaptivity""
or fold-change detection) and that reproduces measured features of real swarms,
we show that pair formation can indeed occur without the introduction of
additional behavioral rules. In the model, pairs form robustly whenever two
insects happen to move together from the center of the swarm (where the
background sound is high) toward the swarm periphery (where the background
sound is low). Due to adaptivity, the attraction between the pair increases as
the background sound decreases, thereby forming a bound state since their
relative kinetic energy is smaller than their pair-potential energy. When the
pair moves into regions of high background sound, however, the process is
reversed and the pair may break up. Our results suggest that pairing should
appear generally in biological systems with long-range attraction and adaptive
sensing, such as during chemotaxis-driven cellular swarming.

policies entirely from a large batch of previously collected data. This problem
setting offers the promise of utilizing such datasets to acquire policies
without any costly or dangerous active exploration. However, it is also
challenging, due to the distributional shift between the offline training data
and those states visited by the learned policy. Despite significant recent
progress, the most successful prior methods are model-free and constrain the
policy to the support of data, precluding generalization to unseen states. In
this paper, we first observe that an existing model-based RL algorithm already
produces significant gains in the offline setting compared to model-free
approaches. However, standard model-based RL methods, designed for the online
setting, do not provide an explicit mechanism to avoid the offline setting's
distributional shift issue. Instead, we propose to modify the existing
model-based RL methods by applying them with rewards artificially penalized by
the uncertainty of the dynamics. We theoretically show that the algorithm
maximizes a lower bound of the policy's return under the true MDP. We also
characterize the trade-off between the gain and risk of leaving the support of
the batch data. Our algorithm, Model-based Offline Policy Optimization (MOPO),
outperforms standard model-based RL algorithms and prior state-of-the-art
model-free offline RL algorithms on existing offline RL benchmarks and two
challenging continuous control tasks that require generalizing from data

various factors, including public policy. When public policies depend on a
misrepresentation of trends in the areas they are aimed at, they become random
and disruptive, which can be interpreted as a source of disorder. Here we
consider policies on the spatial organization of the French Higher Education
and Research system, which reflects the authorities' hypothesis that scientific
excellence is the prerogative of a few large urban agglomerations. By
geographically identifying all the French publications listed in the Web of
Science databases between 1999 and 2017, we highlight a spatial deconcentration
trend, which has slowed down in recent years due to a freezed growth of the
teaching force. This deconcentration continues, however, to sustain the growth
of scientific production in small and medium-sized towns. An examination of the
large conurbations shows the relative decline of sites that nevertheless have
been highlighted as examples to be followed by the Excellence policies
(Strasbourg among others). The number of students and faculty has grown less
there, and it is a plaussible explanation for the relative decline in
scientific production. We show that the publication output of a given site
depends directly and strongly on the number of researchers hosted there. Based
on precise data at the French level, our results confirm what is already known
at world scale. In conclusion, we question the amount of disorder resulting
from policies aligned with poorly assessed trends.

they pose as a perfect example of how single elements of a system give rise to
collective phenomena on an intricate, non-trivial structure of interactions.
However, co-authorship networks are, in fact, one-mode projections of original
bipartite networks, which we call here scientific networks, where authors are
agents connected to artifacts - the papers they have published. Nonetheless,
few studies take into account the structure of the original bipartite network
to understand and explain the topological properties of the projected network.
Here, we create bipartite networks using extensive datasets from the American
Physical Society (APS) dating back to 1893 up to 2015 inclusive, and from arXiv
(1986-2015). We look at the time evolution of publications and at the dynamic
structure of scientific networks considering four major features of bipartite
networks, namely degree distributions, density, redundancy and cycles. We show
how such features shape the formation of co-authorship networks and their
observed structural properties. While the structure of the networks of most
disciplines does not show significant changes over time, the appearance of
large collaborations, in physics, generate largely skewed degree distributions
of top nodes. The latter, in turn, induces massive cliques in the projection,
triggering considerable densification of the co-authorship network, while the
density of the original bipartite network remains at the same levels.

RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) strategies at the transmitter

unique ability to partially decode interference and partially treat
interference as noise so as to softly bridge the two extremes of fully decoding
interference (as in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access, NOMA) and treating
interference as noise (as in Space Division Multiple Access, SDMA or Multi-User
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output, MU-MIMO). RSMA has been shown to provide
significant room for spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, Quality-of-Service
enhancements, robustness to Channel State Information (CSI) imperfections, as
well as feedback overhead and complexity reduction, in a wide range of network
loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a
diversity of channel directions, channel strengths and qualities). RSMA is also
deeply rooted and motivated by recent advances in understanding the fundamental
limits of multi-antenna networks with imperfect CSI at the Transmitter (CSIT).
In this work, we leverage recent results on the optimization of RSMA and design
for the first time its physical layer, accounting for modulation, coding (using

model with new interaction data. To pursue high model fidelity, it is usually
desirable to retrain the model on both historical and new data, since it can
account for both long-term and short-term user preference. However, a full
model retraining could be very time-consuming and memory-costly, especially
when the scale of historical data is large. In this work, we study the model
retraining mechanism for recommender systems, a topic of high practical values
but has been relatively little explored in the research community.
  Our first belief is that retraining the model on historical data is
unnecessary, since the model has been trained on it before. Nevertheless,
normal training on new data only may easily cause overfitting and forgetting
issues, since the new data is of a smaller scale and contains fewer information
on long-term user preference. To address this dilemma, we propose a new
training method, aiming to abandon the historical data during retraining
through learning to transfer the past training experience. Specifically, we
design a neural network-based transfer component, which transforms the old
model to a new model that is tailored for future recommendations. To learn the
transfer component well, we optimize the ""future performance"" -- i.e., the
recommendation accuracy evaluated in the next time period. Our Sequential
Meta-Learning(SML) method offers a general training paradigm that is applicable
to any differentiable model. We demonstrate SML on matrix factorization and
conduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Empirical results show that SML
not only achieves significant speed-up, but also outperforms the full model

1821 book Cours d'Analyse, may have plagiarized Bolzano's book Rein
analytischer Beweis (RB), first published in 1817. That paper was subsequently
discredited in several works, but some of its assumptions still prevail today.
In particular, it is usually considered that Cauchy did not develop his notion
of the continuity of a function before Bolzano developed his in RB, and that
both notions are essentially the same. We argue that both assumptions are
incorrect, and that it is implausible that Cauchy's initial insight into that
notion, which eventually evolved to an approach using infinitesimals, could
have been borrowed from Bolzano's work. Furthermore, we account for Bolzano's
interest in that notion and focus on his discussion of a definition by
K\""astner (in Section 183 of his 1766 book), which the former seems to have
misrepresented at least partially.
  Cauchy's treatment of continuity goes back at least to his 1817 course
summaries, refuting a key component of Grattan-Guinness' plagiarism hypothesis
(that Cauchy may have lifted continuity from RB after reading it in a Paris
library in 1818). We explore antecedents of Cauchy and Bolzano continuity in
the writings of K\""astner and earlier authors.

form for the metric function representing the radius of the 2-sphere, we solve
for the 3-form field and its potential. Using the obtained solution, we
construct an interior black hole spacetime which is everywhere regular. The
singularity is replaced with a Nariai-type spacetime, whose topology is
$\text{dS}_2 \times \text{S}^2$, in which the radius of the 2-sphere is
constant. So long as the interior continues to expand indefinitely, the
geometry becomes essentially compactified. The 2-dimensional de Sitter geometry
appears despite the negative potential of the 3-form field. Such a dynamical
compactification could shed some light on the origin of de Sitter geometry of
our Universe, exacerbated by the Swampland conjecture. In addition, we show
that the spacetime is geodesically complete. The geometry is singularity-free
due to the violation of the null energy condition.

consider the setting where the sample size is fixed but covariate values are
unknown until subjects enrol. Given a model for the outcome, a sequential
optimal design approach can be used to allocate treatments to minimize the
variance of the treatment effect. We extend existing optimal design methodology
so it can be used within a nonmyopic framework, where treatment allocation for
the current subject depends not only on the treatments and covariates of the
subjects already enrolled in the study, but also the impact of possible future
treatment assignments. The nonmyopic approach is computationally expensive as
it requires recursive formulae. We propose a pseudo-nonmyopic approach which
has a similar aim to the nonmyopic approach, but does not involve recursion and
instead relies on simulations of future possible decisions. Our simulation
studies show that the myopic approach is the most efficient for the logistic
model case with a single binary covariate and binary treatment.

investigation metastable skyrmionic spin structures with various topological
charges ($Q=-3,-2,-1,0,1,2$) in the (Pt$_{0.95}$Ir$_{0.05}$)/Fe/Pd(111)
ultrathin magnetic film are considered. Using an out-of-plane magnetized SP-STM
tip it is found that the maps of the LSC vectors acting on the spins of the
magnetic textures and all STT vector components exhibit the same topology as
the skyrmionic objects. In contrast, an in-plane magnetized tip generally does
not result in spin transport vector maps that are topologically equivalent to
the underlying spin structure, except for the LSC vectors acting on the spins
of the skyrmionic textures at a specific relation between the spin
polarizations of the sample and the tip. The magnitudes of the spin transport
vector quantities exhibit close relations to charge current SP-STM images
irrespectively of the skyrmionic topologies. Moreover, we find that the STT
efficiency (torque/current ratio) acting on the spins of the skyrmions can
reach large values up to $\sim$25 meV/$\mu$A ($\sim$0.97 $h/e$) above the rim
of the magnetic objects, but it considerably varies between large and small
values depending on the lateral position of the SP-STM tip above the
topological spin textures. A simple expression for the STT efficiency is
introduced to explain its variation. Our calculated spin transport vectors can
be used for the investigation of spin-polarized tunneling-current-induced spin

network interfaces to save up to 90% of their nominal energy consumption when

coalescing algorithms---that enter the low power mode as soon as there is no
more traffic waiting to be sent, and delay the exit from this mode until there
is an acceptable amount of traffic queued---to minimize energy usage while
maintaining an acceptable performance. However, EEE capable hardware from
several manufactures delays the entrance to the low power mode for a
considerable amount of time (hysteresis). In this paper we augment existing EEE
energy models to account for the hysteresis delay and show that, using the
configuration ranges provided by manufacturers, most existing EEE networking
devices are unable to obtain significant energy savings. To improve their
energy efficiency, we propose to implement frame coalescing directly at traffic
sources, before reaching the network interface. We also derive the optimum
coalescing parameters to obtain a given target energy consumption at the EEE
device when its configuration parameters are known in advance.

task in the field of statistics. Specifically, a major challenge is encountered
when constructing a test on a block structure obtained by applying a specific

to consider the selective bias in the block structure, that is, the block
structure is selected from all the possible cluster memberships based on some
criterion by the clustering algorithm. To cope with this problem, this study
provides a selective inference method for latent block models. Specifically, we
construct a statistical test on a set of row and column cluster memberships of
a latent block model, which is given by a squared residue minimization
algorithm. The proposed test, by its nature, includes and thus can also be used
as the test on the set of row and column cluster numbers. We also propose an
approximated version of the test based on simulated annealing to avoid
combinatorial explosion in searching the optimal block structure. The results
show that the proposed exact and approximated tests work effectively, compared

two units of lepton number $L$ induces neutrino masses $\propto v_s$. The
neutral component of $\Delta$ gives rise to two Higgs particles, a pseudoscalar
$A$ and a scalar $S$. The most general renormalizable Higgs potential $V$ for
$\Delta $ and the Standard-Model Higgs doublet $\Phi$ does not permit the
possibility that the mass of either $A$ or $S$ is small, of order $v_s$, while
the other mass is heavy enough to forbid the decay $Z\to A S$ to comply with
LEP 1 data. We present a model with additional dimension-6 terms in $V$, in
which this feature is absent and either $A$ or $S$ can be chosen light.
Subsequently we propose the model as a remedy to cosmological anomalies, namely
the tension between observed and predicted tensor-to-scalar mode ratios in the
cosmic microwave background and the different values of the Hubble constant
measured at different cosmological scales. Furthermore, if $\Delta$ dominantly
couples to the third-generation doublet $L_\tau=(\nu_\tau,\tau)$, the deficit
of $\nu_\tau$ events at IceCube can be explained. The singly and doubly charged
triplet Higgs bosons are lighter than 280 GeV and 400 GeV respectively, and

representing an inhabitant of Slovenia. The nodes are organised and
interconnected according to the real household and elderly-care center
distribution, while their connections outside these clusters are semi-randomly
distributed and fully-linked. The virus spread model is coupled to the disease
progression model. The ensemble approach with the perturbed transmission and
disease parameters is used to quantify the ensemble spread, a proxy for the
forecast uncertainty. The presented ongoing forecasts of COVID-19 epidemic in
Slovenia are compared with the collected Slovenian data. Results show that
infection is currently twice more likely to transmit within households/elderly
care centers than outside them. We use an ensemble of simulations (N = 1000) to
inversely obtain posterior distributions of model parameters and to estimate
the COVID-19 forecast uncertainty. We found that in the uncontrolled epidemic,
the intrinsic uncertainty mostly originates from the uncertainty of the virus
biology, i.e. its reproductive number. In the controlled epidemic with low
ratio of infected population, the randomness of the social network becomes the
major source of forecast uncertainty, particularly for the short-range
forecasts. Social-network-based models are thus essential for improving
epidemics forecasting.

alternatives to geodesic schemes. Under the assumption that the mean field of
the SA is correlated with the gradient of a smooth Lyapunov function (possibly
non-convex), we show that the above Riemannian SA schemes find an
${\mathcal{O}}(b_\infty + \log n / \sqrt{n})$-stationary point (in expectation)
within ${\mathcal{O}}(n)$ iterations, where $b_\infty \geq 0$ is the asymptotic
bias. Compared to previous works, the conditions we derive are considerably

a-priori bounded. Second, we study biased SA schemes. To be more specific, we
consider the case where the mean-field function can only be estimated up to a
small bias, and/or the case in which the samples are drawn from a controlled

German data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content
analysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors,
negativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and

partial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat
lacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage
on Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media
covered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they
consistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false
claims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of
journalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did
not find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall,
journalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling,

There is chance of aggravation due to two important changes that will be seen
in future cellular networks. First, the number of BSs will remarkably grow with
the proliferation of small-cell networks, which will expose humans to EMF more
often. Second, highly concentrated EMF beams will be generated by employing
larger antenna arrays to overcome faster EMF energy attenuation in
higher-frequency bands such as millimeter wave (mmW) spectrum, which will
increase damage if the main beam points to the human body. However, the two
changes can be exploited as leverages for (i) wider selection of alternative

widespread applications. A widely used method for accelerating model inference
is quantization, by replacing the input operands of a network using fixed-point
values. Then the majority of computation costs focus on the integer matrix
multiplication accumulation. In fact, high-bit accumulator leads to partially
wasted computation and low-bit one typically suffers from numerical overflow.
To address this problem, we propose an overflow aware quantization method by
designing trainable adaptive fixed-point representation, to optimize the number
of bits for each input tensor while prohibiting numeric overflow during the
computation. With the proposed method, we are able to fully utilize the
computing power to minimize the quantization loss and obtain optimized
inference performance. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct
image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks on
ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and COCO datasets, respectively. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve comparable performance with
state-of-the-art quantization methods while accelerating the inference process
by about 2 times.

Patch Label Inference Network (IOPLIN) for automatically detecting various
pavement distresses that are not solely limited to specific ones, such as
cracks and potholes. IOPLIN can be iteratively trained with only the image
label via the Expectation-Maximization Inspired Patch Label Distillation
(EMIPLD) strategy, and accomplish this task well by inferring the labels of
patches from the pavement images. IOPLIN enjoys many desirable properties over
the state-of-the-art single branch CNN models such as GoogLeNet and
EfficientNet. It is able to handle images in different resolutions, and
sufficiently utilize image information particularly for the high-resolution
ones, since IOPLIN extracts the visual features from unrevised image patches
instead of the resized entire image. Moreover, it can roughly localize the
pavement distress without using any prior localization information in the
training phase. In order to better evaluate the effectiveness of our method in
practice, we construct a large-scale Bituminous Pavement Disease Detection
dataset named CQU-BPDD consisting of 60,059 high-resolution pavement images,
which are acquired from different areas at different times. Extensive results
on this dataset demonstrate the superiority of IOPLIN over the state-of-the-art

effective techniques for verification of infinite state systems. They infer
global inductive invariants via local reasoning about a single step of the
transition relation of a system, while employing SMT-based procedures, such as
interpolation, to mitigate the limitations of local reasoning and allow for
better generalization. Unfortunately, these mitigations intertwine model
checking with heuristics of the underlying SMT-solver, negatively affecting
stability of model checking. In this paper, we propose to tackle the
limitations of locality in a systematic manner. We introduce explicit global
guidance into the local reasoning performed by IC3-style algorithms. To this
end, we extend the SMT-IC3 paradigm with three novel rules, designed to
mitigate fundamental sources of failure that stem from locality. We instantiate
these rules for the theory of Linear Integer Arithmetic and implement them on
top of SPACER solver in Z3. Our empirical results show that GSPACER, SPACER
extended with global guidance, is significantly more effective than both SPACER

of multi-core architectures. In said architectures, the most comprehensive
parallelization API is OpenMP. However, the introduction of correct and optimal
OpenMP parallelization to applications is not always a simple task, due to
common parallel management pitfalls, architecture heterogeneity and the current
necessity for human expertise in order to comprehend many fine details and
abstract correlations. To ease this process, many automatic parallelization
compilers were created over the last decade. Harel et al. [2020] tested several
source-to-source compilers and concluded that each has its advantages and
disadvantages and no compiler is superior to all other compilers in all tests.
This indicates that a fusion of the compilers' best outputs under the best
hyper-parameters for the current hardware setups can yield greater speedups. To
create such a fusion, one should execute a computationally intensive
hyper-parameter sweep, in which the performance of each option is estimated and
the best option is chosen. We created a novel parallelization source-to-source
multi-compiler named ComPar, which uses code segmentation-and-fusion with
hyper-parameters tuning to achieve the best parallel code possible without any
human intervention while maintaining the program's validity. In this paper we
present ComPar and analyze its results on NAS and PolyBench benchmarks. We
conclude that although the resources ComPar requires to produce parallel code
are greater than other source-to-source parallelization compilers - as it
depends on the number of parameters the user wishes to consider, and their
combinations - ComPar achieves superior performance overall compared to the
serial code version and other tested parallelization compilers. ComPar is

bursts of short-wavelength radiation and are capable of producing severe
space-weather consequences. Flares release free energy built up in coronal
fields, which are rooted in active regions (ARs) on the photosphere, via
magnetic reconnection. The exact processes that lead to reconnection are not
fully known and therefore reliable forecasting of flares is challenging.
Recently, photospheric magnetic-field data has been extensively analysed using
machine learning (ML) and these studies suggest that flare-forecasting accuracy
does not strongly depend on how long in advance flares are predicted (Bobra &
Couvidat 2015; Raboonik et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Here, we use ML to
understand the evolution of AR magnetic fields before and after flares. We
explicitly train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify SDO/HMI
line-of-sight magnetograms into ARs producing at least one M- or X-class flare
or as nonflaring. We find that flaring ARs remain in flare-productive states --
marked by recall >60% with a peak of ~ 80% -- days before and after flares. We
use occlusion maps and statistical analysis to show that the CNN pays attention
to regions between the opposite polarities from ARs and the CNN output is
dominantly decided by the total unsigned line-of-sight flux of ARs. Using
synthetic bipole magnetograms, we find spurious dependencies of the CNN output
on magnetogram dimensions for a given bipole size. Our results suggest that it
is important to use CNN designs that eliminate such artifacts in CNN
applications for processing magnetograms and, in general, solar image data.

  discrete symmetry. Geometrical aspects",,,,,"nlin.PS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The research group from the Rostov State University has been developing the
theory of bushes of nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) in Hamiltonian systems with
discrete symmetry since the late 90s of the last century. Group-theoretical
methods for studying large-amplitude atomic vibrations in molecular and crystal
structures were developed. Each bush represents a certain collection of
vibrational modes, which do not change in time despite the time evolution of
these modes, and the energy of the initial excitation remains trapped in the
bush. Any bush is characterized by its symmetry group, which is a subgroup of
the system's symmetry group. The modes contained in the given bush are
determined by symmetry-related methods and do not depend on the interatomic
interactions in the considered system. The irreducible representations of the
point and space groups are essentially used in the theory of the bushes of
NNMs, and this theory can be considered as a generalization of the well-known
Wigner classification of the small-amplitude vibrations in molecules and
crystals for the case of large-amplitudes vibrations. Since using of the
irreducible representations of the symmetry groups can be an obstacle to an
initial familiarization with the bush theory, in the present review, we explain
the basic concepts of this theory only with the aid of the ordinary normal
modes, which is well known from the standard textbooks considering the theory
of small atomic vibrations in mechanical systems. Our description is based on
the example of describing plane nonlinear atomic vibrations of a simple square
molecule.

momentum current associated to the particle-conservation law splits into
distinct contributions. Examples are strongly confined liquids for which the
currents in lateral and longitudinal direction to the walls are very different,
or fluids of nonspherical particles with distinct relaxation patterns for
translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Here, we perform an asymptotic
analysis of the slow structural relaxation close to kinetic arrest as described
by mode-coupling theory (MCT) with several relaxation channels. Compared to
standard MCT, the presence of multiple relaxation channels significantly
changes the structure of the underlying equations of motion and leads to
additional, non-trivial terms in the asymptotic solution. We show that the
solution can be rescaled, and thus prove that the well-known $ \beta $-scaling
equation of MCT remains valid even in the presence of multiple relaxation
channels. The asymptotic treatment is validated using a novel schematic model.
We demonstrate that the numerical solution of this schematic model can indeed
be described by the derived asymptotic scaling laws close to kinetic arrest.
Additionally, clear traces of the existence of two distinct decay channels are
found in the low-frequency susceptibility spectrum, suggesting that clear
footprints of the additional relaxation channels can in principle be detected
in simulations or experiments of confined or molecular liquids.

Within the pools the servers are homogeneous, but across pools possibly not in

could be based on (partial) knowledge of their type, but such knowledge might
not be available. Information about the job type can however be obtained while
the job is in service; as the service progresses, the likelihood that the
service speed of this job type is low increases, creating an incentive to
execute the job on different, possibly faster, server(s). Two policies are
considered: reroute the job to the other server pool, or replicate it there.
  We determine the effective load per server under both the rerouting and
replication policy for completely unknown as well as partly known job types. We
also examine the impact of these policies on the stability bound, and find that
the uncertainty in job types may significantly degrade the performance. For
(highly) unbalanced service speeds full replication achieves the largest

maximizes the stability bound. Finally, we discuss how the use of

  Pixel Labeling",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Existing CNN-based methods for pixel labeling heavily depend on multi-scale
features to meet the requirements of both semantic comprehension and detail
preservation. State-of-the-art pixel labeling neural networks widely exploit
conventional scale-transfer operations, i.e., up-sampling and down-sampling to
learn multi-scale features. In this work, we find that these operations lead to
scale-confused features and suboptimal performance because they are
spatial-invariant and directly transit all feature information cross scales
without spatial selection. To address this issue, we propose the Gated
Scale-Transfer Operation (GSTO) to properly transit spatial-filtered features
to another scale. Specifically, GSTO can work either with or without extra
supervision. Unsupervised GSTO is learned from the feature itself while the
supervised one is guided by the supervised probability matrix. Both forms of
GSTO are lightweight and plug-and-play, which can be flexibly integrated into
networks or modules for learning better multi-scale features. In particular, by
plugging GSTO into HRNet, we get a more powerful backbone (namely GSTO-HRNet)
for pixel labeling, and it achieves new state-of-the-art results on the COCO
benchmark for human pose estimation and other benchmarks for semantic
segmentation including Cityscapes, LIP and Pascal Context, with negligible
extra computational cost. Moreover, experiment results demonstrate that GSTO
can also significantly boost the performance of multi-scale feature aggregation
modules like PPM and ASPP. Code will be made available at

magnetic resonances having a nonlinear response with the oscillating amplitude,
which provides them with a large frequency tunability including the possibility
of mutual synchronization. The magnetization dynamics in STNO are induced by
spin transfer torque (STT) from spin currents and can be detected by changes in
electrical resistance due to giant magnetoresistance or tunneling
magnetoresistance. The STT effect is usually treated as a damping-like term
that reduces magnetic dissipation and promotes excitation of magnetic modes.
However, an additional term, known as Zhang-Li term has an effect on
magnetization gradients such as domain walls, and could have an effect on
localized magnetic modes in STNO. Here we study the effect of Zhang-Li torques
in magnetic excitations produced in STNO with a nanocontact geometry. Using
micromagnetic simulations we find that Zhang-Li torque modify threshold
currents of magnetic modes and their effective sizes. Additionally we show that
effects can be controlled by changing the ratio between nanocontact size and

neural networks (CNNs) is promising yet limited by the requirement of precisely
annotating all pixels in a large number of training images, which is extremely
labor-intensive especially for complex coronary trees. To alleviate the burden
on the annotator, we propose a novel weakly supervised training framework that
learns from noisy pseudo labels generated from automatic vessel enhancement,
rather than accurate labels obtained by fully manual annotation. A typical
self-paced learning scheme is used to make the training process robust against
label noise while challenged by the systematic biases in pseudo labels, thus
leading to the decreased performance of CNNs at test time. To solve this
problem, we propose an annotation-refining self-paced learning framework
(AR-SPL) to correct the potential errors using suggestive annotation. An
elaborate model-vesselness uncertainty estimation is also proposed to enable
the minimal annotation cost for suggestive annotation, based on not only the
CNNs in training but also the geometric features of coronary arteries derived
directly from raw data. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves
1) comparable accuracy to fully supervised learning, which also significantly
outperforms other weakly supervised learning frameworks; 2) largely reduced
annotation cost, i.e., 75.18% of annotation time is saved, and only 3.46% of
image regions are required to be annotated; and 3) an efficient intervention
process, leading to superior performance with even fewer manual interactions.

the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality

shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there
is no ""one-fits-all"" GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact,
setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality

high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data.

divide-and-conquer, e.g., partitioning into sub-problems and inducing
functional (and thus computational) independence. Such approximations can be
speedy, accurate, and sometimes even more flexible than an ordinary GPs.
However, a big downside is loss of continuity at partition boundaries. Modern
methods like local approximate GPs (LAGPs) imply effectively infinite
partitioning and are thus pathologically good and bad in this regard. Model
averaging, an alternative to divide-and-conquer, can maintain absolute
continuity but often over-smooths, diminishing accuracy. Here we propose

PALM is at least as accurate as LAGP, can be much faster in terms of speed, and
furnishes continuous predictive surfaces. Finally, we propose sequential

convert into a neutrino via scattering on a target nucleus $\mathcal{N}$: $ X +

direct detection experiments. Similarly, DM can be produced in neutrino
scattering events at neutrino experiments: $ \nu + \mathcal{N} \rightarrow X +

Furthermore, the model allows for late kinetic decoupling of dark matter with
implications for small-scale structure. At low masses, we find that COHERENT

also because they allow for the investigation of physical properties in
non-integer dimensions. In these unconventional systems, a myriad of intrinsic
features might come into play, such as the fractal dimension, the spectral
dimension, or the fractal geometry. Despite abundant theoretical and numerical
studies, experiments in fractal networks remain elusive. Here, we
experimentally investigate quantum transport in fractal networks by performing
continuous-time quantum walks in fractal photonic lattices with incremental
propagation lengths. Photons act as the walkers and evolve in the lattices
after being injected into one initial site. We unveil the transport properties
through the photon evolution pattern at different propagation lengths and the
analysis of the variance and the P'olya number, which are calculated based on
the probability distribution of the patterns. Contrarily to classical fractals,
we observe anomalous transport governed solely by the fractal dimension. In
addition, the critical point at which there is a transition from normal to
anomalous transport is highly dependent on the fractal geometry. Our experiment
allows the verification of physical laws in a quantitative manner and reveals
the transport dynamics with unprecedented detail, thus opening a path to the
understanding of more complex quantum phenomena governed by fractality.

suppression of convective blueshift and velocity imablances resulting from
brightness inhomogeneities, in agreement with recent studies of solar RV
variations. By modelling RV variations over the magnetic cycle using a linear
fit to the unsigned magnetic flux, we recover injected planets at an orbital
period of about 300 days with RV semi-amplitudes down to 0.3 m/s. To reach
semi-amplitudes of 0.1 m/s, we will need to identify and model additional

  uncertainty",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we introduce a new class of decision rules, referred to as
Constant Depth Decision Rules (CDDRs), for multistage optimization under linear
constraints with uncertainty-affected right-hand sides. We consider two
uncertainty classes: discrete uncertainties which can take at each stage at
most a fixed number d of different values, and polytopic uncertainties which,
at each stage, are elements of a convex hull of at most d points. Given the
depth mu of the decision rule, the decision at stage t is expressed as the sum
of t functions of mu consecutive values of the underlying uncertain parameters.
These functions are arbitrary in the case of discrete uncertainties and are
poly-affine in the case of polytopic uncertainties. For these uncertainty
classes, we show that when the uncertain right-hand sides of the constraints of
the multistage problem are of the same additive structure as the decision
rules, these constraints can be reformulated as a system of linear inequality
constraints where the numbers of variables and constraints is O(1)(n+m)d^mu N^2
with n the maximal dimension of control variables, m the maximal number of
inequality constraints at each stage, and N the number of stages.
  As an illustration, we discuss an application of the proposed approach to a
Multistage Stochastic Program arising in the problem of hydro-thermal
production planning with interstage dependent inflows. For problems with a
small number of stages, we present the results of a numerical study in which
optimal CDDRs show similar performance, in terms of optimization objective, to

resonance imaging (fMRI) data to extract independent components (ICs)
representing functional brain networks. While ICA produces reliable group-level
estimates, single-subject ICA often produces noisy results. Template ICA (tICA)
is a hierarchical ICA model using empirical population priors to produce
reliable subject-level IC estimates. However, this and other hierarchical ICA
models assume unrealistically that subject effects are spatially independent.
Here, we propose spatial template ICA (stICA), which incorporates spatial
process priors into tICA. This results in greater estimation efficiency of ICs
and subject effects. Additionally, the joint posterior distribution can be used
to identify engaged areas using an excursions set approach. By leveraging
spatial dependencies and avoiding massive multiple comparisons, stICA has high
power to detect true effects. We derive an efficient expectation-maximization
algorithm to obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the model parameters and
posterior moments of the latent fields. Based on analysis of simulated data and
fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, we find that stICA produces
estimates that are more accurate and reliable than benchmark approaches, and
identifies larger and more reliable areas of engagement. The algorithm is quite
tractable, achieving convergence within 7 hours in our fMRI analysis.

conditions, while native BSA forms amyloid fibrillar structures. Further,
DLS-based micro-rheology studies performed with heat-treated 100 to 200 {\mu}M
native BSA aggregates provided understanding of the equilibrium elastic and
viscous moduli over a very large frequency range, reaching MHz, which are
inaccessible using bulk rheology. Our results indicate that after 6 days of

performed to investigate the effect of a boundary layer on the wedge surface on
ignition and stability of oblique detonation waves (ODWs). Two computational
domains were used: one containing a wedge of a single angle with a straight
after-body, and the other containing a double-angle wedge geometry. Both
domains were channels with a supersonic inflow of stoichiometric hydrogen-air
and a nonreflecting outflow, and the wedge was modeled using an immersed
boundary method. The compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations were solved
using a high-order numerical algorithm on an adapting grid. Inviscid and
viscous wedge surfaces were modeled using slip and no-slip adiabatic boundary
conditions, respectively. Inviscid wedge surface cases are presented for a
range of inflow conditions and compared to previous work outlining several
different ODW structures. An ignition criterion is established as an accurate
method of predicting the formation of an ODW for a given inflow temperature,
Mach number, wedge angle, and length of the inviscid wedge surface. A viscous
wedge surface is then considered for a Mach 5 inflow at temperatures of 600 K,
700 K, and 800 K. The 600 K flow ignites in the boundary layer, but does not
detonate, while the 700 K and 800 K flows ignite and form ODWs. It was
determined that ODW formation depends on the degree of augmentation of the
leading oblique shock wave by the burning boundary layer and that ODW formation
is therefore predictable based on the ignition criterion. The 700 K flow
produces a unique oscillatory mode of a receding ODW followed by a redetonation
event occurring near the leading edge. A mechanism for this cycle, which
repeats indefinitely, is proposed.

scoped meaning representations that capture the semantics of negation, modals,
quantification, and presupposition triggers. Additionally, concepts and
event-participants in DRSs are described with WordNet synsets and the thematic
roles from VerbNet. To measure similarity between two DRSs, they are
represented in a clausal form, i.e. as a set of tuples. Participant systems
were expected to produce DRSs in this clausal form. Taking into account the
rich lexical information, explicit scope marking, a high number of shared
variables among clauses, and highly-constrained format of valid DRSs, all these
makes the DRS parsing a challenging NLP task. The results of the shared task
displayed improvements over the existing state-of-the-art parser.

metallicities and column densities by performing a suite of three-dimensional
radiation hydrodynamics simulations. We find that the photoionization feedback
from massive stars controls the star formation efficiency (SFE) in a
star-forming cloud, and its impact sensitively depends on the gas metallicity
$Z$ and initial cloud surface density $\Sigma$. At $Z=1~Z_{\odot}$, SFE
increases as a power law from 0.03 at $\Sigma = 10~M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}$ to
0.3 at $\Sigma = 300~M_{\odot}{\rm pc^{-2}}$. In low-metallicity cases
$10^{-2}- 10^{-1} Z_{\odot}$, star clusters form from atomic warm gases because
the molecule formation time is not short enough with respect to the cooling or
dynamical time. In addition, the whole cloud is disrupted more easily by
expanding H{\sc ii} bubbles which have higher temperature owing to less
efficient cooling. With smaller dust attenuation, the ionizing radiation
feedback from nearby massive stars is stronger and terminate star formation in
dense clumps. These effects result in inefficient star formation in
low-metallicity environments: the SFE drops by a factor of $\sim 3$ at
$Z=10^{-2}~Z_{\odot}$ compared to the results for $Z=1~Z_{\odot}$, regardless
of $\Sigma$. Newborn star clusters are also gravitationally less bound. We
further develop a new semi-analytical model that can reproduce the simulation
results well, particularly the observed dependencies of the SFEs on the cloud
surface densities and metallicities.

in a multi-modal setting, where we have novel classes of audio/video during
testing that are not seen during training. We use the semantic relatedness of
text embeddings as a means for zero-shot learning by aligning audio and video
embeddings with the corresponding class label text feature space. Our approach
uses a cross-modal decoder and a composite triplet loss. The cross-modal
decoder enforces a constraint that the class label text features can be
reconstructed from the audio and video embeddings of data points. This helps
the audio and video embeddings to move closer to the class label text
embedding. The composite triplet loss makes use of the audio, video, and text
embeddings. It helps bring the embeddings from the same class closer and push
away the embeddings from different classes in a multi-modal setting. This helps
the network to perform better on the multi-modal zero-shot learning task.
Importantly, our multi-modal zero-shot learning approach works even if a
modality is missing at test time. We test our approach on the generalized
zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks and show that our approach
outperforms other models in the presence of a single modality as well as in the
presence of multiple modalities. We validate our approach by comparing it with
previous approaches and using various ablations.

of interest on a given model is that this estimation requires the generation of
counterfactual examples, which is challenging with existing generation
technology. To bridge that gap, we propose CausaLM, a framework for producing
causal model explanations using counterfactual language representation models.
Our approach is based on fine-tuning of deep contextualized embedding models
with auxiliary adversarial tasks derived from the causal graph of the problem.
Concretely, we show that by carefully choosing auxiliary adversarial
pre-training tasks, language representation models such as BERT can effectively
learn a counterfactual representation for a given concept of interest, and be
used to estimate its true causal effect on model performance. A byproduct of
our method is a language representation model that is unaffected by the tested
concept, which can be useful in mitigating unwanted bias ingrained in the data.

the infinitude of primes $p$ satisfying $||\alpha p||\le p^{-\nu}$. The latest
record in this regard is Kaisa Matom\""aki's landmark result
$\nu=1/3-\varepsilon$ which presents the limit of currently known technology.
Recently, Glyn Harman, and, jointly, Marc Technau and the first-named author,
investigated the same problem in the context of imaginary quadratic fields.
Glyn Harman obtained an analog for $\mathbb{Q}(i)$ of his result in the context
of $\mathbb{Q}$, which yields an exponent of $\nu=7/22$. Marc Technau and the
first-named author produced an analogue of Bob Vaughan's result
$\nu=1/4-\varepsilon$ for all imaginary quadratic number fields of class number
1. In the present article, we establish an analog of the last-mentioned result
for real quadratic fields of class number 1 under a certain Diophantine
restriction. This setting involves the additional complication of an infinite
group of units in the ring of integers. Moreover, although the basic sieve
approach remains the same (we use an ideal version of Harman's sieve), the
problem takes a different flavor since it becomes truly 2-dimensional. We
reduce it eventually to a counting problem which is, interestingly, related to
roots of quadratic congruences. To approximate them, we use an approach by
Christopher Hooley based on the theory of binary quadratic forms.

faster than their counter-rotating equivalents. We have found important
difference in the behavior of the excitation (as a function of the peak laser

excitation is always weaker than the ionization and starts for higher

efficiency of conflict-driven clause-learning Boolean satisfiability (CDCL SAT)
solvers on industrial problems from a variety of domains. The availability of
such powerful general-purpose search tools as SAT solvers has led many
researchers to propose SAT-based methods for cryptanalysis, including
techniques for finding collisions in hash functions and breaking symmetric
encryption schemes. Most of the previously proposed SAT-based cryptanalysis
approaches are blackbox techniques, in the sense that the cryptanalysis problem
is encoded as a SAT instance and then a CDCL SAT solver is invoked to solve the
said instance. A weakness of this approach is that the encoding thus generated
may be too large for any modern solver to solve efficiently. Perhaps a more
important weakness of this approach is that the solver is in no way specialized
or tuned to solve the given instance. To address these issues, we propose an
approach called CDCL(Crypto) (inspired by the CDCL(T) paradigm in
Satisfiability Modulo Theory solvers) to tailor the internal subroutines of the
CDCL SAT solver with domain-specific knowledge about cryptographic primitives.
Specifically, we extend the propagation and conflict analysis subroutines of
CDCL solvers with specialized codes that have knowledge about the cryptographic
primitive being analyzed by the solver. We demonstrate the power of this
approach in the differential path and algebraic fault analysis of hash
functions. Our initial results are very encouraging and reinforce the notion
that this approach is a significant improvement over blackbox SAT-based

concerning the bibliometric index and the assigned weights. Inequality has not
increased among the elite clubs and between the national associations, however,

sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $3\,$fb$^{-1}$ collected in
$pp$ collisions at centre-of-mass energies of 7 and 8\,TeV with the LHCb
detector. Candidate $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons from b-hadron
decays are selected in the $ J/\psi \pi^+ \pi^-$ decay mode. Describing the
{\mbox{lineshape}} with a Breit--Wigner function, the mass splitting between
the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ and $\psi(2S)$ states, $\Delta m$, and the width of the
$\chi_{c1}(3872)$ state, $\Gamma_{\mathrm{BW}}$, are determined to be
\begin{eqnarray*} \Delta m & = & 185.598 \pm 0.067 \pm 0.068\, \mathrm{MeV} \,,
\\ \Gamma_{\mathrm{BW}} & = & \phantom{00}1.39\phantom{0} \pm 0.24\phantom{0}
\pm 0.10\phantom{0} \mathrm{MeV} \,, \end{eqnarray*} where the first
uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. Using a Flatt\'e-inspired
model, the mode and full width at half maximum of the lineshape are determined
to be \begin{eqnarray*} \mathrm{mode} & =
3871.69^{\,+\,0.00\,+\,0.05}_{\,-\,0.04\,-\,0.13} &\mathrm{MeV} \\
\mathrm{FWHM} & = 0.22^{\,+\,0.07\,+\,0.11}_{\,-\,0.06\,-\,0.13}& \mathrm{MeV}
. \end{eqnarray*} An investigation of the analytic structure of the Flatt\'e
amplitude reveals a pole structure, which is compatible with a quasi-bound
$D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ state but a quasi-virtual state is still allowed at the level
of $2$ standard deviations.

  and Continuous Normalizing Flows","19 pages, 8 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  We compare the discretize-optimize (Disc-Opt) and optimize-discretize
(Opt-Disc) approaches for time-series regression and continuous normalizing
flows (CNFs) using neural ODEs. Neural ODEs are ordinary differential equations
(ODEs) with neural network components. Training a neural ODE is an optimal
control problem where the weights are the controls and the hidden features are
the states. Every training iteration involves solving an ODE forward and
another backward in time, which can require large amounts of computation, time,
and memory. Comparing the Opt-Disc and Disc-Opt approaches in image
classification tasks, Gholami et al. (2019) suggest that Disc-Opt is preferable
due to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend the
comparison to neural ODEs for time-series regression and CNFs. Unlike in
classification, meaningful models in these tasks must also satisfy additional
requirements beyond accurate final-time output, e.g., the invertibility of the
CNF. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful
numerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as
Opt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced
costs in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction
ranging from 39% to 97%, and in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine
days to less than one day.

  Meaning Representations, 2019, Association for Computational Linguistics","10.18653/v1/W19-3302",,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Meaning banking--creating a semantically annotated corpus for the purpose of
semantic parsing or generation--is a challenging task. It is quite simple to
come up with a complex meaning representation, but it is hard to design a
simple meaning representation that captures many nuances of meaning. This paper
lists some lessons learned in nearly ten years of meaning annotation during the
development of the Groningen Meaning Bank (Bos et al., 2017) and the Parallel
Meaning Bank (Abzianidze et al., 2017). The paper's format is rather
unconventional: there is no explicit related work, no methodology section, no
results, and no discussion (and the current snippet is not an abstract but
actually an introductory preface). Instead, its structure is inspired by work
of Traum (2000) and Bender (2013). The list starts with a brief overview of the
existing meaning banks (Section 1) and the rest of the items are roughly
divided into three groups: corpus collection (Section 2 and 3, annotation
methods (Section 4-11), and design of meaning representations (Section 12-30).
We hope this overview will give inspiration and guidance in creating improved
meaning banks in the future.

  Understanding",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Localizing objects in 3D space and understanding their associated 3D
properties is challenging given only monocular RGB images. The situation is
compounded by the loss of depth information during perspective projection. We
present Center3D, a one-stage anchor-free approach, to efficiently estimate 3D
location and depth using only monocular RGB images. By exploiting the
difference between 2D and 3D centers, we are able to estimate depth
consistently. Center3D uses a combination of classification and regression to
understand the hidden depth information more robustly than each method alone.
Our method employs two joint approaches: (1) LID: a classification-dominated
approach with sequential Linear Increasing Discretization. (2) DepJoint: a
regression-dominated approach with multiple Eigen's transformations for depth
estimation. Evaluating on KITTI dataset for moderate objects, Center3D improved
the AP in BEV from $29.7\%$ to $42.8\%$, and the AP in 3D from $18.6\%$ to
$39.1\%$. Compared with state-of-the-art detectors, Center3D has achieved the
best speed-accuracy trade-off in realtime monocular object detection.

fields can create metallic surfaces with properties not found in the bulk, such
as high electron mobility, magnetism or superconductivity. Optical generation
of such metallic surfaces via BB on ultrafast timescales would facilitate a
drastic manipulation of the conduction, magnetic and optical properties of
semiconductors for high-speed electronics. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast
generation of a metal at the (10-10) surface of ZnO upon photoexcitation.
Compared to hitherto known ultrafast photoinduced semiconductor-to-metal
transitions that occur in the bulk of inorganic semiconductors, the
metallization of the ZnO surface is launched by 3-4 orders of magnitude lower
photon fluxes. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we
show that the phase transition is caused by photoinduced downward surface band
bending due to photodepletion of donor-type deep surface defects. At low photon
flux, surface-confined excitons are formed. Above a critical exciton density, a
Mott transition occurs, leading to a partially filled metallic band below the
equilibrium Fermi energy. This process is in analogy to chemical doping of
semiconductor surfaces. The discovered mechanism is not material-specific and
presents a general route for controlling metallicity confined to semiconductor
interfaces on ultrafast timescales.

continue this effort and optimize the main tensor-product operation in Nekbone
further. Our optimization is done in CUDA and uses a different, 2D, thread
structure to make the computations layer by layer. This enables us to use loop
unrolling as well as utilize registers and shared memory efficiently. Our
implementation is then compared on both the Pascal and Volta GPU architectures
to previous GPU versions of Nekbone as well as a measured roofline. The results
show that our implementation outperforms previous GPU Nekbone implementations

measurements in the frequency domain. Standard methods in this field assume
that the estimated correlation matrix is superimposed with additive white
noise. In this paper we present a mathematical model for the measurement
process covering arbitrarily correlated noise. The covariance matrix of
correlation data is given in terms of fourth order moments. The aim of this
paper is to explore the use of such additional information on the measurement
data in imaging methods. For this purpose a class of weighted data spaces is
introduced, where each data space naturally defines an associated beamforming
method with a corresponding point spread function. This generic class of
beamformers contains many well-known methods such as Conventional Beamforming,
(Robust) Adaptive Beamforming or beamforming with shading. This article
examines in particular weightings that depend on the noise (co)variances. In a
theoretical analysis we prove that the beamformer, weighted by the full noise
covariance matrix, has minimal variance among all beamformers from the
described class. Application of the (co)variance weighted methods on synthetic
and experimental data show that the resolution of the results is improved and
noise effects are reduced.

time invariant (LTI) networked dynamic system (NDS), under which subsystem
interconnections can be estimated from external output measurements. In this
NDS, subsystems may have distinctive dynamics, and subsystem interconnections
are arbitrary. It is assumed that system matrices of each subsystem depend on
its (pseudo) first principle parameters (FPPs) through a linear fractional
transformation (LFT). It has been proven that if in each subsystem, the
transfer function matrix (TFM) from its internal inputs to its external outputs
is of full normal column rank (FNCR), while the TFM from its external inputs to
its internal outputs is of full normal row rank (FNRR), then the structure of
the NDS is identifiable. Moreover, under some particular situations like there
are no direct information transmission from an internal input to an internal
output in each subsystem, a necessary and sufficient condition is established
for NDS structure identifiability. A matrix valued polynomial (MVP) rank based
equivalent condition is further derived, which depends affinely on subsystem
(pseudo) FPPs and can be independently verified for each subsystem. From this
condition, some necessary conditions are obtained for both subsystem dynamics

expressed by fractional Fourier transforms whose orders are real numbers.
According to a scalar theory, diffraction acts on the amplitude of the electric
field as well as on its spherical angular spectrum, and Wigner distributions
can be defined on a space-frequency phase space. The phase space is equipped
with an Euclidean structure, so that the effects of diffraction are rotations
of Wigner distributions associated with optical fields. Such a rotation is
shown to split into two specific elliptical rotations. Wigner distributions
associated with transverse modes of a resonator are invariant in these
rotations, and a complete theory of stable optical resonators and Gaussian
beams is developed on the basis of this property, including waist existence and
related formulae, and naturally introducing the Gouy phase.

cosmic-ray energy scale of LOFAR. First, we present the reconstruction of
cosmic-ray energy using radio and particle techniques along with a discussion
of the event-by-event and absolute scale uncertainties. The resulting energies
reconstructed with each method are shown to be in good agreement, and because
the radio-based reconstructed energy has smaller uncertainty on an
event-to-event basis, LOFAR analyses will use that technique in the future.
Second, we present the radiation energy of air showers measured at LOFAR and
demonstrate how radiation energy can be used to compare the energy scales of
different experiments. The radiation energy scales quadratically with the
electromagnetic energy in an air shower, which can in turn be related to the
energy of the primary particle. Once the local magnetic field is accounted for,
the radiation energy allows for a direct comparison between the LORA
particle-based energy scale and that of the Pierre Auger Observatory. They are
shown to agree to within (6$\pm$20)% for a radiation energy of 1 MeV, where the
uncertainty on the comparison is dominated by the antenna calibrations of each
experiment. This study motivates the development of a portable radio array
which will be used to cross-calibrate the energy scales of different
experiments using radiation energy and the same antennas, thereby significantly
reducing the uncertainty on the comparison.

introduced and explicitly shown to possess a PBW basis and a certain central
element. It is seen that $Z_2(sl(3))$ is isomorphic to a quotient of the

central element. Upon concentrating on three highest weight representations
occurring in the Clebsch--Gordan series of $U(sl(3))$, a specialisation of
$\mathcal{A}$ arises, involving the pairs of numbers characterising the three
highest weights. In this realisation in $U(sl(3))\otimes U(sl(3))$, the
coefficients in the defining relations and the value of the central element
have degrees that correspond to the fundamental degrees of the Weyl group of
type $E_6$. With the correct association between the six parameters of the
representations and some roots of $E_6$, the symmetry under the full Weyl group
of type $E_6$ is made manifest. The coefficients of the relations and the value

We extend on our previous work by performing a series of simulations with a

function is a rich tapestry of the underlying physics. However, actually
leveraging the particle distribution function to understand the dynamics of a
weakly collisional plasma is challenging. The equation system of relevance, the
Vlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck (VM-FP) system of equations, is difficult to
numerically integrate, and traditional methods such as the particle-in-cell
method introduce counting noise into the distribution function.
  In this thesis, we present a new algorithm for the discretization of VM-FP
system of equations for the study of plasmas in the kinetic regime. Using the
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method for the spatial
discretization and a third order strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta for
the time discretization, we obtain an accurate solution for the plasma's
distribution function in space and time.
  We both prove the numerical method retains key physical properties of the
VM-FP system, such as the conservation of energy and the second law of
thermodynamics, and demonstrate these properties numerically. These results are
contextualized in the history of the DG method. We discuss the importance of
the algorithm being alias-free, a necessary condition for deriving stable DG
schemes of kinetic equations so as to retain the implicit conservation
relations embedded in the particle distribution function, and the computational
favorable implementation using a modal, orthonormal basis in comparison to
traditional DG methods applied in computational fluid dynamics. Finally, we
demonstrate how the high fidelity representation of the distribution function,
combined with novel diagnostics, permits detailed analysis of the energization
mechanisms in fundamental plasma processes such as collisionless shocks.

methods for determining model parameters. In this study, we outline details of
the present ABC-IMCMC approach, including the use of an adaptive proposal and a
calibration step to accelerate the parameter estimation process. We demonstrate
the approach by estimating parameters in two nonlinear SGS closures using
reference data from direct numerical simulations of homogeneous isotropic
turbulence. We show that the resulting parameter values give excellent
agreement with reference probability density functions of the SGS stress and
kinetic energy production rate in a priori tests, while also providing stable
solutions in forward LES (i.e., a posteriori tests) for homogeneous isotropic

the user in providing a suggestion of a specific dilemma. Thus, recently, the
interest in developing a recommendation system in many fields has increased.
Fuzzy Logic system (FLSs) is one of the approaches that can be used to model
the recommendation systems as it can deal with uncertainty and imprecise
information. However, one of the fundamental issues in FLS is the problem of
the curse of dimensionality. That is, the number of rules in FLSs is increasing
exponentially with the number of input variables. One effective way to overcome
this problem is by using Hierarchical Fuzzy System (HFSs). This paper aims to
explore the use of HFSs for Recommendation system. Specifically, we are
interested in exploring and comparing the HFS and FLS for the Career path
recommendation system (CPRS) based on four key criteria, namely topology, the
number of rules, the rules structures and interpretability. The findings
suggested that the HFS has advantages over FLS towards improving the
interpretability models, in the context of a recommendation system example.
This study contributes to providing an insight into the development of
interpretable HFSs in the Recommendation systems.

non-premixed flames are commonly seen in more practical combustion analyses. A
range of realistic mass mixture fractions and asymmetric chemical rate laws are
examined while avoiding the commonly forced unreal symmetric behavior with
one-step second-order kinetics. Moreover, a survey of critical parameters is
performed varying pressure and normal strain rate to define the flame structure
and detect different characters. Three flames can co-exist if the strain rate
is low enough and the pressure is high enough. However, at higher strain rate
and/or lower pressure, only one or two flames might be obtained. Negative
regions of heat release rate are observed and linked to potential endothermic
reactions. With a rich premixed mixture at low strain rates and pressures, high
exothermic reactions producing CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, and consuming CO and H$_2$
causes a heat-release-rate peak. Unexpected character of the lean and rich
premixed flames is observed, leading to the conclusion that these flames are
diffusion-controlled.

generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent
state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well
habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is
carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights
for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is
accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower
bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic
tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning
with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a
regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show
that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in
goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor
plans within the range of habituated trajectories.

platform capitalism has not spared scientific research in academia. In this
work, we will analyse the use of ML in fundamental physics and its relationship
to other cases that directly affect society. We will deal with different
aspects of the issue, from a bibliometric analysis of the publications, to a
detailed discussion of the literature, to an overview on the productive and
working context inside and outside academia. The analysis will be conducted on
the basis of three key elements: the non-neutrality of science, understood as
its intrinsic relationship with history and society; the non-neutrality of the
algorithms, in the sense of the presence of elements that depend on the choices
of the programmer, which cannot be eliminated whatever the technological
progress is; the problematic nature of a paradigm shift in favour of a
data-driven science (and society). The deconstruction of the presumed
universality of scientific thought from the inside becomes in this perspective
a necessary first step also for any social and political discussion. This is
the subject of this work in the case study of ML.

computational approaches to semantic similarity, that is, the comparison of
objects such as images in a semantically meaningful way. We consider the
problem of learning Tversky similarity measures from suitable training data
indicating whether two objects tend to be similar or dissimilar.
Experimentally, we evaluate our approach to similarity learning on two image
datasets, showing that is performs very well compared to existing methods.

Scott, Michael Shvartsman and Karl Ridgeway","Unifying Few- and Zero-Shot Egocentric Action Recognition","Accepted for presentation at the EPIC@CVPR2020 workshop",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although there has been significant research in egocentric action
recognition, most methods and tasks, including EPIC-KITCHENS, suppose a fixed
set of action classes. Fixed-set classification is useful for benchmarking
methods, but is often unrealistic in practical settings due to the
compositionality of actions, resulting in a functionally infinite-cardinality
label set. In this work, we explore generalization with an open set of classes
by unifying two popular approaches: few- and zero-shot generalization (the
latter which we reframe as cross-modal few-shot generalization). We propose a
new set of splits derived from the EPIC-KITCHENS dataset that allow evaluation
of open-set classification, and use these splits to show that adding a
metric-learning loss to the conventional direct-alignment baseline can improve
zero-shot classification by as much as 10%, while not sacrificing few-shot
performance.
