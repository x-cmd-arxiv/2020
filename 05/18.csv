discovery but remains a challenge even with computationally expensive
biophysics-based energy scoring methods and state-of-the-art deep learning
approaches. Despite the recent advances in the deep convolutional and graph
neural network based approaches, the model performance depends on the input
data representation and suffers from distinct limitations. It is natural to
combine complementary features and their inference from the individual models
for better predictions. We present fusion models to benefit from different
feature representations of two neural network models to improve the binding
affinity prediction. We demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed approach by
performing experiments with the PDBBind 2016 dataset and its docking pose
complexes. The results show that the proposed approach improves the overall
prediction compared to the individual neural network models with greater
computational efficiency than related biophysics based energy scoring
functions. We also discuss the benefit of the proposed fusion inference with
several example complexes. The software is made available as open source at

scotogenic Dirac model, which could accommodate the Dirac neutrino mass and
dark matter. We have studied the LFV processes in this model, which are
mediated by the charged scalar $\phi^\pm$ and heavy fermions $N_i$. The
experimental bounds, especially given by decays $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to
3e$, have put severe constraints on Yukawa $y_\Phi$ and masses $m_{N1}$,
$m_\phi$. We select the heavy fermion $N_1$ as dark matter candidate and find
the correct relic density is basically by annihilating through another Yukawa
$y_\chi$. After satisfying LFV and dark matter relic density constraints, we
consider the indirect detections of dark matter annihilating into leptons. But
the constraints are relatively loose. Then we make a detailed discussion on the
dark matter direct detections. Although two Yukawa can both contribute to the
direct detection processes, more attention has been paid on the
$y_\Phi$-related processes as the $y_\chi$-related process is bounded loosely.
The current and future direct detection experiments have been used to set
constraints on the Yukawas and masses. The current direct detections bounds are
relatively loose and can barely exclude more parameter region beyond the LFV.
For the future direct detection experiments, the excluding capacities can be
improved due to larger exposures. The detecting capabilities in the large mass
region have not been weakened as the existence of mass enhancement from the
magnetic dipole operator $\mathcal{O}_{\rm mag.}$. At last, we briefly discuss
the collider signal searching in this model, the most promising signature is
pair produced $\phi^+\phi^-$ and decay into signal of
$\ell^+\ell^-+\not{\!\!E}_T$. The exclusion limits from collider on $m_{N1}$
and $m_\phi$ have provided a complementary detecting capability compared to the
LFV and dark matter detections.

method for solving problems closely related to Hamiltonian (or

$\mathbb{C}^n$ (also $\mathbb{R}^n$), the SDA with an $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity does not work well. In this paper, we propose a new decoupled form
of the SDA (we name it as dSDA), building on the associated Krylov subspaces
thus leading to the inherent low-rank structures. Importantly, the approach
decouples the original two to four iteration formulae. The resulting dSDA is
much more efficient since only one quantity (instead of the original two to
four) is computed iteratively. For large-scale problems, further efficiency is
gained from the low-rank structures. This paper presents the theoretical
aspects of the dSDA. A practical algorithm dSDA t with truncation and many

individuals of COVID-19 infection and total deaths; 2) cities located in
hinterland zones (mostly those bordering large urban conurbations) with high

greater number of infected individuals and total deaths. Hence, cities with
pollution industrialization and low renewable energy have also to consider low

also with a proactive strategy directed to interventions for a sustainable

prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 infection must also be based on
sustainability science to support a higher level of renewable energy and
cleaner production to reduce polluting industrialization and, as result, the
factors determining the spread of coronavirus disease and other infections in

principle, a manifestation of which is embodied in quantum coherence. Coherence
of a quantum state is invariably defined with respect to a preferred set of
pointer states, and there exist quantum coherence measures with respect to
deterministically as well as probabilistically distinguishable sets of quantum
state vectors. Here we study the resource theory of quantum coherence with
respect to an arbitrary set of quantum state vectors, that may not even be
probabilistically distinguishable. Geometrically, a probabilistically
indistinguishable set of quantum state vectors forms a linearly dependent set.
We find the free states of the resource theory, and analyze the corresponding
free operations, obtaining a necessary condition for an arbitrary quantum
operation to be free. We identify a class of measures of the quantum coherence,
and in particular establish a monotonicity property of the measures. We find a
connection of an arbitrary set of quantum state vectors with positive operator
valued measurements with respect to the resource theory being considered, which
paves the way for an alternate definition of the free states. We notice that
the resource theory of magic can be looked upon as a resource theory of quantum
coherence with respect to a set of quantum state vectors that are
probabilistically indistinguishable. We subsequently examine the wave-particle
duality in a double-slit set-up in which superposition of probabilistically

hand, lower bounds from conjectures about the $k$-clique problem imply that

well as specialized algorithms with better performance for certain classes of

  In this work, we resolve the problem for general graphs. We show that the
Contraction Algorithm of Karger outputs any fixed $k$-cut of weight $\alpha

the present treatise describes a face mask in which a simple textile
triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) serves the purpose of filtration of
SARS-CoV-2. The proposed mask is designed with multilayer protection sheets, in
which the first two layers act as triboelectric (TE) filter and the outer one
is a smart filter. The conjugated effect of contact electrification, and
electrostatic induction of the proposed smart mask are effective in
inactivating the span of virus-ladden aerosols in a bidirectional way. Five
pairs of triboseries fabrics i.e. nylon - polyester, cotton - polyester,
poly(methyl methacrylate) - PVDF, lylon - PVDF and polypropylene - polyester
have been optimized in this study in terms of their effective tribo-electric
charge densities as 83.13, 211.48, 38.62, 69 and 74.25 nC/m2, respectively.
This smart mask can be used by a wide range of people because of its simple
mechanism, self-driven (harvesting mechanical energy from daily activities,
e.g. breathing, talking, or other facial movements functionalities, and
effective filtration efficiency and thus, it is expected to be potentially
beneficial to slow down the devastating impact of COVID-19.

introduced and analyzed. For the deterministic, mean-field model, the basic
reproductive number $R_0$ determines their global dynamics. If $R_0\le 1$, then
the frequency of infected individuals asymptotically converges to zero. If
$R_0>1$, then the infectious class uniformly persists for all time; conditions
for a globally stable, endemic equilibrium are given. In contrast, the
infection goes extinct in finite time with probability one in the stochastic
models for all $R_0$ values. To understand the length of the transient prior to
extinction as well as the behavior of the transients, the quasi-stationary
distributions and the associated mean time to extinction are analyzed using
large deviation methods. When $R_0>1$, these mean times to extinction are shown
to increase exponentially with the population size $N$. Moreover, as $N$
approaches $\infty$, the quasi-stationary distributions are supported by a
compact set bounded away from extinction; sufficient conditions for convergence
to a Dirac measure at the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic model are
also given. In contrast, when $R_0<1$, the mean times to extinction are bounded
above $1/(1-\alpha)$ where $\alpha<1$ is the geometric rate of decrease of the
infection when rare; as $N$ approaches $\infty$, the quasi-stationary

the deterministic model. For several special cases, explicit formulas for
approximating the quasi-stationary distribution and the associated mean

shrinking interface problem. When the upper plate of the cell is lifted
perpendicularly at a prescribed speed, the exterior less viscous fluid
penetrates the interior more viscous fluid, which generates complex,
time-dependent interfacial patterns through the Saffman-Taylor instability. The
pattern formation process sensitively depends on the lifting speed and is still
not fully understood. For some lifting speeds, such as linear or exponential
speed, the instability is transient and the interface eventually shrinks as a
circle. However, linear stability analysis suggests there exist shape invariant
shrinking patterns if the gap $b(t)$ is increased more rapidly: $\displaystyle
b(t)=\left(1-\frac{7}{2}\tau \mathcal{C} t\right)^{-{2}/{7}}$, where $\tau$ is
the surface tension and $\mathcal{C}$ is a function of the interface
perturbation mode $k$. Here, we use a spectrally accurate boundary integral
method together with an efficient time adaptive rescaling scheme, which for the
first time makes it possible to explore the nonlinear limiting dynamical
behavior of a vanishing interface. When the gap is increased at a constant
rate, our numerical results quantitatively agree with experimental observations
(Nase et al., Phys. Fluids, vol. 23, 2011, pp. 123101). When we use the shape
invariant gap $b(t)$, our nonlinear results reveal the existence of $k$-fold
dominant, one-dimensional, web-like networks, where the fractal dimension is
reduced to almost one at late times. We conclude by constructing a morphology
diagram for pattern selection that relates the dominant mode $k$ of the
vanishing interface and the control parameter $\mathcal{C}$.

where $\alpha\beta=1$ and $i=\sqrt{-1}$, is obtained in the course of
evaluating an integral involving the Riemann $\Xi$-function. It is a
two-variable generalization of a transformation found on page $220$ of
Ramanujan's Lost Notebook. This modular relation involves a surprising
generalization of the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s, a)$, which we denote by
$\zeta_w(s, a)$. While $\zeta_w(s, 1)$ is essentially a product of confluent
hypergeometric function and the Riemann zeta function, $\zeta_w(s, a)$ for
$0<a<1$ is an interesting new special function. We show that $\zeta_w(s, a)$
satisfies a beautiful theory generalizing that of $\zeta(s, a)$ albeit the
properties of $\zeta_w(s, a)$ are much harder to derive than those of $\zeta(s,
a)$. In particular, it is shown that for $0<a<1$ and $w\in\mathbb{C}$,
$\zeta_w(s, a)$ can be analytically continued to Re$(s)>-1$ except for a simple
pole at $s=1$. This is done by obtaining a generalization of Hermite's formula
in the context of $\zeta_w(s, a)$. The theory of functions reciprocal in the
kernel $\sin(\pi z) J_{2 z}(2 \sqrt{xt}) -\cos(\pi z) L_{2 z}(2 \sqrt{xt})$,
where $L_{z}(x)=-\frac{2}{\pi}K_{z}(x)-Y_{z}(x)$ and $J_{z}(x), Y_{z}(x)$ and
$K_{z}(x)$ are the Bessel functions, is worked out. So is the theory of a new
generalization of $K_{z}(x)$, namely, ${}_1K_{z,w}(x)$. Both these theories as

for a common range of excitation temperatures and column densities (Tex > 6 K,
N > 1e14 - 1e15 cm-2). Contrary to the general assumptions, the different CO
isotopologues have distinct excitation temperatures, and the line intensity
ratios between different isotopologues do not accurately reflect the column
density ratios. We find mean fractional abundances that are consistent with
previous determinations towards other molecular clouds. However, significant
local deviations are inferred, not only in regions exposed to UV radiation
field but also in shielded regions. These deviations result from the
competition between selective photodissociation, chemical fractionation, and
depletion on grain surfaces. We observe that the velocity dispersion of the
C18O emission is 10% smaller than that of 13CO. The substantial gain resulting
from the simultaneous analysis of two different rotational transitions of the

structure of the signal measured by an AVS, we show that the covariance matrix
of all the received signals from the array admits a natural low-rank 4-way

raw data, our estimate arises from the unique parametric Canonical Polyadic
Decomposition (CPD) of the observations' Second-Order Statistics (SOSs) tensor.
By exploiting results from fundamental statistics and the recently re-emerging
tensor theory, we derive a consistent blind CPD-based DOAs estimate without
prior assumptions on the array configuration. We show that this estimate is a
solution to an equivalent approximate joint diagonalization problem, and
propose an ad-hoc iterative solution. Additionally, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao
lower bound for Gaussian signals, and use it to derive the iterative Fisher
scoring algorithm for the computation of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE)
in this particular signal model. We then show that the MLE for the Gaussian
model can in fact be used to obtain improved DOAs estimates for non-Gaussian
signals as well (under mild conditions), which are optimal under the
Kullback-Leibler divergence covariance fitting criterion, harnessing additional
information encapsulated in the SOSs. Our analytical results are corroborated

considerable improved accuracy w.r.t. a competing state-of-the-art blind

food, agricultural, and pharmaceutical applications. Traditionally, double
emulsifications rely on the presence of both oil-soluble and water-soluble
surfactants or external stimuli responsive materials and require sequential
droplet formation settings or unique fluidic designs. We report on unusual
phenomenon where double emulsions are spontaneously formed as soon an aqueous
nanoparticle dispersion is placed in contact with an oleic micellar solution.
Nanoscale water droplets nucleate in oil in the form of swollen micelles.
Nanoparticles form a water-shell encapsulating the saturated oil phase with
swollen micelles over time. Remarkably, we find that the gradual
surface-activation of nanoparticles is key in self-double emulsification and
controlling the emulsion intensity. We build on this new discovery and design a
novel system for double emulsion formation. This approach is a scalable
self-sequential strategy for preparing core-shell double emulsions that
disperses nanoparticles in the opposite phase by employing micelles as
transport vehicles. Incorporating nanoparticles into spontaneous emulsification
systems opens novel routes for designing emulsion-based materials.

actively developed have achieved significant success in areas such as molecule
design. However, many real-world problems involve temporal graphs whose
topology and attribute values evolve dynamically over time, including important
applications such as protein folding, human mobility networks, and social
network growth. As yet, deep generative models for temporal graphs are not yet
well understood and existing techniques for static graphs are not adequate for
temporal graphs since they cannot 1) encode and decode continuously-varying
graph topology chronologically, 2) enforce validity via temporal constraints,
or 3) ensure efficiency for information-lossless temporal resolution. To
address these challenges, we propose a new model, called ``Temporal Graph
Generative Adversarial Network'' (TG-GAN) for continuous-time temporal graph
generation, by modeling the deep generative process for truncated temporal
random walks and their compositions. Specifically, we first propose a novel
temporal graph generator that jointly model truncated edge sequences, time
budgets, and node attributes, with novel activation functions that enforce
temporal validity constraints under recurrent architecture. In addition, a new
temporal graph discriminator is proposed, which combines time and node encoding
operations over a recurrent architecture to distinguish the generated sequences
from the real ones sampled by a newly-developed truncated temporal random walk
sampler. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate TG-GAN significantly outperforms the comparison methods in
efficiency and effectiveness.

formation of natural satellites of Jupiter and Saturn within the framework of
this newly outlined picture. We begin by considering the long-term evolution of
solid material, and demonstrate that the circumplanetary disk can act as a
global dust trap, where $s_{\bullet}\sim0.1-10\,$mm grains achieve a
hydrodynamical equilibrium, facilitated by a balance between radial updraft and
aerodynamic drag. This process leads to a gradual increase in the system's
metallicity, and eventually culminates in the gravitational fragmentation of
the outer regions of the solid sub-disk into $\mathcal{R}\sim100\,$km
satellitesimals. Subsequently, satellite conglomeration ensues via pairwise
collisions, but is terminated when disk-driven orbital migration removes the
growing objects from the satellitesimal feeding zone. The resulting satellite
formation cycle can repeat multiple times, until it is brought to an end by
photo-evaporation of the parent nebula. Numerical simulations of the envisioned
formation scenario yield satisfactory agreement between our model and the known
properties of the Jovian and Saturnian moons.

the system to generalize to devices without cameras. To this end, we
incorporate face embeddings extracted from a pretrained model for face

The first are the fluctuations of the time derivative a free massive scalar
field operator, which has been averaged over finite regions of space and time.
These fluctuations obey a Gaussian probability distribution. A sufficiently
large fluctuation is assumed to produce an effect analogous to a classical
initial field velocity, which can cause a finite region to fly over the barrier
separating the meta-stable state from the stable vacuum state. Here we find a
contribution to the decay rate which is comparable to the decay rate by quantum
tunneling, as computed in an instanton approximation. This result is consistent
with those of other authors. We next consider the effects of the fluctuations
of operators which are quadratic in the time derivative of the free scalar
field. The quadratic operator is also averaged over finite regions of space and
of time. Now the probability distribution for the averaged operator falls more
slowly than an exponential function, allowing for the possibility of very large
fluctuations. We find a contribution to the decay rate which is much larger
than those coming from either quantum tunneling or linear field fluctuations,
and hence appears to be the dominant decay mechanism.

have been adopted in this work are: 1) the use of discretization-based schemes
to approximate spatio-temporal partial derivatives and 2) the use of iterative
algorithms to solve linearized PDEs in their discrete form. In the presence of
highly non-linear, coupled PDE solutions, these strategies can be very
important in achieving good accuracy, better stability and faster convergence.
Our ML-solver, DiscretizationNet, employs a generative CNN-based

During training, the discretization schemes are implemented inside the
computational graph to enable faster GPU computation of PDE residuals, which
are used to update network weights that result into converged solutions. A

compiler optimizations on non-semantic properties with security implications.
In particular, little is currently known about how code generation and
optimization decisions made by the compiler affect the availability and utility
of reusable code segments called gadgets required for implementing code reuse
attack methods such as return-oriented programming.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap through a study of the impacts of compiler
optimization on code reuse gadget sets. We analyze and compare 1,187 variants
of 20 different benchmark programs built with two production compilers (GCC and
Clang) to determine how their optimization behaviors affect the code reuse
gadget sets present in program variants with respect to both quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Our study exposes an important and unexpected problem;
compiler optimizations introduce new gadgets at a high rate and produce code
containing gadget sets that are generally more useful to an attacker than those
in unoptimized code. Using differential binary analysis, we identify several
undesirable behaviors at the root of this phenomenon. In turn, we propose and
evaluate several strategies to mitigate these behaviors. In particular, we show
that post-production binary recompilation can effectively mitigate these
behaviors with negligible performance impacts, resulting in optimized code with
significantly smaller and less useful gadget sets.

Moore's Law, merely scaling against these attacks is no longer economically

Software-defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization in security

the sequence in which traffic passes through these functions. In this work, we
make a case for the need to take this ordering into account by showing its
impact. We then propose a reordering framework and analyze what aspects are
necessary for modeling security service function chains and making decisions

classification setting, where the classification is part of a game in which
players can modify their features to attain a favorable classification outcome
(while incurring some cost). Previously, the problem has been considered from a
learning-theoretic perspective and from the algorithmic fairness perspective.
Our main contributions include 1. Showing that if the objective is to maximize
the efficiency of the classification process (defined as the accuracy of the
outcome minus the sunk cost of the qualified players manipulating their
features to gain a better outcome), then using randomized classifiers (that is,
ones where the probability of a given feature vector to be accepted by the
classifier is strictly between 0 and 1) is necessary. 2. Showing that in many
natural cases, the imposed optimal solution (in terms of efficiency) has the
structure where players never change their feature vectors (the randomized
classifier is structured in a way, such that the gain in the probability of
being classified as a 1 does not justify the expense of changing one's
features). 3. Observing that the randomized classification is not a stable
best-response from the classifier's viewpoint, and that the classifier doesn't
benefit from randomized classifiers without creating instability in the system.
4. Showing that in some cases, a noisier signal leads to better equilibria
outcomes -- improving both accuracy and fairness when more than one
subpopulation with different feature adjustment costs are involved. This is
interesting from a policy perspective, since it is hard to force institutions
to stick to a particular randomized classification strategy (especially in a
context of a market with multiple classifiers), but it is possible to alter the
information environment to make the feature signals inherently noisier.

This gap is attributed to the lack of awareness about the disease and its

frequently used to create awareness about major events, including COVID-19. In
this paper, we use Twitter to characterize public awareness regarding COVID-19
by analyzing the information flow in the most affected countries. Towards that,
we collect more than 46K trends and 622 Million tweets from the top twenty most
affected countries to examine 1) the temporal evolution of COVID-19 related

the user sentiment towards preventive measures. Our results show that countries
with a lower pandemic spread generated a higher volume of trends and tweets to
expedite the information flow and contribute to public awareness. We also
observed that in those countries, the COVID-19 related trends were generated
before the sharp increase in the number of cases, indicating a preemptive
attempt to notify users about the potential threat. Finally, we noticed that in
countries with a lower spread, users had a positive sentiment towards COVID-19
preventive measures. Our measurements and analysis show that effective social

head level with limited information of demand forecast errors for an extended
period simulation. The objective is to determine the optimal feedback decisions
of network-connected components, such as nominal pump schedules and tank head
levels and reserve policies, which specify device reactions to forecast errors
for accommodation of fluctuating water demand. Instead of assuming the
uncertainties across the water network are generated by a prescribed certain
distribution, we consider ambiguity sets of distributions centered at an
empirical distribution, which is based directly on a finite training data set.
We use a distance-based ambiguity set with the Wasserstein metric to quantify
the distance between the real unknown data-generating distribution and the
empirical distribution. This allows our multi-period OWF framework to trade off
system performance and inherent sampling errors in the training dataset. Case
studies on a three-tank water distribution network systematically illustrate
the tradeoff between pump operational cost, risks of constraint violation, and

intelligence. During the last decade {\em stream reasoning} has emerged as a
research area within the AI-community with many potential applications. In
fact, the increased availability of streaming data via services like Google and
Facebook has raised the need for reasoning engines coping with data that
changes at high rate. Recently, the rule-based formalism {\em LARS} for
non-monotonic stream reasoning under the answer set semantics has been
introduced. Syntactically, LARS programs are logic programs with negation
incorporating operators for temporal reasoning, most notably {\em window
operators} for selecting relevant time points. Unfortunately, by preselecting
{\em fixed} intervals for the semantic evaluation of programs, the rigid
semantics of LARS programs is not flexible enough to {\em constructively} cope
with rapidly changing data dependencies. Moreover, we show that defining the
answer set semantics of LARS in terms of FLP reducts leads to undesirable
circular justifications similar to other ASP extensions. This paper fixes all
of the aforementioned shortcomings of LARS. More precisely, we contribute to
the foundations of stream reasoning by providing an operational fixed point
semantics for a fully flexible variant of LARS and we show that our semantics
is sound and constructive in the sense that answer sets are derivable bottom-up
and free of circular justifications.

  Networks",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sparse signals, encountered in many wireless and signal acquisition
applications, can be acquired via compressed sensing (CS) to reduce
computations and transmissions, crucial for resource-limited devices, e.g.,
wireless sensors. Since the information signals are often continuous-valued,
digital communication of compressive measurements requires quantization. In
such a quantized compressed sensing (QCS) context, we address remote
acquisition of a sparse source through vector quantized noisy compressive
measurements. We propose a deep encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of an
encoder deep neural network (DNN), a quantizer, and a decoder DNN, that
realizes low-complexity vector quantization aiming at minimizing the
mean-square error of the signal reconstruction for a given quantization rate.
We devise a supervised learning method using stochastic gradient descent and
backpropagation to train the system blocks. Strategies to overcome the
vanishing gradient problem are proposed. Simulation results show that the
proposed non-iterative DNN-based QCS method achieves higher rate-distortion
performance with lower algorithm complexity as compared to standard QCS
methods, conducive to delay-sensitive applications with large-scale signals.

buried at the bottom of a granular column. The intruder starts to move out of
the granular bed once the pulling force reaches a critical value, leading to
material failure. The failure point is found to depend on the diameter of the
granular column, pointing out the importance of particle-wall interaction in
determining the material response. Discrete element simulations show that prior
to failure, the contact network is essentially static, with only minor
rearrangements of the particles. However, the force network, which includes not
only the contact information, but also the information about the interaction
strength, undergoes a nontrivial evolution. An initial insight is reached by
considering the relative magnitudes of normal and tangential forces between the
particles, and in particular the proportion of contacts that reach Coulomb
threshold. More detailed understanding of the processes leading to failure is
reached by the analysis of both spatial and temporal properties of the force
network using the tools of persistent homology. We find that the forces between
the particles undergo intermittent temporal variations ahead of the failure. In
addition to this temporal intermittency, the response of the force network is
found to be spatially dependent and influenced by proximity to the intruder.
Furthermore, the response is modified significantly by the interaction
strength, with the relevant measures describing the response showing differing
behavior for the contacts characterized by large interaction forces.

symmetries in gauge-gravity duality and explain how their breaking describes

nonlocal objects in the gravitational theory -- in gauge-gravity duality these
are the strings and branes of the bulk theory -- giving an alternative way to

Problem (FLP) in which requests ask for different commodities out of a finite
set $S$ of commodities. Ravi and Sinha (SODA'04) introduced the model as the
Multi-Commodity Facility Location Problem (MFLP) and considered it an offline
optimization problem. The model itself is similar to the FLP: i.e., requests
are located at points of a finite metric space and the task of an algorithm is
to construct facilities and assign requests to facilities while minimizing the
construction cost and the sum over all assignment distances. In addition,
requests and facilities are heterogeneous; they request or offer multiple
commodities out of $S$. A request has to be connected to a set of facilities
jointly offering the commodities demanded by it. In comparison to the FLP, an
algorithm has to decide not only if and where to place facilities, but also
which commodities to offer at each.
  To the best of our knowledge we are the first to study the problem in its
online variant in which requests, their positions and their commodities are not
known beforehand but revealed over time. We present results regarding the
competitive ratio. On the one hand, we show that heterogeneity influences the
competitive ratio by developing a lower bound on the competitive ratio for any
randomized online algorithm of $\Omega(\sqrt{|S|}+\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$
that already holds for simple line metrics. Here, $n$ is the number of
requests. On the other side, we establish a deterministic
$O(\sqrt{|S|}\cdot\log n)$-competitive algorithm and a randomized
$O(\sqrt{|S|}\cdot\frac{\log n}{\log\log n})$-competitive algorithm. Further,
we show that when considering a more special class of cost functions for the
construction cost of a facility, the competitive ratio decreases given by our
deterministic algorithm depending on the function.

in nanomechanical systems offer a tremendous advantage for the observation of
EdH torques in particular. At radio frequencies, the EdH effect can become
comparable to or even exceed in magnitude conventional cross-product magnetic
torques. In addition, the RF-EdH torque is expected to be phase-shifted by 90

in quasi-static equilibrium, enabling separation in quadratures when both
sources of torque are operative. Radio frequency EdH measurements are
demonstrated through the full hysteresis range of micrometer scale,

observed in the vortex state at low bias field. Barkhausen-like features emerge
in the in-plane EdH torque at higher fields in the vortex state, revealing
magnetic disorder too weak to be visible through the in-plane cross-product

pulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution and decay
of their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray
emission, but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We
report the discovery of bright, persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE
J1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar
behavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time
periods following a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were
detected outside of a flaring state. They are less energetic and display
temporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events previously
observed from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts.
Our high frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out
simultaneously with the X-ray observations, demonstrate that the relative
alignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational timescales.
No correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the
X-ray and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency
structure, which was not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9

few long desynchronizations even if the average synchrony level is the same. In
this study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the
effects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of
synchronization in a simple model. We employed a small network of
conductance-based model neurons that were connected via excitatory plastic
synapses. The dynamics of this network was subjected to the time-series
analysis methods used in prior experimental studies. We found that STDP could
alter the synchronized dynamics in the network in several ways, depending on
the time scale that plasticity acts on. However, in general, the action of STDP
in the simple network considered here is to promote dynamics with short
desynchronizations (i.e. dynamics reminiscent of that observed in experimental

the activity-dependent adjustment of synaptic strength in such a way as to
facilitate experimentally observed short desynchronizations in the

inversion symmetry, creates a large charge dipole and average electric field

ferrimagnet. The MAE is reduced such that its sign can be switched with
realistic strain, and the large SOC gives rise to an intrinsic voltage
controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA). A slab terminated on both faces with Cr

preferred, the magnitude of the MAE remains large, similar to that of the bulk,

precise three-dimensional measuring instruments to measure the end pose, which
is not only expensive due to the high cost of the measuring instruments but
also not applicable to all manipulators. Another calibration method uses a
camera, but the system error caused by the camera's parameters affects the
calibration accuracy of the kinematics of the robot arm. Therefore, this paper
proposes a method for calibrating the geometric parameters of a kinematic model
of a manipulator based on monocular vision. Firstly, the classic
Denavit-Hartenberg(D-H) modeling method is used to establish the kinematic
parameters of the manipulator. Secondly, nonlinear optimization and parameter
compensation are performed. The three-dimensional positions of the feature
points of the calibration plate under each manipulator attitude corresponding
to the actual kinematic model and the classic D-H kinematic model are mapped
into the pixel coordinate system, and the sum of Euclidean distance errors of
the pixel coordinates of the two is used as the objective function to be
optimized. The experimental results show that the pixel deviation of the end
pose corresponding to the optimized D-H kinematic model proposed in this paper
and the end pose corresponding to the actual kinematic model in the pixel
coordinate system is 0.99 pixels. Compared with the 7.9 deviation pixels
between the pixel coordinates calculated by the classic D-H kinematic model and
the actual pixel coordinates, the deviation is reduced by nearly 7 pixels for
an 87% reduction in error. Therefore, the proposed method can effectively avoid
system errors caused by camera parameters in visual calibration, can improve
the absolute positioning accuracy of the end of the robotic arm, and has good

applications. In this paper, SS of sub-60 mV/dec was firstly observed in
InAlN/GaN high electron mobility transistors (HMETs): an average SS of 30
mV/dec over three orders of magnitude in drain-source (Ids) and a minimum
point-by-point SS of 15 mV/dec were achieved in the InAlN/GaN HEMTs with gate
length (Lg) of 40 nm. It is found that SS decreases with drain-source voltage
(Vds) as well as Lg, and falls below 60 mV/dec when Lg < 100 nm. The decrease
of SS as the device dimension scales down is attributed to the tunneling of
high energy electrons from channel to the surface. The SS decreasing with the
nanoscale gate length shows the great potential of the InAlN/GaN HEMTs to be
applied in future logic switches.

this work, perform a detailed study in which we dissect whether or not the use

what we call ""document filter"". The ""document filter"" protocol is supposed to
be used as a preprocessing technique, such a way that all the data taken from
fragments of the same document must be placed either into the training or into
the test set. The rationale behind it, is that the classifier must capture the
features from the writer itself, and not features regarding other
particularities which could affect the writing in a specific document (i.e.
emotional state of the writer, pen used, paper type, and etc.). By analyzing
the literature, one can find several works dealing the writer identification
problem. However, the performance of the writer identification systems must be
evaluated also taking into account the occurrence of writer volunteers who
contributed with a single sample during the creation of the manuscript
databases. To address the open issue investigated here, a comprehensive set of
experiments was performed on the IAM, BFL and CVL databases. They have shown
that, in the most extreme case, the recognition rate obtained using the

is very natural to ask - what happens if we send a signal towards a corpuscular

existence of a surface located at an effective radius $R=R_s(1+\epsilon)$
slightly larger than the Schwarzschild radius $R_s,$ where $\epsilon=1/N$ and
$N$ is the number of gravitons composing the system. Consequently, the
reflectivity of the object can be non-zero and, indeed, we find that incoming
waves with energies comparable to the Hawking temperature can have a
probability of backscattering of order one. Thus, modes can be trapped between
the two potential barriers located at the photon sphere and at the surface of a
corpuscular black hole, and periodic echoes can be produced. The time delay of
echoes turns out to be of the same order of the scrambling time, i.e., in units
of Planck length it reads $\sqrt{N}\,{\rm log}\,N.$ We also show that the

possible by breaking a part of diffeomorphism invariance, and thus is
consistent with the Lovelock theorem. In the present paper, we study
cosmological implications of the theory in the presence of a perfect fluid and
clarify the similarities and differences between the results obtained from the
consistent $4$-dimensional theory and those from the previously considered,
naive (and inconsistent) $D\rightarrow 4$ limit. Studying the linear

relation of tensor modes which plays significant roles at small scales and
makes the theory different than not only general relativity but also many other
modified gravity theories as well as the naive (and inconsistent) $D\to 4$

considered to be the primary flow, whereas the linear cross shear flow is a
secondary flow with amplitude $10\%$ of the primary flow. To study the effects
of elasticity and plasticity of the carrying fluid on the sphere drag as well
as the flow dynamics, the fluid is modeled using the elastovisco-plastic (EVP)

a sphere settling in a sheared yield stress fluid is reduced significantly as
compared to an otherwise quiescent fluid. More importantly, the sphere drag in
the presence of a secondary cross shear flow cannot be derived from the pure
sedimentation drag law owing to the non-linear coupling between the simple
shear flow and the uniform flow. Finally, we show that the drag on the sphere
settling in a sheared yield-stress fluid is reduced at higher material
elasticity mainly due to the form and viscous drag reduction.

detect human intentions using brain signals in the real world. However, the
electroencephalography (EEG) signals are distorted owing to the artifacts such
as walking and head movement, so brain signals may be large in amplitude rather
than desired EEG signals. Due to these artifacts, detecting accurately human
intention in the mobile environment is challenging. In this paper, we proposed
the reconstruction framework based on generative adversarial networks using the
event-related potentials (ERP) during walking. We used a pre-trained
convolutional encoder to represent latent variables and reconstructed ERP
through the generative model which shape similar to the opposite of encoder.
Finally, the ERP was classified using the discriminative model to demonstrate
the validity of our proposed framework. As a result, the reconstructed signals
had important components such as N200 and P300 similar to ERP during standing.
The accuracy of reconstructed EEG was similar to raw noisy EEG signals during
walking. The signal-to-noise ratio of reconstructed EEG was significantly
increased as 1.3. The loss of the generative model was 0.6301, which is
comparatively low, which means training generative model had high performance.
The reconstructed ERP consequentially showed an improvement in classification
performance during walking through the effects of noise reduction. The proposed
framework could help recognize human intention based on the brain-machine
interface even in the mobile environment.

gender prediction demonstrate good accuracies, but usually extract individual
functional connections instead of connectivity patterns in the whole

multiple scales of brain FC with deep learning, which can extract full FC
patterns as features. We further develop the understanding of the feature
extraction mechanism in deep neural network (DNN) and propose a DNN feature
ranking method to extract the highly important features based on their

destruction of crystal structures was observed at lower temperatures beyond
yield point. While the higher temperature and lower strain rate have similar
effects on mechanical properties. The correlated influences of time and
temperature in the microscopic structures are more complicated. The evolution
of microscopic characteristics such as the orientation parameter, the bond
length, and the content of trans-trans conformation were calculated from the

polymer chains. Higher temperature on one hand makes the chains more flexible,
while on the other hand shortens the relaxation time of polymers. It is the

exhibit critical transaction, which are closely related to the yield point. A

prompt information to make the resulting E2E model more tailored for the MD
task. On the other hand, we adopt two MD decision methods so as to better
cooperate with the proposed framework: 1) decision-making based on a
recognition confidence measure or 2) simply based on speech recognition
results. A series of Mandarin MD experiments demonstrate that our approach not
only simplifies the processing pipeline of existing hybrid DNN-HMM systems but
also brings about systematic and substantial performance improvements.
Furthermore, input augmentation with text prompts seems to hold excellent

border of magnetism, featuring a superconducting order parameter that changes
sign in momentum space. Detection of such a sign-change is experimentally
challenging, since most probes are not phase-sensitive. The observation of a
spin resonance mode (SRM) from inelastic neutron scattering is often seen as
strong phase-sensitive evidence for a sign-changing superconducting order
parameter, by assuming the SRM is a spin-excitonic bound state. Here, we show
that for the heavy fermion superconductor CeCoIn$_5$, its SRM defies
expectations for a spin-excitonic bound state, and is not a manifestation of
sign-changing superconductivity. Instead, the SRM in CeCoIn$_5$ likely arises
from a reduction of damping to a magnon-like mode in the superconducting state,
due to its proximity to magnetic quantum criticality. Our findings emphasize
the need for more stringent tests of whether SRMs are spin-excitonic, when
using their presence to evidence sign-changing superconductivity.

three-dimensional (3D) structures from amino acid sequences now present a
unique opportunity to decipher the interrelationships between proteins. This
task entails--but is not equivalent to--a problem of 3D structure comparison
and classification. Historically, protein domain classification has been a
largely manual and subjective activity, relying upon various heuristics.
Databases such as CATH represent significant steps towards a more systematic
(and automatable) approach, yet there still remains much room for the
development of more scalable and quantitative classification methods, grounded
in machine learning. We suspect that re-examining these relationships via a
Deep Learning (DL) approach may entail a large-scale restructuring of
classification schemes, improved with respect to the interpretability of
distant relationships between proteins. Here, we describe our training of DL
models on protein domain structures (and their associated physicochemical
properties) in order to evaluate classification properties at CATH's
""homologous superfamily"" (SF) level. To achieve this, we have devised and
applied an extension of image-classification methods and image segmentation
techniques, utilizing a convolutional autoencoder model architecture. Our DL
architecture allows models to learn structural features that, in a sense,
'define' different homologous SFs. We evaluate and quantify pairwise
'distances' between SFs by building one model per SF and comparing the loss
functions of the models. Hierarchical clustering on these distance matrices
provides a new view of protein interrelationships--a view that extends beyond
simple structural/geometric similarity, and towards the realm of
structure/function properties.

as generalizations of the Cram\'{e}r--Rao inequality for chemical reaction
networks described by rate equations, where unnormalized concentration

hold true for damped oscillatory reaction networks and systems where the total

We also formulate a trade-off relation between speed and time on a manifold of

network architecture called the voice transformer network (VTN). The original
VTN was designed to learn only a mapping of speech feature sequences from one
speaker to another. The main idea we propose is an extension of the original
VTN that can simultaneously learn mappings among multiple speakers. This
extension called the many-to-many VTN makes it able to fully use available
training data collected from multiple speakers by capturing common latent
features that can be shared across different speakers. It also allows us to
introduce a training loss called the identity mapping loss to ensure that the
input feature sequence will remain unchanged when the source and target speaker
indices are the same. Using this particular loss for model training has been
found to be extremely effective in improving the performance of the model at
test time. We conducted speaker identity conversion experiments and found that
our model obtained higher sound quality and speaker similarity than baseline
methods. We also found that our model, with a slight modification to its

broad and large peak just below the kink temperature of magnetization and a
sharp decrease at lower temperatures, accompanied by an anomaly of the

of the dielectric peak by more than 50 K. Interestingly, the dielectric peak
exhibits a negative magnetic-field effect. For all measured samples, the
low-temperature variation of the dielectric constant can be qualitatively
explained based on the Maxwell-Wagner (MW) model that describes a system
composed of grain boundaries and semiconducting grains. However, the observed
peak and its negative magneto-capacitance effect at high temperatures cannot be
reproduced by a combination of the MW model and magnetoresistance effect. The

Hilbert spaces (RKHS). A conventional assumption in the existing research is
that empirical training data do not contain any noise but this may not be
satisfied in some practical circumstances. Consequently the existing
convergence results do not provide a guarantee as to whether empirical risks
based on empirical data are reliable or not when the data contain some noise.
In this paper, we fill out the gap in a few steps. First, we derive moderate
sufficient conditions under which the expected risk changes stably
(continuously) against small perturbation of the probability distribution of
the underlying random variables and demonstrate how the cost function and
kernel affect the stability. Second, we examine the difference between laws of
the statistical estimators of the expected optimal loss based on pure data and
contaminated data using Prokhorov metric and Kantorovich metric and derive some
qualitative and quantitative statistical robustness results. Third, we identify
appropriate metrics under which the statistical estimators are uniformly
asymptotically consistent. These results provide theoretical grounding for
analysing asymptotic convergence and examining reliability of the statistical
estimators in a number of well-known machine learning models.

reliably estimate the IFR without any specific knowledge about the degree to

partial identifiability approach, formulating clearly where deliberate prior
assumptions can be made and presenting a Bayesian model which pools information
from different samples. When the model is fit to European data obtained from

repetitive action. Existing deep learning methods assume repetitive actions are
performed in a fixed time-scale, which is invalid for the complex repetitive
actions in real life. In this paper, we tailor a context-aware and
scale-insensitive framework, to tackle the challenges in repetition counting
caused by the unknown and diverse cycle-lengths. Our approach combines two key
insights: (1) Cycle lengths from different actions are unpredictable that
require large-scale searching, but, once a coarse cycle length is determined,
the variety between repetitions can be overcome by regression. (2) Determining
the cycle length cannot only rely on a short fragment of video but a contextual
understanding. The first point is implemented by a coarse-to-fine cycle
refinement method. It avoids the heavy computation of exhaustively searching
all the cycle lengths in the video, and, instead, it propagates the coarse
prediction for further refinement in a hierarchical manner. We secondly propose
a bidirectional cycle length estimation method for a context-aware prediction.
It is a regression network that takes two consecutive coarse cycles as input,
and predicts the locations of the previous and next repetitive cycles. To
benefit the training and evaluation of temporal repetition counting area, we
construct a new and largest benchmark, which contains 526 videos with diverse
repetitive actions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network
trained on a single dataset outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several
benchmarks, indicating that the proposed framework is general enough to capture
repetition patterns across domains.

secure and practical gradient tree boosting models (e.g., XGB) in literature.
In this paper, we aim to build large-scale secure XGB under vertically
federated learning setting. We guarantee data privacy from three aspects.
Specifically, (i) we employ secure multi-party computation techniques to avoid
leaking intermediate information during training, (ii) we store the output
model in a distributed manner in order to minimize information release, and
(iii) we provide a novel algorithm for secure XGB predict with the distributed
model. Furthermore, by proposing secure permutation protocols, we can improve
the training efficiency and make the framework scale to large dataset. We
conduct extensive experiments on both public datasets and real-world datasets,
and the results demonstrate that our proposed XGB models provide not only
competitive accuracy but also practical performance.

quantization schemes can improve their stability and accuracy in quantizing
bandlimited signals. However, adaptive quantization has only been designed for
one-dimensional signals. The contribution of this paper is two-fold: i). we
propose the first family of two-dimensional adaptive quantization schemes that
maintain the same mathematical and practical merits as their one-dimensional
counterparts, and ii). we show that both the traditional 1-dimensional and the
new 2-dimensional quantization schemes can effectively quantize signals with
jump discontinuities. These results immediately enable the usage of adaptive
quantization on images. Under mild conditions, we show that the adaptivity is
able to reduce the reconstruction error of images from the presently best
$O(\sqrt P)$ to the much smaller $O(\sqrt s)$, where $s$ is the number of jump
discontinuities in the image and $P$ ($P\gg s$) is the total number of samples.
This $\sqrt{P/s}$-fold error reduction is achieved via applying a total
variation norm regularized decoder, whose formulation is inspired by the
mathematical super-resolution theory in the field of compressed sensing.
Compared to the super-resolution setting, our error reduction is achieved
without requiring adjacent spikes/discontinuities to be well-separated, which
ensures its broad scope of application.
  We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of the new scheme on medical and
natural images. We observe that for images with small pixel intensity values,
the new method can significantly increase image quality over the

between sequences, and to predict biomolecular structure and function. This is
typically addressed through profile models, which capture
position-specificities like conservation in sequences, but assume an
independent evolution of different positions. Over the last years, it has been

computing and/or storage cost of DNNs. However, the trade-off between the
quantization bitwidth and final accuracy is complex and non-convex, which makes
it difficult to be optimized directly. Minimizing direct quantization loss
(DQL) of the coefficient data is an effective local optimization method, but
previous works often neglect the accurate control of the DQL, resulting in a
higher loss of the final DNN model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel
metric called Vector Loss. Based on this new metric, we develop a new
quantization solution called VecQ, which can guarantee minimal direct
quantization loss and better model accuracy. In addition, in order to speed up
the proposed quantization process during model training, we accelerate the
quantization process with a parameterized probability estimation method and
template-based derivation calculation. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on
MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet, IMDB movie review and THUCNews text data sets with
numerical DNN models. The results demonstrate that our proposed quantization
solution is more accurate and effective than the state-of-the-art approaches
yet with more flexible bitwidth support. Moreover, the evaluation of our
quantized models on Saliency Object Detection (SOD) tasks maintains comparable
feature extraction quality with up to 16$\times$ weight size reduction.

health institutions around the world. Contact tracing is an essential tool to
change the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. Manual contact tracing of Covid-19
cases has significant challenges that limit the ability of public health
authorities to minimize community infections. Personalized peer-to-peer contact
tracing through the use of mobile apps has the potential to shift the paradigm.
Some countries have deployed centralized tracking systems, but more
privacy-protecting decentralized systems offer much of the same benefit without
concentrating data in the hands of a state authority or for-profit
corporations. Machine learning methods can circumvent some of the limitations
of standard digital tracing by incorporating many clues and their uncertainty
into a more graded and precise estimation of infection risk. The estimated risk
can provide early risk awareness, personalized recommendations and relevant
information to the user. Finally, non-identifying risk data can inform
epidemiological models trained jointly with the machine learning predictor.
These models can provide statistical evidence for the importance of factors
involved in disease transmission. They can also be used to monitor, evaluate
and optimize health policy and (de)confinement scenarios according to medical
and economic productivity indicators. However, such a strategy based on mobile
apps and machine learning should proactively mitigate potential ethical and
privacy risks, which could have substantial impacts on society (not only
impacts on health but also impacts such as stigmatization and abuse of personal
data). Here, we present an overview of the rationale, design, ethical
considerations and privacy strategy of `COVI,' a Covid-19 public peer-to-peer

device to act as a standalone platform to support the application of MFH cancer
treatment is presented. The platform is shown to offer functionalities for
nanoparticle localization, focused hyperthermia therapy application, and
non-invasive tissue thermometry in one device. Combined, these capabilities
have the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy, effectiveness and
safety of MFH therapy. Measurements of nanoparticle hyperthermia during
protracted exposure to the MPI scanner's 3D imaging field sequence revealed
spatially focused heating, with a maximum that is significantly enhanced
compared with a simple 1-dimensional sinusoidal excitation. The observed
spatial heating behavior is qualitatively described based on a phenomenological
model considering torques exerted in the Brownian regime. In-vitro cell studies
using a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) demonstrated strong
suppression of both structural integrity and metabolic activity within 24 h
following a 40 min MFH treatment actuated within the Lissajous MPI scanner.
Furthermore, reconstructed MPI images of the nanoparticles distributed among
the cells, and the temperature-sensitivity of the MPI imaging signal obtained
during treatment are demonstrated. In summary, combined Lissajous MPI and MFH
technologies are presented; demonstrating for the first time their potential
for cancer treatment with maximum effectiveness, and minimal collateral damage

system (TLS) with an asymmetric pulse when the system is in contact with

find that the unequal ""up"" and ""down"" time duration of the pulse has two main
ramifications. First, the energy gap of the multiple sidebands or photon
sectors created as a result of the periodic modulation are renormalized by a
term which is dependent on both the modulation strength as well as the fraction
of up (or down) time duration. Second, the weights of the different sidebands
are no longer symmetrically distributed about the central band or zero photon
sector. We illustrate the advantages of these findings in the context of
applications in quantum thermal machines and thermometry. For a thermal machine
constructed by coupling the TLS to two thermal baths, we demonstrate that the
asymmetric pulse provides an extra degree of control over the mode of operation
of the thermal machine. Further, by appropriately tuning the weight of the
subbands, we also show that an asymmetric pulse may provide superior optimality
in a recently proposed protocol for quantum thermometry, where dynamical
control has been shown to enhance the precision of measurement.

with deep neural networks (DNNs) in wireless communications over highly dynamic
environments. Incorporating domain knowledge into learning is a promising way
of dealing with this issue, which is an emerging topic in the wireless
community. In this article, we first briefly summarize two classes of
approaches to using domain knowledge: introducing mathematical models or prior
knowledge to deep learning. Then, we consider a kind of symmetric prior,
permutation equivariance, which widely exists in wireless tasks. To explain how
such a generic prior is harnessed to improve learning efficiency, we resort to
ranking, which jointly sorts the input and output of a DNN. We use power
allocation among subcarriers, probabilistic content caching, and interference
coordination to illustrate the improvement of learning efficiency by exploiting
the property. From the case study, we find that the required training samples
to achieve given system performance decreases with the number of subcarriers or
contents, owing to an interesting phenomenon: ""sample hardening"". Simulation
results show that the training samples, the free parameters in DNNs and the
training time can be reduced dramatically by harnessing the prior knowledge.
The samples required to train a DNN after ranking can be reduced by $15 \sim
2,400$ folds to achieve the same system performance as the counterpart without
using prior.

Gradient Descent for the minimization of an unknown function F , defined as the

choice is to use an element of the Clarke subdifferential of the random
function; an other choice is the output of the celebrated backpropagation
algorithm, which is popular amongst practionners, and whose properties have
recently been studied by Bolte and Pauwels [7]. Since the expectation of the
chosen operator is not in general an element of the Clarke subdifferential BF
of the mean function, it has been assumed in the literature that an oracle of
BF is available. As a first result, it is shown in this paper that such an
oracle is not needed for almost all initialization points of the algorithm.
Next, in the small step size regime, it is shown that the interpolated
trajectory of the algorithm converges in probability (in the compact
convergence sense) towards the set of solutions of the differential inclusion.
Finally, viewing the iterates as a Markov chain whose transition kernel is
indexed by the step size, it is shown that the invariant distribution of the
kernel converge weakly to the set of invariant distribution of this
differential inclusion as the step size tends to zero. These results show that
when the step size is small, with large probability, the iterates eventually
lie in a neighborhood of the critical points of the mean function F .

also been proposed. However, there exists a strong need for a benchmark which
can evaluate the abilities of models, in performing question format independent
numerical reasoning, as (i) the numerical reasoning capabilities we want to
teach are not controlled by question formats, (ii) for numerical reasoning
technology to have the best possible application, it must be able to process
language and reason in a way that is not exclusive to a single format, task,

multifaceted benchmark to evaluate model performance across numerical reasoning
tasks of eight diverse formats. We add four existing question types in our
compilation. Two of the new types we add are about questions that require
external numerical knowledge, commonsense knowledge and domain knowledge. For
building a more practical numerical reasoning system, NUMBERGAME demands four
capabilities beyond numerical reasoning: (i) detecting question format directly

converted (iii) incorporating commonsense knowledge (iv) handling data
imbalance across formats. We build several baselines, including a new model
based on knowledge hunting using a cheatsheet. However, all baselines perform
poorly in contrast to the human baselines, indicating the hardness of our
benchmark. Our work takes forward the recent progress in generic system
development, demonstrating the scope of these under-explored tasks.

discrete representation using Vector-Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder models
(VQ-VAEs). Discrete latent variable models have been shown to learn nontrivial
representations of speech, applicable to unsupervised voice conversion and
reaching state-of-the-art performance on unit discovery tasks. For unsupervised
representation learning, they became viable alternatives to continuous latent
variable models such as the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE). However, training
deep discrete variable models is challenging, due to the inherent
non-differentiability of the discretization operation. In this paper we focus
on VQ-VAE, a state-of-the-art discrete bottleneck model shown to perform on par
with its continuous counterparts. It quantizes encoder outputs with on-line
$k$-means clustering. We show that the codebook learning can suffer from poor
initialization and non-stationarity of clustered encoder outputs. We
demonstrate that these can be successfully overcome by increasing the learning
rate for the codebook and periodic date-dependent codeword re-initialization.
As a result, we achieve more robust training across different tasks, and
significantly increase the usage of latent codewords even for large codebooks.
This has practical benefit, for instance, in unsupervised representation
learning, where large codebooks may lead to disentanglement of latent
representations.

their classical solutions by employing power expansion order by order in its
self-interaction coupling $\lambda$. We study holographic correlation functions
of scalar operator deformations to a certain 5-dimensional conformal field
theory where the operators share the same scaling dimension $\Delta=3$, from
the classical solutions. For our solutions, we choose a scheme where we remove
co-linear divergences of momenta along the AdS boundary directions which
frequently appear in the classical solutions. This shows clearly that the
holographic correlation functions are free from the co-linear divergences. It
turns out that this theory provides correct conformal 2- and 3- point functions
of the $\Delta=3$ scalar operators as expected in previous literature. It makes
sense since 2- and 3- point functions are determined by global conformal
symmetry not being dependent on the details of the conformal theory. We also
get 4-point function from this holographic model. In fact, it turns out that
the 4-point correlation function is not conformal because it does not satisfy
the special conformal Ward identity although it does dilation Ward identity and
respect $SO(5)$ rotation symmetry. However, in the co-linear limit that all the
external momenta are in a same direction, the 4-point function is conformal
which means that it satisfy the special conformal Ward identity. We inspect
holographic $n$-point functions of this theory which can be obtained by
employing a certain Feynman-like rule. This rule is a construction of $n$-point
function by connecting $l$-point functions each other where $l<n$. In the
co-linear limit, these $n$-point functions reproduce the conformal $n$-point
functions of $\Delta=3$ scalar operators in $d=5$ Euclidean space addressed in

sustainable alternative. Amongst those available, polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
shows great potential across a large variety of applications but is currently
limited to packaging, cosmetics and tissue engineering due to its relatively
poor physical properties. An expansion of its uses can be accomplished by
developing nanocomposites where PHAs are used as the polymer matrix. Herein, a
PHA biopolyester was melt blended with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) or with a
1:1 hybrid mixture of GNPs and carbon nanofibers (CNFs). The resulting
nanocomposites exhibited enhanced thermal stability while their Young's modulus
roughly doubled compared to pure PHA. The hybrid nanocomposites percolated
electrically at lower nanofiller loadings compared to the GNP-PHA system. The
electrical conductivity at 15 wt.% loading was ~ 6 times higher than the
GNP-based sample. As a result, the electromagnetic interference shielding
performance of the hybrid material was around 50% better than the pure GNPs
nanocomposites, exhibiting shielding effectiveness above 20 dB, which is the
threshold for common commercial applications. The thermal conductivity
increased significantly for both types of bio-nanocomposites and reached values
around 5 W K-1 m-1 with the hybrid-based material displaying the best
performance. Considering the solvent-free and industrially compatible
production method, the proposed multifunctional materials are promising to
expand the range of application of PHAs and increase the environmental
sustainability of the plastic and plastic electronics industry.

the quality is predicted based on the inferred quality maps with deep neural

additional durations of text tokens are required to make a hard alignment

crucial role since it controls the correspondence between text tokens and

get better duration-based alignment and improve the quality of
non-autoregressive speech synthesis, in this paper, we propose a novel neural
alignment model named MoboAligner. Given the pairs of the text and mel
spectrum, MoboAligner tries to identify the boundaries of text tokens in the
given mel spectrum frames based on the token-frame similarity in the neural
semantic space with an end-to-end framework. With these boundaries, durations
can be extracted and used in the training of non-autoregressive TTS models.
Compared with the duration extracted by TransformerTTS, MoboAligner brings
improvement for the non-autoregressive TTS model on MOS (3.74 comparing to
FastSpeech's 3.44). Besides, MoboAligner is task-specified and lightweight,
which reduces the parameter number by 45% and the training time consuming by
30%.

rung-pair localization both at the edges and in the bulk. Using center-of-mass
frame, the two-particle system can be mapped to an effective single-particle
system with an approximate sub-lattice symmetry. Under the condition of

edge leading to a zero-energy flat band, which is the origin of the rung-pair
localization. We also study the multi-particle dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard

that the localization can still survive despite of the existence of interaction
between the pairs. Moreover, the numerical results show that the entanglement

satisfy a volume law. This phenomenon implies that the interaction plays an
important role during the dynamics, although it cannot break the localization.

syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that is rapidly spreading across the globe.
The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to critically
ill cases and requires early detection and monitoring, within a clinical
environment for critical cases and remotely for mild cases. The fear of
contamination in clinical environments has led to a dramatic reduction in
on-site referrals for routine care. There has also been a perceived need to
continuously monitor non-severe COVID- 19 patients, either from their
quarantine site at home, or dedicated quarantine locations (e.g., hotels).
Thus, the pandemic has driven incentives to innovate and enhance or create new
routes for providing healthcare services at distance. In particular, this has
created a dramatic impetus to find innovative ways to remotely and effectively
monitor patient health status. In this paper we present a short review of
remote health monitoring initiatives taken in 19 states during the time of the
pandemic. We emphasize in the discussion particular aspects that are common
ground for the reviewed states, in particular the future impact of the pandemic
on remote health monitoring and consideration on data privacy.

the tower. This is a type of fermionic version of the (magnetic) Weak Gravity

can only be broken below the scale set by this Yukawa coupling. We perform some

studied over the past two decades for commonly used types of constraints
including the classic Functional Dependencies (FDs) and the more general Denial

approximate DCs (i.e., DCs that are ""almost"" satisfied) from data. Considering
approximate constraints allows us to discover more accurate constraints in
inconsistent databases, detect rules that are generally correct but may have a
few exceptions, as well as avoid overfitting and obtain more general and less
contrived constraints. We introduce the algorithm ADCMiner for mining
approximate DCs. An important feature of this algorithm is that it does not
assume any specific definition of an approximate DC, but takes the semantics as
input. Since there is more than one way to define an approximate DC and
different definitions may produce very different results, we do not focus on
one definition, but rather on a general family of approximation functions that
satisfies some natural axioms defined in this paper and captures commonly used
definitions of approximate constraints. We also show how our algorithm can be
combined with sampling to return results with high accuracy while significantly
reducing the running time.

for recovery is crucial to providing better care for patients with traumatic
brain injury (TBI). Estimation of this relationship requires clinical
information on injury severity, patient demographics, and healthcare
utilization, which are often obtained from separate data sources. Because of
privacy and confidentiality regulations, these data sources do not include
unique identifiers to link records across data sources. Record linkage is a
process to identify records that represent the same entity across data sources
in the absence of unique identifiers. These processes commonly rely on
agreement between variables that appear in both data sources to link records.
However, when the number of records in each file is large, this task is
computationally intensive and may result in false links. Blocking is a data
partitioning technique that reduces the number of possible links that should be
considered. Healthcare providers can be used as blocks in applications of
record linkage with healthcare datasets. However, providers may not be uniquely
identified across files. We propose a Bayesian record linkage procedure that
simultaneously performs block-level and record-level linkage. This iterative
approach incorporates the record-level linkage within block pairs to improve
the accuracy of the block-level linkage. Subsequently, the algorithm improves
record-level linkage using the accurate partitioning of the linkage space
through blocking. We demonstrate that our proposed method provides improved
performance compared to existing Bayesian record linkage methods that do not
incorporate blocking. The proposed procedure is then used to merge registry
data from the National Trauma Data Bank with Medicare claims data to estimate
the relationship between injury severity and TBI patients' recovery.

Most recently, deep learning based methods have shown promising for facial
expression recognition. However, the performance of the current
state-of-the-art facial expression recognition (FER) approaches is directly
related to the labeled data for training. To solve this issue, prior works
employ the pretrain-and-finetune strategy, i.e., utilize a large amount of
unlabeled data to pretrain the network and then finetune it by the labeled
data. As the labeled data is in a small amount, the final network performance
is still restricted. From a different perspective, we propose to perform
omni-supervised learning to directly exploit reliable samples in a large amount
of unlabeled data for network training. Particularly, a new dataset is firstly
constructed using a primitive model trained on a small number of labeled
samples to select samples with high confidence scores from a face dataset,
i.e., MS-Celeb-1M, based on feature-wise similarity. We experimentally verify
that the new dataset created in such an omni-supervised manner can
significantly improve the generalization ability of the learned FER model.
However, as the number of training samples grows, computational cost and
training time increase dramatically. To tackle this, we propose to apply a
dataset distillation strategy to compress the created dataset into several
informative class-wise images, significantly improving the training efficiency.
We have conducted extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, where
consistent performance gains can be achieved under various settings using the
proposed framework. More importantly, the distilled dataset has shown its
capabilities of boosting the performance of FER with negligible additional
computational costs.

turbolence and of the artificial propulsion on some basic flow parameters, such
as pressure and volumetric flow rate are studied by a microfluidic set-up

practical outcome of the study, a strong decrease of the mixing time in a

experiments, that allows us to both develop a theoretical model for the

for observations is restricted, it is necessary to reduce the measurements to a

selecting the optimal measurement times for particle filtering is formalized as
a combinatorial optimization problem. We propose an approximated solution based
on the nesting of a genetic algorithm, a Monte Carlo algorithm and a particle
filter. Firstly, an example demonstrates that the genetic algorithm outperforms
a random trial optimization. Then, the interest of non-regular measurements

efficiency of our proposed solution is quantified: better filtering
performances are obtained in 87.5% of the cases and on average, the relative
improvement is 27.7%.

the transition from a glacial to an inter-glacial state through a sudden
release of oceanic Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere. This process can be cast
in terms of a Filippov dynamical system, with a discontinuous change in its
dynamics related to the Carbon Dioxide release. By using techniques from the
theory of non-smooth dynamical systems, we give an analysis of this model in
the cases of both no insolation forcing and also periodic insolation forcing.
This reveals a rich, and novel, dynamical structure to the solutions of the
PP04 model. In particular we see synchronised periodic solutions with subtle
regions of existence which depend on the amplitude and frequency of the

nonlinear interaction of linearly polarized intense laser light and
relativistic degenerate plasmas are studied. In the slow motion approximation
of relativistic dynamics, the evolution of weakly nonlinear EM envelope is
described by the generalized nonlinear Schr{\""o}dinger (GNLS) equation with
local and nonlocal nonlinearities. Using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criteria, the
stability of an EM soliton solution of the GNLS equation is studied. Different
stable and unstable regions are demonstrated with the effects of soliton
velocity, soliton eigenfrequency, as well as the degeneracy parameter
$R=p_{Fe}/m_ec$, where $p_{Fe}$ is the Fermi momentum and $m_e$ the electron
mass, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. It is found that the stability
region shifts to an unstable one and is significantly reduced as one enters
from the regimes of weakly relativistic $(R\ll1)$ to ultrarelativistic
$(R\gg1)$ degeneracy of electrons. The analytically predicted results are in
good agreement with the simulation results of the GNLS equation. It is shown
that the standing EM soliton solutions are stable. However, the moving solitons
can be stable or unstable depending on the values of soliton velocity, the
eigenfrequency or the degeneracy parameter. The latter with strong degeneracy
$(R>1)$ can eventually lead to soliton collapse.

GHz observations of 16 nearby (0.003$\le$z$\le$0.3) hard - X-rays selected AGN
at the (sub)-kpc scale with tens uJy beam$^{-1}$ sensitivity. We detected 15/16
sources, with flux densities ranging from hundreds uJy beam$^{-1}$ to tens Jy
(specific luminosities from $\sim$10$^{20}$ to $\sim$10$^{25}\,W\,Hz^{-1}$ at
22 GHz). All detected sources host a compact core, with 8 being core-dominated
at either frequencies, the others exhibiting also extended structures. Spectral
indices range from steep to flat/inverted. We interpret this evidence as either
due to a core+jet system (6/15), a core accompanied by surrounding star
formation (1/15), to a jet oriented close to the line of sight (3/15), to
emission from a corona or the base of a jet (1/15), although there might be
degeneracies between different processes. Four sources require more data to
shed light on their nature. We conclude that, at these frequencies, extended,
optically-thin components are present together with the flat-spectrum core. The
${L_R}/{L_X}\sim10^{-5}$ relation is roughly followed, indicating a possible
contribution to radio emission from a hot corona. A weakly significant
correlation between radio core (22 and 45 GHz) and X-rays luminosities is
discussed in the light of an accretion-ejection framework.

throughout textbooks on solar and plasma astrophysics, and guides
interpretations of unresolved energetic flaring events on other stars,
accretion disks and jets. To date, a fully self-consistent model that
reproduces the standard scenario in all its facets is lacking, since this
requires the combination of a large scale, multi-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma description with a realistic fast electron
treatment. Here, we demonstrate such a novel combination, where MHD combines
with an analytic fast electron model, adjusted to handle time-evolving,
reconnecting magnetic fields and particle trapping. This allows to study (1)
the role of fast electron deposition in the triggering of chromospheric
evaporation flows; (2) the physical mechanisms that generate various hard X-ray
sources at chromospheric footpoints or looptops; and (3) the relationship
between soft X-ray and hard X-ray fluxes throughout the entire flare loop
evolution. For the first time, this self-consistent solar flare model
demonstrates the observationally suggested relationship between flux swept out
by the hard X-ray footpoint regions, and the actual reconnection rate at the
X-point, which is a major unknown in flaring scenarios. We also demonstrate
that a looptop hard X-ray source can result from fast electron trapping.

gas, cool CGM gas and warm-hot CGM gas. At radii smaller than 50 kpc the CGM is
dominated by recycled warm-hot gas injected from the central galaxy, while at
larger radii it is dominated by cool gas accreted onto the halo. The recycled
gas typically accounts for one-third of the CGM mass. We introduce the novel
publicly available analysis tool \textsc{pygad} to compute ion abundances and
mock absorption spectra. For Lyman-${\alpha}$ absorption we find good agreement

on the spotlight of several research fields such as spintronics, topological
materials and quantum computation. While most theoretical models assume an
infinitely long nanowire, in actual experimental setups the nanowire has a
finite length, is contacted to metallic electrodes and is partly covered by
gates. By taking these effects into account through an inhomogeneous spin-orbit
coupling profile, we show that in general two types of bound states arise in
the nanowire, namely confinement bound states and interface bound states. The
appearance of confinement bound states, related to the finite length of the
nanowire, is favoured by a mismatch of the bulk band bottoms characterizing the
lead and the nanowire, and occurs even in the absence of magnetic field. In
contrast, an interface bound states may only appear if a magnetic field applied
perpendicularly to the spin-orbit field direction overcomes a critical value,
and is favoured by an alignment of the band bottoms of the two regions across
the interface. We describe in details the emergence of these two types of bound
states, pointing out their differences. Furthermore, we show that when a
nanowire portion is covered by a gate the application of a magnetic field can
change the nature of the electronic ground state from a confinement to an
interface bound state, determining a redistribution of the electron charge.

undulating motion of this fish can be described by only two standing-wave like
spatially orthonormal modes. Constructing the data set from our numerical
simulations for flows over the membranous caudal fin of the Jack fish, our
modal analyses reveal that only the first few modes receive energy from both
the fluid and structure, but the contribution of fluid in the higher modes is
minimal. For the viscous and transitional flow conditions considered here, both
spatially and temporally orthonormal modes show strikingly similar coherent
flow structures. Our investigations are expected to assist in developing
data-driven reduced-dimensional mathematical models to examine the dynamics of
bio-inspired swimming robots and develop new and effective control strategies

Behaviors are much more complex than words in sentences, so traditional
attentive and recurrent models may fail in capturing the temporal dynamics of
user preferences. (2) The preferences of users are multiple and evolving, so it
is difficult to integrate long-term memory and short-term intent.
  In this paper, we propose a temporal gating methodology to improve attention

Multi-hop Time-aware Attentive Memory network (MTAM) to integrate long-term and

only reduces the number of comparisons required to compute the results, but
also avoids the generation and elimination of duplicate results, which is an
inherent problem of spatial indexes based on disjoint space partitioning. The
spatial partitions defined by our indexing scheme are totally independent,
facilitating effortless parallel evaluation, as no synchronization or
communication between the partitions is necessary. We show how our index can be
used to efficiently process spatial range queries and drastically reduce the

processing of numerous range queries in batch and in parallel. Extensive
experiments on real datasets confirm the efficiency of our approaches.

assumed that samples from the prior are uniformly distributed along this unit

this means that analytically, nested sampling can deal with plateaus in the

methods are mostly tailored for very sparse depth measurements from LiDARs in

dense measurements in some regions and almost empty in others. We propose a new

Our main contribution is a new decoder modulation branch added to the

map from these features differently for different regions. This is implemented
by modifying the spatial distribution of output signals inside the decoder via

novel training strategy that allows us to train on a semi-dense sensor data

semi-dense input depth, our model is still competitive with LiDAR-oriented

in studies of COVID19 undermines our understanding of the disease risk and
severity. This is typically caused by the data being restricted to people who
have undergone COVID19 testing, among whom healthcare workers are
overrepresented. For example, collider bias caused by smokers being
underrepresented in the dataset may (at least partly) explain empirical results
that suggest smoking reduces the risk of COVID19. We extend the work of
Griffith et al making more explicit use of graphical causal models to interpret
observed data. We show that their smoking example can be clarified and improved
using Bayesian network models with realistic data and assumptions. We show that
there is an even more fundamental problem for risk factors like 'stress' which,
unlike smoking, is more rather than less prevalent among healthcare workers; in
this case, because of a combination of collider bias from the biased dataset
and the fact that 'healthcare worker' is a confounding variable, it is likely
that studies will wrongly conclude that stress reduces rather than increases
the risk of COVID19. Indeed, ""being in close contact with COVID19 people""
reduces the risk of COVID19. To avoid such potentially erroneous conclusions,
any analysis of observational data must take account of the underlying causal
structure including colliders and confounders. If analysts fail to do this
explicitly then any conclusions they make about the effect of specific risk
factors on COVID19 are likely to be flawed.

a rate-$R$ link under a constraint on the average communication load coincides
with the optimum exponent of such a system with a rate $R/(1-\epsilon)$ link
under a maximum communication load constraint. A strong converse thus does not
hold under an average communication load constraint. A similar observation
holds also for testing against independence over DMCs. With variable-length
coding and stop-feedback and under an average communication load constraint,
the optimum type-II error exponent over a DMC of capacity $C$ equals the
optimum exponent under fixed-length coding and a maximum communication load
constraint when communication is over a DMC of capacity $C(1-\epsilon)^{-1}$.

translation operator that is invariant under the change of the spatial unit
cell. Useful properties of the operator are derived. By casting the problem in
an eigenvalue problem form, the equivalency between solutions at different
positions along the structure is demonstrated. It is shown that the underlying
mathematical machinery is identical to the one used in the analysis of linear
time invariant periodic structures, where a two step eigen-decompositions is
performed. The first decomposition is in the temporal eigenfunctions basis,
which is followed by the decomposition of the translation operator in the
spatial domain. The two step process results in the well-known dispersion
relation. We also prove that all points in the ($\beta$,$\omega$) plane
parallel to the modulation velocity are equivalent in the sense that the
eigenvectors are related by a shift operator. Additionally, the wave
propagation inside the space time periodic circuit and the terminal
characteristics are rigorously determined via the expansion of the total
solution in terms of the eigenmodes. To validate the developed framework, two
examples are provided. In the first, a space time modulated composite right
left handed transmission line is studied and results are compared with time
domain simulation. The second example is concerned with the characterization of
the non-reciprocal behaviour observed on a nonlinear transmission line that was
manufactured in our lab. Using the developed machinery it is shown that the
passive interaction between different harmonics results in an observed giant
non-reciprocity, where the difference between the forward and backward
transmission coefficients can be greater than 30 dB. The frequencies at which
non-reciprocity occurs and its strength agree with time domain simulation and
measurements.

with different energies have been used to constrain the photon mass or the Weak
Equivalence Principle, for example. Due to the mixing between the visible and

electrons in the intergalactic medium, can change and impact those constraints
from FRBs. We use five detected FRBs and two associations of FRBs with
gamma-ray bursts to investigate the correspondent variation on the time delay
caused by the presence of DP DM. The result is virtually independent of the FRB
used and this variation is very small, considering the still allowed DP DM

adversarial attack on a given model by looking at a large number of training
data points and the geometry of the decision boundary near them. Subsequent
work \cite{Khrulkov18} constructs universal attack by looking only at test

a simple universalization technique to take any input-dependent adversarial

computational overhead for universalization. We theoretically justify our
universalization technique by a spectral property common to many
input-dependent adversarial perturbations, e.g., gradients, Fast Gradient Sign

spectral perturbation bounds, we show that the top singular vector of
input-dependent adversarial directions on a small test sample gives an
effective and simple universal adversarial attack. For VGG16 and VGG19 models

viability, given that the crew operating cost is second only to the fuel cost.
CPO aims at generating a set of flight sequences (crew pairings) to cover all
scheduled flights, at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality
constraints. The state-of-the-art heavily relies on relaxing the underlying
Integer Programming Problem into a Linear Programming Problem, which in turn is
solved through the Column Generation (CG) technique. However, with the
alarmingly expanding airlines' operations, CPO is marred by the curse of
dimensionality, rendering the exact CG-implementations obsolete, and
necessitating the heuristic-based CG-implementations. Yet, in literature, the
much prevalent large-scale complex flight networks involving multiple { crew
bases and/or hub-and-spoke sub-networks, largely remain uninvestigated. This
paper proposes a novel CG heuristic, which has enabled the in-house development
of an Airline Crew Pairing Optimizer (AirCROP). The efficacy of the
heuristic/AirCROP has been tested on real-world, large-scale, complex network
instances with over 4,200 flights, 15 crew bases, and multiple hub-and-spoke
sub-networks (resulting in billion-plus possible pairings). Notably, this paper
has a dedicated focus on the proposed CG heuristic (not the entire AirCROP
framework) based on balancing random exploration of pairings; exploitation of
domain knowledge (on optimal solution features); and utilization of the past
computational & search effort through archiving. Though this paper has an
airline context, the proposed CG heuristic may find wider applications across
different domains, by serving as a template on how to utilize domain knowledge
to better tackle combinatorial optimization problems.

formally define and quantify the causal effect of a vector of covariates $X$ on
a real-valued response $Y$, even if the causal background knowledge is
incomplete. We introduce a procedure for estimating causal effects, and a
non-parametric hypothesis test for these effects being zero. The proposed
methods do not make strong distributional assumptions, and allow for
arbitrarily many latent confounders, given that these confounders do not vary
across time (or, alternatively, they do not vary across space). When applying
our causal methodology to the problem of conflict and forest loss, using data
from 2000 to 2018, we find a reducing but insignificant causal effect of
conflict on forest loss. Regionally, both enhancing and reducing effects can be
identified. Our theoretical findings are supported by simulations, and code is

(FBOTs), are a distinct class of astrophysical event. They are characterised by
lightcurves that decline much faster than common classes supernovae (SNe), span
vast ranges in peak luminosity and can be seen to redshifts greater than 1.
Their evolution on fast timescales has hindered high quality follow-up
observations, and thus their origin and explosion/emission mechanism remains
unexplained. In this paper we define the largest sample of RETs to date,
comprising 106 objects from the Dark Energy Survey, and perform the most
comprehensive analysis of RET host galaxies. Using deep-stacked photometry and
emission-lines from OzDES spectroscopy, we derive stellar masses and
star-formation rates (SFRs) for 49 host galaxies, and metallicities for 37. We
find that RETs explode exclusively in star-forming galaxies and are thus likely
associated with massive stars. Comparing RET hosts to samples of host galaxies
of other explosive transients as well as field galaxies, we find that RETs
prefer galaxies with high specific SFRs, indicating a link to young stellar
populations, similar to stripped-envelope SNe. RET hosts appear to show a lack
of chemical enrichment, their metallicities akin to long duration gamma-ray
bursts and superluminous SN host galaxies. There are no clear relationships
between properties of the host galaxies and the peak magnitudes or decline
rates of the transients themselves.

quasi-periodic (QP) architecture to improve the pitch controllability of PWG.
PWG is a compact non-autoregressive (non-AR) speech generation model, whose
generative speed is much faster than real time. While utilizing PWG as a
vocoder to generate speech on the basis of acoustic features such as spectral
and prosodic features, PWG generates high-fidelity speech. However, when the
input acoustic features include unseen pitches, the pitch accuracy of
PWG-generated speech degrades because of the fixed and generic network of PWG
without prior knowledge of speech periodicity. The proposed QPPWG adopts a
pitch-dependent dilated convolution network (PDCNN) module, which introduces
the pitch information into PWG via the dynamically changed network
architecture, to improve the pitch controllability and speech modeling
capability of vanilla PWG. Both objective and subjective evaluation results
show the higher pitch accuracy and comparable speech quality of QPPWG-generated
speech when the QPPWG model size is only 70 % of that of vanilla PWG.

dimensions, with $n\geq m >0$, a gauge-invariant action is known to exist in
arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds. If the Weyl tensor is non-vanishing,
however, gauge invariance holds for a pure conformal field in the following
cases: (i) $n=m=1$ (Maxwell's field) on arbitrary gravitational backgrounds;
and (ii) $n=m+1 =2 $ (conformal gravitino) and $n=m=2$ (conformal graviton) on
Bach-flat backgrounds. It is believed that in other cases certain lower-spin
fields must be introduced to ensure gauge invariance in Bach-flat backgrounds,
although no closed-form model has yet been constructed (except for conformal
maximal depth fields with spin $s=5/2$ and $s=3$). In this paper we derive such
a gauge-invariant model describing the dynamics of a conformal gauge field
$h_{\alpha (3)\dot\alpha}$ coupled to a self-dual two-form. Similar to other
conformal higher-spin theories, it can be embedded in an off-shell
superconformal gauge-invariant action. To this end, we introduce a new family
of $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal gauge multiplets described by unconstrained
prepotentials $\Upsilon_{\alpha(n)}$, with $n>0$, and propose the corresponding
gauge-invariant actions on conformally-flat backgrounds. We demonstrate that
the $n=2$ model, which contains $h_{\alpha(3)\dot{\alpha}}$ at the component
level, can be lifted to a Bach-flat background provided $\Upsilon_{\alpha(2)}$
is coupled to a chiral spinor $\Omega_{\alpha}$. We also propose families of
(super)conformal higher-derivative non-gauge actions and new superconformal
operators in any curved space. Finally, through considerations based on
supersymmetry, we argue that the conformal spin-3 field should always be
accompanied by a conformal spin-2 field in order to ensure gauge invariance in
a Bach-flat background.

axial uniform flow and parallel to a free surface, using one-dimensional beam
and potential flow models to revisit this classical fluid-structure interaction
problem. The physical behaviour of the confining free surface is characterized
by the Froude number, corresponding to the ratio of the incoming flow velocity
to that of the gravity waves. After presenting the simplified limit of infinite
span (i.e. two-dimensional problem), the results are generalized to include
finite-span and lateral confinement effects. In both cases, three unstable
regimes are identified for varying Froude number. Rigidly-confined flutter is
observed for low Froude number, i.e. when the free surface behaves as a rigid
wall, and is equivalent to the classical problem of the confined flag. When the
flow and wave velocities are comparable, a new instability is observed before
the onset of flutter (i.e. at lower reduced flow speed) and results from the
resonance of a structural bending wave and one of the fundamental modes of
surface gravity waves. Finally, for large Froude number (low effect of
gravity), flutter is observed with significant but passive deformation of the
free surface in response of the flag's displacement.

XMM-Newton Outburst Detector (EXOD) algorithm, which we run on the EPIC-pn data

variability by binning in time the counts in each detector pixel. We next
compute the maximum-to-median count difference in each pixel to detect
variability. We applied EXOD to 5,751 observations and compared the variability
of the detected sources to the standard chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
variability tests. The algorithm is able to detect periodic and aperiodic
variability, short and long flares. Of the sources detected by EXOD, 60-95% are
also shown to be variable by the chi-square and KS tests. We obtain a net
number of 2,536 variable sources. Of these we investigate the nature of 35
sources with no previously confirmed classification. Amongst the new sources,
we find stellar flares and AGNs; but also four extragalactic type I X-ray
bursters that double the known neutron-star population in M31. This algorithm
is a powerful tool to promptly detect variable sources in XMM-Newton
observations. EXOD detects fast transients that other variability tests
classify as non-variable due to their short duration and low number of counts.
Finally, EXOD allows us to detect and identify the nature of rare compact
objects through their variability. We demonstrate this through the discovery of
four extragalactic neutron-star low mass X-ray binaries, doubling the number of
known neutron stars in M31.

evolution of close-in planets. We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations
of photo-evaporation of exoplanets' atmospheres to study the effect of
photoelectric heating by far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation. Specifically, we
consider a close-in hot Jupiter around a hot A-star. Hot main-sequence stars
emit not only extreme ultraviolet radiation but also FUV radiation, and thus
can drive strong atmospheric escape by photoelectric heating. We show that the
planetary atmosphere escapes at a rate as large as $\dot{M}\sim10^{14}\,
\mathrm{g}~{\rm sec}^{-1}$ if the atmosphere contains a small amount of dust
grains with the level of ten percent of the local interstellar medium. Close-in
planets around hot stars can lose a significant fraction of the atmosphere
during the long-term evolution. We quantify the amount of dust necessary for
causing photoevaporation. The dust-to-gas mass ratio of $10^{-4}$ is sufficient
to drive stronger atmospheric escape by FUV photoelectric heating than in the
case with only extreme ultraviolet radiation. We also explore the metallicity
dependence of the FUV-driven escape. The mass-loss rate increases with
increasing the atmosphere's metallicity because of the enhanced photoelectric
heating, but the stellar FUV flux decreases with increasing stellar
metallicity. We derive an accurate estimate for the mass-loss rate as a
function of FUV flux and metallicity, and of the planet's characteristics. The
FUV driven atmospheric escape may be a key process to understand and explain
the so-called sub-Jovian desert.

the anisotropy induced by thin-layering. The Backus average, a useful
mathematical tool, allows us to describe such an effect quantitatively. The
results are meaningful only if the underlying physical assumptions are obeyed,
such as static equilibrium of the material. We focus on the only mathematical
assumption of the Backus average, namely, product approximation. It states that
the average of the product of a varying function with nearly-constant function
is approximately equal to the product of the averages of those functions. We
discuss particular, problematic case for which the aforementioned assumption is
inaccurate. Further, we focus on the seismological context. We examine
numerically if the inaccuracy affects the wave propagation in a homogenous
medium -- obtained using the Backus average -- equivalent to thin layers. We
take into consideration various material symmetries, including orthotropic,
cubic, and others. We show that the problematic case of product approximation
is strictly related to the negative Poisson's ratio of constituent layers.
Therefore, we discuss the laboratory and well-log cases in which such a ratio
has been noticed. Upon thorough literature review, it occurs that examples of
so-called auxetic materials (media that have negative Poisson's ratio) are not
extremely rare exceptions as thought previously. The investigation and
derivation of Poisson's ratio for materials exhibiting symmetry classes up to
monoclinic become a significant part of this paper. Except for the main
objectives, we also show that the averaging of cubic layers results in an
equivalent medium with tetragonal (not cubic) symmetry. Additionally, we
present concise formulations of stability conditions for low symmetry classes,
such as trigonal, orthotropic, and monoclinic.

monitoring, it is now possible to gather huge amounts of electro-physiological
signals such as electrocardiogram (ECG). It is therefore necessary to develop
models/algorithms that are capable of analysing these massive amounts of data

segmentation of heartbeats. Methods: The proposed algorithm, named as the
DENS-ECG algorithm, combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long
short-term memory (LSTM) model to detect onset, peak, and offset of different
heartbeat waveforms such as the P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave, and No wave (NW).
Using ECG as the inputs, the model learns to extract high level features
through the training process, which, unlike other classical machine learning
based methods, eliminates the feature engineering step. Results: The proposed
DENS-ECG model was trained and validated on a dataset with 105 ECGs of length
15 minutes each and achieved an average sensitivity and precision of 97.95% and
95.68%, respectively, using a 5-fold cross validation. Additionally, the model
was evaluated on an unseen dataset to examine its robustness in QRS detection,

The empirical results show the flexibility and accuracy of the combined

give an information-theoretic analysis on the generalization error and the

Specifically, we provide generalization error upper bounds for general transfer
learning algorithms and extend the results to a specific empirical risk

in the training phase. We further apply the method to iterative, noisy gradient
descent algorithms, and obtain upper bounds which can be easily calculated,
only using parameters from the learning algorithms. A few illustrative examples

recognition (ASR) framework, which generates a sequence by refining outputs of
the connectionist temporal classification (CTC). Neural sequence-to-sequence
models are usually \textit{autoregressive}: each output token is generated by
conditioning on previously generated tokens, at the cost of requiring as many
iterations as the output length. On the other hand, non-autoregressive models
can simultaneously generate tokens within a constant number of iterations,
which results in significant inference time reduction and better suits
end-to-end ASR model for real-world scenarios. In this work, Mask CTC model is
trained using a Transformer encoder-decoder with joint training of mask
prediction and CTC. During inference, the target sequence is initialized with
the greedy CTC outputs and low-confidence tokens are masked based on the CTC
probabilities. Based on the conditional dependence between output tokens, these
masked low-confidence tokens are then predicted conditioning on the
high-confidence tokens. Experimental results on different speech recognition
tasks show that Mask CTC outperforms the standard CTC model (e.g., 17.9% ->
12.1% WER on WSJ) and approaches the autoregressive model, requiring much less
inference time using CPUs (0.07 RTF in Python implementation). All of our codes

Here we apply the machine learning (ML) for the diagnosis of early stage
diabetes, which is known as a challenging task in medicine. Blood glucose
levels are tightly regulated by two counter-regulatory hormones, insulin and
glucagon, and the failure of the glucose homeostasis leads to the common
metabolic disease, diabetes mellitus. It is a chronic disease that has a long
latent period the complicates detection of the disease at an early stage. The
vast majority of diabetics result from that diminished effectiveness of insulin
action. The insulin resistance must modify the temporal profile of blood
glucose. Thus we propose to use ML to detect the subtle change in the temporal
pattern of glucose concentration. Time series data of blood glucose with
sufficient resolution is currently unavailable, so we confirm the proposal
using synthetic data of glucose profiles produced by a biophysical model that
considers the glucose regulation and hormone action. Multi-layered perceptrons,
convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks all identified the
degree of insulin resistance with high accuracy above $85\%$.

Several types of algorithms can be executed significantly faster on a

types of execution platforms poses a number of challenges to software
engineering. Significant efforts are required in such type of migration,
particularly for re-architecting and re-implementing the software. Further,
optimizing it in terms of performance and other runtime properties can be very
challenging, making the process complex, expensive, and error-prone. Therefore,
a systematic approach based on explicit and justified architectural decisions
is needed for a successful refactoring process from a homogeneous to a
heterogeneous platform. In this paper, we propose a decision framework that
supports engineers when refactoring software systems to accommodate
heterogeneous platforms. It includes the assessment of important factors in
order to minimize the risk of recurrent problems in the process. Through a set

making appropriate architectural decisions to accommodate heterogeneous

(2017, 2019) main concept of dynamo action to red dwarfs and red giant and
supergiant stars. Thus, we attempt to establish a unified dynamo action, being
potentially at work at widely varying stellar domains. Thus, the powerful,
unique and leading entity generating the primary stellar magnetic field remains
the so-called Torus structure. Within the Torus the same sign charges are
mutually attracted and the Torus could be simulated as a superconductor. An
existing gradient of the rotation rate accumulates net charge in the Torus, and
the resulting toroidal current becomes the driving source of the magnetic
field. In turn, there is a complicated network of secondary interactions that
affect and modulate the whole star's magnetic behaviour. Our dynamo action is
potentially at work in fully and partly convecting stars. A major finding is
that the strength of the magnetic field, for stars of the same spectral type,
is essentially controlled by the size of the star; we suggest that, the larger
the star, the deeper inward the Torus is formed. The formation of a single
Torus is essentially associated with a large-scale strong, poloidal and
axisymmetric magnetic field topology, whereas the generation of a weaker
multipolar, non-axisymmetric field configuration in rapid evolution can result
from a double-Torus structure (like the solar case). The same basic concept is
scaled up or down. Moreover, we identify four key parameters associated with
the magnetic field of red dwarfs, giants and supergiants: First, the rotation
speed; second, the steepness of the radial gradient of the rotation rate in the
shear layer; third, the distance of the Torus from the photosphere and fourth,
the cross-sectional area of the Torus. The third and fourth key parameters are
introduced for the first time.

proposed technique is termed Polymer on Polymer Pollutant Removal (PoPPR),
which utilizes the elastic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to
physically remove contaminants from contact lens surfaces through non-adhesive
unpeeling.
  Methods: Three different ratios of setting agent to polymer PDMS (1:30, 1:40,
and 1:50) were evaluated using the PoPPR method against the control method of
RR with a commercial multi-purpose lens cleaning solution. Three simulated
pollutants of different sizes: pollen (25-40 {\mu}m), microbeads (1-5 {\mu}m),
and nanoparticles (5-10 nm), were used to test the effectiveness of both
cleaning methods. The fraction of pollutants removed from each contact lens was
recorded and evaluated for significance.
  Results: PDMS 1:40 was found to be the optimal ratio for lens cleaning using
the PoPPR method. For larger particles (>10 {\mu}m), no difference was observed
between conventional RR and proposed PoPPR method (p > 0.05). However, the new
PoPPR technique was significantly better at removing small PM2.5 particles
(<2.5 {\mu}m) compared to the RR method, specifically for microbeads (p =
0.006) and nanoparticles (p < 0.001).
  Conclusion: This proof-of-concept work demonstrates that the PoPPR method of
cleaning contact lenses is as effective as the conventional cleaning method for
larger particles such as pollen. The PoPPR method is more effective at removing
extremely fine particulate pollutants, including microplastics and
nanoparticles. This method offers a potentially more efficient cleaning
protocol that could enhance the safety, health, and comfort of contact lens
users, especially those living in regions with significant air pollution.

subsequent pandemic led to an immense disruption in the daily lives of almost
everyone on the planet. Faced with the consequences of inaction, most national
governments responded with policies that restricted the activities conducted by
their inhabitants. As schools and businesses shuttered, the mobility of these
people decreased. This reduction in mobility, and related activities, was
recorded through ubiquitous location-enabled personal mobile devices. Patterns
emerged that varied by place-based activity. In this work the differences in
these place-based activity patterns are investigated across nations,
specifically focusing on the relationship between government enacted policies
and changes in community activity patterns. We show that people's activity
response to government action varies widely both across nations as well as
regionally within them. Three assessment measures are devised and the results
correlate with a number of global indices. We discuss these findings and the
relationship between government action and residents' response.

cisternae are displayed at the plasma membrane as cell identity markers. The
modified proteins, called glycans, represent a molecular code. The fidelity of
this glycan code is measured by how accurately the glycan synthesis machinery
realises the desired target glycan distribution for a particular cell type and
niche. In this paper, we quantitatively analyse the tradeoffs between the
number of cisternae and the number and specificity of enzymes, in order to
synthesize a prescribed target glycan distribution of a certain complexity. We
find that to synthesize complex distributions, such as those observed in real
cells, one needs to have multiple cisternae and precise enzyme partitioning in
the Golgi. Additionally, for fixed number of enzymes and cisternae, there is an
optimal level of specificity of enzymes that achieves the target distribution
with high fidelity. Our results show how the complexity of the target glycan
distribution places functional constraints on the Golgi cisternal number and
enzyme specificity.

allows to drop the necessity of phonetic models in hybrid ASR. We study it
under different settings and demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with
underrepresented NEs. Next, we study the impact of neural language model (LM)
with letter-based features derived to handle infrequent words. After that, we
attempt to enrich representations of underrepresented NEs in pretrained neural
LM by borrowing the embedding representations of rich-represented words. This
let us gain significant performance improvement on underrepresented NE
recognition. Finally, we boost the likelihood scores of utterances containing
NEs in the word lattices rescored by neural LMs and gain further performance
improvement. The combination of the aforementioned approaches improves NE

problems on graphs with a cost function that is a sum of terms corresponding to
the edges. When conjugating an edge term, the QAOA unitary at depth p produces
an operator that depends only on the subgraph consisting of edges that are at
most p away from the edge in question. On random d-regular graphs, with d fixed
and with p a small constant time log n, these neighborhoods are almost all
trees and so the performance of the QAOA is determined only by how it acts on
an edge in the middle of tree. Both bipartite random d-regular graphs and
general random d-regular graphs locally are trees so the QAOA's performance is
the same on these two ensembles. Using this we can show that the QAOA with
$(d-1)^{2p} < n^A$ for any $A<1$, can only achieve an approximation ratio of
1/2 for Max-Cut on bipartite random d-regular graphs for d large. For Maximum

prediction systems, which consist of many perturbed numerical weather
simulations, or trajectories, run in parallel. These systems are associated
with a high computational cost and often involve statistical post-processing
steps to inexpensively improve their raw prediction qualities. We propose a
mixed model that uses only a subset of the original weather trajectories
combined with a post-processing step using deep neural networks. These enable
the model to account for non-linear relationships that are not captured by
current numerical models or post-processing methods. Applied to global data,
our mixed models achieve a relative improvement in ensemble forecast skill
(CRPS) of over 14%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the improvement is larger
for extreme weather events on select case studies. We also show that our
post-processing can use fewer trajectories to achieve comparable results to the
full ensemble. By using fewer trajectories, the computational costs of an
ensemble prediction system can be reduced, allowing it to run at higher
resolution and produce more accurate forecasts.

to confounding. Identifying a set of appropriate covariates (adjustment set)
and adjusting for their influence can remove confounding bias; however, such a
set is typically not identifiable from observational data alone. Experimental
data do not have confounding bias, but are typically limited in sample size and
can therefore yield imprecise estimates. Furthermore, experimental data often
include a limited set of covariates, and therefore provide limited insight into
the causal structure of the underlying system. In this work we introduce a
method that combines large observational and limited experimental data to
identify adjustment sets and improve the estimation of causal effects. The
method identifies an adjustment set (if possible) by calculating the marginal
likelihood for the experimental data given observationally-derived prior
probabilities of potential adjustmen sets. In this way, the method can make
inferences that are not possible using only the conditional dependencies and
independencies in all the observational and experimental data. We show that the
method successfully identifies adjustment sets and improves causal effect
estimation in simulated data, and it can sometimes make additional inferences
when compared to state-of-the-art methods for combining experimental and
observational data.

deliver unique insights into their rotational periods, the distribution of
cloud structures, weather, and orbital parameters. As the host star is occulted
by the coronagraph, a speckle grid (SG) is introduced to serve as astrometric
and photometric reference. Speckle grids are implemented as diffractive
pupil-plane optics that generate artificial speckles at known location and
brightness. Their performance is limited by the underlying speckle halo caused
by evolving uncorrected wavefront errors. The speckle halo will interfere with
the coherent SGs, affecting their photometric and astrometric precision. Our
aim is to show that by imposing opposite amplitude or phase modulation on the
opposite polarization states, a SG can be instantaneously incoherent with the
underlying halo, greatly increasing the precision. We refer to these as vector
speckle grids (VSGs). We derive analytically the mechanism by which the
incoherency arises and explore the performance gain in idealised simulations
under various atmospheric conditions. We show that the VSG is completely
incoherent for unpolarized light and that the fundamental limiting factor is
the cross-talk between the speckles in the grid. In simulation, we find that
for short-exposure images the VSG reaches a $\sim$0.3-0.8\% photometric error
and $\sim$$3-10\cdot10^{-3}$ $\lambda/D$ astrometric error, which is a
performance increase of a factor $\sim$20 and $\sim$5, respectively.
Furthermore, we outline how VSGs could be implemented using liquid-crystal
technology to impose the geometric phase on the circular polarization states.
The VSG is a promising new method for generating a photometric and astrometric

extensively studied and made significant progress by leveraging the advanced
machine learning techniques based on deep convolutional neural networks

single hyperspectral image super-resolution due to the high-dimensional and
complex spectral patterns in hyperspectral image. In this paper, we make a step
forward by investigating how to adapt state-of-the-art residual learning based
single gray/RGB image super-resolution approaches for computationally efficient
single hyperspectral image super-resolution, referred as SSPSR. Specifically,
we introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit the
spatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the
hyperspectral data. Considering that the hyperspectral training samples are
scarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral image data is very high, it
is nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore, a group
convolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling
framework is proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature
extraction due to high-dimension of the hyperspectral data, but also make the
training process more stable. To exploit the spatial and spectral prior, we
design a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual
module and a spectral attention residual module. Experimental results on some
hyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SSPSR method enhances the
details of the recovered high-resolution hyperspectral images, and outperforms
state-of-the-arts. The source code is available at

systems are well suited for feedforward control. This is especially true when
the delay between a disturbance and the output is larger than the control

general class of $2 \times 2$ hyperbolic systems with a single disturbance
input located at one boundary and a single control actuation at the other
boundary. The goal is to design a feedforward control that makes the system
output insensitive to the measured disturbance input. We show that, for this
class of systems, there exists an efficient ideal feedforward controller which
is causal and stable. The problem is first stated and studied in the frequency
domain for a simple linear system. Then, our main contribution is to show how
the theory can be extended, in the time domain, to general nonlinear hyperbolic
systems. The method is illustrated with an application to the control of an
open channel represented by Saint- Venant equations where the objective is to
make the output water level insensitive to the variations of the input flow
rate. Finally, we address a more complex application to a cascade of pools
where a blind application of perfect feedforward control can lead to
detrimental oscillations. A pragmatic way of modifying the control law to solve
this problem is proposed and validated with a simulation experiment.

Boutonnet, Ioana and Peterson as a tool to study rigidity properties of certain

present paper, we establish the proper proximality of many groups acting on
nonpositively curved spaces.
  First, these include many countable groups $G$ acting properly
nonelementarily by isometries on a proper $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space $X$. More
precisely, proper proximality holds in the presence of rank one isometries or
when $X$ is a locally thick affine building with a minimal $G$-action. As a
consequence of Rank Rigidity, we derive the proper proximality of all countable
nonelementary $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cubical groups, and of all countable groups
acting properly cocompactly nonelementarily by isometries on either a Hadamard
manifold with no Euclidean factor, or on a $2$-dimensional piecewise Euclidean

finite-type boundaryless surfaces (apart from a few low-complexity cases), thus
answering a question raised by Boutonnet, Ioana and Peterson. We also prove the

applications to structural and rigidity results for von Neumann algebras

magnitude and the sign, has great application prospects due to its
theoretically unbounded and orthogonal modes. Here, the sign-distinguishable
OAM measurement in optomechanics is proposed, which is achieved by monitoring
the shift of the transmission spectrum of the probe field in a double
Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) rotational-cavity system. Compared with the traditional
single LG rotational cavity, an asymmetric optomechanically induced
transparency window can occur in our system. Meanwhile, the position of the
resonance valley has a strong correlation with the magnitude and sign of OAM.
This originally comes from the fact that the effective detuning of the cavity
mode from the driving field can vary with the magnitude and sign of OAM, which
causes the spectral shift to be directional for different signs of OAM. Our
scheme solves the shortcoming of the inability to distinguish the sign of OAM
in optomechanics, and works well for high-order vortex beams with topological
charge value $\pm 45$, which is a significant improvement for measuring OAM
based on the cavity optomechanical system.

scenario well, in this work, end users can set the charge time flexibly
according to their own situation rather than reducing the charge time as much
as possible; this is possible by using soft actor-critic (SAC), which is one of
the state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. In this way, the
battery is more likely to extend its life without disturbing the end-users. The
amount of aging is calculated quantitatively based on an accurate
electrochemical battery model, which is directly minimized in the optimization
procedure with SAC. SAC can deal with not only the flexible charge time but
also varying parameters of the battery model caused by aging once the offline
learning is completed, which is not the case for the previous studies; in the
previous studies, time-consuming optimization has to be implemented for each
battery model with a certain set of parameter values. The validation results
show that the proposed method can both extend the battery life effectively and
ensure the end-user convenience.

perform poorly on non-target sounds which are unseen during the training stage,
causing high false alarm rates in real-world scenarios. In reality, keyword
spotting is a detection problem where predefined target keywords are detected
from a variety of unknown sounds. This shares many similarities to metric
learning problems in that the unseen and unknown non-target sounds must be
clearly differentiated from the target keywords. However, a key difference is
that the target keywords are known and predefined. To this end, we propose a
new method based on metric learning that maximises the distance between target
and non-target keywords, but also learns per-class weights for target keywords

guaranteed to have an exact recovery from $O(s^2\log n)$ samples. Since the

popular first-order algorithms, our algorithm is extremely efficient.
Experimental results show that our algorithm can be several times faster than

interest is driven by the need to determine accurately the $\beta$-intensity
distributions of fission products that contribute significantly to the reactor
decay heat and to the antineutrinos emitted by reactors. A number of such
decays have large ground state branches. The method is relevant for nuclear
structure studies as well. Pertinent formulae are revised and extended to the
special case of $\beta$-delayed neutron emitters, and the robustness of the
method is demonstrated with synthetic data. We apply it to a number of measured
decays that serve as test cases and discuss the features of the method.
Finally, we obtain ground state feeding intensities with reduced uncertainty
for four relevant decays that will allow future improvements in antineutrino

establish relations between the two factorization theories and prove the

procedures for high-order continuous Galerkin (CG) finite element
discretizations of scalar conservation laws. We prove that the standard CG
method is entropy conservative for the square entropy. In general, the rate of
entropy production/dissipation depends on the residual of the governing
equation and on the accuracy of the finite element approximation to the entropy
variable. The inclusion of linear high-order stabilization generates an
additional source/sink in the entropy budget equation. To balance the amount of
entropy production in each cell, we construct entropy-dissipative element
contributions using a coercive bilinear form and a parameter-free entropy
viscosity coefficient. The entropy stabilization term is high-order consistent,
and optimal convergence behavior is achieved in practice. To enforce
preservation of local bounds in addition to entropy stability, we use the
Bernstein basis representation of the finite element solution and a new subcell
flux limiting procedure. The underlying inequality constraints ensure the
validity of localized entropy conditions and local maximum principles. The
benefits of the proposed modifications are illustrated by numerical results for
linear and nonlinear test problems.

computing. Among asynchronous, randomized, and signature-free implementations,
the protocols of Most\'efaoui et al. (PODC 2014 and JACM 2015) represent a
landmark result, which has been extended later and taken up in practical
systems. The protocols achieve optimal resilience and takes, in expectation,
only a constant expected number of rounds of quadratic message complexity.
Randomization is provided through a common-coin primitive. In traditional
consensus protocols, all involved processes adhere to a global, symmetric
failure model, typically only defined by bounds on the number of faulty
processes. Motivated by applications to blockchains, however, more flexible
trust assumptions have recently been considered. In particular, with asymmetric
trust, a process is free to choose which other processes it trusts and which
ones might collude against it. This paper revisits the optimal asynchronous
protocol of Most\'efaoui et al. and shows how to realize it with asymmetric
trust. The paper starts by pointing out in detail why some versions of this
protocol may violate liveness. Then it proposes a fix for the protocol that
does not affect its properties, but lets it regain the simplicity of its
original version (PODC 2014). At the same time, the paper shows how to realize
randomized signature-free asynchronous Byzantine consensus with asymmetric
quorums. This results in an optimal consensus protocol with subjective,
asymmetric trust and constant expected running time. It is suitable for
applications to blockchains, for instance.

  To this end, we focus mainly on ODEs consisting of generalized polynomials,

property termed zero sensitivity at a coordinate $x_i$, which means that the
tangent space is contained in a hyperplane of the form $x_i=c$, and provide a
criterion to identify it. We consider the global property termed absolute
concentration robustness (ACR), meaning that all steady states are contained in
a hyperplane of the form $x_i=c$.
  We clarify and formalise the relation between the two approaches. In
particular, we show that ACR implies zero sensitivity, and identify when the
two properties do not agree, via an intermediate property we term local ACR.

whether the initial pattern wavelength scales with the particle diameter or
with the mean fluid height. A previous study (Kidanemariam and Uhlmann, J.
Fluid Mech., vol. 818, 2017, pp. 716-743) has observed a lower bound for the
most unstable pattern wavelength in the range 75-100 times the particle

current paper, we vary the streamwise box length in terms of the particle
diameter and of the mean fluid height independently in order to distinguish
between the two possible scaling relations. For the chosen parameter range, the
obtained results clearly exhibit a scaling of the initial pattern wavelength
with the particle diameter, with a lower bound around a streamwise extent of
approximately 80 particle diameters. In longer domains, on the other hand,
patterns are observed at initial wavelengths in the range 150-180 times the
particle diameter, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements.
Variations of the mean fluid height, on the other hand, seem to have no
significant influence on the most unstable initial pattern wavelength.
Furthermore, for the cases with the largest relative submergence, we observe
spanwise and streamwise sediment waves of similar amplitude to evolve and
superimpose, leading to three-dimensional sediment patterns.

mechanisms such as the Collect & Collapse (C&C) or the Radiation Driven

two zones located in the Photo Dissociation Region (PDR) of the Galactic HII

young star contents found in both clumps. Using the APEX telescope, we mapped
two regions of size 1.5'$\times$1.5' toward the most massive clump of RCW120
hosting young massive sources and toward a clump showing a protrusion inside
the HII region and hosting more evolved low-mass sources. The

No strong evidences have been found concerning the impact of far ultraviolet

both in terms of strong norms (oscillation) and weak norms (fluctuation). These
estimates are optimal in terms of scaling in the ratio between the microscopic
and the macroscopic scale. The purpose of this article is to highlight the
usage of the recently introduced annealed Calderon-Zygmund (CZ) estimates in
obtaining the above, previously known, error estimates. Moreover, the article
provides a novel proof of these annealed CZ estimate that completely avoids
quenched regularity theory, but rather relies on functional analysis. It is
based on the observation that even on the level of operator norms, the
Helmholtz projection is close to the one for the homogenized coefficient (for
which annealed CZ estimates are easily obtained). In this article, we strive
for simple proofs, and thus restrict ourselves to ensembles of coefficient
fields that are local transformations of Gaussian random fields with integrable
correlations and H\""older continuous realizations. As in earlier work, we use
the natural objects from the general theory of homogenization, like the
(potential and flux) correctors and the homogenization commutator. Both
oscillation and fluctuation estimates rely on a sensitivity calculus, i.e. on
estimating how sensitively the quantity of interest does depend on an
infinitesimal change in the coefficient field, which is fed into the Spectral
Gap inequality. In this article, the annealed CZ estimate is the only form in

dark energy that has its origin in the String-Axiverse scenario. The model has
been confronted with the latest cosmological observations. The results show
that a sub-Planckian value of the axion field decay constant is consistent with
observational data. Furthermore, in terms of the observational data considered
in this work, the axion model is preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model in terms
of AIC, BIC information criteria as well as in terms of Bayesian evidence. The
oscillating feature in the scalar field evolution and in the equation of state
for the dark energy can be observed for the allowed parameters space. It is
also observed that cluster number counts in this axion model are suppressed
compared to the $\Lambda$CDM and this suppression is enhanced for the
sub-Planckian values for the axion decay constant.

mean magnetic field, an anisotropy develops relative to that preferred
direction. The well-known tendency is to develop stronger gradients
perpendicular to the magnetic field, relative to the direction along the field.
This anisotropy of the spectrum is deeply connected with anisotropy of
estimated timescales for dynamical processes, and requires reconsideration of
basic issues such as scale locality and spectral transfer. Here analysis of
high-resolution three-dimensional simulations of unforced magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence permits quantitative assessment of the behavior of theoretically
relevant timescales in Fourier wavevector space. We discuss the distribution of
nonlinear times, Alfv\'en times, and estimated spectral transfer rates.
Attention is called to the potential significance of special regions of the
spectrum, such as the two-dimensional limit and the ""critical balance"" region.
A formulation of estimated spectral transfer in terms of a suppression factor
supports a conclusion that the quasi two-dimensional fluctuations
(characterized by strong nonlinearities) are not a singular limit, but may be
in general expected to make important contributions.

that the answer is yes: modern Encoder-Decoder (ED) architectures learn
human-like behavior when inflecting English verbs, such as extending the
regular past tense form -(e)d to novel words. However, their work does not
address the criticism raised by Marcus et al. (1995): that neural models may
learn to extend not the regular, but the most frequent class -- and thus fail
on tasks like German number inflection, where infrequent suffixes like -s can
still be productively generalized.
  To investigate this question, we first collect a new dataset from German
speakers (production and ratings of plural forms for novel nouns) that is
designed to avoid sources of information unavailable to the ED model. The
speaker data show high variability, and two suffixes evince 'regular' behavior,
appearing more often with phonologically atypical inputs. Encoder-decoder
models do generalize the most frequently produced plural class, but do not show
human-like variability or 'regular' extension of these other plural markers. We
conclude that modern neural models may still struggle with minority-class

approach is individual based models (IBMs), but these are often time intensive
and computationally expensive to implement, requiring a high degree of
expertise and computational resources. More often, decision makers need to know
the effects of potential public policy decisions in a very short time window
using limited resources. This paper presents an estimation algorithm for an IBM

limited by the need to store multi-dimensional PDF tables that can take up
large amounts of memory. A significant saving in storage can be achieved by
using various machine-learning techniques that represent the thermo-chemical
quantities of a PDF table using mathematical functions. These functions can be
computationally more expensive than the existing interpolation methods used for
thermo-chemical quantities. More importantly, the training time can amount to a
considerable portion of the simulation time. In this work, we address these
issues by introducing an adaptive training algorithm that relies on multi-layer
perception (MLP) neural networks for regression and self-organizing maps (SOMs)
for clustering data to tabulate using different networks. The algorithm is
designed to address both the multi-dimensionality of the PDF table as well as
the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. SOM clustering divides
the PDF table into several parts based on similarities in data. Each cluster of
data is trained using an MLP algorithm on simple network architectures to
generate local functions for thermo-chemical quantities. The algorithm is
validated for the so-called DLR-A turbulent jet diffusion flame using both RANS
and LES simulations and the results of the PDF tabulation are compared to the
standard linear interpolation method. The comparison yields a very good
agreement between the two tabulation techniques and establishes the MLP-SOM
approach as a viable method for PDF tabulation.

standard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained

GINN focuses exclusively on intervals for mining the feature representation of
a program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling
the learning to large graphs. We evaluate GINN for two popular downstream
applications: variable misuse prediction and method name prediction. Results
show in both cases GINN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a
comfortable margin. We have also created a neural bug detector based on GINN to
catch null pointer deference bugs in Java code. While learning from the same
9,000 methods extracted from 64 projects, GINN-based bug detector significantly
outperforms GNN-based bug detector on 13 unseen test projects. Next, we deploy
our trained GINN-based bug detector and Facebook Infer to scan the codebase of
20 highly starred projects on GitHub. Through our manual inspection, we confirm
38 bugs out of 102 warnings raised by GINN-based bug detector compared to 34

continuous bounded semigroups satisfying certain conditions.
  The conditions allow to define a family of moduli of continuity
$\Omega^{r}(s,f),\>r\in \mathbb{N}, s>0,$ of vectors in ${\bf H}$ and a family
of Paley-Wiener subspaces $PW_{\sigma}$ parametrized by bandwidth $\sigma>0$.
  These subspaces are explored to introduce notion of the best approximation
$\mathcal{E}(\sigma, f)$ of a general vector in ${\bf H}$ by Paley-Wiener
vectors of a certain bandwidth $\sigma>0$. The main objective of the paper is
to prove the so-called Jackson-type estimate $\mathcal{E}(\sigma, f)\leq
C\left( \Omega^{r}(\sigma^{-1},f)+\sigma^{-r}\|f\|\right)$ for $\sigma>1$.
  It was shown in our previous publications that our assumptions are satisfied
for a strongly continuous unitary representation of a Lie group $G$ in a
Hilbert space ${\bf H}$. This way we obtain the Jackson-type estimates on
homogeneous manifolds.

them from first principles, and frequently their use is justified a posteriori.
In this work we extract nonlocal models from data, circumventing these
challenges and providing data-driven justification for the resulting model
form. Extracting provably robust data-driven surrogates is a major challenge
for machine learning (ML) approaches, due to nonlinearities and lack of
convexity. Our scheme allows extraction of provably invertible nonlocal models
whose kernels may be partially negative. To achieve this, based on established
nonlocal theory, we embed in our algorithm sufficient conditions on the
non-positive part of the kernel that guarantee well-posedness of the learnt
operator. These conditions are imposed as inequality constraints and ensure
that models are robust, even in small-data regimes. We demonstrate this
workflow for a range of applications, including reproduction of manufactured
nonlocal kernels; numerical homogenization of Darcy flow associated with a
heterogeneous periodic microstructure; nonlocal approximation to high-order
local transport phenomena; and approximation of globally supported fractional
diffusion operators by truncated kernels.

by delay differential equations (DDEs). Studying the stability of dynamic
systems is critical, but analyzing the stability of time-delay systems is
challenging because DDEs are infinite-dimensional. We propose a new approach to
quickly generate stability charts for DDEs using continuation of characteristic
roots (CCR). In our CCR method, the roots of the characteristic equation of a
DDE are written as implicit functions of the parameters of interest, and the
continuation equations are derived in the form of ordinary differential
equations (ODEs). Numerical continuation is then employed to determine the
characteristic roots at all points in a parametric space; the stability of the
original DDE can then be easily determined. A key advantage of the proposed
method is that a system of linearly independent ODEs is solved rather than the
typical strategy of solving a large eigenvalue problem at each grid point in
the domain. Thus, the CCR method significantly reduces the computational effort
required to determine the stability of DDEs. As we demonstrate with several
examples, the CCR method generates highly accurate stability charts, and does
so up to 10 times faster than the Galerkin approximation method.

Carlson, Shenshen Wang","Aging-induced fragility of the immune system","23 pages, 7 figures",,,,"q-bio.TO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The adaptive and innate branches of the vertebrate immune system work in
close collaboration to protect organisms from harmful pathogens. As an organism
ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined
performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease
and death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate
and adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model.
This model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a
shape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and
exhibits three steady states -- health, septic death, and chronic inflammation
-- qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model,
the immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence
of pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a
proxy for the ""age"" of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen
encounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen
will cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic
inflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of ""inflammaging"", a
condition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade
inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the
onset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered
pathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of
infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate
and adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen
clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence.

approach, it seemingly fits into our daily lives and operations as well as
complex and interdisciplinary fields. With the rise of commercial, open-source
and user-catered ML tools, a key question often arises whenever ML is applied
to explore a phenomenon or a scenario: what constitutes a good ML model?
Keeping in mind that a proper answer to this question depends on a variety of
factors, this work presumes that a good ML model is one that optimally performs
and best describes the phenomenon on hand. From this perspective, identifying
proper assessment metrics to evaluate performance of ML models is not only
necessary but is also warranted. As such, this paper examines a number of the
most commonly-used performance fitness and error metrics for regression and
classification algorithms, with emphasis on engineering applications.
