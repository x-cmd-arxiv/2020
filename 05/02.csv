We say that $G$ has an abelian partition, if
there exists a partition of $G$ into commuting subsets $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$
of $G$, such that $|A_i|\geqslant 2$ for each $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$. This paper
investigates problems relating to group with abelian partitions. Among other
results, we show that every finite group is isomorphic to a subgroup of a group
with an abelian partition and also isomorphic to a subgroup of a group with no
abelian partition. We also find bounds for the minimum number of partitions for
several families of groups which admit abelian partitions -- with exact
calculations in some cases. Finally, we examine how the size of partitions with
the minimum number of parts behaves with respect to the direct product.

modeling the brain connectome as a graph and in using graph metrics as

node level. Given the relatively reduced number of patients in standard
cohorts, such data analysis problems fall in the high-dimension low sample size
framework. In this context, our goal is to provide a machine learning technique
that exhibits flexibility, gives the investigator grip on the features and
covariates, allows visualization and exploration, and yields insight into the
data and the biological phenomena at stake. The retained approach is dimension
reduction in a manifold learning methodology, the originality lying in that one
(or several) reduced variables be chosen by the investigator. The proposed
method is illustrated on two studies, the first one addressing comatose
patients, the second one addressing young versus elderly population comparison.
The method sheds light on the graph metrics and underlying neurobiological

the intriguing question whether every sequence is computably random with

follow an involved path from formulas to counter-free automata to star-free

metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have triggered intense research efforts by the
scientific community. An alternative to induce long-range ferromagnetism (FM)
in TMDs is by introducing magnetic dopants to form a dilute magnetic
semiconductor. Enhancing ferromagnetism in these semiconductors not only
represents a key step towards modern TMD-based spintronics, but also enables
exploration of new and exciting dimensionality-driven magnetic phenomena. To
this end, we show tunable ferromagnetism at room temperature and a thermally
induced spin flip (TISF) in monolayers of V-doped WSe2. As vanadium
concentrations increase within the WSe2 monolayers the saturation magnetization
increases, and it is optimal at ~4at.% vanadium; the highest doping/alloying
level ever achieved for V-doped WSe2 monolayers. The TISF occurs at ~175 K and
becomes more pronounced upon increasing the temperature towards room
temperature. We demonstrate that TISF can be manipulated by changing the
vanadium concentration within the WSe2 monolayers. We attribute TISF to the
magnetic field and temperature dependent flipping of the nearest W-site
magnetic moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to the V magnetic
moments in the ground state. This is fully supported by a recent spin-polarized
density functional theory calculation. Our findings pave the way for the
development of novel spintronic and valleytronic nanodevices based on
atomically thin magnetic semiconductors and stimulate further studies in this
rapidly expanding research field of 2D magnetism.

cannot sufficiently explain a black-box machine learning model using a single
method that gives only one perspective. Isolated explanations are prone to
misunderstanding, leading to wrong or simplistic reasoning. This problem is
known as the Rashomon effect and refers to diverse, even contradictory,
interpretations of the same phenomenon. Surprisingly, most methods developed
for explainable and responsible machine learning focus on a single-aspect of
the model behavior. In contrast, we showcase the problem of explainability as
an interactive and sequential analysis of a model. This paper proposes how
different Explanatory Model Analysis (EMA) methods complement each other and
discusses why it is essential to juxtapose them. The introduced process of
Interactive EMA (IEMA) derives from the algorithmic side of explainable machine
learning and aims to embrace ideas developed in cognitive sciences. We
formalize the grammar of IEMA to describe potential human-model dialogues. It
is implemented in a widely used human-centered open-source software framework
that adopts interactivity, customizability and automation as its main traits.
We conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of IEMA, which indicates
that an interactive sequential analysis of a model increases the performance

predicting its facial landmarks using our supervised spatial and channel-wise

chiral symmetry breaking in both confined and deconfined phases. In the chiral

restored phase to a chirally broken phase. The transition becomes a crossover
as the quark mass increases. Due to a scaling in the temperature, the chiral
transition will also be interpreted as a transition in the temperature for

Two distinct types of dimension reduction are ""data-oblivious"" methods such as

projections, and data-adaptivity for PCA. In this work, we study how to combine

random projection (or sketch) first, and compute PCA after. We compute the
performance of several popular sketching methods (random iid projections,
random sampling, subsampled Hadamard transform, count sketch, etc) in a general
""signal-plus-noise"" (or spiked) data model. Compared to well-known works, our
results (1) give asymptotically exact results, and (2) apply when the signal
components are only slightly above the noise, but the projection dimension is
non-negligible. We also study stronger signals allowing more general covariance
structures. We find that (a) signal strength decreases under projection in a
delicate way depending on the structure of the data and the sketching method,
(b) orthogonal projections are more accurate, (c) randomization does not hurt
too much, due to concentration of measure, (d) count sketch can be improved by
a normalization method. Our results have implications for statistical learning

inhomogeneous ferroelectric order via Raman scattering. These results suggest
that the strain surrounding the self-organized dislocation structures induces

(INU) within a given tissue type is a crucial issue for quantitative MRI image
analysis in daily clinical practice. In this study, we present a deep
learning-based approach for MRI image INU correction.
  Method: We developed a residual cycle generative adversarial network
(res-cycle GAN), which integrates the residual block concept into a
cycle-consistent GAN (cycle-GAN). In cycle-GAN, an inverse transformation was
implemented between the INU uncorrected and corrected MRI images to constrain
the model through forcing the calculation of both an INU corrected MRI and a
synthetic corrected MRI. A fully convolution neural network integrating
residual blocks was applied in the generator of cycle-GAN to enhance end-to-end
raw MRI to INU corrected MRI transformation. A cohort of 30 abdominal patients
with T1-weighted MR INU images and their corrections with a clinically
established and commonly used method, namely, N4ITK were used as a pair to
evaluate the proposed res-cycle GAN based INU correction algorithm.
Quantitatively comparisons were made among the proposed method and other
approaches.
  Result: Our res-cycle GAN based method achieved higher accuracy and better
tissue uniformity compared to the other algorithms. Moreover, once the model is
well trained, our approach can automatically generate the corrected MR images
in a few minutes, eliminating the need for manual setting of parameters.
  Conclusion: In this study, a deep learning based automatic INU correction
method in MRI, namely, res-cycle GAN has been investigated. The results show
that learning based methods can achieve promising accuracy, while highly
speeding up the correction through avoiding the unintuitive parameter tuning
process in N4ITK correction.

often improves accuracy on two downstream tasks, despite lowering BLI test

different Stokes numbers. A finite-time measure to quantify the divergence of
the particle velocity by determining the volume change rate of the Voronoi
cells is proposed. For inertial particles the probability distribution function
(PDF) of the divergence deviates from that for fluid particles. Joint PDFs of
the divergence and the Voronoi volume illustrate that the divergence is most
prominent in cluster regions and less pronounced in void regions. For larger
volumes the results show negative divergence values which represent cluster
formation (i.e. particle convergence) and for small volumes the results show
positive divergence values which represents cluster destruction/void formation
(i.e. particle divergence). Moreover, when the Stokes number increases the
divergence takes larger values, which gives some evidence why fine clusters are
less observed for large Stokes numbers. Theoretical analyses further show that
the divergence for random particles in random flow satisfies a PDF
corresponding to the ratio of two independent variables following normal and
gamma distributions in one dimension. Extending this model to three dimensions,
the predicted PDF agrees reasonably well with Monte-Carlo simulations and DNS

such that each symbol appears only once in every row or column and a
transversal is a collection of cells which do not share the same row, column or

Euler. One of the most famous open problems in this area is a conjecture of
Ryser-Brualdi-Stein from 60s which says that every Latin square of order
$n\times n$ contains a transversal of order $n-1$. In this paper we prove the
existence of a transversal of order $n-O(\log{n}/\log{\log{n}})$, improving the
celebrated bound of $n-O(\log^2n)$ by Hatami and Shor. Our approach (different
from that of Hatami-Shor) is quite general and gives several other applications
as well. We obtain a new lower bound on a 40 year old conjecture of Brouwer on
the maximum matching in Steiner triple systems, showing that every such system
of order $n$ is guaranteed to have a matching of size
$n/3-O(\log{n}/\log{\log{n}})$. This substantially improves the current best
result of Alon, Kim and Spencer which has the error term of order

symbols in Latin arrays suffice to guarantee a full transversal, improving on
previously known bound of $n^{2-\varepsilon}$. The proofs combine in a novel
way the semirandom method together with the robust expansion properties of edge
coloured pseudorandom graphs to show the existence of a rainbow matching

  Reinforcement Learning?",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning to plan for long horizons is a central challenge in episodic
reinforcement learning problems. A fundamental question is to understand how
the difficulty of the problem scales as the horizon increases. Here the natural
measure of sample complexity is a normalized one: we are interested in the
number of episodes it takes to provably discover a policy whose value is
$\varepsilon$ near to that of the optimal value, where the value is measured by
the normalized cumulative reward in each episode. In a COLT 2018 open problem,
Jiang and Agarwal conjectured that, for tabular, episodic reinforcement
learning problems, there exists a sample complexity lower bound which exhibits
a polynomial dependence on the horizon -- a conjecture which is consistent with
all known sample complexity upper bounds. This work refutes this conjecture,
proving that tabular, episodic reinforcement learning is possible with a sample
complexity that scales only logarithmically with the planning horizon. In other
words, when the values are appropriately normalized (to lie in the unit
interval), this results shows that long horizon RL is no more difficult than
short horizon RL, at least in a minimax sense. Our analysis introduces two
ideas: (i) the construction of an $\varepsilon$-net for optimal policies whose
log-covering number scales only logarithmically with the planning horizon, and
(ii) the Online Trajectory Synthesis algorithm, which adaptively evaluates all
policies in a given policy class using sample complexity that scales with the
log-covering number of the given policy class. Both may be of independent
interest.

preheating in symmetric and asymmetric models of $\alpha$-attractors,
characterized by a hyperbolic field-space manifold. We show that the
generalized (asymmetric) E- and (symmetric) T-models exhibit identical
two-field dynamics during inflation for a wide range of initial conditions. The
resulting motion can be decomposed in two approximately single-field segments
connected by a sharp turn in field-space. The details of preheating can
nevertheless be different. For the T-model one main mass-scale dominates the
evolution of fluctuations of the spectator field, whereas for the E-model, a
competing mass-scale emerges due to the steepness of the potential away from
the inflationary plateau, leading to different contributions to parametric
resonance for small and large wave-numbers. Our linear multi-field analysis of
fluctuations indicates that for highly curved manifolds, both the E- and
T-models preheat almost instantaneously. For massless fields this is always due
to efficient tachyonic amplification of the spectator field, making
single-field results inaccurate. Interestingly, there is a parameter window
corresponding to $r={\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and massive fields, where the preheating
behavior is qualitatively and quantitatively different for symmetric and
asymmetric potentials. In that case, the E-model can completely preheat due to
self-resonance for values of the curvature where preheating in the T-model is
inefficient. This provides a first distinguishing feature between models that
otherwise behave identically, both at the single-field and multi-field level.
Finally, we discuss how one can describe multi-field preheating on a hyperbolic
manifold by identifying the relevant mass-scales that control the growth of
inflaton and spectator fluctuations, which can be applied to any
$\alpha$-attractor model and beyond.

Way. The terminal line-of-sight wind velocities of the WC8 and WN4-6b stars are
measured to be $2100 \pm 200$ and $3500 \pm 100$ km s$^{-1}$, respectively. If
the mass-loss rate of the two stars are typical for their spectral class, the
momentum ratio of the colliding winds is expected to be $\approx$ 0.4. Since
the expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either
of the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the
Wolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic. We can recover a shock-compressed wind
velocity consistent with the observed dust expansion velocity if the WC8 star
produces a significantly slow equatorial wind with a velocity of $\approx$530
km s$^{-1}$. Such slow wind speeds can be driven by near-critical rotation of a
Wolf-Rayet star.

insufficient to fully capture the equilibrium orbital behavior in both

Recent hydrodynamical
simulations show that (i) discs can break into distinct planes when the
amplitude of an imposed warp is sufficiently high and the viscosity
sufficiently low, and that (ii) discs can tear up into discrete rings when an
initially planar disc is subject to a forced precession. Previously, we
investigated the local stability of isolated, Keplerian, warped discs in order
to understand the physics causing an accretion disc to break into distinct
planes, finding that anti-diffusion of the warp amplitude is the underlying
cause. Here, we explore the behaviour of this instability in disc regions where
the rotation profile deviates from Keplerian. We find that at small warp
amplitudes non-Keplerian rotation can stabilize the disc by increasing the
critical warp amplitude for instability, while at large warp amplitudes
non-Keplerian rotation can lead to an increased growth rate for discs that are
unstable. Tidal effects on discs in binary systems are typically weak enough
such that the disc remains close to Keplerian rotation. However, the inner
regions of discs around black holes are strongly affected, with the smallest
radius at which the disc can break into discrete planes being a function of the
black hole spin. We suggest that interpreting observed frequencies in the power
spectra of light curves from accreting compact objects as nodal and apsidal
precession of discrete orbits requires an instability that can break the disc
into discrete rings such as the one explored here.

some of which is in the form of spatially extended filaments spanning scales of
tens of kiloparsecs. These findings have raised questions about the origin of
the cold gas, as well as its relationship with the central active galactic
nucleus (AGN), whose feedback has been established as a ubiquitous feature in
such galaxy clusters. Here we report a radiation hydrodynamic simulation of AGN
feedback in a galaxy cluster, in which cold filaments form from the warm,
AGN-driven outflows with temperatures between $10^4$ and $10^7$ K as they rise
in the cluster core. Our analysis reveals a new mechanism, which, through the
combination of radiative cooling and ram pressure, naturally promotes outflows
whose cooling time is shorter than their rising time, giving birth to spatially
extended cold gas filaments. Our results strongly suggest that the formation of
cold gas and AGN feedback in galaxy clusters are inextricably linked and shed
light on how AGN feedback couples to the intracluster medium.

regained interest and need to be revisited with updated data and methods. In
this work we study the radiative wind model in the context of XRBs, with modern

study of observable magnitudes as a function of free model parameters. We
implement a spherically-symmetric non-relativistic wind model in a stationary
regime, with updated opacity tables and modern numerical techniques. Total mass
and energy outflows $(\dot M,\dot E)$ are treated as free parameters. A high
resolution parameter space exploration was performed to allow better
characterization of observable magnitudes. High correlation was found between
different photospheric magnitudes and free parameters. For instance, the
photospheric ratio of gravitational energy outflow to radiative luminosity is
in direct proportion to the photospheric wind velocity. The correlations found
could help determine the physical conditions of the inner layers, where nuclear
reactions take place, by means of observable photospheric values. Further
studies are needed to determine the range of physical conditions in which the

invariance. Maintaining the main features of the so-called 3-3-1 models, such
as the cancellation of gauge anomalies related to the number of chiral fermion
generations, this model exhibits a very compact scalar sector. Only two scalar
triplets and one singlet are necessary and sufficient to break the symmetries
dynamically via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. With the introduction of an
Abelian discrete symmetry and assuming a natural hierarchy among the vacuum
expectation values of the neutral scalar fields, we show that all particles in
the model can get phenomenologically consistent masses. In particular, most of
the standard fermion masses are generated via a seesaw mechanism involving some
extra heavy fermions introduced for consistency. This mechanism provides a
partial solution for the fermion mass hierarchy problem in the SM. Furthermore,
the simplicity of the scalar sector allows us to analytically find the
conditions for the potential stability up to one-loop level and show how they
can be easily satisfied. Some of the new particles, such as the scalars $H$,
$H^\pm$ and all the non-SM vector bosons, are predicted to get masses around
the TeV scale and, therefore, could be produced at the high-luminosity LHC.
Finally, we show that the model features a residual symmetry which leads to the
stability of a heavy neutral particle; the latter is expected to show up in
experiments as missing energy.

Our state-of-the-art calculation extends the available differential results by
one order in the perturbative expansion, and it is relevant for a precise
determination of the top-quark mass, including possible effects of the running
mass in the MSbar scheme. We consider variations of the scale at which the

15-point scale variation. This additional variation is crucial for a reliable

compute, for the first time, the invariant-mass distribution of the top-quark

the invariant-mass distribution in the MSbar scheme are compared with a recent

paradigm -- are equipped with sensors, data storage capability and intelligence
that enable them to route themselves from origin to destination without manual
intervention or central governance. In this self-organizing setting, containers
can autonomously place bids on transport services in a spot market setting.
However, for individual containers it may be difficult to learn good bidding
policies due to limited observations. By sharing information and costs between
one another, smart containers can jointly learn bidding policies, even though
simultaneously competing for the same transport capacity. We replicate this
behavior by learning stochastic bidding policies in a semi-cooperative multi
agent setting. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm based
on the policy gradient framework. Numerical experiments show that sharing
solely bids and acceptance decisions leads to stable bidding policies.
Additional system information only marginally improves performance; individual
job properties suffice to place appropriate bids. Furthermore, we find that
carriers may have incentives not to share information with the smart
containers. The experiments give rise to several directions for follow-up
research, in particular the interaction between smart containers and transport
services in self-organizing logistics.

performance by training multiple models (e.g., with different initializations)
and aggregating their predictions. This approach is commonly reserved for the
largest models, as it is commonly held that increasing the model size provides
a more substantial reduction in error than ensembling smaller models. However,
we show results from experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet that ensembles can
outperform single models with both higher accuracy and requiring fewer total
FLOPs to compute, even when those individual models' weights and
hyperparameters are highly optimized. Furthermore, this gap in improvement
widens as models become large. This presents an interesting observation that
output diversity in ensembling can often be more efficient than training larger
models, especially when the models approach the size of what their dataset can
foster. Instead of using the common practice of tuning a single large model,
one can use ensembles as a more flexible trade-off between a model's inference
speed and accuracy. This also potentially eases hardware design, e.g., an
easier way to parallelize the model across multiple workers for real-time or

giant stars observed by SDSS APOGEE and GALEX to demonstrate an empirical
relationship between NUV excess and rotational velocity (vsini). Beyond this
simple relationship, we find that NUV excess also correlates with rotation
period and with Rossby number in a manner that shares broadly similar trends to
those found in M dwarfs, including activity saturation among rapid rotators.
Our data also suggest that the most extremely rapidly rotating giants may
exhibit so-called ""super-saturation"", which could be caused by centrifugal
stripping of these stars rotating at a high fraction of breakup speed. As an
example application of our empirical rotation-activity relation, we demonstrate
that the NUV emission observed from a recently reported system comprising a red
giant with a black hole companion is fully consistent with arising from the

Morse theory in the space of Hamiltonian flows. As an example we analyze a
general family of timecrystalline Hamiltonians that is designed to model
polygonal, piecewise linear closed strings. The vertices correspond to the
locations of pointlike interaction centers; the string is akin a chain of
atoms, that are joined together by covalent bonds, modeled by the links of the

affected by its topology. For this we show that a knotty string is usually more
timecrystalline than a string with no self-entanglement. We also reveal a
relation between phase space topology and the occurrence of timecrystalline

event requires subsequent angular momentum removal for consistency with the
current Earth-Moon system. The early Moon may have been captured into the
evection resonance, occurring when the lunar perigee precession period equals
one year. It has been proposed that after a high-angular momentum giant impact,
evection removed the angular momentum excess from the Earth-Moon pair and
transferred it to Earth's orbit about the Sun. However, prior N-body
integrations suggest this result depends on the tidal model and chosen tidal
parameters. Here we examine the Moon's encounter with evection using a
complementary analytic description and the Mignard tidal model. While the Moon
is in resonance the lunar longitude of perigee librates, and if tidal evolution
excites the libration amplitude sufficiently, escape from resonance occurs. The
angular momentum drain produced by formal evection depends on how long the
resonance is maintained. We estimate that resonant escape occurs early, leading
to only a small reduction (~few to 10%) in the Earth-Moon system angular
momentum. Moon formation from a high-angular momentum impact would then require
other angular momentum removal mechanisms beyond standard libration in
evection, as have been suggested previously.

ultrasonic nondestructive characterization. This work presents a multiple
scattering theory for strongly scattering elastic media with general triaxial
heterogeneities. A closed analytical expression of the shape dependent
singularity of the anisotropic Green tensor for the homogeneous reference
medium is derived by introducing a proper nonorthogonal ellipsoidal coordinate.
Renormalized Dyson equation for the coherent wave field is then derived with
the help of Feynman diagram technique and the first order smoothing
approximation. The exact dispersion curves and the inverse Q-factors of
coherent waves in several representative medium models for the heterogeneous
lithosphere are calculated numerically. Numerical results for smallscale
heterogeneities with the aspect ratio varying from 1 to 7 show satisfactory
agreement with those obtained from real earthquakes. The results for velocity
dispersion give rise to a novel explanation to the formation mechanism of
different seismic phases. The new model has potential applications in

this paper, we extend the state-of the-art of training classifiers to jointly
deal with both forms of errorful data. We accomplish this by modeling noisy and
missing labels in multi-label images with a new Noise Modeling Network (NMN)
that follows our convolutional neural network (CNN), integrates with it,
forming an end-to-end deep learning system, which can jointly learn the noise
distribution and CNN parameters. The NMN learns the distribution of noise
patterns directly from the noisy data without the need for any clean training
data. The NMN can model label noise that depends only on the true label or is
also dependent on the image features. We show that the integrated NMN/CNN
learning system consistently improves the classification performance, for
different levels of label noise, on the MSR-COCO dataset and MSR-VTT dataset.
We also show that noise performance improvements are obtained when multiple
instance learning methods are used.

Non-Gaussian component analysis (SING) in which dimension reduction and feature

physical processes that are useless for communication: any message that passes
through them along a well-defined trajectory is completely erased. When two
such channels are used in a quantum superposition of two alternative orders,
they become able to transmit some amount of classical information, but still no
quantum information can pass through them. Here we show that the ability to
place N completely depolarising channels in a superposition of N alternative
causal orders enables a high-fidelity, heralded transmission of quantum
information with error vanishing as 1/N. This phenomenon highlights a
fundamental difference with the N = 2 case, where completely depolarising
channels are unable to transmit quantum data, even when placed in a
superposition of causal orders. The ability to place quantum channels in a
superposition of orders also leads to an increase of the classical

effective in retrieving specific instances of image patches; textual context
plays an important role in this process. Visually grounded language models
slightly outperform text-only language models in instance retrieval, but
greatly under-perform humans. We hope our analyses inspire future research in
understanding and improving the visual capabilities of language models.

from deterministic, but the phonological form of a noun and/or its meaning can
often provide imperfect clues. Here, we investigate the strength of those
clues. More specifically, we operationalize this by measuring how much
information, in bits, we can glean about declension class from knowing the form
and/or meaning of nouns. We know that form and meaning are often also
indicative of grammatical gender---which, as we quantitatively verify, can
itself share information with declension class---so we also control for gender.
We find for two Indo-European languages (Czech and German) that form and
meaning respectively share significant amounts of information with class (and
contribute additional information above and beyond gender). The three-way
interaction between class, form, and meaning (given gender) is also
significant. Our study is important for two reasons: First, we introduce a new

finding that form and meaning are relevant for the classification of nouns into
declensions. Secondly, we show not only that individual declensions classes
vary in the strength of their clues within a language, but also that these

which a particle is sequentially placed in contact with distinct thermal
environments and external forces. Thermodynamic properties are exactly
obtained, irrespective the number of reservoirs involved. In the presence of

efficiencies are investigated taking into account distinct external forces

merge two approaches to projective uniqueness in the literature. One is
primarily geometric and is due to McMullen, who showed that certain natural
operations on polytopes preserve projective uniqueness. The other is more
algebraic and is due to Gouveia, Macchia, Thomas, and Wiebe. They use certain
ideals associated to a polytope to verify a property called graphicality that
implies projective uniqueness. In this paper, we show that that McMullen's

Syntactic Question Abstraction and Retrieval (SQAR), a method to build a neural
semantic parser that translates a natural language (NL) query to a SQL logical
form (LF) with less than 1,000 annotated examples. SQAR first retrieves a
logical pattern from the train data by computing the similarity between NL
queries and then grounds a lexical information on the retrieved pattern in
order to generate the final LF. We validate SQAR by training models using
various small subsets of WikiSQL train data achieving up to 4.9% higher LF
accuracy compared to the previous state-of-the-art models on WikiSQL test set.
We also show that by using query-similarity to retrieve logical pattern, SQAR
can leverage a paraphrasing dataset achieving up to 5.9% higher LF accuracy
compared to the case where SQAR is trained by using only WikiSQL data. In
contrast to a simple pattern classification approach, SQAR can generate unseen
logical patterns upon the addition of new examples without re-training the
model. We also discuss an ideal way to create cost efficient and robust train
datasets when the data distribution can be approximated under a data-hungry

attribute to effective carbon-carbon interactions mediated by the electronic
spin ensemble. In particular, observations across the full range of hyperfine

orders of magnitude greater than that expected from homo-nuclear spin
couplings. Our results open intriguing opportunities to study the onset of

Dancer and Buffoni--Toland, but extending it to unbounded domains requires
contending with new potential limiting behavior relating to loss of
compactness. We obtain an exhaustive set of alternatives for the global
behavior of the solution curve that is sharp, with each possibility having a
direct analogue in the bifurcation theory of second-order ODEs.
  As a major application of the general theory, we construct global families of
internal hydrodynamic bores. These are traveling front solutions of the full
two-phase Euler equation in two dimensions. The fluids are confined to a
channel that is bounded above and below by rigid walls, with incompressible and
irrotational flow in each layer. Small-amplitude fronts for this system have
been obtained by several authors. We give the first large-amplitude result in
the form of continuous curves of elevation and depression bores. Following the
elevation curve to its extreme, we find waves whose interfaces either overturn
(develop a vertical tangent) or become exceptionally singular in that the flow
in both layers degenerates at a single point on the boundary. For the curve of
depression waves, we prove that either the interface overturns or it comes into
contact with the upper wall.

information-technology ecosystem and has aroused great attention in recent
years. While the impacts of social reinforcement on single-layer networks are
well-documented, extension to multilayer networks is needed to study how
reinforcement from different social circles influences the spreading dynamics.
To this end, we incorporate multilayer social reinforcement into
ignorant-spreader-ignorant (SIS) model on multiplex networks. Our theoretical
analysis combines pairwise method and mean-field theory and agrees well with
large-scale simulations. Surprisingly, we find this complex social contagion
mechanism triggers the emergence of bistability phenomena, where extinction and
outbreak states coexist. In particular, the hysteresis loop of stationary
prevalence occurs in this bistable region, explaining why the fight towards the
spread of rumors is protracted and difficult in modern society. Further, we
show that the final state of bistable regions depends on the initial density of
adopters, the critical value of which decreases as the contagion
transmissibility or the multilayer reinforcement increases. In particular, we
highlight two possible conditions for the outbreak of social contagion: to
possess large contagion transmissibility, or to possess large initial density
of adopters with strong multilayer reinforcement. Our results unveil the
non-negligible power of social reinforcement on multiplex networks, which sheds
lights on designing efficient strategies in spreading behaviors such as
marketing and promoting innovations.

Vehicle ReID is challenging due to 1) high intra-class variability (caused by
the dependency of shape and appearance on viewpoint), and 2) small inter-class
variability (caused by the similarity in shape and appearance between vehicles
produced by different manufacturers). To address these challenges, we propose a
Pose-Aware Multi-Task Re-Identification (PAMTRI) framework. This approach
includes two innovations compared with previous methods. First, it overcomes
viewpoint-dependency by explicitly reasoning about vehicle pose and shape via
keypoints, heatmaps and segments from pose estimation. Second, it jointly
classifies semantic vehicle attributes (colors and types) while performing
ReID, through multi-task learning with the embedded pose representations. Since
manually labeling images with detailed pose and attribute information is
prohibitive, we create a large-scale highly randomized synthetic dataset with
automatically annotated vehicle attributes for training. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of each proposed component, showing that PAMTRI
achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art on two mainstream
vehicle ReID benchmarks: VeRi and CityFlow-ReID. Code and models are available

matrix method. The temporal evolution of the quasinormal modes is investigated
by using the finite difference method. Through numerical simulations, the
properties of the quasinormal frequencies are analyzed, including those for the
extremal black holes. Among others, we explore the case of a second type of
extremal black holes regarding the Nariai solution, where the cosmical and
event horizon coincide. The results obtained by the WKB approaches are found to
be mostly consistent with those by the matrix method. It is demonstrated that
the black hole solutions for Rastall gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes
are equivalent to those in Einstein gravity, featured by different asymptotical
spacetime properties. As one of its possible consequences, we also investigate
the behavior of the late-time tails of quasinormal models in the present model.
It is found that the asymptotical behavior of the late-time tails of
quasinormal modes in Rastall theory is governed by the asymptotical properties

manipulation. Assuming that the devil-stick remains confined to the vertical
plane, the problem of juggling the stick between two symmetric configurations
is considered. Impulsive forces are applied to the stick intermittently and the
impulse of the force and its point of application are modeled as control inputs
to the system. The dynamics of the devil-stick due to the impulsive forces and
gravity is described by half-return maps between two Poincare sections; the
symmetric configurations are fixed points of these sections. A coordinate
transformation is used to convert the juggling problem to that of stabilization
of one of the fixed points. Inclusion of the coordinate transformation in the
dynamic model results in a nonlinear discrete-time system. A dead-beat design
for one of the inputs simplifies the control problem and results in a linear
time-invariant discrete-time system. Standard control techniques are used to
show that symmetric juggling can be achieved from arbitrary initial conditions.

for a fully-online collection of multiple strings, where a new character can be
prepended to any string in the collection at any time. The only previously
known algorithm for the problem, recently proposed by Takagi et al.
[Algorithmica 82(5): 1346-1377 (2020)], runs in $O(N \log \sigma)$ time and
$O(N)$ space on the word RAM model, where $N$ denotes the total length of the
strings and $\sigma$ denotes the alphabet size. Their algorithm makes heavy use
of the nearest marked ancestor (NMA) data structure on semi-dynamic trees, that
can answer queries and supports insertion of nodes in $O(1)$ amortized time on
the word RAM model. In this paper, we present a simpler fully-online
right-to-left algorithm that builds the suffix tree for a given string
collection in $O(N (\log \sigma + \log d))$ time and $O(N)$ space, where $d$ is
the maximum number of in-coming Weiner links to a node of the suffix tree. We
note that $d$ is bounded by the height of the suffix tree, which is further
bounded by the length of the longest string in the collection. The advantage of
this new algorithm is that it works on the pointer machine model, namely, it
does not use the complicated NMA data structures that involve table look-ups.
As a byproduct, we also obtain a pointer-machine algorithm for building the
directed acyclic word graph (DAWG) for a fully-online left-to-right collection
of multiple strings, which runs in $O(N (\log \sigma + \log d))$ time and
$O(N)$ space again without the aid of the NMA data structures.

caused by related to the intrusion of the negative peninsula: rapid changes of
the magnetic field around the intruding negative peninsula; precursor
brightening at the tip of the negative peninsula, including a cusp-shaped
brightening that shows a transient but significant downflow (~100 km/s) at a

rope that erupted with the X9.3 flare; and coronal brightening along the dark

the intrusion of the negative peninsula was critical in promoting the push-mode

semantic space such that words with similar meanings are close to each other
regardless of the language. These embeddings have been widely used in various
settings, such as cross-lingual transfer, where a natural language processing
(NLP) model trained on one language is deployed to another language. While the
cross-lingual transfer techniques are powerful, they carry gender bias from the
source to target languages. In this paper, we study gender bias in multilingual
embeddings and how it affects transfer learning for NLP applications. We create
a multilingual dataset for bias analysis and propose several ways for
quantifying bias in multilingual representations from both the intrinsic and
extrinsic perspectives. Experimental results show that the magnitude of bias in
the multilingual representations changes differently when we align the
embeddings to different target spaces and that the alignment direction can also
have an influence on the bias in transfer learning. We further provide
recommendations for using the multilingual word representations for downstream
tasks.

build a single pre-trained QA model, UnifiedQA, that performs surprisingly well
across 17 QA datasets spanning 4 diverse formats. UnifiedQA performs on par
with 9 different models that were trained on individual datasets themselves.
Even when faced with 12 unseen datasets of observed formats, UnifiedQA performs
surprisingly well, showing strong generalization from its out-of-format

specialized models results in a new state of the art on 6 datasets,

transportation systems for providing safety and valuable information, and yet
vulnerable to a number of attacks from passive eavesdropping to active
interfering. Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are important devices that can
mitigate the threats by detecting malicious behaviors. Furthermore, the
collaborations among vehicles in VANETs can improve the detection accuracy by
communicating their experiences between nodes. To this end, distributed machine
learning is a suitable framework for the design of scalable and implementable
collaborative detection algorithms over VANETs. One fundamental barrier to
collaborative learning is the privacy concern as nodes exchange data among
them. A malicious node can obtain sensitive information of other nodes by
inferring from the observed data. In this paper, we propose a
privacy-preserving machine-learning based collaborative IDS (PML-CIDS) for
VANETs. The proposed algorithm employs the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) to a class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems and
trains a classifier to detect the intrusions in the VANETs. We use the
differential privacy to capture the privacy notation of the PML-CIDS and
propose a method of dual variable perturbation to provide dynamic differential
privacy. We analyze theoretical performance and characterize the fundamental
tradeoff between the security and privacy of the PML-CIDS. We also conduct
numerical experiments using the NSL-KDD dataset to corroborate the results on
the detection accuracy, security-privacy tradeoffs, and design.

to demonstrate that the condition $d_N\gg \sqrt{N}$ is tight, in the sense that
the limiting distribution changes if $d_N\sim \sqrt{N}$ except in the high

that neutrons might have an exotic decay to a Dark Sector (DS). In this paper,
we explore a scenario where neutrons decay to a dark Dirac fermion $\chi$ and a
non-abelian dark gauge boson $W'$. We discuss the cosmological implications of
this scenario assuming DS particles are produced via freeze-in. In our proposed
scenario, DS has three portals with the SM sector: (1) the fermion portal
coming from the mixing of the neutron with $\chi$, (2) a scalar portal, and (3)
a non-renormalizable kinetic mixing between photon and dark gauge bosons which
induces a vector portal between the two sectors. We show that neither the
fermion portal nor the scalar portal should contribute to the production of the
particles in the early universe. Specifically, we argue that the maximum
temperature of the universe must be low enough to prevent the production of
$\chi$ in the early universe. In this paper, we rely on the vector portal to
connect the two sectors, and we discuss the phenomenological bounds on the
model. The main constraints come from ensuring the right relic abundance of
dark matter and evading the neutron star bounds. When dark gauge boson is very

  Relevance?","EACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although neural models have achieved impressive results on several NLP
benchmarks, little is understood about the mechanisms they use to perform
language tasks. Thus, much recent attention has been devoted to analyzing the
sentence representations learned by neural encoders, through the lens of
`probing' tasks. However, to what extent was the information encoded in
sentence representations, as discovered through a probe, actually used by the
model to perform its task? In this work, we examine this probing paradigm
through a case study in Natural Language Inference, showing that models can
learn to encode linguistic properties even if they are not needed for the task
on which the model was trained. We further identify that pretrained word
embeddings play a considerable role in encoding these properties rather than
the training task itself, highlighting the importance of careful controls when
designing probing experiments. Finally, through a set of controlled synthetic
tasks, we demonstrate models can encode these properties considerably above
chance-level even when distributed in the data as random noise, calling into
question the interpretation of absolute claims on probing tasks.

efficient processing and learning of discrete spikes still remains as a
challenging problem. In this paper, we make our contributions towards this
direction. A simplified spiking neuron model is firstly introduced with effects
of both synaptic input and firing output on membrane potential being modeled
with an impulse function. An event-driven scheme is then presented to further
improve the processing efficiency. Based on the neuron model, we propose two
new multi-spike learning rules which demonstrate better performance over other
baselines on various tasks including association, classification, feature
detection. In addition to efficiency, our learning rules demonstrate a high
robustness against strong noise of different types. They can also be
generalized to different spike coding schemes for the classification task, and
notably single neuron is capable of solving multi-category classifications with
our learning rules. In the feature detection task, we re-examine the ability of
unsupervised STDP with its limitations being presented, and find a new
phenomenon of losing selectivity. In contrast, our proposed learning rules can
reliably solve the task over a wide range of conditions without specific

relatively low pulse arrival rates may be considered unsuitable for covert
communications. The high crest factor of such trains can be extremely
burdensome for the transmitter hardware, and it makes the pulse trains easily
detectable even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, it may appear
that sharing the wideband channel by multiple users would require explicit
allocation of the pulse arrival times for each sub-channel, which would be
impractical in most cases. On the other hand, messaging by wideband pulse
trains has many appealing features. Among those are the ease of synchronous as
well as asynchronous pulse detection, and on-the-fly channel reconfigurability
(e.g. changing the spreading factor). Favorably, the crest factor of a pulse
train, as well as its apparent temporal and amplitude structure, can be easily,
and reversibly, controlled by simple linear filtering. For example, a
transmitted pulse train can be made statistically indistinguishable from the
Gaussian component of the channel noise (e.g. the thermal noise) observed in
the same spectral band, while the received signal will be the designed
high-crest-factor wideband pulse train. In this paper, we utilize the so-called
pulse pileup effect to perform such reversible control of the pulse train
structure, enabling a wider use of this approach for synthesis of robust
low-SNR covert communication links. We place a particular focus on the

task performance through optimizing the robot morphology and configuration of
the system through motion. To optimize the design for different scenarios, we
select a set of tasks that represent the variability in small scale
manipulation (e.g. pick and place, tasks involving positioning and orientation)
and track the motion to obtain a reproducible trajectory. Kinematic data is
captured through an electromagnetic (EM) tracker system while a human subject
performs the tasks. Then, the data is pre-processed and used to optimize the
morphology of each symmetric robot arm of the bilateral system. Once optimized,
a kinematic control scheme is used to generate a motion with dexterous
configurations. The dexterity is evaluated along the trajectories with standard
dexterity metrics. Results show a 10\% improvement in dexterous maneuverability
with the optimized arm design and optimal base configuration.

However, relay selection to result in the strongest link becomes the critical
technology to facilitate RAN using mmWave. A alternative approach toward relay

severe fading in mmWave band. In this paper, we apply classification techniques
using ANN with multilayer perception to predict the path loss of multiple

mimic the images of the particle image velocimetry (PIV). The output data are
the velocity fields, and the correct answers for them are given by a direct
numerical simulation (DNS). We examine two types of the input data: APIs
without missing regions (i.e., full APIs) and APIs with missing regions (lacked

experimental situation in our wind tunnel setup. The velocity fields estimated
from both full and lacked APIs are in great agreement with the reference DNS

images so that their applicability to the exact experimental situation can be
investigated. The velocity fields estimated by the machine learned models
contain approximately 40 folds denser data than that with the conventional
cross-correlation method. This finding suggests that we may be able to obtain
finer and hidden structures of the flow field which cannot be resolved with the
conventional cross-correlation method. We also found that even the complex flow
structures are hidden due to the alignment of two square cylinders, the machine

reaching essential enhancement of the radiation intensity in the far-field
region at certain selection of the problem parameters. Owing to the ""inverted""
cone geometry, this effect can be realized for arbitrary charge velocity,
including the ultra relativistic case, by proper selection of the cone material
and the apex angle. Typical radiation patterns in the far-field area are
demonstrated.

developers of DL software meet the new challenges posed by DL, enormous

studied. To fill this knowledge gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study
on understanding challenges in deploying DL software. We mine and analyze 3,023
relevant posts from Stack Overflow, a popular Q&A website for developers, and

body, reconstructed images will suffer from metal artifacts. In order to reduce
metal artifacts, metals are typically removed in projection images. Therefore,
the metal corrupted projection areas need to be inpainted. For deep learning
inpainting methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used, for
example, the U-Net. However, such CNNs use convolutional filter responses on
both valid and corrupted pixel values, resulting in unsatisfactory image
quality. In this work, partial convolution is applied for projection
inpainting, which only relies on valid pixels values. The U-Net with partial
convolution and conventional convolution are compared for metal artifact
reduction. Our experiments demonstrate that the U-Net with partial convolution
is able to inpaint the metal corrupted areas better than that with conventional
convolution.

in the Neil Gehrels \emph{Swift} data. For instance, some GRBs show an internal
X-ray plateau followed by very steep decay, which is difficult to be
interpreted within the framework of a black hole (BH) central engine, but are
consistent within a rapidly spinning magnetar engine picture. The very steep
decay at the end of the plateau suggests a sudden cessation of the central
engine, which is explained as the collapse of a supra-massive magnetar into a
black hole when it spins down. Here we propose that some additional evidence,
such as a second X-ray plateau feature would show up, if the fall-back
accretion could activate the newborn BH and sufficient energy could be
transferred from the newborn BH to the GRB blast wave. With a systematic data
analysis for all long GRBs, we find three candidates in \emph{Swift} sample,
i.e., GRBs 070802, 090111, and 120213A, whose X-ray afterglow light curves
contain two plateaus, with the first one being an internal plateau. We find
that in a fairly loose and reasonable parameter space, the second X-ray plateau
data for all 3 GRBs could be well interpreted with our proposed model. Future
observations are likely to discover more similar events, which could offer more
information of the properties of the magnetar as well as the newborn BH.

Task-oriented: the robot only takes actions to further its own task objective
and (2) Supportive: the robot sometimes prefers supportive actions to
task-oriented ones when they reduce future goal-conflicts. Our experiments in
simulation, using a simplified human model, reveal that supportive actions
reduce the interference between agents, especially in more difficult tasks, but
also cause the robot to take longer to complete the task. We implemented these
modes on a physical robot in a user study where a human and a robot perform
object placement on a shared table. Our results show that a supportive robot
was perceived as a more favorable coworker by the human and also reduced
interference with the human in the more difficult of two scenarios. However, it
also took longer to complete the task highlighting an interesting trade-off
between task-efficiency and human-preference that needs to be considered before
designing robot behavior for close-proximity manipulation scenarios.

Rham cohomology by means of formal completions. Our approach is inspired by the
deformation to the normal cone provided in \cite{Gaitsgory_Study_II}. More
specifically, given a morphism $f \colon X \to Y$ of (derived) $k$-analytic
spaces we construct the \emph{non-archimedean deformation to the normal cone}
associated to $f$. The latter can be thought as an $\mathbf A^1_k$-parametrized
deformation whose fiber at $1 \in \mathbf A^1_k$ coincides with the formal
completion of $f$ and the fiber at $0 \in \mathbf A^1_k$ with the (derived)
normal cone associated to $f$. We further show that such deformation can be
endowed with a natural filtration which spreads out the usual Hodge filtration
on the (completed shifted) analytic tangent bundle to the formal completion.
Such filtration agrees with the $I$-adic filtration in the case where $f$ is a
locally complete intersection morphism between (derived) $k$-affinoid spaces.

reproduced at $\tau$ which is deviated a little bit from $\tau=i$. The charged
lepton mass matrix is also given by using modular forms of weights $2$, $4$ and
$6$, where five cases have been examined. The neutrino mass matrix is generated
in terms of the modular forms of weight $4$ through the Weinberg operator.
Lepton mass matrices are also consistent with the observed mixing angles at
$\tau$ close to $i$ for NH of neutrino masses. Allowed regions of $\tau$ of
quarks and leptons overlap each other for all cases of the charged lepton mass
matrix. However, the sum of neutrino masses is crucial to test the common
$\tau$ for quarks and leptons. The minimal sum of neutrino masses $\sum m_i$ is
$140$meV at the common $\tau$.
  The inverted hierarchy of neutrino masses is unfavorable in our framework. It

where the mean group ($-0.54\pm0.22$) and isolated ($-0.77\pm0.14$) CGM
metallicities are similar. Group and isolated environments have similar
distributions of {\HI} column densities as a function of impact parameter.
However, contrary to isolated galaxies, we do not find an anti-correlation
between {\HI} column density and the nearest group galaxy impact parameter. We
additionally divided the groups by member luminosity ratios (i.e.,
galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-dwarf groups). While there was no significant
difference in their mean metallicities, a modest increase in sample size should
allow one to statistically identify a higher CGM metallicity in galaxy-dwarf
groups compared to galaxy-galaxy groups. We conclude that either environmental
effects have not played an important role in the metallicity of the CGM at this
stage and expect that this may only occur when galaxies are strongly
interacting or merging, or that some isolated galaxies have higher CGM
metallicities due to past interactions. Thus, environment does not seem to be
the cause of the CGM metallicity bimodality.

gained significant research interest within the wireless networking research

will see swarms of UAV populating the sky of our smart cities to accomplish
different missions: parcel delivery, infrastructure monitoring, event filming,
surveillance, tracking, etc. The UAV ecosystem can benefit from existing 5G/B5G
cellular networks, which can be exploited in different ways to enhance UAV
communications. Because of the inherent characteristics of UAV pertaining to
flexible mobility in 3D space, autonomous operation and intelligent placement,
these smart devices cater to wide range of wireless applications and use cases.
This work aims at presenting an in-depth exploration of integration synergies
between 5G/B5G cellular systems and UAV technology, where the UAV is integrated
as a new aerial User Equipment (UE) to existing cellular networks. In this
integration, the UAVs perform the role of flying users within cellular
coverage, thus they are termed as cellular-connected UAVs (a.k.a. UAV-UE,
drone-UE, 5G-connected drone, or aerial user). The main focus of this work is
to present an extensive study of integration challenges along with key 5G/B5G
technological innovations and ongoing efforts in design prototyping and field
trials corroborating cellular-connected UAVs. This study highlights recent
progress updates with respect to 3GPP standardization and emphasizes
socio-economic concerns that must be accounted before successful adoption of
this promising technology. Various open problems paving the path to future
research opportunities are also discussed.

significant gap between PTLMs and human-level language understanding and offers
a new challenge for PTLMs to demonstrate commonsense.

accurately find the neighbor clusters for each cluster resulting distance
computations only between a point and its neighbor clusters' centroids instead
of all centroids. Moreover, each cluster can be divided into a stable area and
an active area, and the later one can be further divided into annulus areas.
The assigned cluster of the points in the stable area is not changed in the
current iteration while the points in the annulus area will be adjusted within
a few neighbor clusters in the current iteration. Also, there are no upper or
lower bounds in the proposed Ball k-means. Furthermore, reducing
centroid-centroid distance computation between iterations makes it efficient
for large k clustering. The fast speed, no extra parameters and simple design
of the Ball k-means make it an all-around replacement of the naive k-means

data, prove existence of its solutions, establish the stability and uniform
estimates, derive a convenient consistency formulation of the balance laws and
use it to show the weak convergence of the numerical solutions to a dissipative
solution with the Reynold defect introduced in Abbatiello et al. [Preprint
Arxiv 1912.12896]. If the target system admits a strong solution then the
convergence is strong towards the strong solution. Moreover, we establish the
convergence rate of the strong convergence in terms of the size of the space
discretization h (which is supposed to be comparable with the time step). In
the case of non zero inflow/outflow boundary data, all results are new. The
latter result is new also for the no-slip boundary conditions.

regions where, in high-mass clusters, ejecta from some kind of high-mass stars
are effectively captured during the formation phase of some of the low mass
stars and effectively channeled into the latter to form multiple populations.
Star formation epochs in star clusters are generally set by gas flows that
determine the abundance of gas in the cluster. We argue that there is likely
only one star formation epoch after which clusters remain essentially clear of
gas by cluster winds. Collisional dynamics is important in this phase leading
to core collapse, expansion and eventual dispersion of every cluster. We review
recent developments in the field with a focus on theoretical work.

  systems",,,,,"q-bio.NC q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Seizure activity is a ubiquitous and pernicious pathophysiology that, in
principle, should yield to mathematical treatments of (neuronal) ensemble
dynamics - and therefore interventions on stochastic chaos. A seizure can be
characterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime,
i.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico
treatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the
brain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and
potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external
stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the (neuronal) state equation used in
Dynamic Causal Modelling generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism when
propagation of neuronal activity along structural connections is considered.
Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an
initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity
(i.e., connectivity that disperses neuronal fluctuations). We show, for neural
systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via
external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be
applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas
adjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'. We
offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging
data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we
successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network. Our hope
is that this technique can form the basis for real-time monitoring and
intervention devices that are capable of suppressing or even preventing
seizures in a non-invasive manner.

using DQI to create higher quality data. The data creation paradigm consists of
several data visualizations to help data creators (i) understand the quality of
data and (ii) visualize the impact of the created data instance on the overall

models trained on the renovated SNLI dataset generalize better to out of

large gap with respect to human performance. DQI systematically helps in
creating harder benchmarks using active learning. Our work takes the process of

homogeneous continuous-time realization is a hard problem. In practice, this
problem reduces to deciding when a given Markov matrix can be written as the
exponential of some rate matrix (a Markov generator). This is an old question
known in the literature as the embedding problem (Elfving37), which has been
only solved for matrices of size $2\times 2$ or $3\times 3$. In this paper, we
address this problem and related questions and obtain results in two different
lines. First, for matrices of any size, we give a bound on the number of Markov
generators in terms of the spectrum of the Markov matrix. Based on this, we
establish a criterion for deciding whether a generic Markov matrix (different
eigenvalues) is embeddable and propose an algorithm that lists all its Markov
generators. Then, motivated and inspired by recent results on substitution
models of DNA, we focus in the $4\times 4$ case and completely solve the

probabilistic models to alleviate peaky (i.e. over-confident) predictions, a
common sign of overfitting. This class of techniques, of which label smoothing
is one, has a connection to entropy regularization. Despite the consistent
success of label smoothing across architectures and data sets in language
generation tasks, two problems remain open: (1) there is little understanding
of the underlying effects entropy regularizers have on models, and (2) the full
space of entropy regularization techniques is largely unexplored. We introduce
a parametric family of entropy regularizers, which includes label smoothing as
a special case, and use it to gain a better understanding of the relationship
between the entropy of a model and its performance on language generation
tasks. We also find that variance in model performance can be explained largely
by the resulting entropy of the model. Lastly, we find that label smoothing
provably does not allow for sparsity in an output distribution, an undesirable
property for language generation models, and therefore advise the use of other
entropy regularization methods in its place.

considerably important for autonomous robots, which support human activities.
One of the practical approaches for acquiring such social interaction skills
and semantic information as common sense in human activity is the application
of recent machine learning techniques. Although recent machine learning
techniques have been successful in realizing automatic manipulation and driving
tasks, it is difficult to use these techniques in applications that require
human-robot interaction experience. Humans have to perform several times over a
long term to show embodied and social interaction behaviors to robots or
learning systems. To address this problem, we propose a cloud-based immersive
virtual reality (VR) platform which enables virtual human-robot interaction to
collect the social and embodied knowledge of human activities in a variety of
situations. To realize the flexible and reusable system, we develop a real-time
bridging mechanism between ROS and Unity, which is one of the standard
platforms for developing VR applications. We apply the proposed system to a
robot competition field named RoboCup@Home to confirm the feasibility of the
system in a realistic human-robot interaction scenario. Through demonstration
experiments at the competition, we show the usefulness and potential of the
system for the development and evaluation of social intelligence through
human-robot interaction. The proposed VR platform enables robot systems to
collect social experiences with several users in a short time. The platform
also contributes in providing a dataset of social behaviors, which would be a
key aspect for intelligent service robots to acquire social interaction skills

developed, which keeps the convexity for the terminal safe set and allows for

three-dimensional space, causes high uncertainty. The uncertainty problem leads
to inaccurate location predictions and fuzziness in scale estimations. DroTrack
solves such issues by discovering the dependency between object representation
and motion geometry. We implement an effective object segmentation based on
Fuzzy C Means (FCM). We incorporate the spatial information into the membership
function to cluster the most discriminative segments. We then enhance the
object segmentation by using a pre-trained Convolution Neural Network (CNN)

reliable object scale. We discuss the experimental results and performance
evaluation using two datasets of 51,462 drone-captured frames. The combination
of the FCM segmentation and the angular scaling increased DroTrack precision by
up to $9\%$ and decreased the centre location error by $162$ pixels on average.
DroTrack outperforms all the high-speed trackers and achieves comparable
results in comparison to deep learning trackers. DroTrack offers high frame

Linear Algebra' (ILA). This approach has the advantage of simplicity and
generality. Implicit linear algebra is outlined in [1]. We denote the space of
all vectors on $S$ by $\mathcal{F}_S$ and the space containing only the zero
vector on $S$ by $\mathbf{0}_S.$ The dual $\mathcal{V}_S^{\perp}$ of a vector
space $\mathcal{V}_S$ is the collection of all vectors whose dot product with
vectors in $\mathcal{V}_S$ is zero. The basic operation of ILA is a linking
operation ('matched composition`) between vector spaces
$\mathcal{V}_{SP},\mathcal{V}_{PQ}$ (regarded as collections of row vectors on
column sets $S\cup P, P\cup Q,$ respectively with $S,P,Q$ disjoint) defined by
$\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow \mathcal{V}_{PQ}\equiv
\{(f_S,h_Q):((f_S,g_P)\in \mathcal{V}_{SP}, (g_P,h_Q) \in \mathcal{V}_{PQ}\},$
and another ('skewed composition`) defined by
$\mathcal{V}_{SP}\rightleftharpoons \mathcal{V}_{PQ}\equiv
\{(f_S,h_Q):((f_S,g_P)\in \mathcal{V}_{SP}, (-g_P,h_Q) \in \mathcal{V}_{PQ}\}.$
The basic results of ILA are the Implicit Inversion Theorem (which states that
$\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow(\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow
\mathcal{V}_S)= \mathcal{V}_S,$ iff $\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow
\mathbf{0}_P\subseteq \mathcal{V}_S\subseteq
\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow\mathcal{F}_S$) and Implicit Duality Theorem
(which states that $(\mathcal{V}_{SP}\leftrightarrow \mathcal{V}_{PQ})^{\perp}=
(\mathcal{V}_{SP}^{\perp}\rightleftharpoons \mathcal{V}_{PQ}^{\perp}$). We show
that the operations and results of ILA are useful in understanding basic
circuit theory. We illustrate this by using ILA to present a generalization of
Thevenin-Norton theorem where we compute multiport behaviour using adjoint
multiport termination through a gyrator and a very general version of maximum
power transfer theorem, which states that the port conditions that appear,
during adjoint multiport termination through an ideal transformer, correspond
to maximum power transfer.

delay-sensitive applications such as connected vehicles, smart grids, and
actuator networks by moving data processing close to end users. Passive optical
networks (PONs) are widely used in access networks to reduce the power
consumption while providing high bandwidth to end users under flexible designs.
Typically, distributed fog computing units in access networks have limited
processing and storage capacities that can be under or over utilized depending
on instantaneous demands. To extend the available capacity in access network,
this paper proposes a fog computing architecture based on SDN-enabled PONs to
achieve full connectivity among distributed fog computing servers. The power
consumption results show that this architecture can achieve up to about 80%
power savings in comparison to legacy fog computing based on spine and leaf
data centers with the same number of servers.

classification and treatment recommendations if an acute intoxication is
suspected. Due to the time-sensitive nature of these cases, doctors are
required to propose a correct diagnosis and intervention within a minimal time
frame. Usually the toxin is known and recommendations can be made accordingly.
However, in challenging cases only symptoms are mentioned and doctors have to
rely on their clinical experience. Medical experts and our analyses of a
regional dataset of intoxication records provide evidence that this is
challenging, since occurring symptoms may not always match the textbook
description due to regional distinctions, inter-rater variance, and
institutional workflow. Computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) can provide decision
support, but approaches so far do not consider additional information of the
reported cases like age or gender, despite their potential value towards a
correct diagnosis. In this work, we propose a new machine learning based CADx
method which fuses symptoms and meta information of the patients using graph
convolutional networks. We further propose a novel symptom matching method that
allows the effective incorporation of prior knowledge into the learning process
and evidently stabilizes the poison prediction. We validate our method against
10 medical doctors with different experience diagnosing intoxication cases for
10 different toxins from the PCC in Munich and show our method's superiority in
performance for poison prediction.

treatment of bacterial infections and contributes to increased prevalence of

allows for ultra-sensitive measurement of growth signals from only tens of
bacteria in a microfluidic device. Our device is essentially a set of
microfluidic channels, each with a nano-constriction at one end and
cross-sectional dimensions close to that of a single bacterium. Flowing a
liquid bacteria sample (e.g., urine) through the microchannels rapidly traps
the bacteria in the device, allowing for subsequent incubation in drugs. We
measure the electrical resistance of the microchannels, which increases (or
decreases) in proportion to the number of bacteria in the microchannels. The
method and device allow for rapid antibiotic susceptibility tests in about two
hours. Further, the short-time fluctuations in the electrical resistance during
an antibiotic susceptibility test are correlated with the morphological changes
of bacteria caused by the antibiotic. In contrast to other electrical
approaches, the underlying geometric blockage effect provides a robust and
sensitive signal, which is straightforward to interpret without electrical
models. The approach also obviates the need for a high-resolution microscope
and other complex equipment, making it potentially usable in resource-limited

algorithms has been shown by now. Most of them are technically demanding due to
the (hard to avoid) use of negative drift theorems -- general results which
translate an expected progress away from the target into a high hitting time.
  We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios
and show that it can simplify existing analyses. We discuss in more detail
Lehre's (PPSN 2010) \emph{negative drift in populations} method, one of the
most general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of non-elitist
mutation-based evolutionary algorithms for discrete search spaces. Together
with other arguments, we obtain an alternative and simpler proof, which also
strengthens and simplifies this method. In particular, now only three of the
five technical conditions of the previous result have to be verified. The lower
bounds we obtain are explicit instead of only asymptotic. This allows to
compute concrete lower bounds for concrete algorithms, but also enables us to
show that super-polynomial runtimes appear already when the reproduction rate
is only a $(1 - \omega(n^{-1/2}))$ factor below the threshold. For the special
case of algorithms using standard bit mutation with a random mutation rate
(called uniform mixing in the language of hyper-heuristics), we prove the
result stated by Dang and Lehre (PPSN 2016) and extend it to mutation rates
other than $\Theta(1/n)$, which includes the heavy-tailed mutation operator
proposed by Doerr, Le, Makhmara, and Nguyen (GECCO 2017). We finally apply our
method and a novel domination argument to show an exponential lower bound for
the runtime of the mutation-only simple genetic algorithm on \onemax for
arbitrary population size.

$G_\mathcal{D}$ for $\mathcal{D}$ is the undirected graph with vertex set
$\mathcal{D}$ in which two disks are joined by an edge if and only if they
intersect. The directed transmission graph $G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ for
$\mathcal{D}$ is the directed graph with vertex set $\mathcal{D}$ in which
there is an edge from a disk $D_1 \in \mathcal{D}$ to a disk $D_2 \in

  Given $\mathcal{D}$ and two non-intersecting disks $s, t \in \mathcal{D}$, we
show that a minimum $s$-$t$ vertex cut in $G_\mathcal{D}$ or in
$G^{\rightarrow}_\mathcal{D}$ can be found in $O(n^{3/2}\text{polylog} n)$
expected time. To obtain our result, we combine an algorithm for the maximum
flow problem in general graphs with dynamic geometric data structures to
manipulate the disks.
  As an application, we consider the barrier resilience problem in a
rectangular domain. In this problem, we have a vertical strip $S$ bounded by
two vertical lines, $L_\ell$ and $L_r$, and a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of
disks. Let $a$ be a point in $S$ above all disks of $\mathcal{D}$, and let $b$
a point in $S$ below all disks of $\mathcal{D}$. The task is to find a curve
from $a$ to $b$ that lies in $S$ and that intersects as few disks of
$\mathcal{D}$ as possible. Using our improved algorithm for minimum cuts in
disk graphs, we can solve the barrier resilience problem in
$O(n^{3/2}\text{polylog} n)$ expected time.

simultaneously minimizing the system cost under the type 2 fuzzy uncertainty.
In the proposed formulation, the higher order uncertainties (such as
parametric, manufacturing, environmental, and designers uncertainty) associated
with the system are modeled with interval type 2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS). The
footprint of uncertainty of the interval type 2 membership functions (IT2 MFs)
accommodates these uncertainties by capturing the multiple opinions from
several system experts. We consider IT2 MFs to represent the subsystem
reliability and cost, which are to be further aggregated using extension
principle to evaluate the total system reliability and cost according to their
configurations, i.e., series parallel and parallel series. We proposed a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) based novel solution approach to solve the
FMORRAP. To demonstrate the applicability of two formulations, namely, series
parallel FMORRAP and parallel series FMORRAP, we performed experimental
simulations on various numerical data sets. The decision makers/system experts
assign different importance to the objectives (system reliability and cost),
and these preferences are represented by sets of weights. The optimal results
are obtained from our solution approach, and the Pareto optimal front is
established using these different weight sets. The genetic algorithm (GA) was
implemented to compare the results obtained from our proposed solution
approach. A statistical analysis was conducted between PSO and GA, and it was
found that the PSO based Pareto solution outperforms the GA.

$\mathsf{SO(10)}$ which with appropriate choice of Higgs representations
generate in a natural way a pair of light Higgs doublets needed to accomplish
electroweak symmetry breaking. In this class of models higher dimensional
operators of the form matter-matter-Higgs-Higgs in the superpotential after
spontaneous breaking of the GUT symmetry generate contributions to Yukawa
couplings which are comparable to the ones from cubic interactions.
Specifically we consider an $\mathsf{SO(10)}$ model with a sector consisting of
$\mathsf{126+\overline{126} + 210}$ of heavy Higgs which breaks the GUT
symmetry down to the standard model gauge group and a sector consisting of
$2\times \mathsf{10+120}$ of light Higgs fields. In this model we compute the
corrections from the quartic interactions to the Yukawa couplings for the top
and the bottom quarks and for the tau lepton. It is then shown that inclusion
of these corrections to the GUT scale Yukawas allows for consistency of the
top, bottom and tau masses with experiment for low $\tan\beta$ with a value as
low as $\tan\beta$ of 5$-$10. We compute the sparticle spectrum for a set of
benchmarks and find that satisfaction of the relic density is achieved via a
compressed spectrum and coannihilation and three sets of coannihilations
appear: chargino-neutralino, stop-neutralino and stau-neutralino. We
investigate the chargino-neutralino coannihilation in detail for the
possibility of observation of the light chargino at the high luminosity LHC

FSs) play a prominent role by facilitating a better representation of uncertain
linguistic information. Perceptual Computing (Per C), a well known computing
with words (CWW) approach, and its various applications have nicely exploited
this advantage. This paper reports a novel Per C based approach for student
strategy evaluation. Examinations are generally oriented to test the subject
knowledge of students. The number of questions that they are able to solve
accurately judges success rates of students in the examinations. However, we
feel that not only the solutions of questions, but also the strategy adopted
for finding those solutions are equally important. More marks should be awarded
to a student, who solves a question with a better strategy compared to a
student, whose strategy is relatively not that good. Furthermore, the students
strategy can be taken as a measure of his or her learning outcome as perceived
by a faculty member. This can help to identify students, whose learning
outcomes are not good, and, thus, can be provided with any relevant help, for
improvement. The main contribution of this paper is to illustrate the use of
CWW for student strategy evaluation and present a comparison of the
recommendations generated by different CWW approaches. CWW provides us with two
major advantages. First, it generates a numeric score for the overall
evaluation of strategy adopted by a student in the examination. This enables
comparison and ranking of the students based on their performances. Second, a
linguistic evaluation describing the student strategy is also obtained from the
system. Both these numeric score and linguistic recommendation are together
used to assess the quality of a students strategy. We found that Per-C
generates unique recommendations in all cases and outperforms other CWW
approaches.

strength of LKT is the specification of a symbolic notation system for
alternative logistic regression models that is powerful enough to specify many

generality of LKT, we fit 12 models, some variants of well-known models and
some newly devised, to 6 learning technology datasets. The results indicated
that no single learner model was best in all cases, further justifying a broad
approach that considers multiple learner model features and the learning
context. The models presented here avoid student-level fixed parameters to
increase generalizability. We also introduce features to stand in for these
intercepts. We argue that to be maximally applicable, a learner model needs to
adapt to student differences, rather than needing to be pre-parameterized with
the level of each student's ability.

considerable attention for the spatiotemporal information components and the
event-driven processing fashion. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) represent a
family of event-driven models with spatiotemporal dynamics for neuromorphic
computing, which are widely benchmarked on neuromorphic data. Interestingly,
researchers in the machine learning community can argue that recurrent
(artificial) neural networks (RNNs) also have the capability to extract
spatiotemporal features although they are not event-driven. Thus, the question
of ""what will happen if we benchmark these two kinds of models together on
neuromorphic data"" comes out but remains unclear. In this work, we make a
systematic study to compare SNNs and RNNs on neuromorphic data, taking the
vision datasets as a case study. First, we identify the similarities and
differences between SNNs and RNNs (including the vanilla RNNs and LSTM) from
the modeling and learning perspectives. To improve comparability and fairness,
we unify the supervised learning algorithm based on backpropagation through
time (BPTT), the loss function exploiting the outputs at all timesteps, the
network structure with stacked fully-connected or convolutional layers, and the
hyper-parameters during training. Especially, given the mainstream loss
function used in RNNs, we modify it inspired by the rate coding scheme to
approach that of SNNs. Furthermore, we tune the temporal resolution of datasets
to test model robustness and generalization. At last, a series of contrast
experiments are conducted on two types of neuromorphic datasets: DVS-converted
(N-MNIST) and DVS-captured (DVS Gesture).

basic idea is to extract and coherently combine the received multipath
components of the transmitted symbols in the delay-Doppler grid using maximal
ratio combining (MRC) to improve the SNR of the combined signal. We reformulate
the OTFS input-output relation in simple vector form by placing guard null
symbols or zero padding (ZP) in the delay-Doppler grid and exploiting the
resulting circulant property of the blocks of the channel matrix. Using this
vector input-output relation we propose a low complexity iterative decision
feedback equalizer (DFE) based on MRC. The performance and complexity of the
proposed detector favorably compares with the state of the art message passing
detector. An alternative time domain MRC based detector is also proposed for
even faster detection. We further propose a Gauss-Seidel based over-relaxation
parameter in the rake detector to improve the performance and the convergence
speed of the iterative detection. We also show how the MRC detector can be
combined with outer error-correcting codes to operate as a turbo DFE scheme to
further improve the error performance. All results are compared with a baseline
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) scheme employing a single tap

observational evidence,we assume that the CME-driven shock experienced a large
lateral expansion shortly after the eruption, which is modelled by a double
Gaussian velocity profile in this simulation. We use the in-situ shock arrival
times and the observed CME speeds at multiple spacecraft near Earth and Mars as
constraints to adjust the input model parameters. The modelled time intensity
profiles and fluence for energetic protons are then compared with observations.
Reasonable agreements with observations at Mars and STEREO-A are found. The
simulated results at Earth differ from observations of GOES-15. Instead, the
simulated results at a heliocentric longitude 20 degree west to Earth fit
reasonably well with the GOES observation. This can be explained if the
pre-event solar wind magnetic field at Earth is not described by a nominal
Parker field. Our results suggest that a large lateral expansion of the

  Protocols",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Temporal knowledge bases associate relational (s,r,o) triples with a set of
times (or a single time instant) when the relation is valid. While
time-agnostic KB completion (KBC) has witnessed significant research, temporal
KB completion (TKBC) is in its early days. In this paper, we consider
predicting missing entities (link prediction) and missing time intervals (time
prediction) as joint TKBC tasks where entities, relations, and time are all
embedded in a uniform, compatible space. We present TIMEPLEX, a novel
time-aware KBC method, that also automatically exploits the recurrent nature of
some relations and temporal interactions between pairs of relations. TIMEPLEX
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both prediction tasks.
  We also find that existing TKBC models heavily overestimate link prediction
performance due to imperfect evaluation mechanisms. In response, we propose
improved TKBC evaluation protocols for both link and time prediction tasks,
dealing with subtle issues that arise from the partial overlap of time
intervals in gold instances and system predictions.

language processing techniques. The past decade has witnessed significant
progress achieved in GEC for the sake of increasing popularity of machine
learning and deep learning, especially in late 2010s when near human-level GEC
systems are available. However, there is no prior work focusing on the whole
recapitulation of the progress. We present the first survey in GEC for a
comprehensive retrospect of the literature in this area. We first give the
introduction of five public datasets, data annotation schema, two important
shared tasks and four standard evaluation metrics. More importantly, we discuss
four kinds of basic approaches, including statistical machine translation based
approach, neural machine translation based approach, classification based
approach and language model based approach, six commonly applied performance
boosting techniques for GEC systems and two data augmentation methods. Since
GEC is typically viewed as a sister task of machine translation, many GEC
systems are based on neural machine translation (NMT) approaches, where the
neural sequence-to-sequence model is applied. Similarly, some performance
boosting techniques are adapted from machine translation and are successfully
combined with GEC systems for enhancement on the final performance.
Furthermore, we conduct an analysis in level of basic approaches, performance
boosting techniques and integrated GEC systems based on their experiment
results respectively for more clear patterns and conclusions. Finally, we
discuss five prospective directions for future GEC researches.

region. As it is chemiluminescent radiation in a thin medium, the population
distribution over the various roto-vibrational OH energy levels of the
electronic ground state is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In
order to better understand these non-LTE effects, we studied hundreds of OH
lines in a high-quality mean spectrum based on observations with the
high-resolution Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at Cerro Paranal in
Chile. Our derived populations cover vibrational levels between v = 3 and 9,
rotational levels up to N = 24, and individual $\Lambda$-doublet components
when resolved. As the reliability of these results critically depends on the
Einstein-A coefficients used, we tested six different sets and found clear
systematic errors in all of them, especially for Q-branch lines and individual
$\Lambda$-doublet components. In order to minimise the deviations in the
populations for the same upper level, we used the most promising coefficients
from Brooke et al. (2016) and further improved them with an empirical
correction approach. The resulting rotational level populations show a clear
bimodality for each v, which is characterised by a probably fully thermalised
cold component and a hot population with rotational temperatures between about
700 (v = 9) and 7,000 K (v = 4). The latter causes non-LTE contributions at low
N, which can be estimated quite robustly based on the two-temperature model.
The bimodality is also clearly indicated by the different dependence of the
populations on changes in the effective height of the OH emission layer.

estimation method, called Total Spiking Probability Edges (TSPE). Based on
cross-correlation and edge filtering at different time scales this method is
proposed and the theoretical framework is outlined in this work. TSPE enables
the classification between inhibitory and excitatory connections by using
recorded action potentials. To compare this method learning about state of the
art algorithms to estimate connectivity is necessary. After a research,
promising algorithms are implemented and evaluated for further research topics,
among others in the biomems lab of UAS Aschaffenburg. To evaluate these
algorithms in silico networks are used, because of their known connectivity.
This makes it possible to validate the correctness of our algorithm results.
Therefore, a biophysically representative neuronal network simulation is needed
first. Datasets were simulated in different ways and analysed in order to
develop an evaluation framework. After a successful evaluation with in silico
networks, in vitro experiments and their analyses complete this project.

structure may continue to evolve over time as a result of mutations. In this
paper, we use a data science perspective to study the potential structural
impacts due to ongoing mutations in its amino acid sequence. To do so, we
identify a key segment of the protein and apply a sequential Monte Carlo
sampling method to detect possible changes to the space of low-energy
conformations for different amino acid sequences. Such computational approaches
can further our understanding of this protein structure and complement
