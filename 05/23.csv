improve mathematical software. It may seem that the probabilistic nature of ML
tools would invalidate the exact results prized by such software, however, the
algorithms which underpin the software often come with a range of choices which
are good candidates for ML application. We refer to choices which have no
effect on the mathematical correctness of the software, but do impact its
performance.
  In the past we experimented with one such choice: the variable ordering to
use when building a Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). We used the
Python library Scikit-Learn (sklearn) to experiment with different ML models,
and developed new techniques for feature generation and hyper-parameter
selection.
  These techniques could easily be adapted for making decisions other than our
immediate application of CAD variable ordering. Hence in this paper we present
a software pipeline to use sklearn to pick the variable ordering for an
algorithm that acts on a polynomial system. The code described is freely
available online.

  Opinion Dynamics: Modeling and Analysis",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In social systems, the evolution of interpersonal appraisals and individual
opinions are not independent processes but intertwine with each other. Despite
extensive studies on both opinion dynamics and appraisal dynamics separately,
no previous work has ever combined these two processes together. In this paper,
we propose a novel and intuitive model on the interplay between homophily-based
appraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics. We assume that
individuals' opinions are updated via the influence network constructed from
their interpersonal appraisals, which are in turn updated based on the
individual opinions via the homophily mechanism. By theoretical analysis, we
characterize the set of equilibria and some transient behavior of our model.
Moreover, we establish the equivalence among the convergence of the appraisal
network to social balance, the modulus consensus of individual opinions, and
the non-vanishing appraisals. Monte Carlo validations further show that the
non-vanishing appraisals condition holds for generic initial conditions.
Compared with previous works that explain the emergence of social balance via
person-to-person homophily mechanism, our model provides an alternative
explanation in terms of the person-to-entity homophily mechanism. In addition,
our model also describes how individuals' opinions on multiple irrelevant
issues become correlated and converge to modulus consensus over time-varying
influence networks.

We explore the role of initiation and termination of the copy process in the

plays no direct role in the overall thermodynamics. Instead, it is
thermodynamically costly to produce outputs that are more similar to the
oligomers in the environment than sequences obtained by randomly sampling
monomers. Copy accuracy can be thermodynamically neutral, or even favoured,
depending on the surroundings. Oligomer copying mechanisms can thus function as
information engines that interconvert chemical and information-based free

Persistent Object Stores, previous approaches to prefetching have been based on
predictions made through analysis of the store's schema, which generates rigid
predictions, or monitoring access patterns to the store while applications are
executed, which introduces memory and/or computation overhead. In this paper,
we present CAPre, a novel prefetching system for Persistent Object Stores based
on static code analysis of object-oriented applications. CAPre generates the
predictions at compile-time and does not introduce any overhead to the
application execution. Moreover, CAPre is able to predict large amounts of
objects that will be accessed in the near future, thus enabling the object
store to perform parallel prefetching if the objects are distributed, in a much
more aggressive way than in schema-based prediction algorithms. We integrate
CAPre into a distributed Persistent Object Store and run a series of
experiments that show that it can reduce the execution time of applications

Young stellar groups develop very quickly, expanding significantly within just
a few Myr. Here we model this strong dynamical development of young stellar

emergent phenomena. One such phenomenon is the presence of unstable particles,
traditionally seen via special analytic structures of the scattering matrix.
Because of their finite lifetime and energy threshold, these are especially
hard to study. In this paper we apply the GHD approach to a model possessing
both unstable excitations and quantum integrability. The largest family of
relativistic integrable quantum field theories known to have these features are
the homogeneous sine-Gordon models. We consider the simplest non-trivial
example of such theories and investigate the effect of an unstable excitation
on various physical quantities, both at equilibrium and in the non-equilibrium
state arising from the partitioning protocol. The hydrodynamic approach sheds
new light onto the physics of the unstable particle, going much beyond its
definition via the analytic structure of the scattering matrix, and clarifies
its effects both on the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of the
theory. Crucially, within this dynamical perspective, we identify unstable
particles as finitely-lived bound states of co-propagating stable particles of
different types, and observe how stable populations of unstable particles
emerge in large-temperature thermal baths.

sensing matrices (where $M < N$) guarantees efficient reconstruction of sparse
vectors. A matrix has the $(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ property if behaves as a
$\delta$-approximate isometry on $s$-sparse vectors. It is well known that an
$M\times N$ matrix with i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries is
$(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ with high probability as long as $s\lesssim
\delta^2 M/\log N$. On the other hand, most prior works aiming to
deterministically construct $(s,\delta)$-$\mathsf{RIP}$ matrices have failed
when $s \gg \sqrt{M}$. An alternative way to find an RIP matrix could be to
draw a random gaussian matrix and certify that it is indeed RIP. However, there
is evidence that this certification task is computationally hard when $s \gg
\sqrt{M}$, both in the worst case and the average case.
  In this paper, we investigate the exact average-case time complexity of
certifying the RIP property for $M\times N$ matrices with i.i.d.
$\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries, in the ""possible but hard"" regime $\sqrt{M} \ll
s\lesssim M/\log N$. Based on analysis of the low-degree likelihood ratio, we
give rigorous evidence that subexponential runtime $N^{\tilde\Omega(s^2/M)}$ is
required, demonstrating a smooth tradeoff between the maximum tolerated
sparsity and the required computational power. This lower bound is essentially
tight, matching the runtime of an existing algorithm due to Koiran and Zouzias.
Our hardness result allows $\delta$ to take any constant value in $(0,1)$,
which captures the relevant regime for compressed sensing. This improves upon

to greatly accelerate synthetic biology. Machine learning models that
accurately predict biological fitness from sequence are becoming a powerful
tool for molecular design. Activation maximization offers a simple design
strategy for differentiable models: one-hot coded sequences are first
approximated by a continuous representation which is then iteratively optimized
with respect to the predictor oracle by gradient ascent. While elegant, this
method suffers from vanishing gradients and may cause predictor pathologies
leading to poor convergence. Here, we build on a previously proposed
straight-through approximation method to optimize through discrete sequence
samples. By normalizing nucleotide logits across positions and introducing an
adaptive entropy variable, we remove bottlenecks arising from overly large or
skewed sampling parameters. The resulting algorithm, which we call Fast
SeqProp, achieves up to 100-fold faster convergence compared to previous
versions of activation maximization and finds improved fitness optima for many
applications. We demonstrate Fast SeqProp by designing DNA and protein
sequences for six deep learning predictors, including a protein structure

neural networks. Most existing pruning methods either train from scratch with a
sparsity inducing term such as group lasso, or prune redundant channels in a
pretrained network and then fine tune the network. Both strategies suffer from
some limitations: the use of group lasso is computationally expensive,
difficult to converge and often suffers from worse behavior due to the
regularization bias. The methods that start with a pretrained network either
prune channels uniformly across the layers or prune channels based on the basic
statistics of the network parameters. These approaches either ignore the fact
that some CNN layers are more redundant than others or fail to adequately
identify the level of redundancy in different layers. In this work, we
investigate a simple-yet-effective method for pruning channels based on a
computationally light-weight yet effective data driven optimization step that
discovers the necessary width per layer. Experiments conducted on ILSVRC-$12$
confirm effectiveness of our approach. With non-uniform pruning across the
layers on ResNet-$50$, we are able to match the FLOP reduction of
state-of-the-art channel pruning results while achieving a $0.98\%$ higher

the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities,
including the reproduction number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on
the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (""risk"" and ""spread""), including
their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint
distributions of various kinds, we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity
cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models,
i.e., so-called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random,
and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by
realistic complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity)
are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly
from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy
implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and
for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular,
directed graphs have a forward and backward version of the classic ""friendship
paradox"" -- forward edges tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while
backward edges lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination
of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find
superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.

In a recent groundbreaking experiment, membranes of the perovskite manganite
La$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LCMO) deposited on a flexible polymer layer were
strained up to 8\% [S.~S. Hong {\it et al.}, Science {\bf 368}, 71 (2020)],
much more than achieved by regular strain induced by a rigid substrate. By
increasing this strain a metal-insulator transition was reported. Here we
reproduce the results of the experiments using Monte Carlo simulations of the
two-orbital double-exchange model including Jahn-Teller distortions, at hole
density $x=1/3$. The full phase diagram with varying temperature and
Jahn-Teller coupling $\lambda$ is presented. When the bandwidth $W$ of mobile
electrons is reduced, thus when the effective Jahn-Teller coupling $\lambda/W$
is increased, a metal-insulator transition is found in our simulations, between
a ferromagnetic metallic state with uniform charge distribution and an
insulator with diagonal charge stripes that retains its ferromagnetic
character. In between the hole-rich diagonals, staggered orbital order occurs.
We also report resistivity and magnetization measurements alongside with spin
correlations and charge structure factors. Our overall conclusions are in
agreement with the recent experimental and density functional theory results by
Hong {\it et al.}, and we confirm much earlier ground state predictions of
striped ferromagnetic order using energy optimization techniques by T. Hotta
{\it et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 86}, 4922 (2001). The experimental
observation of one of the states predicted by theory suggests that diagonal
stripes could be achieved at other hole densities as well, such as $x=1/4$, if

advocates establishing quantum-ready applications and underlying tools and

ready for quantum advantage. This work can be done independently of which
hardware approach delivers quantum advantage first. The quadratic unconstrained
binary optimization (QUBO) problem is one such quantum-ready formulation. We
developed the next generation of qbsolv, a tool that is widely used for
sampling QUBOs on early QCs, focusing on its performance executing purely
classically, and deliver it as a cloud service today. We find that it delivers
highly competitive results in all of quality (low energy value), speed (time to
solution), and diversity (variety of solutions). We believe these results give
quantum-forward users a reason to switch to quantum-ready formulations today,
reaping immediate benefits in performance and diversity of solution from the
quantum-ready formulation,preparing themselves for quantum advantage, and
accelerating the development of the quantum computing ecosystem.

nudging approaches are still attractive due to their simplicity of
implementation when more complex methods need to be avoided. However, optimal
estimate of nudging gain matrix might be cumbersome. In this paper, we put
forth a fully nonintrusive recurrent neural network approach based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) embedding architecture to estimate the nudging term,
which plays a role not only to force the state trajectories to the observations
but also acts as a stabilizer. Furthermore, our approach relies on the power of
archival data and the trained model can be retrained effectively due to power
of transfer learning in any neural network applications. In order to verify the
feasibility of the proposed approach, we perform twin experiments using Lorenz
96 system. Our results demonstrate that the proposed LSTM nudging approach
yields more accurate estimates than both extended Kalman filter (EKF) and
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) when only sparse observations are available. With
the availability of emerging AI-friendly and modular hardware technologies and
heterogeneous computing platforms, we articulate that our simplistic nudging

debate around contact tracing apps -- the tech-enabled response to the

the right way to implement these apps, we noticed recurring implicit
assumptions. The proposed solutions are designed for a world where Internet

install these apps, and those who receive notifications about potential
exposure to the virus have access to testing and can isolate safely. In this
work we challenge these assumptions. We not only show that there are not enough
smartphones worldwide to reach required adoption thresholds but also highlight
a broad lack of internet access, which affects certain groups more: the
elderly, those with lower incomes, and those with limited ability to socially
distance. Unfortunately, these are also the groups that are at the highest
risks from COVID-19. We also report that the contact tracing apps that are
already deployed on an opt-in basis show disappointing adoption levels. We warn
about the potential consequences of over-extending the existing state and
corporate surveillance powers. Finally, we describe a multitude of scenarios
where contact tracing apps will not help regardless of access or policy. In
this work we call for a comprehensive and equitable policy response that
prioritizes the needs of the most vulnerable, protects human rights, and
considers long term impact instead of focusing on technology-first fixes.

Traditional
epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical

phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed
cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain
by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until
herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new
cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the
structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate
there exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear
growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional
epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When
calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission
rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\sim 7.2$. Assuming
realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown
measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual
infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of
parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one
country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a
severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard
compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The

commonly used class of procedures for the estimation of causal effects. By
adjusting for selection biases via a weighting mechanism, these procedures
estimate an effect of interest by constructing a pseudo-population in which
selection biases are eliminated. Despite their ease of use, these estimators
require the correct specification of a model for the weighting mechanism, are
known to be inefficient, and suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We
propose a class of nonparametric inverse probability weighted estimators in
which the weighting mechanism is estimated via undersmoothing of the highly
adaptive lasso, a nonparametric regression function proven to converge at
$n^{-1/3}$-rate to the true weighting mechanism. We demonstrate that our
estimators are asymptotically linear with variance converging to the
nonparametric efficiency bound. Unlike doubly robust estimators, our procedures
require neither derivation of the efficient influence function nor
specification of the conditional outcome model. Our theoretical developments
have broad implications for the construction of efficient inverse probability

non-locally. In this work, we propose an adaptive control strategy that offers
strong guarantees in both the mitigation and localization of line failures.
Specifically, we leverage the properties of network bridge-block decomposition
and a frequency regulation method called the unified control. If the balancing
areas over which the unified control operates coincide with the bridge-blocks
of the network, the proposed strategy drives the post-contingency system to a
steady state where the impact of initial line outages is localized within the
areas where they occurred whenever possible, stopping the cascading process.
When the initial line outages cannot be localized, the proposed control
strategy provides a configurable design that progressively involves and
coordinates more balancing areas. We compare the proposed control strategy with
the classical Automatic Generation Control (AGC) on the IEEE 118-bus and
2736-bus test networks. Simulation results show that our strategy greatly
improves overall reliability in terms of the N-k security standard, and
localizes the impact of initial failures in the majority of the simulated

unique tool for learning about the early phases of cosmic history, reaching
deep into the primordial Universe. At redshifts $z<10^6$, thermalization
processes become inefficient and existing limits from COBE/FIRAS imply that no
more than $\Delta \rho/\rho<6\times 10^{-5}$ (95% c.l.) of energy could have
been injected into the CMB. However, at higher redshifts, when thermalization
is efficient, the constraint weakens and $\Delta \rho/\rho \simeq 0.01-0.1$
could in principle have occurred. Existing computations for the evolution of
distortions commonly assume $\Delta \rho/\rho \ll 1$ and thus become inaccurate
in this case. Similarly, relativistic temperature corrections become relevant
for large energy release, but have previously not been modeled as carefully.
Here we study the evolution of distortions and the thermalization process after
single large energy release at $z>10^5$. We show that for large distortions the
thermalization efficiency is significantly reduced and that the distortion
visibility is sizeable to much earlier times. This tightens spectral
distortions constraints on low-mass primordial black holes with masses $M_{\rm
PBH} < 6\times 10^{11}$ g. Similarly, distortion limits on the amplitude of the
small-scale curvature power spectrum at wavenumbers $k>10^4\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$
and short-lived decaying particles with lifetimes $t_X< 10^7$ s are tightened,
however, these still require a more detailed time-dependent treatment. We also
briefly discuss the constraints from measurements of the effective number of
relativistic degrees of freedom and light element abundances and how these
complement spectral distortion limits.

spontaneous breaking of $B-L$ gauge symmetry also plays the role of inflaton by
virtue of its non-minimal coupling to gravity. While the lightest right handed
neutrino is the DM candidate, being stabilised by an additional $Z_2$ symmetry,
we show by performing a detailed renormalisation group evolution (RGE) improved
study of inflationary dynamics that thermal DM is generally overproduced due to
insufficient annihilations through gauge and scalar portals. This happens due
to strict upper limits obtained on gauge and other dimensionless couplings
responsible for DM annihilation while assuming the non-minimal coupling to
gravity to be at most of order unity. The non-thermal DM scenario is viable,
with or without $Z_2$ symmetry, although in such a case the $B-L$ gauge sector
remains decoupled from the inflationary dynamics due to tiny couplings. We also
show that the reheat temperature predicted by the model prefers non-thermal
leptogenesis with hierarchical right handed neutrinos while being consistent
with other requirements.

hard. This is due not just to the very fast increase of the computational
complexity with the number of moduli, but also to the fact that the scalar

angular momentum, where the accretion of material onto the central star is
driven by viscous expansion of the outer disk or by disk winds extracting
angular momentum without changing the disk size. Studying the time evolution of
disk sizes allows us therefore to distinguish between viscous stresses or disk
winds as the main mechanism of disk evolution. Observationally, estimates of
the disk gaseous outer radius are based on the extent of the CO rotational
emission, which, during the evolution, is also affected by the changing
physical and chemical conditions in the disk. We use physical-chemical DALI
models to study how the extent of the CO emission changes with time in a
viscously expanding disk and investigate to what degree this observable gas
outer radius is a suitable tracer of viscous spreading and whether current
observations are consistent with viscous evolution. We find that the gas outer
radius (R_co) measured from our models matches the expectations of a viscously
spreading disk: R_co increases with time and for a given time R_co is larger
for a disk with a higher viscosity alpha_visc. However, in the extreme case
where the disk mass is low (less than 10^-4 Msun) and alpha_visc is high
(larger than 10^-2), R_co will instead decrease with time as a result of CO
photodissociation in the outer disk. For most disk ages R_co is up to 12x
larger than the characteristic size R_c of the disk, and R_co/R_c is largest
for the most massive disk. As a result of this difference, a simple conversion
of R_co to alpha_visc will overestimate the true alpha_visc of the disk by up
to an order of magnitude. We find that most observed gas outer radii in Lupus
can be explained using a viscously evolving disk that starts out small (R_c =
10 AU) and has a low viscosity (alpha_visc = 10^-4 - 10^-3).

expected to occur in the accretion discs of active galactic nuclei (AGN), where
torques exerted by the disc can interfere with the inspiral and cause a phase
shift in the GW waveform. Here we use a suite of two-dimensional hydrodynamical
simulations with the moving-mesh code DISCO to present a systematic study of
disc torques. We measure torques on an inspiraling BH and compute the
corresponding waveform deviations as a function of the binary mass ratio
$q\equiv M_2/M_1$, the disc viscosity ($\alpha$), and gas temperature (or
equivalently Mach number; $\mathcal{M}$). We find that the absolute value of
the gas torques is within an order of magnitude of previously determined
planetary migration torques, but their precise value and sign depends
non-trivially on the combination of these parameters. The gas imprint is
detectable by LISA for binaries embedded in AGN discs with surface densities
above $\Sigma_0\ge10^{4-6} \rm \, g cm^{-2}$, depending on $q$, $\alpha$ and
$\mathcal{M}$. Deviations are most pronounced in discs with higher viscosities,
and for E/IMRIs detected at frequencies where LISA is most sensitive. Torques
in colder discs exhibit a noticeable dependence on the GW-driven inspiral rate
as well as strong fluctuations at late stages of the inspiral. Our results
further suggest that LISA may be able to place constraints on AGN disc

ordinary QFT in a subregion in the boundary is given by a quarter of the area
of an minimal surface embedded in the bulk spacetime. This rule has been also
extended to a suitable one-parameter generalization of the von-Neuman entropy
$\hat{S}_n$ that is related to the R\'enyi entropies $S_n$, as given by the
area of a \emph{cosmic brane} minimally coupled with gravity, with a tension
related to $n$ that vanishes as $n\to1$, and moreover, this parameter can be
analytically extended to arbitrary real values. However, the brane action plays
no role in the duality and cannot be considered a part of the theory of
gravity, thus it is used as an auxiliary tool to find the correct background
geometry.
  In this work we study the construction of the gravitational (reduced) density
matrix from holographic states, whose wave-functionals are described as
euclidean path integrals with arbitrary conditions on the asymptotic
boundaries, and argue that in general, a non-trivial Hayward term must be haven
into account. So we propose that the gravity model with a coupled Nambu-Goto
action is not an artificial tool to account for the R\'enyi entropies, but it
is present in the own gravity action through a Hayward term. As a result we
show that the computations using replicas simplify considerably and we recover
the holographic prescriptions for the measures of entanglement entropy; in
particular, derive an area law for the original R\'enyi entropies ($S_n$)
related to a minimal surface in the $n$ replicated spacetime. Moreover, we show
that the gravitational modular flow contains the area operator and can explain
the Jafferis-Lewkowycz-Maldacena-Suh proposal.

top of a Kondo-lattice, and allowing for pairing in the former. We analyze a
bilayer Kondo Lattice Model with an on-site Hubbard interaction, $-U$, on the
additional layer, using a mean-field approach. For $U=0$, we notice a drastic
change in the density-of-states due to multiple-orbital singlet resonating
combinations. It destroys the well-known Kondo insulator at half filling,
leading to a metallic ground state, which, in turn, enhances antiferromagnetism
through the polarization of the conduction electrons. For $U\neq 0$, a
superconducting Kondo state sets in at zero temperature, with the occurrence of
unconventional pairing amplitudes involving $f$-electrons. We establish that
this remarkable feature is only possible due to the proximity effects of the
additional layer. At finite temperatures we find that the critical
superconducting temperature, $T_c$, decreases with the interlayer
hybridization. We have also established that a zero temperature superconducting
amplitude tracks $T_c$, which reminisces the BCS proportionality between the
superconducting gap and $T_c$.

involve a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs, which are effective in reducing the
virus and extending life spans. However, there is currently no FDA-approved
HIV-1 transcription inhibitor. Furthermore, there have only been a few attempts
to model the transcription process in HIV-1. In this work, we extend a novel
three-state model of HIV-1 transcription introduced in DeMarino et al. (2020)
that has been developed and validated against experimental data. After fitting
this model to in vitro data, significant differences in the transcription
process of HIV-1 in T-cells and macrophages have been observed. In particular,
the activation of the HIV-1 promoter in T-cells appears to take place rapidly
as the Tat protein approaches a critical threshold. In contrast, the same
process occurs smoother in macrophages.
  In this work, we carry out systematic mathematical analyses of the model to
complement experimental data fitting and sensitivity analysis performed
earlier. We derive explicit solutions of the model to obtain exact
transcription process decay rates for the original model and then study the
effect of nonlinearity on the system behavior, including the existence and the
local and global stability of the positive equilibrium. We were able to show
the stability of the positive steady state in limiting cases, with the global
stability in the general case remaining an open question.
  By modeling the effect of transcription-inhibiting drug therapy, we provide a
nontrivial condition for it to be effective in reducing viral load. Moreover,
our numerical simulations and analysis point out that the effect of the
transcription-inhibitor can be enhanced by synchronizing with standard
treatments, such as combination antiretroviral therapy, to allow the reduction
of total dosages and toxicity.

including absorption by the interstellar medium, correction for pile-up of
X-ray photons on the detector, and a power-law for count excesses at high
photon energy. Using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo approach, we extract mass and
radius credible intervals for both chemical compositions of the atmosphere:
$R_{\textrm{NS}}=7.94^{+0.76}_{-1.21}$ km and $M_{\textrm{NS}}<1.19$
M$_{\odot}$ assuming pure hydrogen, and $R_{\textrm{NS}}=10.50^{+2.88}_{-2.03}$
km and $M_{\textrm{NS}}<1.78$ M$_{\odot}$ for helium, where the uncertainties
represent the 90% credible regions. For H, the small radius is difficult to
reconcile with most current nuclear physics models (especially for nucleonic
equations of state) and with other measurements of neutron star radii, with
recent preferred values generally in the 11-14 km range. Whereas for He, the
measured radius is consistent with this range. We discuss possible sources of
systematic uncertainty that may result in an underestimation of the radius,
identifying the presence of surface temperature inhomogeneities as the most
relevant bias. According to this, we conclude that either the atmosphere is
composed of He, or it is a H atmosphere with a significant contribution of hot

discriminating sentence representation. However, it is known that the sentence
representation can be biased when the sampled sentence pairs deviate from the

learning on equal weighted pairs, we propose a unified locality weighting and

SentPWNet, exploits the neighboring spatial distribution of each sentence as
locality weight to indicate the informative level of sentence pair. Such weight
is updated along with pair-loss optimization in each round, ensuring the model
keep learning the most informative sentence pairs. Extensive experiments on

model systems of different dimensionality and distinctive electronic
structures: a 1D chain, a 1D ring, a 2D triangular lattice, and a 3D
close-packed pyramid. To assess the ability of a computational method to
produce accurate and compact wave functions, we introduce the accuracy volume,
a metric that measures the number of variational parameters necessary to
achieve a target energy error. Using this metric and the hydrogen models, we
examine the performance of three classical deterministic methods: i) selected
configuration interaction (sCI) realized both via an a posteriori and
variational selection of the most important determinants, ii) rank-reduced FCI,
obtained by an a posteriori singular value decomposition of the FCI tensor
(SVD-FCI), and iii) the matrix product state representation obtained via the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We find that DMRG generally gives
the most efficient wave function representation for all systems, particularly
in the 1D chain with a localized basis. For the 2D and 3D systems, all methods
perform best with a delocalized basis, and the efficiency of sCI is closer to
that of DMRG, with the former having and accuracy volume approximately twice as
large in the strong correlation regime. Compared to sCI, the SVD-FCI scheme is
generally found to require a slightly larger number of parameters to achieve
the same energy accuracy.

time yet capture few performance metrics and fail to model complex interactions
between multiple cores.
  This paper presents a novel multi-purpose simulator that exploits binary
translation to offer fast cycle-level full-system simulations. Its functional
simulation mode outperforms QEMU and, if desired, it is possible to switch
between functional and timing modes at run-time. Cycle-level simulations of
RISC-V multi-core processors are possible at more than 20 MIPS, a useful middle
ground in terms of accuracy and performance with simulation speeds nearly 100
times those of more detailed cycle-accurate models.

Principal Investigators (PIs) at U.S.- and Europe-based research institutions.
Distributed in mid-April 2020, the survey solicited information about how
scientists' work changed from the onset of the pandemic, how their research
output might be affected in the near future, and a wide range of individuals'
characteristics. Scientists report a sharp decline in time spent on research on
average, but there is substantial heterogeneity with a significant share
reporting no change or even increases. Some of this heterogeneity is due to
field-specific differences, with laboratory-based fields being the most
negatively affected, and some is due to gender, with female scientists
reporting larger declines. However, among the individuals' characteristics
examined, the largest disruptions are connected to a usually unobserved
dimension: childcare. Reporting a young dependent is associated with declines
similar in magnitude to those reported by the laboratory-based fields and can
account for a significant fraction of gender differences. Amidst scarce
evidence about the role of parenting in scientists' work, these results
highlight the fundamental and heterogeneous ways this pandemic is affecting the
scientific workforce, and may have broad relevance for shaping responses to the
pandemic's effect on science and beyond.

of this paper is to study two paradigms of learning hierarchical parameters:
one is from the probabilistic Bayesian perspective, in particular, the
empirical Bayes approach that has been largely used in Bayesian statistics; the
other is from the deterministic and approximation theoretic view, and in

parameter in the Mat\'ern-like field, for which consistency results have been
very scarce in the spatial statistics literature. Moreover, we conduct
extensive numerical experiments beyond the Mat\'ern-like model, comparing the
two algorithms further. These experiments demonstrate learning of other
hierarchical parameters, such as amplitude and lengthscale; they also
illustrate the setting of model misspecification in which the kernel flow
approach could show superior performance to the more traditional empirical

the consistent evaluation of the thermodynamics model and the resulting weak

does not generate unphysical pressure oscillations in smooth regions of the

Additionally, we present an hp-adaptive DG method for solving systems of
ordinary differential equations, DGODE, which is used to resolve the temporal
evolution of the species concentrations due to stiff chemical reactions. The
coupled solver is applied to several challenging test problems including
multi-component shocked flows as well as chemically reacting detonations,

soliton in a 1D linearly chirped nonlinear waveguide array (WA). The discrete
soliton is self-accelerated inside the transversely chirped WA and emits a
\textit{dynamic diffractive resonant radiation} (DifRR). The radiation appears
when soliton wave-number matched with linear radiation wave. Unlike uniform WA,
the DifRR can be excited even for zero wave-number of input soliton when the
waveguide channels are chirped. The transverse modulation due to chirp
conceptually imposes a linear potential which acts as a perturbation to soliton
dynamics and leads to a monotonous wave-number shift of the propagating wave.
Exploiting perturbative variational analysis we determine the equation of
motion of soliton wave-number and use it to establish a modified phase-matching
condition which takes into account the soliton wave-number shift and
efficiently predicts the dynamic DifRR. A startling effect like generation of
dual DifRR occurs as a result of the interplay between self-accelerated soliton
and its initial wave-number. We exploit the modified phase matching relation to
understand this unique phenomenon of dual radiation and find a satisfactory
agreement with numerical result in radiation wave-number calculation.

shown how cross domain object detection can be improved using an image
translation model which translates between domains using a single shared latent
space. However, while current image translation models do a good job preserving
global/intermediate level structures they often have trouble preserving tiny
structures. In medical imaging applications, preserving small structures is
important since these structures can carry information which is highly relevant
for disease diagnosis. Recent works on image reconstruction show that complex
real-world images are better reconstructed using a union of subspaces approach.
Since small image patches are used to train the image translation model, it
makes sense to enforce that each patch be represented by a linear combination
of subspaces which may correspond to the different parts of the body present in
that patch. Motivated by this, we propose an image translation network using a
shared union of subspaces constraint and show our approach preserves subtle

skyrmion crystal (SkX), is of fundamental interest to confirm such exotic
magnetic order. The SkX is realized by competing Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and
ferromagnetic-exchange interactions with a magnetic field or anisotropy. Here
we compute the dynamical spin structure factor, using Monte Carlo and spin
dynamics simulations, extracting the spin-wave spectrum in the SkX, in the
vicinity of the paramagnet to SkX transition. Inside the SkX, we find six
spin-wave modes, which are supplemented by another mode originating from the
ferromagnetic background. Above the critical temperature $T_s$ for the skyrmion
crystallization, we find a diffusive regime, reminiscent of the
liquid-to-crystal transition, revealing that topological spin texture of
skyrmionic character starts to develop above $T_s$ as the precursor of the SkX.
We discuss the opportunities for the detection of the spin waves of the SkX
using inelastic-neutron-scattering experiments in manganite-iridate
heterostructures.

fine-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP

to the line of sight. The jet spectral index ($\alpha$, defined in the sense $S
\propto \nu^{\alpha}$) is fairly constant (<$\alpha_{\rm jet}$> = $-$0.7), and
spectral flattening within 4.4 kpc of the core coincides with bright knots and
is consistent with the site of X-ray particle acceleration at the base of the
radio jet found in previous studies. There is little difference between the
spectra of the two hotspot components, plausibly indicating that electron
populations of the same properties are injected there. The NW and SE plumes are
approximately homologous structures, with variations in mass injection and
propagation in external pressure and density gradients in the two regions
plausibly accounting for the slightly steeper spectrum in the NW plume,
<$\alpha_{\rm NWp}$> = $-$1.43 compared with the SE plume, <$\alpha_{\rm SEp}$>

case, we refer to the model as to the simplicial SIS model. Classically, the
multi-group SIS model has assumed pairwise interactions of contagion across
groups and thus has been vastly studied in the literature. It is only recently
that a renewed special attention has been drawn to the study of contagion
dynamics over higher-order interactions and over more general graph structures,
like simplexes. Previous work on mean-field approximation scalar models of the
simplicial SIS model has indicated that a new dynamical behavior domain,
compared to the classical SIS model, appears due to the newly introduced higher
order interaction terms: both a disease-free equilibrium and an endemic
equilibrium co-exist and are both locally asymptotically stable. This paper
formally establishes that bistability (as a new epidemiological behavior) also
appears in the multi-group simplicial SIS model. We give sufficient conditions
over the model's parameters for the appearance of this and the other behavioral
domains present in the classical multi-group SIS model. We additionally provide
an algorithm to compute the value of the endemic equilibrium and report

require large amounts of data and computing resources. These constraints make
it difficult to quickly personalize to individual users or train models outside
of fairly powerful machines. To deal with these problems, there has been a
large body of research into teaching machines to learn to classify images based
on only a handful of training examples, a field known as few-shot learning.
Few-shot learning research traditionally makes the simplifying assumption that
all images belong to one of a fixed number of previously seen groups. However,
many image datasets, such as a camera roll on a phone, will be noisy and
contain images that may not be relevant or fit into any clear group. We propose
a model which can both classify new images based on a small number of examples
and recognize images which do not belong to any previously seen group. We adapt
previous few-shot learning work to include a simple mechanism for learning a
cutoff that determines whether an image should be excluded or classified. We
examine how well our method performs in a realistic setting, benchmarking the
approach on a noisy and ambiguous dataset of images. We evaluate performance
over a spectrum of model architectures, including setups small enough to be run
on low powered devices, such as mobile phones or web browsers. We find that
this task of excluding irrelevant images poses significant extra difficulty
beyond that of the traditional few-shot task. We decompose the sources of this
error, and suggest future improvements that might alleviate this difficulty.

of people every year. Computational methods have been proven to be useful in
the medical industry by providing effective means of classification of
diagnostic imaging and disease identification. This paper examines different
machine learning methods in the context of classifying the presence of malaria
in cell images. Numerous machine learning methods can be applied to the same
problem; the question of whether one machine learning method is better suited
to a problem relies heavily on the problem itself and the implementation of a
model. In particular, convolutional neural networks and k nearest neighbours
are both analyzed and contrasted in regards to their application to classifying
the presence of malaria and each models empirical performance. Here, we
implement two models of classification; a convolutional neural network, and the
k nearest neighbours algorithm. These two algorithms are compared based on
validation accuracy. For our implementation, CNN (95%) performed 25% better
than kNN (75%).

distributed data. To effectively utilize data at different devices without
moving them to the cloud, algorithms such as the Federated Averaging (FedAvg)
have adopted a ""computation then aggregation"" (CTA) model, in which multiple
local updates are performed using local data, before sending the local models
to the cloud for aggregation.
  However, these schemes typically require strong assumptions, such as the
local data are identically independent distributed (i.i.d), or the size of the
local gradients are bounded. In this paper, we first explicitly characterize
the behavior of the FedAvg algorithm, and show that without strong and
unrealistic assumptions on the problem structure, the algorithm can behave
erratically for non-convex problems (e.g., diverge to infinity). Aiming at
designing FL algorithms that are provably fast and require as few assumptions
as possible, we propose a new algorithm design strategy from the primal-dual
optimization perspective. Our strategy yields a family of algorithms that take
the same CTA model as existing algorithms, but they can deal with the
non-convex objective, achieve the best possible optimization and communication
complexity while being able to deal with both the full batch and mini-batch
local computation models. Most importantly, the proposed algorithms are {\it
communication efficient}, in the sense that the communication pattern can be
adaptive to the level of heterogeneity among the local data. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first algorithmic framework for FL that achieves all the
above properties.

quantum equations of motion expanded in a trans-series around this asymptotic
regime. By studying the scalings of all possible perturbative and
non-perturbative corrections we identify the effects that have the right
scaling to allow for the desired solutions. In the case of Anti-de Sitter, we
find agreement with KKLT-type scenarios, and argue that non-perturbative
brane-instantons wrapping four-cycles (or similarly scaling effects) are
essentially the only ingredient that allows for scale separated solutions. We
also comment on the relation of these results to the AdS swampland conjectures.
For the de Sitter case we find that we are forced to introduce an infinite
number of relatively unsuppressed corrections to the equations of motion,
leading to a breakdown of effective theory. This suggests that if de Sitter
vacua exist in the string landscape, they should not be thought of as residing
within the same effective theory as the AdS or Minkowski compactifications, but
rather as defining a separate asymptotic regime, presumably related to the
others by a duality transformation.

interests in developing a new generation of ""intelligent textbooks"", which have
the ability to guide the readers according to their learning goals and current

machine-manipulatable knowledge such as a knowledge map or a
prerequisite-outcome relationship between sections, among which, the most
popular integrated knowledge is a list of unique knowledge concepts associated
with each section. With the help of this concept, multiple intelligent
operations, such as content linking, content recommendation or student

textbook section is a challenge. Automatic unsupervised methods for extracting
key-phrases as the concepts are known to have insufficient accuracy. Manual
annotation by experts is considered as a preferred approach and can be used to
produce both the target outcome and the labeled data for training supervised

concept annotation process as an ad-hoc activity rather than an engineering

textbook knowledge engineering method to obtain reliable concept annotations.
The outcomes of our work include a validated knowledge engineering procedure, a
code-book for technical concept annotation, and a set of concept annotations
for the target textbook, which could be used as gold standard in further

X-ray computed tomography (CT). Optical diffusion tomography is an alternative
to X-ray CT that uses multiply scattered light to deliver coarse density maps
for soft tissues. We define and derive tomography of cloud droplet
distributions via passive remote sensing. We use multi-view polarimetric images
to fit a 3D polarized radiative transfer (RT) forward model. Our motivation is
3D volumetric probing of vertically-developed convectively-driven clouds that
are ill-served by current methods in operational passive remote sensing. These
techniques are based on strictly 1D RT modeling and applied to a single cloudy
pixel, where cloud geometry is assumed to be that of a plane-parallel slab.
Incident unpolarized sunlight, once scattered by cloud-droplets, changes its
polarization state according to droplet size. Therefore, polarimetric
measurements in the rainbow and glory angular regions can be used to infer the
droplet size distribution. This work defines and derives a framework for a full
3D tomography of cloud droplets for both their mass concentration in space and
their distribution across a range of sizes. This 3D retrieval of key
microphysical properties is made tractable by our novel approach that involves
a restructuring and differentiation of an open-source polarized 3D RT code to

synthetic clouds are used to demonstrate the methodology with rigorous

ensure proper packet delivery in the event of software errors or hardware
failures. Networks must ensure reachability and routing correctness, such as
subnet isolation and waypoint traversal. Existing work in network verification
relies on centralized computation at the cost of fault tolerance, while other
approaches either build an over-engineered, complex control plane, or compose
multiple control planes without providing any guarantee on correctness. This
paper presents Carbide, a novel system to achieve high reliability in networks
through distributed verification and multiple control plane composition. The
core of Carbide is a simple, generic, efficient distributed verification
framework that transforms a generic network verification problem to a
reachability verification problem on a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and solves
the latter via an efficient distributed verification protocol (DV-protocol).
Equipped with verification results, Carbide allows the systematic composition
of multiple control planes and realization of operator-specified consistency.
Carbide is fully implemented. Extensive experiments show that (1) Carbide
reduces downtime by 43% over the most reliable individual underlying control
plane, while enforcing correctness requirements on all traffic; and (2) by
systematically decomposing computation to devices and pruning unnecessary
messaging between devices during verification, Carbide scales to a production
data center network.

to be huge when the number of boxes becomes large, especially for crowded
scenes. The basic idea of HNMS is to firstly map each box to a discrete code
(hash cell) and then remove the boxes with lower confidences if they are in the
same cell. Considering the intersection-over-union (IoU) as the metric, we
propose a simple yet effective hashing algorithm, named IoUHash, which
guarantees that the boxes within the same cell are close enough by a lower IoU
bound. For two-stage detectors, we replace NMS in region proposal network with
HNMS, and observe significant speed-up with comparable accuracy. For one-stage
detectors, HNMS is used as a pre-filter to speed up the suppression with a
large margin. Extensive experiments are conducted on CARPK, SKU-110K,
CrowdHuman datasets to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of HNMS.

a finite-element method (FEM) based solid dynamics solver for FSI simulation of

reaction networks in which species act catalytically at the level of the

complexes to coordinate the catalysis, indirect interaction between the
catalyst and its substrate, and the recovery of a distinct ``catalyst'' strand
from the one that triggered the reaction. These facts make emulation of the

propose a new framework for constructing catalytic DSD networks: Active

directly bind to their substrates, and and the ``identity'' strand of the

also revealed that the ratio T_c/lambda_(eff)^(-2) is comparable to those of

sensing system with n sensors communicating with a fusion center via a

it is shown that the problem of minimizing the mean-squared error subject to a
threshold-based strategy at the transmitters is quasi-convex. As such, low
complexity, numerical optimization methods can be applied. When coordination
among sensors is not possible, the performance of the optimal threshold
strategy is close to that of a centralized lower bound. The loss due to
decentralization is thoroughly characterized. Local communication among sensors
(using a sparsely connected graph), enables the on-line learning of unknown
parameters of the statistical model. These learned parameters are employed to
compute the desired thresholds locally and autonomously. Consensus-based
strategies are investigated and analyzed for parameter estimation. One strategy
approaches the performance of the decentralized approach with fast convergence
and a second strategy approaches the performance of the centralized approach,
albeit with slower convergence. A hybrid scheme that combines the best of both
approaches is proposed offering a fast convergence and excellent convergent
performance.

selects a batch of unlabeled data points, queries their labels and updates a
binary classifier. While there exists a rich body of work on active learning in
this general form, in this paper, we focus on problems with two distinguishing
characteristics: severe class imbalance (skew) and small amounts of initial
training data. Both of these problems occur with surprising frequency in many
web applications. For instance, detecting offensive or sensitive content in
online communities (pornography, violence, and hate-speech) is receiving
enormous attention from industry as well as research communities. Such problems
have both the characteristics we describe -- a vast majority of content is not
offensive, so the number of positive examples for such content is orders of
magnitude smaller than the negative examples. Furthermore, there is usually
only a small amount of initial training data available when building
machine-learned models to solve such problems. To address both these issues, we
propose a hybrid active learning algorithm (HAL) that balances exploiting the
knowledge available through the currently labeled training examples with
exploring the large amount of unlabeled data available. Through simulation
results, we show that HAL makes significantly better choices for what points to
label when compared to strong baselines like margin-sampling. Classifiers
trained on the examples selected for labeling by HAL easily out-perform the
baselines on target metrics (like area under the precision-recall curve) given
the same budget for labeling examples. We believe HAL offers a simple,
intuitive, and computationally tractable way to structure active learning for a
wide range of machine learning applications.

important to understand the trade-offs between the approaches, how these

  Experts who have worked in these areas tend to find the trade-offs somewhat

discussion of general trade-offs between general classes of techniques. As a

important attribute of the iBCI is that its input signal contains

on a system with non-collocated haptic feedback and inform iBCI-based
prostheses control strategies, we conducted an experiment with a conventional
haptic interface as a proxy for the iBCI. Able-bodied users were tasked with
locating an indentation within a virtual environment using input from their
right hand. Non-collocated haptic feedback of the interaction forces in the

simultaneously rendered on users' left hands. We found increases in distance
error of the guess of the indentation location, mean time per trial, mean peak

highest noise level compared to the other two levels. The findings suggest that
users have a threshold of disturbance rejection and that they attempt to

  Conference 2020",,"10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256527",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the rapidly increasing number of flights and high usage of VHF
channels, the VHF spectrum is becoming much more crowded, and use of analog
waveforms will likely not maintain the required performance. Therefore, digital
communications have been considered due to larger spectral efficiency. Notably,
VHF data link modes 2 and 3 (VDL2 and 3) using D8PSK modulation has been
proposed. VDL2 and 3 received attention due to its simplicity and more constant
amplitude waveform, yielding lower PAPR. Recently, advanced VHF digital link
(A-VDL) was proposed for VHF. This scheme enables use of essentially the same
platform as VDL except for the physical layer processing, including modulation.
The proposed A-VDL, following DVB-S2 standard, uses APSK modulation with higher
modulation order than VDL, hence providing higher spectral efficiency than VDL.
Compared to the widely used QAM, APSK is more resistant to amplifier amplitude
and phase distortions. Thus, APSK has become of interest for satellite
communications, as well as VHF communications in A-VDL. In this paper, we
investigate other advanced technologies such as channel encoding technique
low-density parity-check (LDPC), more efficient standardized voice encoders, as
well as better pulse shaping filters than the classical square-root
raised-cosine filter used in VDL and A-VDL. Via simulations and analysis, we
compare the proposed scheme's link margin, PAPR, and spectral efficiency
compared to VDL and A-VDL, which both use Reed Solomon (RS) encoding. In
addition, as another way of generating the same VDL waveforms (or possibly
other single-carrier aeronautical band waveforms), we investigate the
single-carrier type waveform used in cellular LTE and 5G uplink communication
links, the discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), and discuss how
we can take advantage of using the same LTE and 5G hardware resources.

noise (AWGN) performance in spectrally non-white channels, using multicarrier
communications, i.e., orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and
filterbank multicarrier (FBMC). The non-white channel can be from non-white
noise, or more commonly, interference. Our algorithm uses a simple optimization
method to find usable subcarriers and assigns different power levels to the
subcarriers to attain the equivalent AWGN channel bit error ratio (BER).
Subcarriers that experience very high interference are assigned as null
subcarriers. After describing our analysis, we show results for two non-white
interference signal examples: the Gaussian pulse shaped distance measuring
equipment (DME) pulses, and a classical rectangular-pulse interference signal.
The DME example is pertinent for currently proposed aviation communication
systems, where new multicarrier techniques, e.g., the L-band digital aviation
communication systems (LDACS) have been designed as an inlay approach between
the high-power DME channels in the L-band. Our results show how using this
adaptive technique can improve performance and spectral efficiency, whereas
fixed bandwidth schemes such as LDACS could suffer significant performance
degradation. These results show the utility of this idea for future adaptive
and cognitive radio applications for aviation or other non-white channels.

predictions without strong annotations and then take predictions with high

effectiveness in SSED. However, probabilities are poorly calibrated confidence
estimates, and samples with low probabilities are ignored. Hence, we introduce
a method of learning confidence deliberately and retaining all data distinctly
by applying confidence as weights. Additionally, linear pooling has been
considered as a state-of-the-art aggregation function for SSED with weak
labeling. In this paper, we propose a power pooling function whose coefficient
can be trained automatically to achieve nonlinearity. A confidencebased
semi-supervised sound event detection (C-SSED) framework is designed to combine
confidence and power pooling. The experimental results demonstrate that
confidence is proportional to the accuracy of the predictions. The power
pooling function outperforms linear pooling at both error rate and F1 results.

over a large range of misalignments; we term this diffractive network design as
vaccinated D2NN (v-D2NN). We further extend this vaccination strategy to the
training of diffractive networks that use differential detectors at the output

reveal that all of these diffractive designs improve their resilience to
misalignments by taking into account possible 3D fabrication variations and

steering is important for both its fundamental role in interpreting the nature
of quantum mechanics and its application as resource for the tasks where the
levels of trust at different parties are highly asymmetric. Here, we study the
entanglement and EPR steering between two macroscopic magnons in a hybrid
ferrimagnet-light system. In the absence of light, the two types of magnons on
the two sublattices can be entangled, but no quantum steering occurs when they
are damped with the same rates. In the presence of the cavity field, the
entanglement can be significantly enhanced, and strong two-way asymmetric
quantum steering appears between two magnons with equal dispassion. This is
very different from the conventional protocols to produce asymmetric steering
by imposing additional unbalanced losses or noises on the two parties at the
cost of reducing steerability. The essential physics is well understood by the
unbalanced population of acoustic and optical magnons under the cooling effect
of cavity photons. Our finding may provide a novel platform to manipulate the
quantum steering and the detection of bi-party steering provides a knob to

Here we show that when the stacking order changes from ABC to CBA, three

feature map resolution and receptive field on high-resolution inputs still
remains an open question. In this paper, to tackle this issue, we build a novel
architecture, called Attention-guided Context Feature Pyramid Network (AC-FPN),
that exploits discriminative information from various large receptive fields
via integrating attention-guided multi-path features. The model contains two
modules. The first one is Context Extraction Module (CEM) that explores large
contextual information from multiple receptive fields. As redundant contextual
relations may mislead localization and recognition, we also design the second
module named Attention-guided Module (AM), which can adaptively capture the
salient dependencies over objects by using the attention mechanism. AM consists
of two sub-modules, i.e., Context Attention Module (CxAM) and Content Attention
Module (CnAM), which focus on capturing discriminative semantics and locating
precise positions, respectively. Most importantly, our AC-FPN can be readily
plugged into existing FPN-based models. Extensive experiments on object
detection and instance segmentation show that existing models with our proposed
CEM and AM significantly surpass their counterparts without them, and our model
successfully obtains state-of-the-art results. We have released the source code

Inspired by the bias-variance trade-off, WGTB is proposed and tailored to the
great disparity among different inference models on accuracy, volatility and
linearity. The complete strategy integrates four different inference models of
different capacities. WGTB then ensembles their outputs by a warm-start and a
hybrid of bagging and boosting, which lowers bias and variance concurrently. It
is validated on two real datasets from State Grid Corporation of China of

of unknown origin observed at extragalactic distances. It has been long
speculated that magnetars are the engine powering repeating bursts from FRB
sources, but no convincing evidence has been collected so far\cite{sun19}.
Recently, the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 entered an active phase by
emitting intense soft Gamma-ray bursts. One FRB-like event with two peaks (FRB
200428) and a luminosity slightly lower than the faintest extragalactic FRBs
was detected from the source, in association with a soft Gamma-ray / hard X-ray
flare. Here we report an eight-hour targeted radio observational campaign
comprising four sessions and assisted by multi-wavelength (optical and hard
X-rays) data. During the third session, 29 soft Gamma-ray repeater (SGR) bursts
were detected in Gamma-ray energies. Throughout the observing period, we
detected no single dispersed pulsed emission coincident with the arrivals of
SGR bursts, but unfortunately we were not observing when the FRB was detected.
The non-detection places a fluence upper limit that is eight orders of
magnitude lower than the fluence of FRB 200428. Our results suggest that FRB --
SGR burst associations are rare. FRBs may be highly relativistic and
geometrically beamed, or FRB-like events associated with SGR bursts may have
narrow spectra and characteristic frequencies outside the observed band. It is
also possible that the physical conditions required to achieve coherent
radiation in SGR bursts are difficult to satisfy, and that only under extreme
conditions could an FRB be associated with an SGR burst.

emerging privacy concerns from users on data sharing hinder the generation or
use of crowdsourcing datasets and lead to hunger of training data for new deep
learning applications. One na\""{\i}ve solution is to pre-process the raw data
to extract features at the user-side, and then only the extracted features will
be sent to the data collector. Unfortunately, attackers can still exploit these
extracted features to train an adversary classifier to infer private

the case where the learning task may be unknown or changing, we present TIPRDC,
a task-independent privacy-respecting data crowdsourcing framework with
anonymized intermediate representation. The goal of this framework is to learn
a feature extractor that can hide the privacy information from the intermediate
representations; while maximally retaining the original information embedded in
the raw data for the data collector to accomplish unknown learning tasks. We
design a hybrid training method to learn the anonymized intermediate
representation: (1) an adversarial training process for hiding private

other Fe-Ni alloys exhibit no temperature dependence down to 10~K.
Interestingly, the shallow core level spectra (3$s$, 3$p$) of Fe and Ni of the
Invar alloy reveal stronger deviation at low temperatures compared to the deep
core levels (2$s$, 2$p$) indicating crystal field effect. It appears that there
is a large precipitation of antiferromagnetic $\gamma^\prime$ phase below 20 K

The discovery of negative magneto-resistance, anomalous magnetization at low

first principles the effective interaction between hadrons with different quark
content. First successes have been achieved using techniques that solve the
dynamics of quarks and gluons on discrete space-time lattices. Experimentally,
the dynamics of the strong interaction have been studied by scattering hadrons
off each other. Such scattering experiments are difficult or impossible for
unstable hadrons and so high-quality measurements exist only for hadrons
containing up and down quarks. Here we demonstrate that measuring correlations
in the momentum space between hadron pairs produced in ultrarelativistic
proton-proton collisions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) provides a
precise method with which to obtain the missing information on the interaction
dynamics between any pair of unstable hadrons. Specifically, we discuss the
case of the interaction of baryons containing strange quarks (hyperons). We
demonstrate how, using precision measurements of p-omega baryon correlations,
the effect of the strong interaction for this hadron-hadron pair can be studied
with precision similar to, and compared with, predictions from lattice
calculations. The large number of hyperons identified in proton-proton
collisions at the LHC, together with an accurate modelling of the small
(approximately one femtometre) inter-particle distance and exact predictions
for the correlation functions, enables a detailed determination of the
short-range part of the nucleon-hyperon interaction.

a lattice distribution of hidden nodes has three inherent demerits: 1) the
approximation domain of adaptive RBFNNs is difficult to be determined a priori;
2) only a partial persistence of excitation (PE) condition can be guaranteed;
and 3) in general, the required number of hidden nodes of RBFNNs is enormous.
This paper proposes an adaptive feedforward RBFNN controller with an optimized
distribution of hidden nodes to suitably address the above demerits. The
distribution of the hidden nodes calculated by a K-means algorithm is optimally
distributed along the desired state trajectory. The adaptive RBFNN satisfies
the PE condition for the periodic reference trajectory. The weights of all
hidden nodes will converge to the optimal values. This proposed method
considerably reduces the number of hidden nodes, while achieving a better
approximation ability. The proposed control scheme shares a similar rationality
to that of the classical PID control in two special cases, which can thus be
seen as an enhanced PID scheme with a better approximation ability. For the
controller implemented by digital devices,the proposed method, for a
manipulator with unknown dynamics, potentially achieves better control
performance than model-based schemes with accurate dynamics.Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. This result provides a
deeper insight into the coordination of the adaptive neural network control and
the deterministic learning theory.

describe the space of probability distributions as a Riemannian manifold with
an additional dual structure. The formal equivalence of compositional data with
discrete probability distributions makes it possible to apply the same
description to the sample space of Compositional Data Analysis (CoDA). The
latter has been formally described as a Euclidean space with an orthonormal
basis featuring components that are suitable combinations of the original
parts. In contrast to the Euclidean metric, the information-geometric
description singles out the Fisher information metric as the only one keeping
the manifold's geometric structure invariant under equivalent representations
of the underlying random variables. Well-known concepts that are valid in
Euclidean coordinates, e.g., the Pythogorean theorem, are generalized by
information geometry to corresponding notions that hold for more general
coordinates. In briefly reviewing Euclidean CoDA and, in more detail, the
information-geometric approach, we show how the latter justifies the use of
distance measures and divergences that so far have received little attention in
CoDA as they do not fit the Euclidean geometry favored by current thinking. We

one of the standard models of disease spreading. Here we analyse an extended
SEIR model that accounts for asymptomatic carriers, believed to play an
important role in COVID-19 transmission. For this model we derive a number of
analytic results for important quantities such as the peak number of
infections, the time taken to reach the peak and the size of the final affected
population. We also propose an accurate way of specifying initial conditions
for the numerics (from insufficient data) using the fact that the early time
exponential growth is well-described by the dominant eigenvector of the
linearized equations. Secondly we explore the effect of different intervention
strategies such as social distancing (SD) and testing-quarantining (TQ). The
two intervention strategies (SD and TQ) try to reduce the disease reproductive
number, $R_0$, to a target value $R^{\rm target}_0 < 1$, but in distinct ways,
which we implement in our model equations. We find that for the same $R^{\rm
target}_0 < 1$, TQ is more efficient in controlling the pandemic than SD.
However, for TQ to be effective, it has to be based on contact tracing and our
study quantifies the required ratio of tests-per-day to the number of new
cases-per-day. Our analysis shows that the largest eigenvalue of the linearised
dynamics provides a simple understanding of the disease progression, both pre-
and post- intervention, and explains observed data for many countries. We apply
our results to the COVID data for India to obtain heuristic projections for the
course of the pandemic, and note that the predictions strongly depend on the
assumed fraction of asymptomatic carriers.

Frontal attack exploits timing differences that arise from how the CPU frontend
fetches and processes instructions while being interrupted. In particular, we
observe that in modern Intel CPUs, some instructions' execution times will
depend on which operations precede and succeed them, and on their virtual
addresses. Unlike previous attacks that could only profile branches if they
contained different code or had known branch targets, the Frontal attack allows
the adversary to distinguish between instruction-wise identical branches. As
the attack requires OS capabilities to set the interrupts, we use it to exploit
SGX enclaves. Our attack further demonstrates that secret-dependent branches
should not be used even alongside defenses to current controlled-channel
attacks. We show that the adversary can use the Frontal attack to extract a
secret from an SGX enclave if that secret was used as a branching condition for
two instruction-wise identical branches. We successfully tested the attack on
all the available Intel CPUs with SGX (until 10th gen) and used it to leak
information from two commonly used cryptographic libraries.

CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition system was proposed to
identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify
the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN
classifier. Furthermore, the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to
visualize classification output and understand the reasoning behind the
decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained and
tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed
images were used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks.
Two recognition schemes were considered: plain CXR classification and segmented
CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was observed that InceptionV3
outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities

FlowDroid, perform the whole-app inter-procedural analysis that is
comprehensive but fundamentally difficult to handle modern (large) apps. The
average app size has increased three to four times over five years. In this
paper, we explore a new paradigm of targeted inter-procedural analysis that can
skip irrelevant code and focus only on the flows of security-sensitive sink
APIs. To this end, we propose a technique called on-the-fly bytecode search,
which searches the disassembled app bytecode text just in time when a caller
needs to be located. In this way, it guides targeted (and backward)
inter-procedural analysis step by step until reaching entry points, without
relying on a whole-app graph. Such search-based inter-procedural analysis,
however, is challenging due to Java polymorphism, callbacks, asynchronous
flows, static initializers, and inter-component communication in Android apps.
We overcome these unique obstacles in our context by proposing a set of
bytecode search mechanisms that utilize flexible searches and forward object
taint analysis. Atop of this new inter-procedural analysis, we further adjust
the traditional backward slicing and forward constant propagation to provide
the complete dataflow tracking of sink API calls. We have implemented a
prototype called BackDroid and compared it with Amandroid in analyzing 3,178
modern popular apps for crypto and SSL misconfigurations. The evaluation shows
that for such sink-based problems, BackDroid is 37 times faster (2.13 v.s.
78.15 minutes) and has no timed-out failure (v.s. 35% in Amandroid), while
maintaining close or even better detection effectiveness.

fluctuations. The result shows the existence of possibility of ratcheting
driven by bath fluctuations. If this component of energy conversion driven by

efficiently classically, assuming strongly held conjectures in complexity
theory. A feature dubbed quantum speedup. However, the effect of noise on these
proposals is not well understood in general, and in certain cases it is known
that simple noise can destroy the quantum speedup.
  Here we develop a fault-tolerant version of one family of these sampling
problems, which we show can be implemented using quantum circuits of constant
depth. We present two constructions, each taking $poly(n)$ physical qubits,
some of which are prepared in noisy magic states. The first of our
constructions is a constant depth quantum circuit composed of single and
two-qubit nearest neighbour Clifford gates in four dimensions. This circuit has
one layer of interaction with a classical computer before final measurements.
Our second construction is a constant depth quantum circuit with single and
two-qubit nearest neighbour Clifford gates in three dimensions, but with two
layers of interaction with a classical computer before the final measurements.
  For each of these constructions, we show that there is no classical algorithm
which can sample according to its output distribution in $poly(n)$ time,
assuming two standard complexity theoretic conjectures hold. The noise model we
assume is the so-called local stochastic quantum noise. Along the way, we
introduce various new concepts such as constant depth magic state distillation
(MSD), and constant depth output routing, which arise naturally in measurement
based quantum computation (MBQC), but have no constant-depth analogue in the
circuit model.

faster than by exhaustive search (and by how much), we study the fine-grained
complexity of Boolean constraint satisfaction with size constraint exactly $k$.
More precisely, we aim to determine, for any finite constraint family, the
optimal running time $f(k)n^{g(k)}$ required to find satisfying assignments
that set precisely $k$ of the $n$ variables to $1$.
  Under central hardness assumptions on detecting cliques in graphs and
3-uniform hypergraphs, we give an almost tight characterization of $g(k)$ into
four regimes: (1) Brute force is essentially best-possible, i.e., $g(k) = (1\pm
o(1))k$, (2) the best algorithms are as fast as current $k$-clique algorithms,
i.e., $g(k)=(\omega/3\pm o(1))k$, (3) the exponent has sublinear dependence on
$k$ with $g(k) \in [\Omega(\sqrt[3]{k}), O(\sqrt{k})]$, or (4) the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable, i.e., $g(k) = O(1)$.
  This yields a more fine-grained perspective than a previous FPT/W[1]-hardness
dichotomy (Marx, Computational Complexity 2005). Our most interesting technical
contribution is a $f(k)n^{4\sqrt{k}}$-time algorithm for SubsetSum with

running times that scale better with $k$ and $\Vert x \Vert_0$ compared to ICWS

essential step towards implementing various quantum technologies. The
omnidirectionality of free-standing emitters, however, makes this coupling
highly inefficient, in particular if the distant nodes are coupled via low
numerical aperture (NA) channels such as optical fibers. This limitation
requires placing quantum emitters in nanoantennas that can direct the photons
into the channels with very high efficiency. Moreover, to be able to scale such
technologies to a large number of channels, the placing of the emitters should
be deterministic. In this work we present a method for directly locating single
free-standing quantum emitters with high spatial accuracy at the center of
highly directional bullseye metal-dielectric nanoantennas. We further employ
non-blinking, high quantum yield colloidal quantum dots (QDs) for on-demand
single-photon emission that is uncompromised by instabilities or non-radiative
exciton recombination processes. Taken together this approach results in a
record-high collection efficiency of 85% of the single photons into a low NA of
0.5, setting the stage for efficient coupling between on-chip, room temperature
nanoantenna-emitter devices and a fiber or a remote free-space node without the
need for additional optics.

but with different sets of Objects of Interest (OoI) is an inexpensive way (in
terms of labor cost) for crafting a large-scale dataset covering a wide range
of objects. Moreover, merging datasets allows us to train one integrated object
detector, instead of training several ones, which in turn resulting in the
reduction of computational and time costs. However, merging the datasets from
similar contexts causes samples with partial labeling as each constituent
dataset is originally annotated for its own set of OoI and ignores to annotate
those objects that are become interested after merging the datasets. With the
goal of training \emph{one integrated robust object detector with high

computationally efficient self-supervised framework to create on-the-fly
pseudo-labels for the unlabeled positive instances in the merged dataset in

properties of logical systems. They have recently been fruitfully explored in
understanding minimisation of various types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et
al. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category
of algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual
to a coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace
equivalence. It follows that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to
minimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include partially observable
deterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras
over finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are
coalgebras on compact Hausdorff spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's
double-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic finite automata was
described categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between
reachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of
Brzozowski's algorithm to Moore and weighted automata over commutative
semirings.
  In this paper we propose a general categorical framework within which such
minimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a unifying
perspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three
interconnected adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual
adjunction between coalgebras and algebras and also to a dual adjunction
between automata. The approach provides an abstract understanding of
reachability and observability. We illustrate the general framework on range of
concrete examples, including deterministic Kripke frames, weighted automata,
topological automata (belief automata), and alternating automata.

learned about the high-z Universe. Aims. Despite extensive Ly-alpha Blobs (LAB)
surveys from low to high redshifts, giant LABs over 100 kpc have been found
mostly at z~2-4. This redshift range is coincident with the transition epoch of
galactic gas-circulation processes from inflows to outflows at z~2.5-3. This
suggests that the formation of giant LABs may be related to a combination of
gas inflows and outflows. Their extreme youth makes them interesting objects in
the study of galaxy formation as they provide insight into some of the youngest
known highly star forming galaxies, with only modest time investments using
ground-based telescopes. Methods. Systematic narrow-band Ly-alpha nebula
surveys are ongoing, but they are limited in their covered redshift range and
their comoving volume. This poses a significant problem when searching for such
rare sources. To address this problem, we developed a systematic searching
tool, ATACAMA (A Tool for seArChing for lArge LyMan Alpha nebulae) designed to
find large Ly-alpha nebulae at any redshift within deep multi-wavelength
broad-band imaging. Results. We identified a Ly-alpha nebula candidate at
zphot~3.3 covering an isophotal area of 29.4sq.arcsec. Its morphology shows a
bright core and a faint core which coincides with the morphology of previously
known Ly-alpha blobs. A first estimation of the Ly-alpha equivalent width and
line flux agree with the values from the study led by several groups.

inherent limitation of performing real-time personalization for cold-start
users. Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this
limitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the
exploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods
model recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider
the items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which
naturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can
effectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the
conversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask
the attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important
scenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted
function to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such
separate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system
highly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing
fragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify
attributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs
automatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling. Our Conversational
Thompson Sampling (ConTS) model holistically solves all questions in
conversational recommendation by choosing the arm with the maximal reward to
play. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that ConTS
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods Conversational UCB (ConUCB) and

controlled directly in a physical (closed-course proving ground) or virtual

  In AV testing, simulation serves primarily two purposes: to assist the

temperature superconductors. The maximum temperature of 250K for LaH(10) and
288K for CSH(8) were reported at the megabar pressures. The highest possible
temperatures were achieved by employing hydrides of chemical elements.
Empirically, many of these are made of Madelung-exceptional atoms. Here the
theoretical background is provided explaining this observation. The, thus far
empirical, Madelung rule is controlling Mendeleev's law of periodicity.
Although the majority of elements do obey this rule, there are some exceptions.
Thus, it is of interest to derive it and its exceptions theoretically in view
of experimental findings. As a by product, such a study yields some plausible
explanation of the role of Madelung-exceptional atoms in the design of
hightemperature superconductors. Thus far the atoms obeying the Madelung rule
and its exceptions were studied with help of the relativistic Hartree-Fock
calculations. In this work we reobtain both the rule and the exceptions
analytically. The newly developed methods are expected to be of value in
quantum many-body theory and, in particular, in the theory of high temperature
superconductivity. Ultimately, new methods involve some uses of the
Seiberg-Witten (S-W) theory known as the extended Ginzburg-Landau theory of
superconductivity. Using results of the S-W theory the difference between the
Madelung-regular and Madelung-exceptional atoms is explained in terms of the
topological transition. Extension of this, single atom, result to solids of
respective elements is also discussed

  data","4 pages, 2 figures",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.MA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  How can urban movement data be exploited in order to improve the flow of
traffic within a city? Movement data provides valuable information about routes
and specific roads that people are likely to drive on. This allows us to
pinpoint roads that occur in many routes and are thus sensitive to congestion.
Redistributing some of the traffic to avoid unnecessary use of these roads
could be a key factor in improving traffic flow. Many proposed approaches to
combat congestion are either static or do not incorporate any movement data. In
this work, we present a method to redistribute traffic through the introduction
of externally imposed variable costs to each road segment, assuming that all
drivers seek to drive the cheapest route. We use a metaheuristic optimisation
approach to minimise total travel times by optimising a set of road-specific
variable cost parameters, which are used as input for an objective function
based on traffic flow theory. The optimisation scenario for the city centre of
Tokyo considered in this paper was defined using public spatial road network
data, and movement data acquired from Foursquare. Experimental results show
that our proposed scenario has the potential to achieve a 62.6\% improvement of
total travel time in Tokyo compared to that of a currently operational road
network configuration, with no imposed variable costs.

models in Stan, and should be useful to researchers interested in modeling the
SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and other infectious diseases in a Bayesian framework.
Bayesian modeling provides a principled way to quantify uncertainty and
incorporate both data and prior knowledge into the model estimates. Stan is an
expressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and
allows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and
easily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent.
Furthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is
amiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained
inference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit,
and diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple
Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, then with a more elaborate
transmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced
topics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably,
how to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational
techniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.

the 3D geometric moments invariants and the invariant theory, considering a
problem of describing of the 3D geometric moments invariants as a problem of
the classical invariant theory. Using the remarkable fact that the groups
$SO(3)$ and $SL(2)$ are locally isomorphic, we reduced the problem of deriving
3D geometric moments invariants to the well-known problem of the classical
invariant theory. We give a precise statement of the 3D geometric invariant
moments computation, introducing the notions of the algebras of simultaneous 3D
geometric moment invariants, and prove that they are isomorphic to the algebras
of joint $SL(2)$-invariants of several binary forms. To simplify the
calculating of the invariants we proceed from an action of Lie group $SO(3)$ to
an action of its Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$. The author hopes that the
results will be useful to the researchers in the fields of image analysis and
pattern recognition.

fields like image generation, inpainting, super-resolution and drug discovery,
etc., by now, the inner process of GANs is far from been understood. To get
deeper insight of the intrinsic mechanism of GANs, in this paper, a method for
interpreting the latent space of GANs by analyzing the correlation between
latent variables and the corresponding semantic contents in generated images is
proposed. Unlike previous methods that focus on dissecting models via feature
visualization, the emphasis of this work is put on the variables in latent
space, i.e. how the latent variables affect the quantitative analysis of
generated results. Given a pretrained GAN model with weights fixed, the latent
variables are intervened to analyze their effect on the semantic content in
generated images. A set of controlling latent variables can be derived for
specific content generation, and the controllable semantic content manipulation
be achieved. The proposed method is testified on the datasets Fashion-MNIST and
UT Zappos50K, experiment results show its effectiveness.

human society, it is a big challenge to estimate the potential risks of getting
exposed to a widely spreading virus. To allow the public to be aware of the
exposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based
probability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for
estimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The
exposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in
public places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops,
office suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active
patients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the
room. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by
doing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a
different number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds.
The system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate
exposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved
preparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis
tools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April
1 to May 15. The experiment shows that the estimation model is very promising
to assist people to be more specifically precise about their safety control in
daily routine and social lives and help businesses to dynamically adjust their
COVID-19 policies to accelerate their recovery.
