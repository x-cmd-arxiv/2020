natural language processing (NLP) research, it is computationally prohibitive
to exhaustively test newly proposed models on each possible experimental
setting. In this work, we attempt to explore the possibility of gaining
plausible judgments of how well an NLP model can perform under an experimental
setting, without actually training or testing the model. To do so, we build
regression models to predict the evaluation score of an NLP experiment given
the experimental settings as input. Experimenting on 9 different NLP tasks, we
find that our predictors can produce meaningful predictions over unseen
languages and different modeling architectures, outperforming reasonable
baselines as well as human experts. Going further, we outline how our predictor
can be used to find a small subset of representative experiments that should be
run in order to obtain plausible predictions for all other experimental
settings.

properties of 2D ferrimagnets in early time. Here, using the 2D ferrimagnetic
MXenes as prototype systems, our real-time density functional theory (TDDFT)
simulation show that laser pulses can directly induce ultrafast spin-selective
charge transfer between two magnetic sublattices on a few femtoseconds, and
further generate dramatic changes in the magnetic structure of these MXenes,
including a magnetic order transition from ferrimagnetic (FiM) to transient
ferromagnetic (FM). The microscopic mechanism underpinning this ultrafast
switching of magnetic order in MXenes is governed by optically induced
inter-site spin transfer (OISTR) effect, which theoretically enables the
ultrafast direct optical manipulation of the magnetic state in MXenes-based
materials. Our results open new opportunities to optically manipulate the spin

the treasure means getting at distance at most 1 from it. The agent makes a
series of moves. Each of them consists in moving straight in a chosen direction
at a chosen distance. In the beginning and after each move the agent gets a
hint consisting of a positive angle smaller than $2\pi$ whose vertex is at the
current position of the agent and within which the treasure is contained. We
investigate the problem of how these hints permit the agent to lower the cost
of finding the treasure, using a deterministic algorithm, where the cost is the
worst-case total length of the agent's trajectory. It is well known that
without any hint the optimal (worst case) cost is $\Theta(D^2)$. We show that
if all angles given as hints are at most $\pi$, then the cost can be lowered to
$O(D)$, which is optimal. If all angles are at most $\beta$, where $\beta<2\pi$
is a constant unknown to the agent, then the cost is at most
$O(D^{2-\epsilon})$, for some $\epsilon>0$. For both these positive results we
present deterministic algorithms achieving the above costs. Finally, if angles

it can still be observed even when training with massive amounts of audio. We
believe these insights can generalize to other large-scale datasets.

starting at two distinct positions, have to meet. The meeting, called
rendezvous, occurs when agents are at distance at most $r$ of each other and
never move after this time, where $r$ is a positive real unknown to them,
called the visibility radius. Agents are anonymous and execute the same
deterministic algorithm. Each agent has a set of private attributes, some or
all of which can differ between agents. These attributes are: the initial
position of the agent, its system of coordinates (orientation and chirality),
the rate of its clock, its speed when it moves, and the time of its wake-up. If
all attributes (except the initial positions) are identical and agents start at
distance larger than $r$ then they can never meet. However, differences between
attributes make it sometimes possible to break the symmetry and accomplish
rendezvous. Such instances of the rendezvous problem (formalized as lists of
attributes), are called feasible.
  Our contribution is three-fold. We first give an exact characterization of
feasible instances. Thus it is natural to ask whether there exists a single
algorithm that guarantees rendezvous for all these instances. We give a strong
negative answer to this question: we show two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ of feasible
instances such that none of them admits a single rendezvous algorithm valid for
all instances of the set. On the other hand, we construct a single algorithm
that guarantees rendezvous for all feasible instances outside of sets $S_1$ and
$S_2$. We observe that these exception sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are geometrically
very small, compared to the set of all feasible instances: they are included in
low-dimension subspaces of the latter. Thus, our rendezvous algorithm handling
all feasible instances other than these small sets of exceptions can be justly
called almost universal.

limited to a single photometric passband without taking into account NLTE
effects on the bolometric corrections. Using these statistical models, we
calculate the luminosities of 34 slowly pulsating B-type (SPB) stars with
available spectroscopic parameters, to place them in the Hertzsprung-Russell

find that excluding NLTE effects has no significant impact on the derived
luminosities for the temperature range 11500-21000 K. We conclude that
spectroscopic parameters are needed in order to achieve meaningful luminosities

untruthful instances in the datasets, this study hypothesizes that removing

an entailment relation between an article and its headline, we filter out

the interface energy and the elastic strain energy caused by the misfit between
the solute-rich and solute-poor phases. It increases with the distance between
the phase boundary and free surface of the compound, and so the instability is
most pronounced when the boundary is close to the surface at the early stage of
the (de)intercalation process. Numerical calculations show that such
instability leads to non-uniform intercalation behavior. We find that uniform
intercalation cannot be achieved unless the phase boundary moves at a speed

challenge that sets MEC slicing apart from traditional resource allocation
problems is that edge nodes depend on tightly-intertwined and
strictly-constrained networking, computation and storage resources. Therefore,
instantiating MEC slices without incurring in resource over-provisioning is
hardly addressable with existing slicing algorithms. The main innovation of
this paper is Sl-EDGE, a unified MEC slicing framework that allows network
operators to instantiate heterogeneous slice services (e.g., video streaming,
caching, 5G network access) on edge devices. We first describe the architecture

near-optimal algorithms that leverage key similarities among edge nodes and
resource virtualization to instantiate heterogeneous slices 7.5x faster and

generated mouse trajectories. We propose two new mouse trajectory synthesis
methods for generating realistic data: a) a function-based method based on
heuristic functions, and b) a data-driven method based on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) in which a Generator synthesizes human-like
trajectories from a Gaussian noise input. Experiments are conducted on a new
testbed also introduced here and available in GitHub: BeCAPTCHA-Mouse
Benchmark; useful for research in bot detection and other mouse-based HCI
applications. Our benchmark data consists of 15,000 mouse trajectories
including real data from 58 users and bot data with various levels of realism.
Our experiments show that BeCAPTCHA-Mouse is able to detect bot trajectories of
high realism with 93% of accuracy in average using only one mouse trajectory.
When our approach is fused with state-of-the-art mouse dynamic features, the
bot detection accuracy increases relatively by more than 36%, proving that
mouse-based bot detection is a fast, easy, and reliable tool to complement
traditional CAPTCHA systems.

different architectures, algorithms, and data management methods have been
recently proposed. For example, appendable-block blockchain uses a different

It is especially applicable in domains such as Internet of Things (IoT), where
both latency and energy are key concerns. However, the lack of some features

$\mathcal G = \mathrm U(N)$. We use a lattice ultraviolet regularization,
starting with the model defined on a finite hypercubic lattice $\Lambda\subset
a\mathbb Z^d$, $d = 2,3,4$, with lattice spacing $a\in (0,1]$ and $L\in\mathbb
N$ sites on a side. The Wilson partition function is used where the action is a
sum over four lattice bond variables of gauge-invariant plaquette (lattice
minimal squares) actions with a prefactor $a^{d-4}/g^2$, where we take the
gauge coupling $g\in(0,g_0^2]$, $0<g_0<\infty$. In a recent paper, for free
boundary conditions, we proved that a normalized model partition function
satisfies thermodynamic and ultraviolet stable stability bounds. Here, we
extend the stability bounds to the Yang-Mills model with periodic boundary
conditions, with constants which are also independent of $L$, $a$, $g$.
Furthermore, we also consider a normalized generating functional for the
correlations of $r\in\mathbb N$ gauge-invariant plaquette fields. Using
periodic boundary conditions and the multireflection method, we then prove that
this generating functional is bounded, with a bound that is independent of $L$,
$a$, $g$ and the location and orientation of the $r$ plaquette fields. The
bounds factorize and each factor is a single-bond variable, single-plaquette
partition function. The number of factors is, up to boundary corrections, the
number of non-temporal lattice bonds, such as $(d-1)L^d$. A new global
quadratic upper bound in the gluon fields is proved for the Wilson plaquette
action.

Mass flow estimation is the critical factor to measure, and having this allows

limits. Several common technologies used on grain harvesters, including impact
plate sensors, are accurate enough on combines to be valuable but suffer from
issues such as drift. Sugarcane is composed of a mixture of billets and trash,
which is a very dispersed material with much less consistency than grains. In
this study, a 3d point cloud approach is used to estimate volume, from which a
calibration factor is derived [density] to translate to mass. The system was
proved in concept in a controlled environment using bamboo, achieving an R2 of
97.4% when fitting average volume flow per test against average mass flow after
correcting for bulk density changes with volume. The system was also tested on
field data, which was collected from nearly 1700 wagon loads from the southern
U.S. and Brazil over the course of 3 seasons in both green and burnt cane.
Results indicated that the concept is very robust with good accuracy, having
seasonal CVs for density values ranging from 6.9% to 16.2%. The camera concept
proves relatively robust to environmental conditions. The same approach could
be used in sugar beets, potatoes or other sparse/non-flowing crops with highly
varying material properties, where traditional mass flow sensors do not work.

it a very robust tool. Simply by changing the input parameters, a large
question bank with solutions even to complex physical problems can be
generated. Thus, it is a powerful alternative to the calculated and multiple

module writes the questions to be imported into Moodle in a simple and
human-readable ASCII output using the GIFT format, which enables html

transducers require large optical pump power to overcome weak EO coupling and
reach high efficiency. Here, we create an EO transducer in thin-film lithium

The transduction efficiency can be improved by further reducing the microwave

surprisingly, despite the increasing popularity of Big Data technologies in

has not been pursued, possibly due to its complexity. Results: We fill this
important gap by introducing FADE, the first extensible, efficient and scalable

eighteen of the best performing AF functions coming out of a recent hallmark

disparity, accommodation, motion parallax and occlusion. It is incumbent upon
virtual-reality displays to satisfy these cues to provide an immersive user
experience. Multifocal displays, one of the classic approaches to satisfy the
accommodation cue, place virtual content at multiple focal planes, each at a di
erent depth. However, the content on focal planes close to the eye do not
occlude those farther away; this deteriorates the occlusion cue as well as
reduces contrast at depth discontinuities due to leakage of the defocus blur.
This paper enables occlusion-aware multifocal displays using a novel ConeTilt
operator that provides an additional degree of freedom -- tilting the light
cone emitted at each pixel of the display panel. We show that, for scenes with
relatively simple occlusion con gurations, tilting the light cones provides the
same e ect as physical occlusion. We demonstrate that ConeTilt can be easily
implemented by a phase-only spatial light modulator. Using a lab prototype, we

We formulate this problem as an optimization problem to determine the prices of

overcome the computational challenge of this optimization problem, we propose
an efficient FPTAS algorithm that can solve the problem approximately to any
desired accuracy. Moreover, we consider the revenue management problem in the

that our learning algorithm can converge to the optimal algorithm that has

tight up to a certain logarithmic term. In addition, we conduct numerical
experiments with the real-world transaction data we collect from a popular

manifold and a Poincare section is constructed at a fixed point on the orbit.
The corresponding Poincare map is linearized about the fixed point; this
results in a discrete linear time-invariant system. To stabilize the desired
orbit, impulsive inputs are applied when the system trajectory crosses the
Poincare section; these inputs can be designed using standard techniques such

However, most existing CNNs-based methods often produce unsatisfactory
segmentation mask without accurate object boundaries. This is caused by the
limited context information and inadequate discriminative feature maps after
consecutive pooling and convolution operations. In that the medical image is
characterized by the high intra-class variation, inter-class indistinction and
noise, extracting powerful context and aggregating discriminative features for
fine-grained segmentation are still challenging today. In this paper, we
formulate a boundary-aware context neural network (BA-Net) for 2D medical image
segmentation to capture richer context and preserve fine spatial information.
BA-Net adopts encoder-decoder architecture. In each stage of encoder network,
pyramid edge extraction module is proposed for obtaining edge information with
multiple granularities firstly. Then we design a mini multi-task learning
module for jointly learning to segment object masks and detect lesion
boundaries. In particular, a new interactive attention is proposed to bridge
two tasks for achieving information complementarity between different tasks,
which effectively leverages the boundary information for offering a strong cue
to better segmentation prediction. At last, a cross feature fusion module aims
to selectively aggregate multi-level features from the whole encoder network.
By cascaded three modules, richer context and fine-grain features of each stage
are encoded. Extensive experiments on five datasets show that the proposed
BA-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

satisfactory performance. The algorithm works by gradually deactivating beams
using a Bayesian probability criterion based on a uniform improper prior, where
beam deactivation can be implemented with low-complexity operations that
require computing a low-degree polynomial or a search through a look-up table.

fix patterns; the most common bug fix patterns are fixing data dimension and
neural network connectivity; DNN bug fixes have the potential to introduce

Euler-Poisson system. Under general assumptions on the equation of states, we
proved a turning point principle (TPP) that the stability of the stars is
entirely determined by the mass-radius curve parameterized by the center
density. In particular, the stability can only change at extrema (i.e. local
maximum or minimum points) of the total mass. For very general equation of
states, TPP implies that for increasing center density the stars are stable up
to the first mass maximum and unstable beyond this point until next mass
extremum (a minimum). Moreover, we get a precise counting of unstable modes and
exponential trichotomy estimates for the linearized Euler-Poisson system. To
prove these results, we develop a general framework of separable Hamiltonian
PDEs. The general approach is flexible and can be used for many other problems
including stability of rotating and magnetic stars, relativistic stars and

provided new opportunities for tackling visual tasks under challenging
scenarios with fast motion, high dynamic range, and/or power constraint. Yet
unlike image/video compression, the performance of event compression algorithm
is far from satisfying and practical. The main challenge for compressing events
is the unique event data form, i.e., a stream of asynchronously fired event
tuples each encoding the 2D spatial location, timestamp, and polarity (denoting
an increase or decrease in brightness). Since events only encode temporal
variations, they lack spatial structure which is crucial for compression. To
address this problem, we propose a novel event compression algorithm based on a
quad tree (QT) segmentation map derived from the adjacent intensity images. The
QT informs 2D spatial priority within the 3D space-time volume. In the event
encoding step, events are first aggregated over time to form polarity-based
event histograms. The histograms are then variably sampled via Poisson Disk
Sampling prioritized by the QT based segmentation map. Next, differential
encoding and run length encoding are employed for encoding the spatial and
polarity information of the sampled events, respectively, followed by Huffman
encoding to produce the final encoded events. Our Poisson Disk Sampling based
Lossy Event Compression (PDS-LEC) algorithm performs rate-distortion based
optimal allocation. On average, our algorithm achieves greater than 6x
compression compared to the state of the art.

three challenges: missing labels, incomplete views, and non-aligned views.
Existing methods mainly concern the first two and commonly need multiple
assumptions to attack them, making even state-of-the-arts involve at least two
explicit hyper-parameters such that model selection is quite difficult. More
roughly, they will fail in handling the third challenge, let alone addressing
the three jointly. In this paper, we aim at meeting these under the least
assumption by building a concise yet effective model with just one
hyper-parameter. To ease insufficiency of available labels, we exploit not only
the consensus of multiple views but also the global and local structures hidden
among multiple labels. Specifically, we introduce an indicator matrix to tackle
the first two challenges in a regression form while aligning the same
individual labels and all labels of different views in a common label space to
battle the third challenge. In aligning, we characterize the global and local
structures of multiple labels to be high-rank and low-rank, respectively.
Subsequently, an efficient algorithm with linear time complexity in the number
of samples is established. Finally, even without view-alignment, our method
substantially outperforms state-of-the-arts with view-alignment on five real

to the mobility level, without incurring frequent loss of track, as verified by
an extensive set of experiments under both representative statistical channel

In particular, numerical results show that ATSC can track dominant channel

integral come from solutions of semiclassical equations of motion (EOMs), which
reduces to Hamilton's equations of holonomies and fluxes ${h}(e),{p}^a(e)$ in
the reduced phase space $\mathcal{P}_\gamma$ of the cubic lattice $\gamma$:
$\dot{h}(e)=\{{h}(e),\, \mathbf{H}\}$, $\dot{p}^a(e)=\{{p}^a(e),\,

semiclassical dynamics from the path integral becomes an initial value problem
of Hamiltonian time evolution in $\mathcal{P}_\gamma$. Moreover when we take
the continuum limit of the lattice $\gamma$, these Hamilton's equations
reproduce correctly classical reduced phase space EOMs of gravity coupled to
dust fields in the continuum, as far as initial and final states are
semiclassical. Our result proves that the new path integral formulation has the
correct semiclassical limit, and indicates that the reduced phase space

text operators, which enables interesting optimization opportunities for hybrid
data sources that have both relational and textual data. We demonstrate its

energy threshold in the range of a few tens to a few hundreds of TeV. The
shower observables are measured indirectly with an array of detectors. The
atmospheric absorption of low energy secondaries limits their detection
frequencies at the Earth's surface. However, due to selection effects, a tiny
fraction of low energy showers, which are produced in the lower atmosphere can
reach the observational level. But, due to less information of shower
observables, the reconstruction of these showers are arduous. Hence, it is
believed that direct measurements by experiments aboard on satellites and
balloon flights are more reliable at low energies. Despite having very small
efficiency ($\sim$0.1%) at low energies, the large acceptance ($\sim$5 m$^2$sr)
of GRAPES-3 experiment allows observing primary cosmic rays down below to
$\sim$1 TeV and opens up the possibility to measure primary energy spectrum
spanning from a few TeV to beyond cosmic ray knee (up to 10$^{16}$ eV),
covering five orders of magnitude. The GRAPES-3 energy threshold for primary
protons through Monte Carlo simulations are calculated, which gives reasonably
good agreement with data. Furthermore, the total efficiencies and acceptance
are also calculated for protons primaries. The ability of GRAPES-3 experiment
to cover such a broader energy range may provide a unique handle to bridge the
energy spectrum between direct measurements at low energies and indirect
measurements at ultra-high energies.

  Specification in Embedded Cyber-Physical Systems","23 pages",,,,"eess.SY cs.SE cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reliability and fault tolerance are critical attributes of embedded
cyber-physical systems that require a high safety-integrity level. For such
systems, the use of formal functional safety specifications has been strongly
advocated in most industrial safety standards, but reliability and fault
tolerance have traditionally been treated as platform issues. We believe that
addressing reliability and fault tolerance at the functional safety level
widens the scope for resource optimization, targeting those functionalities
that are safety-critical, rather than the entire platform. Moreover, for
software based control functionalities, temporal redundancies have become just
as important as replication of physical resources, and such redundancies can be
modeled at the functional specification level. The ability to formally model
functional reliability at a specification level enables early estimation of
physical resources and computation bandwidth requirements. In this paper we
propose, for the first time, a resource estimation methodology from a formal
functional safety specification augmented by reliability annotations. The
proposed reliability specification is overlaid on the safety-critical
functional specification and our methodology extracts a constraint satisfaction
problem for determining the optimal set of resources for meeting the
reliability target for the safety-critical behaviors. We use SMT
(Satisfiability Modulo Theories) / ILP (Integer Linear Programming) solvers at
the back end to solve the optimization problem, and demonstrate the feasibility
of our methodology on a Satellite Launch Vehicle Navigation, Guidance and

functions within the quasiparticle model at finite temperature, strong magnetic
field and finite chemical potential. This study helps to understand the impacts
of strong magnetic field and chemical potential on the local equilibrium by the
Knudsen number ($\Omega$) through $\kappa$ and on the relative behavior between
thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity through the Lorenz number
($L$) in the Wiedemann-Franz law. We have observed that, both $\sigma_{\rm el}$
and $\kappa$ get increased in the presence of strong magnetic field, and the
additional presence of chemical potential further increases their magnitudes,
where $\sigma_{\rm el}$ shows decreasing trend with the temperature, opposite
to its increasing behavior in the isotropic medium, whereas $\kappa$ increases
slowly with the temperature, contrary to its fast increase in the isotropic
medium. The variation in $\kappa$ explains the decrease of the Knudsen number
with the increase of the temperature. However, in the presence of strong
magnetic field and finite chemical potential, $\Omega$ gets enhanced and
approaches unity, thus, the system may move slightly away from the equilibrium
state. The Lorenz number ($\kappa/(\sigma_{\rm el} T))$ in the abovementioned
regime of strong magnetic field and finite chemical potential shows linear
enhancement with the temperature and has smaller magnitude than the isotropic
one, thus, it describes the violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law for the hot

non-Gaussian noise or outliers, leading to bias estimates of the latent

a robust orthogonal tensor CPD model with Cauchy loss, which is resistant to
heavy-tailed noise or outliers. By exploring the half-quadratic property of the

expensive and performance of the analysis heavily depends on the underlying CFG
traversal strategy. State-of-the-art analysis frameworks use a fixed traversal
strategy. We argue that a single traversal strategy does not fit all kinds of
analyses and CFGs and propose bespoke control flow analysis (BCFA). Given a
control flow analysis (CFA) and a large number of CFGs, BCFA selects the most
efficient traversal strategy for each CFG. BCFA extracts a set of properties of
the CFA by analyzing the code of the CFA and combines it with properties of the
CFG, such as branching factor and cyclicity, for selecting the optimal
traversal strategy. We have implemented BCFA in Boa, and evaluated BCFA using a
set of representative static analyses that mainly involve traversing CFGs and
two large datasets containing 287 thousand and 162 million CFGs. Our results
show that BCFA can speedup the large scale analyses by 1%-28%. Further, BCFA

predominantly based on training data employing number of cases and fatalities
are limited in that they do not account for the spatiotemporal population
dynamics that principally contributes to the disease spread. Here, a stochastic
cellular automata enabled predictive model is presented that is able to
accurate describe the effect of demography-dependent population dynamics on
disease transmission. Using the spread of coronavirus in the state of New York
as a case study, results from the computational framework remarkably agree with
the actual count for infected cases and deaths as reported across
organizations. The predictions suggest that an extended lockdown in some form,
for up to 180 days, can significantly reduce the risk of a second wave of the
outbreak. In addition, increased availability of medical testing is able to
reduce the number of infected patients, even when less stringent social
distancing guidelines and imposed. Equipping this stochastic approach with
demographic factors such as age ratio, pre-existing health conditions,
robustifies the model to predict the transmittivity of future outbreaks before
they transform into an epidemic.

the sweeping swarm is the confinement of the evaders to their initial domain.
The feasibility of completing these tasks depends on geometric and dynamic
constraints that impose a lower bound on the velocity that the sweeper swarm

temperature-driven phase transitions. Here, we study electron dynamics in one
such material, CaFe2As2, a parent Fe-based superconductor, employing time and
angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. CaFe2As2 exhibits concomitant
transition to spin density wave state and nematic order below 170 K. We
discover that magnetic excitations can be induced selectively, by using
polarized pump pulses, significantly before the destruction of nematic order.
More specifically, we observe that s-polarized light enhances electron
temperature by several hundreds of degrees at a time scale of about 200 fs,
while the temperature of the electrons participating in magnetic order can be
enhanced by similar amount at a much faster time scale (50 fs) using
p-polarized pump pulse. These results provide a pathway to achieve selective
electron heating, which is not possible with other methods, as well as to
disentangle phase transitions in quantum materials.

feature-metric projection error does not need to search the correspondences so
that the optimisation speed is fast. The principle behind the proposed method
is that the feature difference is smallest if point clouds are aligned very
well. We train the proposed method in a semi-supervised or unsupervised

demonstrate our method obtains higher accuracy and robustness than the

fill this gap, we first design three types of robot engagement behavior

communication significantly changes the human's estimation of the robots'
capability and significantly raises their expectation towards the learning
outcomes, even though we do not run actual learning algorithms in the
experiments. Moreover, imitation behavior affects humans more than attention
does in all metrics, while their combination has the most profound influences

Unlike distributed machine learning, federated learning aims to tackle non-IID

those on smartphones. Existing federated learning approaches usually adopt a
single global model to capture the shared knowledge of all users by aggregating
their gradients, regardless of the discrepancy between their data

users' gradients to different global models (i.e., centers) can better capture
the heterogeneity of data distributions across users. Our paper proposes a
novel multi-center aggregation mechanism for federated learning, which learns
multiple global models from the non-IID user data and simultaneously derives
the optimal matching between users and centers. We formulate the problem as a

molecular nanomagnet in which a small structural distortion establishes clock
transitions (i.e. transitions whose energy is to first order independent of

interest by governmental, legal and social institutions to enforce regulations,

enforces privacy using lightweight and anonymous tokens, while transparency is
achieved using fault-tolerant blockchains shared across multiple platforms. The

Standard Model and has a strong predictive power for the neutrino sector. In
particular, the mass spectrum and couplings of heavy right-handed neutrinos are
determined as functions of three neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings, with which we
can evaluate the baryon asymmetry of the Universe generated through their
decay, i.e., leptogenesis. In this letter, we study leptogenesis in the minimal
gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ model. It turns out that the sign of the resultant
baryon asymmetry for the case with the Dirac CP phase, $\delta$, larger than
$\pi$ is predicted to be opposite to that for $\delta < \pi$. In addition, if
lepton asymmetry is dominantly produced by the decay of the lightest
right-handed neutrino, then the correct sign of baryon asymmetry is obtained
for $\delta > \pi$, which is favored by the current neutrino-oscillation
experiments, whilst the wrong sign is obtained for $\delta < \pi$. We further
investigate a non-thermal leptogenesis scenario where the U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$
breaking field plays the role of inflaton and decays into right-handed
neutrinos, as a concrete example. It is found that this simple framework offers
a successful inflation that is consistent with the CMB observation. We then
show that the observed amount of baryon asymmetry can be reproduced in this
scenario, with its sign predicted to be positive in most of the parameter
space.

peak hours by storing some content at the user's local cache memory without
knowledge of later demands. The goal of coded caching design is to minimize the
transmission rate and the subpacketization. In practice the demand for each
user is sensitive since one can get the other users' preferences when it gets
the other users' demands. The first coded caching scheme with private demands
was proposed by Wan et al. However the transmission rate and the
subpacketization of their scheme increase with the file number stored in the
library. In this paper we consider the following secure coded caching: prevent
the wiretappers from obtaining any information about the files in the server
and protect the demands from all the users in the delivery phase. We firstly
introduce a combinatorial structure called secure placement delivery array
(SPDA in short) to realize a coded caching scheme for our security setting.
Then we obtain three classes of secure schemes by constructing SPDAs, where one
of them is optimal. It is worth noting that the transmission rates and the
subpacketizations of our schemes are independent to the file number.
Furthermore, comparing with the previously known schemes with the same security
setting, our schemes have significantly advantages on the subpacketizations and
for some parameters have the advantage on the transmission rates.

tester which can distinguish valid codewords from words that are ""far"" from all
codewords by probing a given word only at a very few (sublinear, typically
constant) number of locations. Such codes form the combinatorial backbone of
PCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate,
constant relative distance and testable with a constant number of queries.
  In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing such LTCs using
the machinery of high-dimensional expanders. To this end, we consider the
Tanner representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code.
Informally, our result states that if this graph is part of a high-dimensional
expander then the local testability of the code follows from the local
testability of the base code.
  This work unifies and generalizes the known results on testability of the
Hadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes on the Subspace Complex, all of which
are proved via local self correction. However, unlike previous results,
constant rounds of self correction do not suffice as the diameter of the
underlying test graph can be logarithmically large in a high-dimensional
expander and not constant as in all known earlier results. We overcome this
technical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically
many rounds and tightly controlling the error in each iteration using
properties of the high-dimensional expander.
  Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a
constant-query LTC with positive rate and constant relative distance is an
instantiation of a base code that interacts well with a constant-degree
high-dimensional expander.

KF with the set of pairs $\langle\Gamma, \Delta\rangle$, such that KF proves
that if all members of $\Gamma$ are true, at least one member of $\Delta$ is
true. In way of addressing Reinhardt's question we show that the provably true

non-linear in the parameters thus leading to non-Gaussian posteriors. Many
computational and analytical tools exist that can deal with non-Gaussian
distributions, and empirical Gaussianisation transforms can reduce the amount
of non-Gaussianity in a distribution. Alternatively, in this work, we employ
methods from information geometry. The latter formulates a set of probability
distributions for some given model as a manifold employing a Riemannian
structure, equipped with a metric, the Fisher information. In this framework we
study the differential geometrical meaning of non-Gaussianities in a higher
order Fisher approximation, and their respective transformation behaviour under
re-parameterisation, which corresponds to a chart transition on the statistical
manifold. While weak non-Gaussianities vanish in normal coordinates in a first
order approximation, one can in general not find transformations that discard
non-Gaussianities globally. As an application we consider the likelihood of the
supernovae distance-redshift relation in cosmology for the parameter pair

form of the penalty function, ensuring that the penalized estimator among a
collection of models satisfies an oracle inequality. Then we derive a penalty
shape involving the spectral radius of the covariance matrix of the errors,
which can be chosen proportional to the dimension when the error process is
stationary and short range dependent. However, this penalty can be too rough in
some cases, in particular when the error process is long range dependent. In a
second part, we focus on the fixed-design regression model assuming that the
error process is a stationary Gaussian process. We propose a model selection
procedure in order to estimate the mean function via piecewise polynomials on a
regular partition, when the error process is either short range dependent, long
range dependent or anti-persistent. We present different kinds of penalties,
depending on the memory of the process. For each case, an adaptive estimator is
built, and the rates of convergence are computed. Thanks to several sets of
simulations, we study the performance of these different penalties for all
types of errors (short memory, long memory and anti-persistent errors).
Finally, we give an application of our method to the well-known Nile data,
which clearly shows that the type of dependence of the error process must be

this paper develops a novel online bad PMU data detection (BPDD) approach for
regional phasor data concentrators (PDCs) by sufficiently exploring
spatial-temporal correlations. With no need for costly data labeling or
iterative learning, it performs model-free, label-free, and non-iterative BPDD
in power grids from a new data-driven perspective of spatial-temporal nearest
neighbor (STNN) discovery. Specifically, spatial-temporally correlated regional
measurements acquired by PMUs are first gathered as a spatial-temporal time
series (TS) profile. Afterwards, TS subsequences contaminated with bad PMU data
are identified by characterizing anomalous STNNs. To make the whole approach
competent in processing online streaming PMU data, an efficient strategy for
accelerating STNN discovery is carefully designed. Different from existing
data-driven BPDD solutions requiring either costly offline dataset
preparation/training or computationally intensive online optimization, it can
be implemented in a highly cost-effective way, thereby being more applicable
and scalable in practical contexts. Numerical test results on the Nordic test
system and the realistic China Southern Power Grid demonstrate the reliability,

binary with a 1000 $M_{\odot}$ IMBH and a 3 $M_{\odot}$ donor star in an orbit
of initial orbital period near the so-called bifurcation period of 0.77 d could
evolve into an ultra-compact X-ray binary, which will emit GW signals with
maximum frequency of 2.5 mHz. According to the evolutionary tracks of
characteristic strain, IMBH X-ray binaries with the initial donor-star masses
of $1-3~M_{\odot}$ and the initial orbital periods slightly less than the
bifurcation periods will be detectable by the LISA in a distance of 15 kpc.
Assuming each of 60 Galactic globular clusters hosts a 1000 $M_{\odot}$ IMBH,
the maximum number of compact IMBH X-ray binaries that LISA will detect in the
Galaxy should be less than ten. Therefore, the detectability of compact IMBH
X-ray binaries by the LISA is not optimistic.

most strategic decisions. However, few data-driven tools that support strategic
decision-making are available. We introduce and extend the use of autoencoders
to provide strategically relevant granular feedback. A first experiment
indicates that experts are inconsistent in their decision making, highlighting
the need for strategic decision support. Furthermore, using two large
industry-provided human resources datasets, the proposed solution is evaluated
in terms of ranking accuracy, synergy with human experts, and dimension-level
feedback. This three-point scheme is validated using (a) synthetic data, (b)
the perspective of data quality, (c) blind expert validation, and (d)
transparent expert evaluation. Our study confirms several principal weaknesses
of human decision-making and stresses the importance of synergy between a model

are shown to be valuable tools for strategic decision-making.

quantum computing and phase transitions in statistical physics, recent work in
approximate counting has shown that the behaviour in the complex plane, and
more precisely the location of zeros, is strongly connected with the complexity
of the approximation problem, even for positive real-valued parameters.
Previous work in the complex plane by Goldberg and Guo focused on $q=2$, which
corresponds to the case of the Ising model; for $q>2$, the behaviour in the
complex plane is not as well understood and most work applies only to the
real-valued Tutte plane.
  Our main result is a complete classification of the complexity of the
approximation problems for all non-real values of the parameters, by
establishing \#P-hardness results that apply even when restricted to planar
graphs. Our techniques apply to all $q\geq 2$ and further complement/refine
previous results both for the Ising model and the Tutte plane, answering in

However, their potential to produce accurate estimates in vivo is uncertain as

  Aim: To demonstrate the capability of deep neural networks to process whole
3D images and output 3D maps of vascular sO$_2$ from realistic tissue
models/images.
  Approach: Two separate fully convolutional neural networks were trained to
produce 3D maps of vascular blood oxygen saturation and vessel positions from
multiwavelength simulated images of tissue models.
  Results: The mean of the absolute difference between the true mean vessel
sO$_2$ and the network output for 40 examples was 4.4% and the standard

  Conclusions: 3D fully convolutional networks were shown capable of producing
accurate sO$_2$ maps using the full extent of spatial information contained

Internet of Things (mIoT) systems. However, their Random Access CHannel (RACH)
procedure suffers from unreliability, due to the collision from the
simultaneous massive access. Despite that this collision problem has been
treated in existing RACH schemes, these schemes usually organize IoT devices'
transmission and re-transmission along with fixed parameters, thus can hardly
adapt to time-varying traffic patterns. Without adaptation, the RACH procedure
easily suffers from high access delay, high energy consumption, or even access
unavailability. With the goal of improving the RACH procedure, this paper
targets to optimize the RACH procedure in real-time by maximizing a long-term
hybrid multi-objective function, which consists of the number of access success
devices, the average energy consumption, and the average access delay. To do
so, we first optimize the long-term objective in the number of access success
devices by using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for different
RACH schemes, including Access Class Barring (ACB), Back-Off (BO), and
Distributed Queuing (DQ). The converging capability and efficiency of different
DRL algorithms including Policy Gradient (PG), Actor-Critic (AC), Deep
Q-Network (DQN), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) are compared.
Inspired by the results from this comparison, a decoupled learning strategy is
developed to jointly and dynamically adapt the access control factors of those
three access schemes. This decoupled strategy first leverage a Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) model to predict the real-time traffic values of the network
environment, and then uses multiple DRL agents to cooperatively configure
parameters of each RACH scheme.

inclusive jets in Pb+Pb are shifted to lower girth region relative to that in

jets is larger than unity at small girth region, while smaller than one at
large girth region. This behavior results from more soft fragments inside a jet

the black-box nature of the neural attention architecture, avoiding these

propose to explicitly segment target text into fragment units and align them
with their data correspondences. The segmentation and correspondence are
jointly learned as latent variables without any human annotations. We further
impose a soft statistical constraint to regularize the segmental granularity.
The resulting architecture maintains the same expressive power as neural
attention models, while being able to generate fully interpretable outputs with
several times less computational cost. On both E2E and WebNLG benchmarks, we

dynamic filters that are space-efficient (the space is $1+o(1)$ times the

$\epsilon$ satisfies $\log(1/\epsilon) = \omega(\log\log n)$.

functioning of the United States. It is thus necessary to ensure that it is
well-connected, efficient, and robust. Despite extensive research on its
topology, the temporal evolution of the network's robustness and tolerance
remains largely unexplored. In the present paper, a temporal study of the
domestic U.S. ATN was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016
and network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that
followed the 9/11 events along with the current state of the system. Centrality
measures were computed to assess the system's topology and its global
robustness. A node deletion method was applied to assess the network's
tolerance by simulating a targeted attack scenario. The study showed that the
9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of
efficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes
were introduced. Airlines reconsidered their strategy and optimized their
operations, thus allowing the network to recover rapidly and become even more
efficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the
network's robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties
of the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the network's
expansion. On the other hand, the robustness of the system has not shown an
improving tendency. Findings suggest that although the system's ability to
sustain its operational level under extreme circumstances has lately improved,
its tolerance to targeted attacks has deteriorated. The presented methodology
may be applied on different network levels or different transportation
networks, to provide a general perspective of the system's vulnerabilities.

community a platform to compare MFIF algorithms fairly and comprehensively.
Extensive experiments have been conducted using the proposed MFIFB to
understand the performance of these algorithms. By analyzing the experimental
results, effective MFIF algorithms are identified. More importantly, some
observations on the status of the MFIF field are given, which can help to

paradigm for a spatially formulated decentralized two-sided matching market
with independent and autonomous agents. Having autonomous agents acting
independently makes our environment very dynamic and uncertain. Moreover,
agents lack the knowledge of preferences of other agents and have to explore
the environment and interact with other agents to discover their own
preferences through noisy rewards. We think such a setting better approximates
the real world and we study the usefulness of our MARL approach for it. Along
with conventional stable matching case where agents have strictly ordered
preferences, we check the applicability of our approach for stable matching
with incomplete lists and ties. We investigate our results for stability, level
of instability (for unstable results), and fairness. Our MARL approach mostly
yields stable and fair outcomes.

accordingly. To accomplish such a feat, four user-specific methods were
developed, implemented and tested; all of which were based on a benchmark
database created by the authors.The first three techniques were automatic,
employ correlation and were variants of template matching, while the last one
uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Different metrics to quantitatively
evaluate the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy and latency

choice for the gaze estimator, which commands the wheelchair motion. The system
was evaluated carefully on 8 subjects achieving 99% accuracy in changing

($\frac{M}{N}$) of $2 \pi$, it is finite-dimensional, parametrized by the
complex coordinate $\lambda_0$. The case for $N=2 \: ; \: \theta=\pi$ is the
usual Clifford algebra for fermions, while the case for $N=\infty \: ; \:

to the boson situation as $N \rightarrow \infty$ from $N=2$. After constructing
the Hilbert space from the algebra, the cases for $N=2,3$ can be mapped to
$SU(2)$. Then, we motivate the study of coherent states, rather generally. The

will show that if one is limited by positive values of the coupling constants,

the higher is the order of the Lovelock term, the smaller is the maximal value

combining naturally occurring porous textures we generated 17700 semi-real 3-D
micro-structures of porous geo-materials with size of 256^3 voxels and 30
physical properties of each sample are calculated using physical simulations on
the corresponding pore network models. Next, a designed feed-forward
convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained based on the dataset to estimate
several morphological, hydraulic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics of
the porous material in a fraction of a second. In order to fine-tune the CNN
design, we tested 9 different training scenarios and selected the one with the
highest average coefficient of determination (R^2) equal to 0.885 for 1418
testing samples. Additionally, 3 independent synthetic images as well as 3
realistic tomography images have been tested using the proposed method and
results are compared with pore network modelling and experimental data,
respectively. Tested absolute permeabilities had around 13 % relative error
compared to the experimental data which is noticeable considering the accuracy
of the direct numerical simulation methods such as Lattice Boltzmann and Finite
Volume. The workflow is compatible with any physical size of the images due to
its dimensionless approach and can be used to characterize large-scale 3-D
images by averaging the model outputs for a sliding window that scans the whole
geometry.

solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations across a region of parameter space, in
which the parameters define physical properties such as domain shape and
boundary conditions. The contributions of this work are threefold:
  1) To demonstrate that neural networks can be efficient aggregators of whole
families of parameteric solutions to physical problems, trained using data
created with traditional, trusted numerical methods such as finite elements.
Advantages include extremely fast evaluation of pressure and velocity at any
point in physical and parameter space (asymptotically, ~3 $\mu s$ / query), and
data compression (the network requires 99\% less storage space compared to its
own training data).
  2) To demonstrate that the neural networks can accurately interpolate between
finite element solutions in parameter space, allowing them to be instantly
queried for pressure and velocity field solutions to problems for which
traditional simulations have never been performed.
  3) To introduce an active learning algorithm, so that during training, a
finite element solver can automatically be queried to obtain additional
training data in locations where the neural network's predictions are in most
need of improvement, thus autonomously acquiring and efficiently distributing
training data throughout parameter space.
  In addition to the obvious utility of Item 2, above, we demonstrate an
application of the network in rapid parameter sweeping, very precisely
predicting the degree of narrowing in a tube which would result in a 50\%
increase in end-to-end pressure difference at a given flow rate. This
capability could have applications in both medical diagnosis of arterial
disease, and in computer-aided design.

forensics, which addresses the problem of whether two texts were written by the
same person. In recent years, a variety of AV methods have been proposed that
focus on this problem and can be divided into two categories: The first
category refers to such methods that are based on explicitly defined features,
where one has full control over which features are considered and what they
actually represent. The second category, on the other hand, relates to such AV
methods that are based on implicitly defined features, where no control
mechanism is involved, so that any character sequence in a text can serve as a
potential feature. However, AV methods belonging to the second category bear
the risk that the topic of the texts may bias their classification predictions,
which in turn may lead to misleading conclusions regarding their results. To
tackle this problem, we propose a preprocessing technique called POSNoise,
which effectively masks topic-related content in a given text. In this way, AV
methods are forced to focus on such text units that are more related to the
writing style. Our empirical evaluation based on six AV methods (falling into
the second category) and seven corpora shows that POSNoise leads to better
results compared to a well-known topic masking approach in 34 out of 42 cases,
with an increase in accuracy of up to 10%.

algorithm for tokenizing sentences into subword units. We view the subword
segmentation of output sentences as a latent variable that should be
marginalized out for learning and inference. A mixed character-subword
transformer is proposed, which enables exact log marginal likelihood estimation
and exact MAP inference to find target segmentations with maximum posterior
probability. DPE uses a lightweight mixed character-subword transformer as a
means of pre-processing parallel data to segment output sentences using dynamic
programming. Empirical results on machine translation suggest that DPE is
effective for segmenting output sentences and can be combined with BPE dropout
for stochastic segmentation of source sentences. DPE achieves an average
improvement of 0.9 BLEU over BPE (Sennrich et al., 2016) and an average
improvement of 0.55 BLEU over BPE dropout (Provilkov et al., 2019) on several

known as Weyl's problem. We describe several computational projects related to
the cumulative state number, defined as the number of states having wavenumber
up to a maximum value. This quantity and its derivative, the density of states,
have important applications in nuclear physics, degenerate Fermi gases,
blackbody radiation, Bose-Einstein condensation and the Casimir effect. Weyl's
theorem states that, in the limit of large wavenumbers, the cumulative state
number depends only on the volume of the bounding domain and not on its shape.
Corrections to this behavior are well known and depend on the surface area of
the bounding domain, its curvature and other features. We describe several
projects that allow readers to investigate this dependence for three bounding
domains - a rectangular box, a sphere, and a circular cylinder. Quasi-one- and
two-dimensional systems can be analyzed by considering various limits. The
projects have applications in statistical mechanics, but can also be integrated
into quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, or computational physics courses.
