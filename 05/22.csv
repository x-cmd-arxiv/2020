with a powerful (but untrusted) prover. Distributed verifier proof systems are
a new family of proof models that involve a network of verifier nodes
communicating with a single independent prover that has access to the complete
network structure of the verifiers. The prover is tasked with convincing all
verifiers of some global property of the network graph. In addition, each
individual verifier may be given some input string they will be required to
verify during the course of computation. Verifier nodes are allowed to exchange
messaged with nodes a constant distance away, and accept / reject the input
after some computation.
  Because individual nodes are limited to a local view, communication with the
prover is potentially necessary to prove global properties about the network
graph of nodes, which only the prover has access to. In this system of models,
the entire model accepts the input if and only if every individual node has
accepted.
  There are three models in the distributed verifier proof system family:
$\mathsf{LCP}$, $\mathsf{dIP}$, and our proposed $\mathsf{dPCP}$, with the
fundamental difference between these coming from the type of communication
established between the verifiers and the prover. In this paper, we will first
go over the past work in the $\mathsf{LCP}$ and $\mathsf{dIP}$ space before
showing properties and proofs in our $\mathsf{dPCP}$ system.

becoming a promising technology for future 6G networks. For THz communication,
precoding is an essential technique to overcome the severe path loss of THz
signals in order to support the desired coverage. In this article, we
systematically investigate the dominant THz precoding techniques for future 6G
networks, with the highlight on its key challenges and opportunities.
Specifically, we first illustrate three typical THz application scenarios
including indoor, mobile, and satellite communications. Then, the major
differences between millimeter-wave and THz channels are explicitly clarified,
based on which we reveal the key challenges of THz precoding, such as the
distance-dependent path loss, the beam split effect, and the high power
consumption. To address these challenges, three representative THz precoding
techniques, i.e., analog beamforming, hybrid precoding, and delay-phase
precoding, are extensively investigated in terms of their different structures,
designs, most recent results, pros and cons. We also provide simulation results
of spectrum and energy efficiencies to compare these typical THz precoding
schemes to draw some insights for their applications in future 6G networks.
Finally, several important open issues and the potential research
opportunities, such as the use of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) to
solve the THz blockage problem, are pointed out and discussed.

the Sobolev space $W^{1,p}$ when $s \nearrow 1$. We prove that the

strongly to the classical gradient $Du$. We also show a weak compactness result
in $W^{1,p}$ for sequences of functions $u_s$ with bounded $L^p$ norm of $D^s
u_s$ as $s \nearrow 1$. Moreover, the weak convergence of $D^s u_s$ in $L^p$

inverse problem associated with image reconstruction in sparse-view computed
tomography (CT) can be solved with a convolutional neural network (CNN).
Methods: Training and testing image/data pairs are generated in a dedicated
breast CT simulation for sparse-view sampling, using two different object
models. The trained CNN is tested to see if images can be accurately recovered
from their corresponding sparse-view data. For reference, the same sparse-view
CT data is reconstructed by the use of constrained total-variation (TV)
minimization (TVmin), which exploits sparsity in the gradient magnitude image
(GMI). Results: Using sparse-view data from images either in the training or
testing set, there is a significant discrepancy between the image obtained with
the CNN and the image that generated the data. For the same simulated scanning
conditions, TVmin is able to accurately reconstruct the test image. Conclusion:
We find that the sparse-view CT inverse problem cannot be solved for the
particular published CNN-based methodology that we chose and the particular
object model that we tested. Furthermore, this negative result is obtained for
conditions where TVmin is able to recover the test images. Significance: The
inability of the CNN to solve the inverse problem associated with sparse-view
CT, for the specific conditions of the presented simulation, draws into
question similar unsupported claims being made for the use of CNNs to solve
inverse problems in medical imaging.

significantly limits the scalability of distributed training for large-scale

recent interest in techniques that reduce the communication cost of distributed
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), with gradient sparsification techniques such
as top-k and random-k shown to be particularly effective. The same observation
has also motivated a separate line of work in distributed statistical

paper is to connect these two research lines and demonstrate how statistical
estimation models and their analysis can lead to new insights in the design of
communication-efficient training techniques. We propose a simple statistical
estimation model for the stochastic gradients which captures the sparsity and
skewness of their distribution. The statistically optimal communication scheme
arising from the analysis of this model leads to a new sparsification technique
for SGD, which concatenates random-k and top-k, considered separately in the
prior literature. We show through extensive experiments on both image and
language domains with CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and Penn Treebank datasets that the
concatenated application of these two sparsification methods consistently and
significantly outperforms either method applied alone.

there may be several other background threads running asynchronously. For any

explore the schedules between the upper/lower bound events while grouping
events within a single statement, to find whether the test outcome is flaky. We
also create a suite of subject programs called DroidFlaker to study flaky tests

mechanisms, or remain completely unused, as in the Covid-19 pandemic, where
social distance constraints are enforced to limit the number of people who can
share public spaces. In this work, we plug this gap through market based
mechanisms designed to efficiently allocate capacity constrained public goods.
To design these mechanisms, we leverage the theory of Fisher markets, wherein
each agent in the economy is endowed with an artificial currency budget that
they can spend to avail public goods. While Fisher markets provide a strong
methodological backbone to model resource allocation problems, their
applicability is limited to settings involving two types of constraints -
budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods. Thus, we introduce a
modified Fisher market, where each individual may have additional physical
constraints, characterize its solution properties and establish the existence
of a market equilibrium. Furthermore, to account for additional constraints we
introduce a social convex optimization problem where we perturb the budgets of
agents such that the KKT conditions of the perturbed social problem establishes
equilibrium prices. Finally, to compute the budget perturbations we present a
fixed point scheme and illustrate convergence guarantees through numerical
experiments. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally,
overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only

metal-poor stars in other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies and in the Milky Way halo.
Nucleosynthesis in high mass ($\geqslant 20$M$_\odot$) core-collapse supernovae
has been shown to create this signature. The abundances of this small sample
(3) stars suggest the chemical enrichment of Grus~II could have occurred
through substantial high-mass stellar evolution and is consistent with the
framework of a top-heavy initial mass function. However, with only three stars
it can not be ruled out that the abundance pattern is the result of a
stochastic chemical enrichment at early times in the galaxy. The most
metal-rich of the three stars also possesses a small enhancement in rapid
neutron-capture ($r$-process) elements. The abundance pattern of the
$r$-process elements in this star matches the scaled $r$-process pattern of the
solar system and $r$-process enhanced stars in other dwarf galaxies and in the
Milky Way halo, hinting at a common origin for these elements across a range of
environments. All current proposed astrophysical sites of $r$-process element
production are associated with high-mass stars, thus the possible top-heavy
initial mass function of Grus~II would increase the likelihood of any of these
events occurring. The time delay between the $\alpha$ and $r$-process element
enrichment of the galaxy favors a neutron star merger as the origin of the
$r$-process elements in Grus~II.

  confinement -- inertial dynamics","8 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study two types of active (self-propelled) macroscopic particles under
confinement: camphor surfers and hexbug crawlers, using a combined
experimental, theoretical, and numerical approach. Unlike widely studied
microscopic active particles and swimmers, where thermal forces are often
important and inertia is negligible, our macroscopic particles exhibit complex
dynamics due expressly to active non-thermal noise combined with inertial
effects. Strong confinement induces accumulation at a finite distance within
the boundary and gives rise to three distinguishable dynamical states; both
depending on activity and inertia. These surprisingly complex dynamics arise
already at the single particle level -- highlighting the importance of inertia
in macroscopic active matter.

equation and Master equation for mean field type control problems, using a
novel form of the ""lifting"" idea introduced by P.-L. Lions. Rather than
studying the usual system of Hamilton-Jacobi/Fokker-Planck PDEs using analytic
techniques, we instead study a stochastic control problem on a specially
constructed Hilbert space, which is reminiscent of a tangent space on the
Wasserstein space in optimal transport. On this Hilbert space we can use
classical control theory techniques, despite the fact that it is infinite
dimensional. A consequence of our construction is that the mean field type
control problem appears as a special case. Thus we preserve the advantages of
the lifiting procedure, while removing some of the difficulties. Our approach
extends previous work by two of the coauthors, which dealt with a deterministic
control problem for which the Hilbert space could be generic.

of FEMs for PDEs. In addition, one may encounter non-smooth integrands. In many
nonlocal models, nonlocal interactions are limited to bounded neighborhoods

of dealing with intersections of such balls with the finite elements. We focus
on developing recipes for the efficient assembly of FEM stiffness matrices and
on the choice of quadrature rules for the double integrals that contribute to
the assembly efficiency and also posses sufficient accuracy. A major feature of
our recipes is the use of approximate balls, e.g., several polygonal
approximations of Euclidean balls, that, among other advantages, mitigate the

represented with global statistics (e.g., Gram matrices or covariance
matrices), and thus address the problem by forcing the output and style images
to have similar global statistics. An alternative is the assumption of local
style patterns, where algorithms are designed to swap similar local features of
content and style images. However, the limitation of these existing methods is
that they neglect the semantic structure of the content image which may lead to
corrupted content structure in the output. In this paper, we make a new
assumption that image features from the same semantic region form a manifold
and an image with multiple semantic regions follows a multi-manifold
distribution. Based on this assumption, the style transfer problem is
formulated as aligning two multi-manifold distributions and a Manifold
Alignment based Style Transfer (MAST) framework is proposed. The proposed
framework allows semantically similar regions between the output and the style
image share similar style patterns. Moreover, the proposed manifold alignment
method is flexible to allow user editing or using semantic segmentation maps as
guidance for style transfer. To allow the method to be applicable to
photorealistic style transfer, we propose a new adaptive weight skip connection
network structure to preserve the content details. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both artistic and
photorealistic style transfer. Code is available at

clouds with radii larger than 1 pc. The clouds are mainly distributed in the
two representative velocity ranges of 10 $-$ 20 km s$^{-1}$ and 30 $-$ 40 km
s$^{-1}$. By comparing with the ATLASGAL catalog, we found that the majority of

likely located at distances of 2 kpc (Sagittarius arm) and 3 kpc (Scutum arm),

their velocity structures, we attempt to reveal the origin of the cloud
structure in this region. Here we discuss three possibilities: (1) overlapping
with different velocities, (2) cloud oscillation, and (3) cloud-cloud
collision. From the position-velocity diagrams, we found spatially-extended
faint emission between $\sim$ 20 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$ 35 km s$^{-1}$, which
is mainly distributed in the spatially-overlapped areas of the clouds. We also
found that in some areas where clouds with different velocities overlapped, the
magnetic field orientation changes abruptly. The distribution of the diffuse
emission in the position-position-velocity space and the bending magnetic
fields appear to favor the cloud-cloud collision scenario compared to other
scenarios. In the cloud-cloud collision scenario, we propose that two $\sim$35
km s$^{-1}$ foreground clouds are colliding with clouds at $\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$
with a relative velocity of 15 km s$^{-1}$. These clouds may be substructures
of two larger clouds having velocities of $\sim$ 35 km s$^{-1}$ ($\gtrsim 10^3

using techniques that identify somatic mutations. In principle these mutational

3-5% of tumors that have an unknown primary site. Diagnosis of primary site is
also critical for screening tests that employ circulating DNA. However, most
mutations observed in any new tumor are very rarely occurring mutations, and
indeed the preponderance of these may never have been observed in any previous
recorded tumor. To create a viable diagnostic tool we need to harness the
information content in this ""hidden genome"" of variants for which no direct
information is available. To accomplish this we propose a multi-level
meta-feature regression to extract the critical information from rare variants
in the training data in a way that permits us to also extract diagnostic
information from any previously unobserved variants in the new tumor sample. A
scalable implementation of the model is obtained by combining a
high-dimensional feature screening approach with a group-lasso penalized
maximum likelihood approach based on an equivalent mixed-effect representation
of the multilevel model. We apply the method to the Cancer Genome Atlas

multiple helical flagella. The filaments gather behind the cell body and form a
close helical bundle, which propels the cell forward during a ""run"". The
filaments inside the bundle cannot be continuously actuated, nor can they
easily unbundle, if they are tangled around one another. The fact that bacteria
can passively form coherent bundles, i.e. bundles which do not contain tangled
pairs of filaments, may appear surprising given that flagella are actuated by
uncoordinated motors. In this article, we establish the theoretical conditions
under which a pair of rigid helical filaments can form a tangled bundle, and we
compare these constraints with experimental data collected from the literature.
Our results suggest that bacterial flagella are too straight and too far apart
to form tangled bundles based on their intrinsic, undeformed geometry alone.
This makes the formation of coherent bundles more robust against the passive
nature of the bundling process, where the position of individual filaments
cannot be controlled.

scheme capturing geometric phase effects. Specifically, a semiclassical closure
of the nuclear Ehrenfest dynamics is obtained through a convenient prescription
for the nuclear Bohmian trajectories. The conical intersections are suitably
regularized in the resulting nuclear particle motion and the associated Lorentz
force involves a smoothened Berry curvature identifying a loop-dependent
geometric phase. In turn, this geometric phase rapidly reaches the usual
topological index as the loop expands away from the original singularity. This
feature reproduces the phenomenology appearing in recent exact nonadiabatic
studies, as shown explicitly in the Jahn-Teller problem for linear vibronic
coupling. Likewise, a newly proposed regularization of the diagonal correction

the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, (ii) allows for different power-law indices

confusion noise from compact binaries, and (iv) exhibits the dependence of the
expected sensitivity on the collected amount of data. An important outcome of
this analysis is that, for the considered set of models, galactic confusion
noise typically reduces the number of observable scenarios by roughly a factor
two, more or less independent of the observing time. The numerical results

we find that the exciton-cavity coupling has significant effects on the total

coupling strength for the H-aggregate at which a maximal mobility is reached,
while the mobility in the J-aggregate decreases monotonically with increasing
exciton-cavity coupling; 2) At high temperatures, the mobility in both types of
aggregates get enhanced by the cavity. We illustrate the above-mentioned
low-temperature optimal mobility observed in the H-aggregate by using realistic
parameters at room temperature.

distance measures that avoids the saturation of the health system. In this
context, we investigate a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework to determine
the time and duration of social distancing policies. We use Brazilian data in
the period from March to May of 2020. The available data regarding the number
of infected individuals and deaths suffers from sub-notification due to the
absence of mass tests and the relevant presence of the asymptomatic
individuals. We estimate variations of the SIR model using an
uncertainty-weighted Least-Squares criterion that considers both nominal and
inconsistent-data conditions. Moreover, we add to our versions of the SIR model
an additional dynamic state variable to mimic the response of the population to
the social distancing policies determined by the government that affects the
speed of COVID-19 transmission. Our control framework is within a mixed-logical
formalism, since the decision variable is forcefully binary (the existence or
the absence of social distance policy). A dwell-time constraint is included to
avoid harsh shifting between these two states. Finally, we present simulation
results to illustrate how such optimal control policy would operate. These
results point out that no social distancing should be relaxed before mid August
2020. If relaxations are necessary, they should not be performed before the
beginning this date and should be in small periods, no longer than 25 days.
This paradigm would proceed roughly until January/2021. The second peak of

overview, analysis, and synthesis of the results of a variety of long-term

primarily at the study of magnetized gaseous structures. As a part of such a
study, it was found that the structure of the gaseous flows between the donor

period; and, accordingly, that the donor magnetic field influences the
formation of these moving magnetized structures. The analysis of the masses of
both components for use in further scientific works suggests that the following
values are optimal: 2.9 M_sun for the donor and 13 M_sun for the gainer. The
study of satellite lines as a certain phenomenon leads to the fact that the
accretion disk surrounding the gainer consists of two parts: the external
satellite disk and the internal massive opaque disk. From the analysis of all
observations and studies of the magnetic field, observations on the 6-m
telescope can be considered the most reliable. They have formed the spatial
configuration of the donor magnetic field, which is important for studying and

contour dependence, i.e. dependence on the way operators are distributed around
the thermal circle. We report large scale tensor network numerics on a gapped
chaotic spin chain down to temperatures comparable to the gap which show that
the speed of operator growth is strongly contour dependent. The numerics also
show a characteristic broadening of the operator wavefront at finite

perform a perturbative calculation in the paramagnetic phase of a 2+1D O($N$)
non-linear sigma model, which is analytically tractable at large $N$. Using the
ladder diagram technique, we find that operators spread at a speed $\sqrt{T/m}$

we observe coherent excitations and strong photon echoes that provide us with a
powerful method for the study of their decay processes. We extract the first
measurements of energy relaxation ($T_1$) and decoherence ($T_2$) times close
to the MIT in this classic system. We observe that (i) both relaxation rates

relaxation timescale $T_1$ counterintuitively increases with increasing
temperature and (iii) the coherence relaxation timescale $T_2$ has little

uncertainty. Previous methods leverage the deep neural network to map input
grayscale images to plausible color outputs directly. Although these

the input images that contain multiple objects. The leading cause is that
existing models perform learning and colorization on the entire image. In the
absence of a clear figure-ground separation, these models cannot effectively
locate and learn meaningful object-level semantics. In this paper, we propose a
method for achieving instance-aware colorization. Our network architecture
leverages an off-the-shelf object detector to obtain cropped object images and
uses an instance colorization network to extract object-level features. We use
a similar network to extract the full-image features and apply a fusion module
to full object-level and image-level features to predict the final colors. Both
colorization networks and fusion modules are learned from a large-scale

Magnetars have surface magnetic fields in excess of $10^{14}$ G, the decay of
which powers a range of high-energy phenomena. Here we present the discovery of
a millisecond-duration radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154,
with a fluence of $1.5\pm 0.3$ Mega-Jansky milliseconds. This event, termed ST
200428A(=FRB 200428), was detected on 28 April 2020 by the STARE2 radio array
in the 1281--1468\,MHz band. The isotropic-equivalent energy released in ST
200428A is $4\times10^{3}$ times greater than in any Galactic radio burst
previously observed on similar timescales. ST 200428A is just 40 times less
energetic than the weakest extragalactic FRB observed to date, and is arguably
drawn from the same population as the observed FRB sample. The coincidence of
ST 200428A with an X-ray burst favours emission models developed for FRBs that
describe synchrotron masers or electromagnetic pulses powered by magnetar
bursts and giant flares. The discovery of ST 200428A implies that active

comparing to previous results, we also find that the transport transition is
distinct from a transition observed in the speed of operator growth in the

find an unusual oscillation pattern for intermediate values of the potential

multiple dynamical phases between the much-studied thermal and

potential reach of the HGCAL using a signal model in which the Standard Model
Higgs boson decays into a pair of LLPs, $h \to XX$. After carefully estimating
the Standard Model QCD and the misreconstructed fake-track backgrounds, we give
the projected reach for both a more conservative vector boson fusion trigger

for the Higgs decay branching ratio, BR$(h \to XX)$, in the vector boson fusion
channel is about $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ with lifetime $c\tau_X \sim 0.1$--$1$

$\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}\text{--}10^{-6})$ for similar lifetimes. Alternatively,
for an LLP with $c\tau_X \sim 10^3$ meters, the HGCAL based search should be
able to probe BR$(h\to XX)$ down to a few $\times 10^{-4}$($10^{-2}$) in the

given by derivatives of modular or quasi-modular forms, which encode BPS
invariants of Calabi-Yau or non-Calabi-Yau threefolds that are embedded in the
given fourfold. As a result, the elliptic genus is only a quasi-Jacobi form,
rather than a modular or quasi-modular one in the usual sense. This manifests
itself as a holomorphic anomaly of the spectral flow symmetry, and in an
elliptic holomorphic anomaly equation that maps between different flux sectors.
We support our general considerations by a detailed study of examples,
including non-critical strings in four dimensions. For the critical heterotic
string, we explain how anomaly cancellation is restored due to the properties
of the derivative sector. Essentially, while the modular sector of the elliptic
genus takes care of anomaly cancellation involving the universal B-field, the
quasi-Jacobi one accounts for additional B-fields that can be present. Thus
once again, diverse mathematical ingredients, namely here the algebraic
geometry of fourfolds, relative Gromow-Witten theory pertaining to flux
backgrounds, and the modular properties of (quasi-)Jacobi forms, conspire in an
intriguing manner precisely as required by stringy consistency.

extrinsic curvature. Applied to cosmology, this framework allows us to control
not only the Hubble parameter but also anisotropies without the problem of
Ostrogradsky ghost, which is in sharp contrast to the case of limiting
spacetime curvature scalars. Our theory can be viewed as a generalization of
mimetic and cuscuton theories (thus clarifying their relation), which are known
to possess a structure that limits only the Hubble parameter on homogeneous and
isotropic backgrounds. As an application of our framework, we construct a model
where both anisotropies and the Hubble parameter are kept finite at any stage
in the evolution of the universe in the diagonal Bianchi type I setup. The
universe starts from a constant-anisotropy phase and recovers Einstein gravity
at low energies. We also show that the cosmological solution is stable against
a wide class of perturbation wavenumbers, though instabilities may remain for
arbitrary initial conditions.

SO(2k)/Z_2, Sp(2k)/Z_2, E_6/Z_3, and E_7/Z_2 for various discrete theta angles,
both directly in the gauge theory and also in nonabelian mirrors, extending a
classification begun in previous work. We find in each case that there are
supersymmetric vacua for precisely one value of the discrete theta angle, and
no supersymmetric vacua for other values, hence supersymmetry is broken in the
IR for most discrete theta angles. Furthermore, for the one distinguished value
of the discrete theta angle for which supersymmetry is unbroken, the theory has
as many twisted chiral multiplet degrees of freedom in the IR as the rank. We
take this opportunity to further develop the technology of nonabelian mirrors
to discuss how the mirror to a G gauge theory differs from the mirror to a G/K
gauge theory for K a subgroup of the center of G. In particular, the discrete
theta angles in these cases are considerably more intricate than those of the
pure gauge theories studied in previous papers, so we discuss the realization
of these more complex discrete theta angles in the mirror construction. We find
that discrete theta angles, both in the original gauge theory and their
mirrors, are intimately related to the descriptions of centers of universal
covering groups as quotients of weight lattices by root sublattices. We perform
numerous consistency checks, comparing results against basic group-theoretic
relations as well as with decomposition, which describes how two-dimensional
theories with one-form symmetries (such as pure gauge theories with nontrivial
centers) decompose into disjoint unions, in this case of pure gauge theories
with quotiented gauge groups and discrete theta angles.

early exits at the edge and full-precision layers on the cloud. During
inference, if an early exit has high confidence in the classification results,
it would allow samples to exit at the edge, and the deeper layers on the cloud
are activated conditionally, which can lead to improved energy efficiency and
inference latency. We perform an extensive design space exploration with the
goal of minimizing energy consumption at the edge while achieving
state-of-the-art classification accuracies on image classification tasks. We
show that with binarized layers at the edge, the proposed conditional hybrid
network can process 65% of inferences at the edge, leading to 5.5x
computational energy reduction with minimal accuracy degradation on CIFAR-10

restricted compared to the classical adversary because of the $\kappa$-CB
constraint. On the other hand, we seek competitive ratios parameterized only by
$\kappa$ with no dependence on the input length $n$, thereby giving the new
adversary power to use arbitrarily large inputs.
  We study online coloring under the $\kappa$-CB adversary. We obtain finer
analysis of the existing algorithms $FirstFit$ and $CBIP$ by computing their
competitive ratios on trees and bipartite graphs under the new adversary.
Surprisingly, $FirstFit$ outperforms $CBIP$ on trees. When it comes to
bipartite graphs $FirstFit$ is no longer competitive under the new adversary,

Erasure coding has seen itself quickly emerged as a promising technique to
reduce storage cost while providing similar reliability as replicated systems,
widely adopted by companies like Facebook, Microsoft and Google. However, it
also brings new challenges in characterizing and optimizing the access latency
when erasure codes are used in distributed storage. The aim of this monograph
is to provide a review of recent progress (both theoretical and practical) on
systems that employ erasure codes for distributed storage.
  In this monograph, we will first identify the key challenges and taxonomy of
the research problems and then give an overview of different approaches that
have been developed to quantify and model latency of erasure-coded storage.
This includes recent work leveraging MDS-Reservation, Fork-Join, Probabilistic,
and Delayed-Relaunch scheduling policies, as well as their applications to
characterize access latency (e.g., mean, tail, asymptotic latency) of
erasure-coded distributed storage systems. We will also extend the problem to
the case when users are streaming videos from erasure-coded distributed storage
systems. Next, we bridge the gap between theory and practice, and discuss
lessons learned from prototype implementation. In particular, we will discuss
exemplary implementations of erasure-coded storage, illuminate key design
degrees of freedom and tradeoffs, and summarize remaining challenges in
real-world storage systems such as in content delivery and caching. Open
problems for future research are discussed at the end of each chapter.

problem, which is commonly solved by optimization algorithms under a predefined

impressive performance, they are very computational demanding as they often
rely on an iterative updating scheme. Recently, the rise of neural networks has
inspired lots of learning based algorithms in unmixing literature. However,
most of them lack of interpretability and require a large training dataset. One
natural question then arises: can one leverage the model based algorithm and
learning based algorithm to achieve interpretable and fast algorithm for HSI
unmixing problem? In this paper, we propose two novel network architectures,
named U-ADMM-AENet and U-ADMM-BUNet, for abundance estimation and blind
unmixing respectively, by combining the conventional optimization-model based
unmixing method and the rising learning based unmixing method. We first
consider a linear mixture model with sparsity constraint, then we unfold
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to construct the
unmixing network structures. We also show that the unfolded structures can find
corresponding interpretations in machine learning literature, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of proposed methods. Benefit from the
interpretation, the proposed networks can be initialized by incorporating prior
information about the HSI data. Different from traditional unfolding networks,
we propose a new training strategy for proposed networks to better fit in the
HSI applications. Extensive experiments show that the proposed methods can
achieve much faster convergence and competitive performance even with very
small size of training data, when compared with state-of-art algorithms.

  3D Object Detection and Motion Forecasting","Submitted to IROS 2021",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Robust real-time detection and motion forecasting of traffic participants is
necessary for autonomous vehicles to safely navigate urban environments. In
this paper, we present RV-FuseNet, a novel end-to-end approach for joint
detection and trajectory estimation directly from time-series LiDAR data.
Instead of the widely used bird's eye view (BEV) representation, we utilize the
native range view (RV) representation of LiDAR data. The RV preserves the full
resolution of the sensor by avoiding the voxelization used in the BEV.
Furthermore, RV can be processed efficiently due to its compactness. Previous
approaches project time-series data to a common viewpoint for temporal fusion,
and often this viewpoint is different from where it was captured. This is
sufficient for BEV methods, but for RV methods, this can lead to loss of
information and data distortion which has an adverse impact on performance. To
address this challenge we propose a simple yet effective novel architecture,
\textit{Incremental Fusion}, that minimizes the information loss by
sequentially projecting each RV sweep into the viewpoint of the next sweep in
time. We show that our approach significantly improves motion forecasting
performance over the existing state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that our sequential fusion approach is superior to alternative RV based fusion
methods on multiple datasets.

structures that can be associated to pressure maxima. Pressure maxima are known
to be dust collectors and planet migration traps. Most of planet formation
works are based either on the pebble accretion model or on the planetesimal
accretion model. However, recent studies proposed the possible formation of
Jupiter by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We aim to study
the full process of planet formation consisting of dust evolution, planetesimal
formation and planet growth at a pressure maximum in a protoplanetary disk. We
compute, through numerical simulations, the gas and dust evolution, including
dust growth, fragmentation, radial drift and particle accumulation at a
pressure bump. We also consider the formation of planetesimals by streaming
instability and the formation of a moon-size embryo that grows into a giant
planet by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We find that
pressure maxima in protoplanetary disks are efficient collectors of dust
drifting inwards. The condition of planetesimal formation by streaming
instability is fulfilled due to the large amount of dust accumulated at the
pressure bump. Then, a massive core is quickly formed (in $\sim 10^4$ yr) by
the accretion of pebbles. After the pebble isolation mass is reached, the
growth of the core slowly continues by the accretion of planetesimals. The
energy released by planetesimal accretion delays the onset of runaway gas
accretion, allowing a gas giant to form after $\sim$1 Myr of disk evolution.
The pressure maximum also acts as a migration trap. Pressure maxima in
protoplanetary disks are preferential locations for dust traps, planetesimal
formation by streaming instability and planet migration traps. All these
conditions allow the fast formation of a giant planet by the hybrid accretion
of pebbles and planetesimals.

ansatz together with a purely radial scalar field can be fully integrated. The
kinetic term of the scalar field solution is shown to satisfy an algebraic
relation depending only on the coupling functions, and hence is constant while
the metric solution is nothing but the BTZ metric with an effective
cosmological constant fixed in terms of the coupling functions. As a direct
consequence the thermodynamics of the solution is shown to be identical to the
BTZ one with an effective cosmological constant, despite the presence of a
scalar field. Finally, the expression of the semi-classical entropy of this

the mass of the scalar soliton obtained from the black hole by means of a

conduction in such a material. Geometry optimisations of 100 structures with a
12.5% dopant concentration allowed us to identify a clear correlation between
the bending of the metal-oxygen-metal angle and the energies of the simulated
cells. Depending on the type of bending, two configurations, designated as
inwards bending and outwards bending, were defined. The results demonstrate
that a larger bending decreases the energy and that the lowest energies are
observed for structures combining inwards bending with protons being close to
the dopant atoms. These lowest energy structures are the ones with the
strongest hydrogen bonds. DFT-MD simulations in cells with different yttrium
distributions provide complementary microscopic information on proton diffusion
as they capture the dynamic distortions of the lattice caused by thermal
motion. A careful analysis of the proton jumps between different environments
confirmed that the inwards and outwards bending states are relevant for the
understanding of proton diffusion. Indeed, intra-octahedral jumps were shown to
only occur starting from an outwards configuration while the inwards
configuration seems to favor rotations around the oxygen. On average, in the
DFT-MD simulations, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter for the outwards
configuration which facilitates the intraoctahedral jumps. Diffusion
coefficients and activation energies were also determined and compared to
previous theoretical and experimental data showing a good agreement with

simplicity provides rich opportunities for probing and controlling the
electronic motion. Even for the simplest multielectron atom, helium, new DI
mechanisms are still being found. To first order in the field strength, a
strong external field doubly ionizes the electrons in helium such that they are
ejected into the same direction (front-to-back motion). The ejection into
opposite directions (back-to-back motion) cannot be described to first order,
making it a challenging target for control. Here, we address this challenge and
optimize the field with the objective of back-to-back double ionization using a
(1 + 1)-dimensional model. The optimization is performed using four different
control procedures: (1) short-time control, (2) derivative-free optimization of
basis expansions of the field, (3) the Krotov method, and (4) control of the
classical equations of motion. All four procedures lead to fields with dominant
back-to-back motion. All the fields obtained exploit essentially the same
two-step mechanism leading to back-to-back motion: first, the electrons are
displaced by the field into the same direction. Second, after the field turns
off, the nuclear attraction and the electron-electron repulsion combine to
generate the final motion into opposite directions for each electron. By
performing quasi-classical calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is
essentially classical.

determine system characteristics and input signals from the single output

pairs, the corresponding (complex-valued) amplitudes and the input signals from
only one output vector. This problem arises in a variety of applications such
as radar imaging, microscopy, channel estimation and localization problems.
While this problem is naturally ill-posed, by constraining the unknown input
waveforms to lie in separate known low-dimensional subspaces, it becomes
tractable. More explicitly, we propose a semidefinite program which exactly
recovers time-frequency shift pairs and input signals. We prove uniqueness and
optimality of the solution to this program. Moreover, we provide a grid-based
approach which can significantly reduce computational complexity in exchange
for adding a small gridding error. Numerical results confirm the ability of our

projective measurements necessarily implies high gate fidelity, nor slow
application necessarily implies low gate fidelity. Indeed, for highly
non-Markovian environments, it is of utmost importance to know the best time to
perform the measurements, since a huge variation in the gate fidelity may occur
given this scenario. Furthermore, we show that while for the amplitude damping
the knowledge of the dissipative map is sufficient to determine the best
measurement times, i.e. the best times in which measures are taken, the same is
not necessarily true for the phase damping. To the later, the time of the set
of measures becomes crucial since a phase error in one qubit can fix the phase
error that takes place in another.

fields of characteristic $p > 0$ are sufficient to derandomize polynomial
identity testing over fields of characteristic $p$. In this setting, existing
work on hardness-randomness tradeoffs for polynomial identity testing requires
either the characteristic to be sufficiently large or the notion of hardness to
be stronger than the standard syntactic notion of hardness used in algebraic
complexity. Our results make no restriction on the characteristic of the field
and use standard notions of hardness.
  We do this by combining the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with a white-box
procedure to take $p$-th roots of circuits computing a $p$-th power over fields
of characteristic $p$. When the number of variables appearing in the circuit is
bounded by some constant, this procedure turns out to be efficient, which
allows us to bypass difficulties related to factoring circuits in
characteristic $p$.
  We also combine the Kabanets-Impagliazzo generator with recent
""bootstrapping"" results in polynomial identity testing to show that a
sufficiently-hard family of explicit constant-variate polynomials yields a
near-complete derandomization of polynomial identity testing. This result holds
over fields of both zero and positive characteristic and complements a recent
work of Guo, Kumar, Saptharishi, and Solomon, who obtained a slightly stronger
statement over fields of characteristic zero.

auditable methodology for minimizing biases and ensuring reliability. A common
kind of bias arises when selecting studies using a set of inclusion/exclusion
criteria. This bias can be decreased through dual revision, which makes the
selection process more time-consuming and remains prone to generating bias
depending on how each researcher interprets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Objective: To reduce the bias and time spent in the study selection process,
this paper presents a process for selecting studies based on the use of Cohen's
Kappa statistic. We have defined an iterative process based on the use of this
statistic during which the criteria are refined until obtain almost perfect
agreement (k>0.8). At this point, the two researchers interpret the selection
criteria in the same way, and thus, the bias is reduced. Starting from this
agreement, dual review can be eliminated; consequently, the time spent is
drastically shortened. Method: The feasibility of this iterative process for
selecting studies is demonstrated through a tertiary study in the area of
software engineering on works that were published from 2005 to 2018. Results:
The time saved in the study selection process was 28% (for 152 studies) and if
the number of studies is sufficiently large, the time saved tend asymptotically
to 50%. Conclusions: Researchers and students may take advantage of this
iterative process for selecting studies when conducting SLRs to reduce bias in
the interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is especially useful
for research with few resources.

Although their importance is well recognized, a theoretical framework to

this paper, we bridge this gap and derive expressions for the stability of
dynamical systems defined on an arbitrary hypergraph. The framework allows us
to reveal that, near the fixed point, the relevant structure is the
graph-projection of the hypergraph and that it is possible to identify the role
of each structural order for a given process. We also analytically solve two
dynamics of general interest, namely, social contagion and diffusion processes,
and show that the stability conditions can be decoupled in structural and
dynamical components. Our results show that in social contagion processes, only
pairwise interactions play a role in the stability of the absorbing state,
while for the diffusion dynamics, the order of the interactions plays a
differential role. Ours is the first attempt to provide a general framework for

variant, a frame of venues or places where the members of the population tend
to gather, such as parks and bars, is constructed. The frame is not assumed to
cover the whole population. An initial cluster sample of elements is selected
from the frame, where the clusters are the venues, and the elements in the
initial sample are asked to name their contacts who are also members of the
population. The sample size is increased by including in the sample the named
elements who are not in the initial sample. The proposed estimators do not use
design-based inclusion probabilities, but model-based inclusion probabilities
which are derived from a model proposed by Felix-Medina et al. (2015) and are
estimated by maximum likelihood estimators. The inclusion probabilities are
assumed to be heterogeneous, that is, that they depend on the sampled people.
Estimates of the variances of the proposed estimators are obtained by bootstrap
and they are used to construct confidence intervals of the totals and means.
The performance of the proposed estimators and confidence intervals is

removed. In this paper, a method based on fitting the set of frequencies that
best describe a general non-linear model, like the Volterra series, is
presented. The method allows to extract these frequencies from the power
spectrum, so helping to improve the frequency analysis enabling hidden
frequencies to emerge from the initially considered as noise. Moreover, the
method yields frequencies with uncertainties several orders of magnitude
smaller than the Rayleigh dispersion, usually taken as the present error in a
standard frequency analysis. Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical

optimization is desired. However, previous literature observed computational
burdens limiting deterministic global optimization to Gaussian processes
trained on few data points. We propose a reduced-space formulation for
deterministic global optimization with trained Gaussian processes embedded. For
optimization, the branch-and-bound solver branches only on the degrees of
freedom and McCormick relaxations are propagated through explicit Gaussian
process models. The approach also leads to significantly smaller and
computationally cheaper subproblems for lower and upper bounding. To further
accelerate convergence, we derive envelopes of common covariance functions for

optimization including expected improvement, probability of improvement, and
lower confidence bound. In total, we reduce computational time by orders of

in the case of video data, results in higher performance for both tasks, but
they require a high frame-rate as a strict requirement for performance. This is
assumption is often violated in real-world applications, when models run on
embedded devices, often at only a few frames per second.
  Videos at low frame-rate suffer from large object displacements. Here
re-identification features may support to match large-displaced object
detections, but current joint detection and re-identification formulations
degrade the detector performance, as these two are contrasting tasks. In the
real-world application having separate detector and re-id models is often not
feasible, as both the memory and runtime effectively double.
  Towards robust long-term tracking applicable to reduced-computational-power
devices, we propose the first joint optimization of detection, tracking and
re-identification features for videos. Notably, our joint optimization
maintains the detector performance, a typical multi-task challenge. At
inference time, we leverage detections for tracking (tracking-by-detection)
when the objects are visible, detectable and slowly moving in the image. We
leverage instead re-identification features to match objects which disappeared
(e.g. due to occlusion) for several frames or were not tracked due to fast
motion (or low-frame-rate videos). Our proposed method reaches the
state-of-the-art on MOT, it ranks 1st in the UA-DETRAC'18 tracking challenge

main results assert that if the degree of the embedding line bundle of a
nonsingular curve of genus $g$ is greater than $2g+2k+p$ for nonnegative
integers $k$ and $p$, then the $k$-th secant variety of the curve has normal Du
Bois singularities, is arithmetically Cohen--Macaulay, and satisfies the
property $N_{k+2, p}$. In addition, the singularities of the secant varieties
are further classified according to the genus of the curve, and the
Castelnuovo--Mumford regularities are also obtained as well. As one of the main
technical ingredients, we establish a vanishing theorem on the Cartesian
products of the curve, which may have independent interests and may find

reaction becomes increasingly non-uniform when the slope of the equilibrium
potential curve is reduced. We employ numerical simulation and equivalent

a dimensionless reaction uniformity number. For electrode materials that have
equilibrium potentials insensitive to the state of charge and exhibit
significant reaction non-uniformity, we demonstrate several approaches to
spatially homogenizing the reaction current inside porous electrodes, including
matching the electronic and ionic resistances, introducing graded electronic

of the nodes continuously evolves through interactions among neighboring nodes,
forming a high-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. One of the main
challenges of Network Science consists in predicting the impact of network
topology and dynamics on the evolution of the states and, especially, on the
emergence of collective phenomena, such as synchronization. We address this
problem by proposing a Dynamics Approximate Reduction Technique (DART) that
maps high-dimensional (complete) dynamics unto low-dimensional (reduced)
dynamics while preserving the most salient features, both topological and
dynamical, of the original system. DART generalizes recent approaches for
dimension reduction by allowing the treatment of complex-valued dynamical
variables, heterogeneities in the intrinsic properties of the nodes as well as
modular networks with strongly interacting communities. Most importantly, we
identify three major reduction procedures whose relative accuracy depends on
whether the evolution of the states is mainly determined by the intrinsic
dynamics, the degree sequence, or the adjacency matrix. We use phase
synchronization of oscillator networks as a benchmark for our threefold method.
We successfully predict the synchronization curves for three phase dynamics
(Winfree, Kuramoto, theta) on the stochastic block model. Moreover, we obtain
the bifurcations of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model on the mean stochastic block
model with asymmetric blocks and we show numerically the existence of periphery
chimera state on the two-star graph. This allows us to highlight the critical
role played by the asymmetry of community sizes on the existence of chimera
states. Finally, we systematically recover well-known analytical results on
explosive synchronization by using DART for the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model on the

500 km. The Ca II 8542 {\AA} line wing images show much fainter ribbon

the limb. RADYN models are used to investigate synthetic spectral line profiles

The simulations show that, towards the limb, where the line of sight is
substantially oblique with respect to the vertical direction, the flaring
atmosphere model reproduces the high contrast of the off-limb H$\beta$ ribbons

bimolecular association step. Here, we use a novel single-molecule Fluorescence
Resonance Energy Transfer (smFRET) approach termed the ""fission"" assay to
obtain the full distribution of first passage times of unimolecular strand
displacement. At a frame time of 4.4 ms, the first passage time distribution
for a 14-nt displacement domain exhibited a nearly monotonic decay with little
delay. Among the eight different sequences we tested, the mean displacement
time was on average 35 ms and varied by up to a factor of 13. The measured
displacement kinetics also varied between complementary invaders and between
RNA and DNA invaders of the same base sequence except for T$\rightarrow$U
substitution. However, displacement times were largely insensitive to the
monovalent salt concentration in the range of 0.25 M to 1 M. Using a
one-dimensional random walk model, we infer that the single-step displacement

extremely limited in underwater acoustic (UWA) communications. Addressing this
concern, in-band fullduplex (IBFD) has the potential to double the efficiency
in a given bandwidth. In an IBFD scheme, transmission and reception are
performed simultaneously in the same frequency band. However, in UWA-IBFD,
because of reflections from the surface and bottom and the inhomogeneity of the
water, a significant part of the transmitted signal returns back to the IBFD
receiver. This signal contaminates the desired signal from the remote end and
is known as the self-interference (SI). With an estimate of the
self-interference channel impulse response (SCIR), a receiver can estimate and
eliminate the SI. A better understanding of the statistical characteristics of
the SCIR is necessary for an accurate SI cancellation. In this article, we use
an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal to characterize the
SCIR in a lake water experiment. To verify the results, SCIR estimation is
performed using estimators in both the frequency and time domains. We show
that, in our experiment, regardless of the depth of the hydrophone, the direct
path of SCIR is strong, stable and easily tracked; however, the reflection
paths are weaker and rapidly time-varying making SI cancellation challenging.
Among the reflections, the first bounce from the water surface is the prevalent
path with a short coherence time around 70 ms.

declining fibrinogen and increasing platelet counts to levels that are lower

an over-complete dictionary for input training data. At the deep coding layer,
a locality constraint is added to guarantee that the activated dictionary bases
are close to each other. Then the activated dictionary atoms are assembled and
passed to the compound dictionary learning and coding layers. In this way, the
activated atoms in the first layer can be represented by the deeper atoms in
the second dictionary. Intuitively, the second dictionary is designed to learn
the fine-grained components shared among the input dictionary atoms, thus a
more informative and discriminative low-level representation of the dictionary

Finally we mention extensions of these estimates to adapted function spaces. In
particular we give a general transference type principle for $U^2$ type spaces
that roughly implies that if an estimate holds for homogeneous solutions, then
it also holds in $U^2$. This transference argument can be used to obtain
bilinear and multilinear estimates in $U^2$ from the corresponding bounds for

problem of finding the critical exponents for the two nonlinear problems above

is more difficult than the effective case $\theta\in[0,\sigma/2)$, since the
asymptotic profile of the solution involves a diffusive component and an
oscillating one. The novel idea in this paper consists in treating separately
the two components to neglect the loss of decay rate created by the interplay
of the two components. We deal with the oscillating component, by localizing
the low frequencies, where oscillations appear, in the extended phase space.
This strategy allows us to recover a quasi-scaling property which replaces the
lack of homogeneity of the equation.

In this paper, we cut straight to the core of the problem of logical

""quanta"" of given percepts, qualia and cognitions, terming our approach ""PQG

we reach a novel semantics of belief, knowledge, in addition to a semantics for

well-equipped to not only address the problem of logical omniscience but to
more deeply investigate the psychical-logical nature of belief and knowledge.

46-day flight in 2016. The instrument is sensitive to photons in the energy
range $0.2$-$5$ MeV. Compton telescopes have the advantage of a unique imaging
response and provide the possibility of strong background suppression. With its
high-purity germanium detectors, COSI can precisely map $\gamma$-ray line
emission. The strongest persistent and diffuse $\gamma$-ray line signal is the
511 keV emission line from the annihilation of electrons with positrons from
the direction of the Galactic centre. While many sources have been proposed to
explain the amount of positrons, $\dot{N}_{\mathrm{e^+}} \sim
10^{50}\,\mathrm{e^+\,yr^{-1}}$, the true contributions remain unsolved. In
this study, we aim at imaging the 511 keV sky with COSI and pursue a
full-forward modelling approach, using a simulated and binned imaging response.
For the strong instrumental background, we describe an empirical approach to
take the balloon environment into account. We perform two alternative methods
to describe the signal: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, an iterative method
towards the maximum likelihood solution, and model fitting with pre-defined
emission templates. Consistently with both methods, we find a 511 keV bulge
signal with a flux between $0.9$ and $3.1 \times
10^{-3}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, confirming earlier measurements, and
also indications of more extended emission. The upper limit we find for the 511
keV disk, $< 4.3 \times 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}}$, is consistent
with previous detections. For large-scale emission with weak gradients, coded
aperture mask instruments suffer from their inability to distinguish isotropic
emission from instrumental background, while Compton-telescopes provide a clear
imaging response, independent of the true emission.

algorithms and statistical models to explore the connection between radiation

number of patient datasets are currently available, we used image flipping and
curvature-based interpolation methods to generate more data in order to
leverage transfer learning. Using interpolated and augmented data, we trained a
convolutional autoencoder network to obtain near-optimal starting points for
the weights. A convolutional neural network then analyzed the relationship
between patient-reported quality-of-life and radiation. We also used analysis
of variance and logistic regression to explore organ sensitivity to radiation
and develop dosage thresholds for each organ region. Our findings show no
connection between the bladder and quality-of-life scores. However, we found a
connection between radiation applied to posterior and anterior rectal regions
to changes in quality-of-life. Finally, we estimated radiation therapy dosage
thresholds for each organ. Our analysis connects machine learning methods with
organ sensitivity, thus providing a framework for informing cancer patient care
using patient reported quality-of-life metrics.

using a thick target by recording coincidence between light and heavy recoils,
populating T=3/2 isobaric analog states (IAS) in 9Be. Results: A good fit of
the 8Li(p,p)8Li resonance elastic scattering excitation function was obtained
using previously tentatively known 5/2- T=3/2 state at 18.65 MeV in 9Be and a
new broad T=3/2 s-wave state - the 5/2+ at 18.5 MeV. These results fit the
expected iso-mirror properties for the T=3/2 A=9 iso-quartet. Conclusions: Our
analysis confirmed isospin as a good quantum number for the investigated highly
excited T=3/2 states and demonstrated that studying the structure of
neutron-rich exotic nuclei through IAS is a promising approach.

large deviations of the empirical distribution and an early example of the
so-called maximum entropy inference method. This so-called Schroedinger bridge
problem (SBP) was recently recognized as a regularization of the
Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT), leading to effective
computation of the latter. Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed
as a zero-temperature limit of SBP, which amounts to minimization of the
Helmholtz's free energy over probability distributions constrained to possess
given marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a
temperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing
the entropy. These concepts are central to a rapidly expanding area of modern
science dealing with the so-called {\em Sinkhorn algorithm} which appears as a
special case of an algorithm first studied by the French analyst Robert Fortet
in 1938/40 specifically for Schroedinger bridges. Due to the constraint on
end-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack
these problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete
counterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation by iteratively solving
the so-called {\em Schroedinger system}. In both the continuous as well as the
discrete-time and space settings, {\em stochastic control} provides a
reformulation and dynamic versions of these problems. The formalism behind
these control problems have attracted attention as they lead to a variety of
new applications in spacecraft guidance, control of robot or biological swarms,
sensing, active cooling, network routing as well as in computer and data
science. This multifacet and versatile framework, intertwining SBP and OMT,
provides the substrate for a historical and technical overview of the field
taken up in this paper.

mean-flow field have been shown to qualitatively capture characteristics of the
observed turbulent coherent structures in both wall-bounded and free shear
flows. To make such resolvent models predictive, the nonlinear forcing term
must be closed. Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of
triadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence
modelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the
mean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field. In this
study, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear
resolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the
projection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent
structure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data
from high-fidelity simulations. We use large-eddy simulation databases for
round isothermal jets at subsonic, transonic, and supersonic conditions and
show that the optimal eddy viscosity substantially improves the alignment
between resolvent and SPOD modes, reaching over 90% alignment at those
frequencies where the jet exhibits a low-rank response. We then consider a
fixed model for the eddy viscosity and show that with the calibration of a
single constant, the results are generally close to the optimal one. In
particular, the use of a standard Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS)
eddy-viscosity resolvent model, with a single coefficient, provides substantial
agreement between SPOD and resolvent modes for three turbulent jets and across
the most energetic wavenumbers and frequencies.

the cascaded resonant Raman processes following ionization create negative
coherence between the rotational states of $J$ and $J$+2 in the ionic ground

final-value problems, corresponding to barrier options, using forward deep
learning to solve forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs).
Barrier instruments are instruments that expire or transform into another
instrument if a barrier condition is satisfied before maturity; otherwise they
perform like the instrument without the barrier condition. In the PDE
formulation, this corresponds to adding boundary conditions to the final value
problem. The deep BSDE methods developed so far have not addressed
barrier/boundary conditions directly. We extend the forward deep BSDE to the
barrier condition case by adding nodes to the computational graph to explicitly
monitor the barrier conditions for each realization of the dynamics as well as
nodes that preserve the time, state variables, and trading strategy value at
barrier breach or at maturity otherwise. Given these additional nodes in the
computational graph, the forward loss function quantifies the replication of
the barrier or final payoff according to a chosen risk measure such as squared
sum of differences. The proposed method can handle any barrier condition in the
FBSDE set-up and any Dirichlet boundary conditions in the PDE set-up, both in
low and high dimensions.

accretion at 1AU from solar-type stars. In this paper, we show that transition
to runaway gas accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an increase of the
grain opacity in their envelope after they have acquired sufficient mass
(typically 10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The accumulation of
mm-m size pebbles in their migration barriers enhances their local
fragmentation rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass through the
barrier, elevate the effective dust opacity and reduce the radiative flux in
the cores envelope. These effects alone are adequate to suppress the transition
to runaway accretion and preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1
AU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope and the disk can further
reduce the accretion rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host
stars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates over entropy advection in
stalling the transition to runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated
cores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more massive cores to gas giants
is reachable before severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can be
satisfied either in extended disks with large scale height via orderly
accretion of migrating pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic
protoplanetary embryos, and can account for the correlated occurrence of
long-period gas giants and close-in super-Earths.

  Heterogeneity",,,,,"math.DS math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a single population model with memory effect and the
heterogeneity of the environment, equipped with the Neumann boundary, is
considered. The global existence of a spatial nonhomogeneous steady state is
proved by the method of upper and lower solutions, which is asymptotically
stable for relatively small memorized diffusion. However, after the memorized
diffusion rate exceeding a critical value, spatial inhomogeneous periodic
solution can be generated through Hopf bifurcation, if the integral of
intrinsic growth rate over the domain is negative. Such phenomenon will never
happen, if only memorized diffusion or spatially heterogeneity is presented,
and therefore must be induced by their joint effects. This indicates that the
memorized diffusion will bring about spatial-temporal patterns in the overall
hostile environment. When the integral of intrinsic growth rate over the domain
is positive, it turns out that the steady state is still asymptotically stable.
Finally, the possible dynamics of the model is also discussed, if the boundary
condition is replaced by Dirichlet condition.

Previous anti-spoofing works focused on supervised techniques, typically with

face detection, which largely relaxes the supervision condition. To capture the
underlying structure of live faces data in latent representation space, we
propose to train the live face data only, with a convolutional Encoder-Decoder
network acting as a Generator. Meanwhile, we add a second convolutional network
serving as a Discriminator. The generator and discriminator are trained by
competing with each other while collaborating to understand the underlying
concept in the normal class(live faces). Since the spoof face detection is
video based (i.e., temporal information), we intuitively take the optical flow
maps converted from consecutive video frames as input. Our approach is free of
the spoof faces, thus being robust and general to different types of spoof,
even unknown spoof. Extensive experiments on intra- and cross-dataset tests
show that our semi-supervised method achieves better or comparable results to

over canonical forms of some accordiohedra with appropriate weights. These
weights were determined by demanding that the weighted sum corresponds to the

problem whether scattering amplitudes are completely obtained from only the

continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and bilevel positive airway pressure

to its locally normalized probability formulation. This paper provides a series
of empirical evidence that label bias is a major reason for such degenerate
behaviors of beam search. By combining locally normalized maximum likelihood
estimation and globally normalized sequence-level training, label bias can be
reduced with almost no sacrifice in perplexity. To quantitatively measure label
bias, we test the model's ability to discriminate the groundtruth text and a
set of context-agnostic distractors. We conduct experiments on large-scale

errors make this a stochastic optimization with unique challenges that must be
addressed at the level of the optimizer. The sharp trade-off between precision
and sampling time in conjunction with experimental constraints necessitates the
development of new optimization strategies to minimize overall wall clock time
in this setting. In this work, we introduce two optimization methods and
numerically compare their performance with common methods in use today. The
methods are surrogate model-based algorithms designed to improve reuse of
collected data. They do so by utilizing a least-squares quadratic fit of
sampled function values within a moving trusted region to estimate the gradient
or a policy gradient. To make fair comparisons between optimization methods, we
develop experimentally relevant cost models designed to balance efficiency in
testing and accuracy with respect to cloud quantum computing systems. The
results here underscore the need to both use relevant cost models and optimize
hyperparameters of existing optimization methods for competitive performance.
The methods introduced here have several practical advantages in realistic
experimental settings, and we have used one of them successfully in a

experimentally linked to the anomalous flattening of electron temperature
profiles at high beam power in NSTX, potentially limiting fusion performance. A
detailed understanding of CAE/GAE excitation, therefore, is vital to predicting
(and ultimately controlling) their effects on plasma confinement. To this end,
hybrid kinetic-MHD simulations are complemented with an analytic study of the
linear stability properties of CAEs and GAEs. Perturbative, local analytic
theory has been used to derive new instability conditions for CAEs/GAEs driven

NSTX-like plasmas has been performed for a wide range of beam parameters,
providing a wealth of information on CAE and GAE stability in spherical

complex dependence on the fast ion injection velocity and geometry,

energetic particle modifications of GAEs are found in simulations, indicating
the existence of a new type of high frequency energetic particle mode. A cross

automatic clustering of similar user utterances (Clustering), manual annotation
of clusters with an intent label (Labeling) and propagation of intent labels to
the utterances from the previous step, which are not mapped to any cluster

explore contextual challenges to implementing different educational

via interest rates, or -- as hybrid products like equity-linked life insurance
and variable annuities -- directly to stocks or indices. However, insurance
contracts are not for trade except sometimes as surrender to the selling
office. This excludes the situation of arbitrage by buying and selling
insurance contracts at different prices. Furthermore, the insurer uses private
information on top of the publicly available one about financial market. This
paper provides a study of the consistency of insurance contracts in connection
with trades in the financial market with explicit mention of the information
involved.
  By defining strategies on an insurance portfolio and combining them with
financial trading strategies, we arrive at the notion of insurance-finance
arbitrage (IFA). In analogy to the classical fundamental theorem of asset
pricing, we give a fundamental theorem on the absence of IFA, leading to the
existence of an insurance-finance-consistent probability. In addition, we study
when this probability gives the expected discounted cash-flows required by the
EIOPA best estimate.
  The generality of our approach allows to incorporate many important aspects,
like mortality risk or general levels of dependence between mortality and stock
markets. Utilizing the theory of enlargements of filtrations, we construct a
tractable framework for insurance-finance consistent valuation.

random variable in terms of its moment generating function. When the underlying
random variable is itself the sum of $n$ unobserved i.i.d. terms, the basic
classical result is that the relative error in the density is of order $1/n$.
If instead the approximation is interpreted as a likelihood and maximised as a
function of model parameters, the result is an approximation to the maximum
likelihood estimate (MLE) that can be much faster to compute than the true MLE.
This paper proves the analogous basic result for the approximation error
between the saddlepoint MLE and the true MLE: subject to certain explicit
identifiability conditions, the error has asymptotic size $O(1/n^2)$ for some
parameters, and $O(1/n^{3/2})$ or $O(1/n)$ for others. In all three cases, the
approximation errors are asymptotically negligible compared to the inferential
uncertainty.
  The proof is based on a factorisation of the saddlepoint likelihood into an
exact and approximate term, along with an analysis of the approximation error
in the gradient of the log-likelihood. This factorisation also gives insight
into alternatives to the saddlepoint approximation, including a new and simpler
saddlepoint approximation, for which we derive analogous error bounds. As a
corollary of our results, we also obtain the asymptotic size of the MLE error
approximation when the saddlepoint approximation is replaced by the normal
approximation.

speed. Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision
processing models that only require limited computational resources. To this
end, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet)
for achieving real-time semantic segmentation. In SGCPNet, we propose the
strategy of spatial-detail guided context propagation. It uses the spatial
details of shallow layers to guide the propagation of the low-resolution global
contexts, in which the lost spatial information can be effectively
reconstructed. In this way, the need for maintaining high-resolution features
along the network is freed, therefore largely improving the model efficiency.
On the other hand, due to the effective reconstruction of spatial details, the
segmentation accuracy can be still preserved. In the experiments, we validate

design a generalizable person ReID framework which trains a model on source

this goal, we propose a simple yet effective Style Normalization and
Restitution (SNR) module. Specifically, we filter out style variations (e.g.,
illumination, color contrast) by Instance Normalization (IN). However, such a
process inevitably removes discriminative information. We propose to distill
identity-relevant feature from the removed information and restitute it to the
network to ensure high discrimination. For better disentanglement, we enforce a
dual causal loss constraint in SNR to encourage the separation of
identity-relevant features and identity-irrelevant features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the strong generalization capability of our framework.
Our models empowered by the SNR modules significantly outperform the

the form ""The more/less X, The more/less Y"" play a crucial role in many real
world applications where the amount of numerical data to manage is important,
this is the biological data. Recently, these types of patterns have caught the
attention of the data mining community, where several methods have been defined
to automatically extract and manage these patterns from different data models.
However, these methods are often faced the problem of managing the quantity of
mined patterns, and in many practical applications, the calculation of all
these patterns can prove to be intractable for the user-defined frequency
threshold and the lack of focus leads to generating huge collections of
patterns. Moreover another problem with the traditional approaches is that the
concept of gradualness is defined just as an increase or a decrease. Indeed, a
gradualness is considered as soon as the values of the attribute on both
objects are different. As a result, numerous quantities of patterns extracted
by traditional algorithms can be presented to the user although their
gradualness is only a noise effect in the data. To address this issue, this
paper suggests to introduce the gradualness thresholds from which to consider
an increase or a decrease. In contrast to literature approaches, the proposed
approach takes into account the distribution of attribute values, as well as
the user's preferences on the gradualness threshold and makes it possible to
extract gradual patterns on certain databases where literature approaches fail
due to too large search space. Moreover, results from an experimental
evaluation on real databases show that the proposed algorithm is scalable,
efficient, and can eliminate numerous patterns that do not verify specific
gradualness requirements to show a small set of patterns to the user.

statistics display the usual Poissonian behavior, but the variance of the

on the phase-shifter setting which can be explained by a probabilistic model
that accounts for fluctuations of the phase shift. The time series of the
detection events exhibit long-time correlations with amplitudes that also
depend on the phase-shifter setting. These correlations appear as damped
oscillations with a period of about 2.8 s. By simulation, we show that the
correlations of the time differences observed in the experiment can be
reproduced by assuming that, for a fixed setting of the phase shifter, the
phase shift experienced by the neutrons varies periodically in time with a
period of 2.8 s. The same simulations also reproduce the behavior of the
variance. Our analysis of the experimental data suggests that time-stamped data
of singleparticle interference experiments may exhibit transient features that

routes, one linked with finite-amplitude disturbances and the other one
originating from a linear instability, as in e.g. boundary layer flows. The
dynamical systems concept of edge manifold has been suggested in the
subcritical case to explain the partition of the state space of the system.
This investigation is devoted to the evolution of the edge manifold when a
linear stability is added in such subcritical systems, a situation poorly
studied despite its prevalence in realistic fluid flows. In particular the fate
of the edge state as a mediator of transition is unclear. A deterministic
three-dimensional model is suggested, parametrised by the linear instability
growth rate. The edge manifold evolves topologically, via a global saddle-loop
bifurcation, from the separatrix between two attraction basins to the mediator
between two transition routes. For larger instability rates, the stable
manifold of the saddle point increases in codimension from 1 to 2 after an
additional local saddle node bifurcation, causing the collapse of the edge
manifold. As the growth rate is increased, three different regimes of this
model are identified, each one associated with a flow case from the recent
hydrodynamic literature. A simple nonautonomous generalisation of the model is
also suggested in order to capture the complexity of spatially developing
flows.

is a key problem in heterogeneous (and even homogeneous) distributed computing

Accordingly, our goal is to make the system robust against these uncertainties.
Considering task execution time as a random variable, we use probabilistic

our robustness goal. Specifically, we provide a mathematical model that
identifies the optimality of a task dropping decision, so that the system
robustness is maximized. Then, we leverage the mathematical model to develop a
task dropping heuristic that achieves the system robustness within a feasible
time complexity. Although the proposed model is generic and can be applied to
any distributed system, we concentrate on heterogeneous computing (HC) systems
that have a higher degree of exposure to uncertainty than homogeneous systems.
Experimental results demonstrate that the autonomous proactive dropping
mechanism can improve the system robustness by up to 20%.

polarization has been investigated in silicene. It has been shown that
non-equilibrium spin and pseudo-spin polarizations are emerged in silicene
sheet by applying an external perpendicular electric field in the presence of
circularly polarized light emission. This electric field results in pseudo-spin
resolved states very close to the Dirac points therefore could be considered as
a pseudomagnetic field. It has been shown that staggered potential induced
spin-valley locking and pseudo-spin resolved bands are responsible for
enhancement of the spin and pseudo-spin polarizations. Meanwhile, spin-valley
locking suggests a coexistence of both spin and valley polarizations with
nearly identical population imbalance at low Fermi energies which could be
employed for magnetic detection of the valley polarization. It has been shown
that spin-valley locking results in protection of the spin polarizations
against the relaxations in elastic scattering regime. In addition results
indicate that the pseudo-spin current can be generated by the circularly
polarized light which could be explained by asymmetric light absorption of the
states in k-space.

X-ray computed tomography imaging is being used for effectively screening
COVID-19 patients. The development of computer-aided systems based on deep
neural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect
COVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in
number, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the
vulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are
vulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation
(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we
focus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest
X-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple
iterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure
resulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,
which cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results
demonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,
even in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average
norm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for
the nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted
UAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The
targeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given
target class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in
practical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they
emphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,
we show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the
robustness of the DNN models against UAPs.

up and how often these should be serviced. To that end, we study the strategic
planning problem for MMUs (SPMMU) $-$ a capacitated set covering problem that
includes existing practices and two types of patient demands: (i) steerable
demands representing patients who seek health services through a centralized
appointment system and can be steered to any treatment facility within a given
consideration set and (ii) unsteerable demands representing walk-in patients
who always visit the closest available treatment facility. We propose an
integer linear program for the SPMMU that can be solved via Benders

focus on the uncertain version of the problem in which steerable and
unsteerable demands are modeled as random variables that may vary within a
given interval. Using methods from robust optimization and duality theory, we
devise exact constraint generation methods to solve the robust counterparts for

passengers have different needs for AVs, thus, how to provide personalized
choices for different passengers is another issue for AVs. Therefore, a
human-like decision making framework is designed for AVs in this paper.
Different driving styles and social interaction characteristics are formulated
for AVs regarding driving safety, ride comfort and travel efficiency, which are
considered in the modeling process of decision making. Then, Nash equilibrium
and Stackelberg game theory are applied to the noncooperative decision making.
In addition, potential field method and model predictive control (MPC) are
combined to deal with the motion prediction and planning for AVs, which
provides predicted motion information for the decision-making module. Finally,
two typical testing scenarios of lane change, i.e., merging and overtaking, are
carried out to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
decision-making framework considering different human-like behaviors. Testing
results indicate that both the two game theoretic approaches can provide
reasonable human-like decision making for AVs. Compared with the Nash

nonminimal coupling affects the spectrum of the curvature perturbation
generated in the curvaton scenarios. In particular we find that for small,
negative nonminimal couplings the spectral index gets a contribution that is
negative and linear in the nonminimal coupling. Since in this way the curvature
spectrum becomes redder, some of curvaton scenarios can be saved, which would
otherwise be ruled out. In the power law inflation we find that a large
nonminimal coupling is excluded since it gives the principal slow roll
parameter that is of the order of unity. Finally, we point out that nonminimal

successful electromagnetic followup. In this manuscript, we explore the
possibility of using the early stage X-ray afterglow to search for the
electromagnetic counterpart of gravitational wave events. Two algorithms, the
sequential observation and the local optimization are considered and applied to
three simulated events. We consider the proposed Einstein probe as a candidate
X-ray telescope. Benefiting from the large field of view and high sensitivity,
we find that the sequential observation algorithm not only is easy to
implement, but also promises a good chance of actual detection.

  Modeling","13 pages, 4 figures. Submitted to T.ITS",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intra-driver and inter-driver heterogeneity has been confirmed to exist in
human driving behaviors by many studies. In this study, a joint model of the
two types of heterogeneity in car-following behavior is proposed as an approach
of driver profiling and identification. It is assumed that all drivers share a
pool of driver states; under each state a car-following data sequence obeys a
specific probability distribution in feature space; each driver has his/her own
probability distribution over the states, called driver profile, which
characterize the intradriver heterogeneity, while the difference between the
driver profile of different drivers depict the inter-driver heterogeneity.
Thus, the driver profile can be used to distinguish a driver from others. Based
on the assumption, a stochastic car-following model is proposed to take both
intra-driver and inter-driver heterogeneity into consideration, and a method is
proposed to jointly learn parameters in behavioral feature extractor, driver
states and driver profiles. Experiments demonstrate the performance of the
proposed method in driver identification on naturalistic car-following data:
accuracy of 82.3% is achieved in an 8-driver experiment using 10 car-following
sequences of duration 15 seconds for online inference. The potential of fast
registration of new drivers are demonstrated and discussed.

stacking our lower resolution data to measure the depth of various interstellar

gas and the gas-phase and stellar metallicities near the end of the era of
cosmic reionization. From maximum absorption line depths of SiII1260 and
CII1334, we infer a mean covering fraction of >0.85+/-0.16 for our sample. This
is larger than that determined using similar methods for lower luminosity
galaxies at slightly lower redshifts, suggesting that the most luminous
galaxies appear to have a lower escape fraction than fainter galaxies, and
therefore may not play a prominent role in concluding reionization. Using
various interstellar absorption lines we deduce gas-phase metallicities close
to solar indicative of substantial early enrichment. Using selected stellar
absorption lines, we model our spectra with a range of metallicities using
techniques successfully employed at lower redshift and deduce a stellar
metallicity of 0.4 +0.3/-0.1 solar, consistent with the stellar mass - stellar
metallicity relation recently found at z~3-5. We discuss the implications of
these metallicity estimates for the typical ages of our luminous galaxies and

quickly. Graphically we show that the transmission (reflection) coefficients
decrease (increase) with an increase in the magnitude of the electric charge

oscillations due to the nonzero value of the imaginary part, which is always
negative. The imaginary part of the QNMs frequencies is continuously decreasing

surface mesh from an input point cloud. Instead of explicitly specifying a
prior that encodes the expected shape properties, the prior is defined
automatically using the input point cloud, which we refer to as a self-prior.
The self-prior encapsulates reoccurring geometric repetitions from a single
shape within the weights of a deep neural network. We optimize the network
weights to deform an initial mesh to shrink-wrap a single input point cloud.
This explicitly considers the entire reconstructed shape, since shared local
kernels are calculated to fit the overall object. The convolutional kernels are
optimized globally across the entire shape, which inherently encourages
local-scale geometric self-similarity across the shape surface. We show that
shrink-wrapping a point cloud with a self-prior converges to a desirable
solution; compared to a prescribed smoothness prior, which often becomes
trapped in undesirable local minima. While the performance of traditional
reconstruction approaches degrades in non-ideal conditions that are often
present in real world scanning, i.e., unoriented normals, noise and missing
(low density) parts, Point2Mesh is robust to non-ideal conditions. We
demonstrate the performance of Point2Mesh on a large variety of shapes with
varying complexity.

However, we find that there are evident misregistration shifts between the
Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images that are directly downloaded from
the official website. To address that, this paper presents a fast and effective
registration method for the two types of images. In the proposed method, a
block-based scheme is first designed to extract evenly distributed interest
points. Then the correspondences are detected by using the similarity of
structural features between the SAR and optical images, where the three
dimension (3D) phase correlation (PC) is used as the similarity measure for
accelerating image matching. Finally, the obtained correspondences are employed
to measure the misregistration shifts between the images. Moreover, to
eliminate the misregistration, we use some representative geometric
transformation models such as polynomial models, projective models, and
rational function models for the co-registration of the two types of images,
and compare and analyze their registration accuracy under different numbers of
control points and different terrains. Six pairs of the Sentinel-1 SAR L1 and
Sentinel-2 optical L1C images covering three different terrains are tested in
our experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve
precise correspondences between the images, and the 3rd. Order polynomial
achieves the most satisfactory registration results. Its registration accuracy
of the flat areas is less than 1.0 10m pixels, and that of the hilly areas is

and allocation of a disjoint ensemble of black-box predictors to answer
predictive spatio-temporal queries. Our approach is divided into two parts --
offline and online. During the offline part, we preprocess the predictive
domain data -- transforming it into a regular grid -- and the black-box models
-- computing their spatio-temporal learning function. In the online part, we
compute a DJEnsemble plan which minimizes a multivariate cost function based on
estimates for the prediction error and the execution cost -- producing a model
spatial allocation matrix -- and run the optimal ensemble plan. We conduct a
set of extensive experiments that evaluate the DJEnsemble approach and
highlight its efficiency. We show that our cost model produces plans with
performance close to the actual best plan. When compared against the
traditional ensemble approach, DJEnsemble achieves up to $4X$ improvement in
execution time and almost $9X$ improvement in prediction accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first work to solve the problem of optimizing the
allocation of black-box models to answer predictive spatio-temporal queries.

  2020 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA 2020)",,,,"cs.RO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The most common way for robots to handle environmental information is by
using maps. At present, each kind of data is hosted on a separate map, which
complicates planning because a robot attempting to perform a task needs to
access and process information from many different maps. Also, most often
correlation among the information contained in maps obtained from different
sources is not evaluated or exploited. In this paper, we argue that in robotics
a shift from single-source maps to a multi-layer mapping formalism has the
potential to revolutionize the way robots interact with knowledge about their
environment. This observation stems from the raise in metric-semantic mapping
research, but expands to include in its formulation also layers containing
other information sources, e.g., people flow, room semantic, or environment
topology. Such multi-layer maps, here named hypermaps, not only can ease
processing spatial data information but they can bring added benefits arising
from the interaction between maps. We imagine that a new research direction
grounded in such multi-layer mapping formalism for robots can use artificial
intelligence to process the information it stores to present to the robot
task-specific information simplifying planning and bringing us one step closer
to high-level reasoning in robots.

proposal network coupled with a false-positive reduction module for the
detection and localization of intracranial aneurysms (IA) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA), and to assess our model's performance to a
similar detection network. Methods: In this retrospective study, we evaluated
1,216 patients from two separate institutions who underwent CT for the presence
of saccular IA>=2.5 mm. A two-step model was implemented: a 3D region proposal
network for initial aneurysm detection and 3D DenseNetsfor false-positive
reduction and further determination of suspicious IA. Free-response receiver
operative characteristics (FROC) curve and lesion-/patient-level performance at
established false positive per volume (FPPV) were also performed. Fisher's
exact test was used to compare with a similar available model. Results: CADIA's
sensitivities at 0.25 and 1 FPPV were 63.9% and 77.5%, respectively. Our
model's performance varied with size and location, and the best performance was
achieved in IA between 5-10 mm and in those at anterior communicating artery,
with sensitivities at 1 FPPV of 95.8% and 94%, respectively. Our model showed
statistically higher patient-level accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when
compared to the available model at 0.25 FPPV and the best F-1 score (P<=0.001).
At 1 FPPV threshold, our model showed better accuracy and specificity
(P<=0.001) and equivalent sensitivity. Conclusions: CADIA outperformed a
comparable network in the detection task of IA. The addition of a
false-positive reduction module is a feasible step to improve the IA detection
models.

training of the network, the higher the accuracy is, regardless of the time
span of the time series. In order to analyze the performance of the neural
network in various conditions, 14 permanent stations are used in different
countries, namely, Spain, France, Romania, Poland, Russian Federation, United
Kingdom, Czech Republic, Sweden, Ukraine, Italy, Finland, Slovak Republic,
Cyprus, and Greece. The performance analysis is divided into two parts,
continuous data-without gaps-and discontinuous ones-having intervals of gaps
with no data available. Three measure of error are presented, namely, symmetric
mean absolute percentage error, standard deviation, and mean of absolute
errors. It is shown that for discontinuous data the position can be predicted
with an accuracy of up to 6 centimeters, while the continuous data positions
present a higher prediction accuracy, as high as 3 centimeters. In order to
compare the results of this machine learning algorithm with the traditional
statistical approaches, the Theta method is used, which is well-established for
high-accuracy time series prediction. The comparison shows that the generalized

than the Theta method, possibly up to 250 times. In addition, it is
approximately 4.6 times faster.

insertion-deletion streaming algorithms for Maximum Matching via the
simultaneous model of communication. Our lower bound is simpler and stronger in
several aspects: The lower bound of Assadi et al. only holds for algorithms
that (1) are able to process streams that contain a triple exponential number
of deletions in $n$, the number of vertices of the input graph; (2) are able to
process multi-graphs; and (3) never output edges that do not exist in the input

evolve with their hosts. The supermassive binary black holes (SMBBH) are thus
expected to exist in close galaxy pairs, however, none has been unequivocally
detected. The square kilometre array (SKA) is a multi-purpose radio telescope
with a collecting area approaching 1 million square metres, with great
potential for detecting nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). In this paper, we
quantify the GW detectability by SKA for a realistic SMBBH population using
pulsar timing array (PTA) technique and quantify its impact on revealing SMBBH
evolution with redshift for the first time. With only $\sim20$ pulsars, much
smaller a requirement than in previous work, the SKA PTA is expected to obtain
detection within about 5 years of operation and to achieve a detection rate of
more than 100 SMBBHs/yr after about 10 years. Although beyond the scope of this
paper, we must acknowledge that the presence of persistent red noise will
reduce the number of expected detections here. It is thus imperative to
understand and mitigate red noise in the PTA data. The GW signatures from a few
well-known SMBBH candidates, such as OJ 287, 3C 66B, NGC 5548 and Ark 120, will
be detected given the currently best-known parameters of each system. Within 30
years of operation, about 60 individual SMBBHs detection with $z<0.05$ and more
than $10^4$ with $z<1$ are expected. The detection rate drops precipitately
beyond $z=1$. The substantial number of expected detections and their
discernible evolution with redshift by SKA PTA will make SKA a significant tool
for studying SMBBHs.

provide a good description of the non-femtoscopic background, which results
mainly from collective effects, with unprecedented precision. Furthermore,
together with HIJING simulations, this model is used to account for
contributions from residual correlations induced by feed-down from particle
decays. The extracted scattering parameters indicate that the strong force is
repulsive in the $\Lambda\rm{K}^{+}$ interaction and attractive in the
$\Lambda\rm{K}^{-}$ interaction. The data hint that the and
$\Lambda\rm{K}^{0}_{S}$ interaction is attractive, however the uncertainty of
the result does not permit such a decisive conclusion. The results suggest an
effect arising either from different quark-antiquark interactions between the
pairs ($\rm s\overline{s}$ in $\Lambda$K$^{+}$ and $\rm u\overline{u}$ in
$\Lambda$K$^{-}$) or from different net strangeness for each system (S = 0 for
$\Lambda$K$^{+}$, and S = $-2$ for $\Lambda$K$^{-}$). Finally, the $\Lambda$K
systems exhibit source radii larger than expected from extrapolation from
identical particle femtoscopic studies. This effect is interpreted as resulting
from the separation in space-time of the single-particle $\Lambda$ and K source
distributions.

decays at midrapidity is found to be positive with a significance of

in agreement with the results at low $p_{\rm{T}}$. Transport models including
substantial interactions of beauty quarks with an expanding

D-meson $v_{n}$ harmonics are compatible within uncertainties with a mass
hierarchy for $p_{\rm T} \lesssim 3$ GeV/$c$, and are similar to those of
charged pions for higher $p_{\rm T}$. The coupling of the charm quark to the
light quarks in the underlying medium is further investigated with the
application of the event-shape engineering (ESE) technique to the D-meson $v_2$

average bulk elliptic flow in both central and semi-central collisions. Within
the current precision, the ratios of per-event D-meson yields in the

the measurements are found to be reasonably well described by theoretical
calculations including the effects of charm-quark transport and the
recombination of charm quarks with light quarks in a hydrodynamically expanding

the manifestation of signs in comparison with the known characteristic of solar

an order of magnitude shorter than available observations of solar activity
variation. Therefore, the resolved time scales of stellar activity are
insufficient to decide reliably that a cyclic variation for a particular star
is similar to the well-known 11-yr sunspot cycles. As a result, recent studies
report several stars with double or multiple cycles which serve to challenge
the underlying theoretical understanding. This is why a consistent method to
separate 'true' cycles from stochastic variations is required. In this paper,
we suggest that a conservative method, based on the best practice of wavelet
analysis previously applied to the study of solar activity, for studying and
interpreting the longest available stellar activity record - photometric
monitoring of V833 Tau for more than 100 years. We find that the observed
variations of V833 Tau with timescales of 2-50 yr should be comparable with the

thermalization to infinite temperature. To elucidate the properties of
prethermal quasiconservation in many-body Floquet systems, here we
systematically analyze infinite temperature correlations between observables.
We numerically show that the late-time behavior of the autocorrelations
unambiguously distinguishes quasiconserved observables from non-conserved ones,
allowing to single out a set of linearly-independent quasiconserved
observables. By investigating two Floquet spin models, we identify two
different mechanism underlying the quasi-conservation law. First, we
numerically verify energy quasiconservation when the driving frequency is
large, so that the system dynamics is approximately described by a static
prethermal Hamiltonian. More interestingly, under moderate driving frequency,
another quasiconserved observable can still persist if the Floquet driving
contains a large global rotation. We show theoretically how to calculate this
conserved observable and provide numerical verification. Having systematically
identified all quasiconserved observables, we can finally investigate their
behavior in the infinite-time limit and thermodynamic limit, using
autocorrelations obtained from both numerical simulation and experiments in

movement of several independent random walkers on a graph. Designing an
efficient graph algorithm based on multiple random walks requires investigating
multiple random walks theoretically to attain a deep understanding of their
characteristics. The first meeting time is one of the important metrics for
multiple random walks. The first meeting time on a graph is defined by the time
it takes for multiple random walkers to meet at the same node in a graph. This
time is closely related to the rendezvous problem, a fundamental problem in
computer science. The first meeting time of multiple random walks has been
analyzed previously, but many of these analyses have focused on regular graphs.
In this paper, we analyze the first meeting time of multiple random walks in
arbitrary graphs and clarify the effects of graph structures on expected
values. First, we derive the spectral formula of the expected first meeting
time on the basis of spectral graph theory. Then, we examine the principal
component of the expected first meeting time using the derived spectral
formula. The clarified principal component reveals that (a)the expected first
meeting time is almost dominated by $n/(1+d_{\rm std}^2/d_{\rm avg}^2)$ and
(b)the expected first meeting time is independent of the starting nodes of
random walkers, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. $d_{\rm avg}$
and $d_{\rm std}$ are the average and the standard deviation of weighted node
degrees, respectively. The characteristic(a) is useful for understanding the
effect of the graph structure on the first meeting time. According to the
revealed effect of graph structures, the variance of the coefficient $d_{\rm
std}/d_{\rm avg}$(degree heterogeneity) for weighted degrees facilitates the
meeting of random walkers.

decades and have been considered as a promising candidate for many
optoelectronic applications including highly-efficient solar cells. Some of the
fundamental properties of interest in these nanostructures is the temperature
dependence of their optical absorption onset, and how this is controlled by
different passivation regimes. In the present work we employ first-principles
calculations in conjunction with the special displacement method to study the
temperature dependence of the band gap renormalization of free-standing
hydrogen-terminated, and oxidized SiNCs, as well as matrix-embedded SiNCs in
amorphous silica, and we obtain good agreement with experimental
photoluminescence data. We also provide strong evidence that the
electron-phonon interplay at the surface of the nanocrystal is suppressed by
oxidation and the surrounding amorphous matrix. For the matrix-embedded SiNCs,
we show a high correlation between the temperature dependence of the band gap
and the Si-Si strained bonds. This result emphasizes the immanent relationship
of electron-phonon coupling and thermal structural distortions. We also
demonstrate that, apart from quantum confinement, Si- Si strained bonds are the
major cause of zero-phonon quasidirect transitions in matrix-embedded SiNCs. As
a final point, we clarify that, unlike optical absorption in bulk Si,
phonon-assisted electronic transitions play a secondary role in SiNCs.

physical origin. Recently, their extragalactic nature has been demonstrated and
an increasing number of the sources have been found to repeat. Young, highly
magnetized, isolated neutron stars - magnetars - have been suggested as the
most promising candidates for fast radio burst progenitors owing to their
energetics and high X-ray flaring activity. Here we report the detection with
the Konus-Wind of a hard X-ray event of April 28, 2020, temporarily coincident
with a bright, two-peak radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR~1935+2154
with properties remarkably similar to those of fast radio bursts. We show that
two peaks of the double-peaked X-ray burst coincide in time with the radio
peaks, confirming that the X-ray and radio emission most likely have a common
origin. Thus, this is the first simultaneous detection of a fast radio burst
from a Galactic magnetar and its high-energy counterpart. The total energy
emitted in X-rays in this burst is typical of bright short magnetar bursts, but
an unusual hardness of its energy spectrum strongly distinguish the April 28
event among multiple ""ordinary"" flares detected from SGR~1935+2154 previously.
This, and a recent non-detection of radio emission from about one hundred
typical soft bursts from SGR 1935+2154 favors the idea that bright, FRB-like
magnetar signals are associated with rare, hard-spectrum X-ray bursts, which
implied rate ($\sim$ 0.04 yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$) appears consistent with
the rate estimate of SGR 1935+2154-like radio bursts (0.007 - 0.04 yr$^{-1}$

One of the widely used methods for fractal analysis is box-covering. It is
known to be NP-hard. More severely, in comparison with fractal analysis
algorithms, MFA algorithms have much higher computational complexity. Among
various MFA algorithms for complex networks, the sandbox MFA algorithm behaves
with the best computational efficiency. However, the existing sandbox algorithm
is still computationally expensive. It becomes challenging to implement the MFA
for large-scale networks with tens of millions of nodes. It is also not clear
whether or not MFA results can be improved by a largely increased size of a
theoretical network. To tackle these challenges, a computationally-efficient
sandbox algorithm (CESA) is presented in this paper for MFA of large-scale
networks. Our CESA employs the breadth-first search (BFS) technique to directly
search the neighbor nodes of each layer of center nodes, and then to retrieve
the required information. Our CESA's input is a sparse data structure derived
from the compressed sparse row (CSR) format designed for compressed storage of
the adjacency matrix of large-scale network. A theoretical analysis reveals
that the CESA reduces the time complexity of the existing sandbox algorithm
from cubic to quadratic, and also improves the space complexity from quadratic
to linear. MFA experiments are performed for typical complex networks to verify
our CESA. Finally, our CESA is applied to a few typical real-world networks of
large scale.

use of additional covariates, for example terrain data, in order to improve
prediction accuracy in the modelling task. While elevation itself may be
important, additional explanatory power for any given problem can be sought
(but not necessarily found) by filtering digital elevation models to extract
higher-order derivatives such as slope angles, curvatures, and roughness. In
essence, it would be beneficial to extract as much task-relevant information as
possible from the elevation grid. However, given the complexities of the
natural world, chance dictates that the use of 'off-the-shelf' filters is
unlikely to derive covariates that provide strong explanatory power to the
target variable at hand, and any attempt to manually design informative
covariates is likely to be a trial-and-error process -- not optimal. In this
paper we present a solution to this problem in the form of a deep learning
approach to automatically deriving optimal task-specific terrain texture
covariates from a standard SRTM 90m gridded digital elevation model (DEM). For
our target variables we use point-sampled geochemical data from the British
Geological Survey: concentrations of potassium, calcium and arsenic in stream
sediments. We find that our deep learning approach produces covariates for
geostatistical modelling that have surprisingly strong explanatory power on
their own, with R-squared values around 0.6 for all three elements (with
arsenic on the log scale). These results are achieved without the neural
network being provided with easting, northing, or absolute elevation as inputs,
and purely reflect the capacity of our deep neural network to extract
task-specific information from terrain texture. We hope that these results will
inspire further investigation into the capabilities of deep learning within
geostatistical applications.

variety of applications yet by design are hard to adapt, tune to a specific

systems via automatic pre-processing (APP) using sentence simplification. We
first propose a method to automatically generate a large in-domain paraphrase
corpus through back-translation with a black-box MT system, which is used to
train a paraphrase model that ""simplifies"" the original sentence to be more
conducive for translation. The model is used to preprocess source sentences of
multiple low-resource language pairs. We show that this preprocessing leads to
better translation performance as compared to non-preprocessed source
sentences. We further perform side-by-side human evaluation to verify that
translations of the simplified sentences are better than the original ones.
Finally, we provide some guidance on recommended language pairs for generating
the simplification model corpora by investigating the relationship between ease
of translation of a language pair (as measured by BLEU) and quality of the
resulting simplification model from back-translations of this language pair (as
measured by SARI), and tie this into the downstream task of low-resource
translation.

device is realized by deterministic fabrication of the QD-microlens via in-situ
electron-beam lithography and 3D two-photon laser writing of the on-chip
micro-objective and fiber-holder. The QD with microlens is an efficient
single-photon source, whose emission is collimated by the on-chip
micro-objective. A second polymer microlens is located at the end facet of the
single-mode fiber and ensures that the collimated light is efficiently coupled
into the fiber core. For this purpose, the fiber is placed in the on-chip fiber
chuck, which is precisely aligned to the QD-microlens thanks to the sub-$\mu$m

especially for breast imaging, due to improvements in both ultrasound and
computing hardware. In particular, three-dimensional ultrasound tomography, a
fully tomographic method in which the medium to be imaged is surrounded by
ultrasound transducers, has become feasible. In this paper, a comprehensive
derivation and study of a robust framework for large-scale bent-ray ultrasound
tomography in 3D for a hemispherical detector array is presented. Two
ray-tracing approaches are derived and compared. More significantly, the
problem of linking the rays between emitters and receivers, which is
challenging in 3D due to the high number of degrees of freedom for the
trajectory of rays, is analysed both as a minimisation and as a root-finding
problem. The ray-linking problem is parameterised for a convex detection
surface and three robust, accurate, and efficient ray-linking algorithms are
formulated and demonstrated. To stabilise these methods, novel
adaptive-smoothing approaches are proposed that control the conditioning of the
update matrices to ensure accurate linking. The nonlinear UST problem of
estimating the sound speed was recast as a series of linearised subproblems,
each solved using the above algorithms and within a steepest descent scheme.
The whole imaging algorithm was demonstrated to be robust and accurate on
realistic data simulated using a full-wave acoustic model and an anatomical
breast phantom, and incorporating the errors due to time-of-flight picking that
would be present with measured data. This method can used to provide a
low-artefact, quantitatively accurate, 3D sound speed maps. In addition to
being useful in their own right, such 3D sound speed maps can be used to
initialise full-wave inversion methods, or as an input to photoacoustic
tomography reconstructions.

Saturn, our current exoplanet census includes several dozen such planets with
well-measured masses and radii. These sub-Saturns exhibit a diversity of bulk
densities, ranging from ~$0.1-3\ \rm{g\ cm}^{-3}$. When modeled simply as
hydrogen/helium envelopes atop rocky cores, this diversity in densities
translates to a diversity in planetary envelope fractions,
$f_\rm{env}=M_\rm{env}/M_p$ ranging from ~$10\%$ to ~$50\%$. Planets with
$f_\rm{env}\sim50\%$ pose a challenge to traditional models of giant planet
formation by core-nucleated accretion, which predict the onset of runaway gas
accretion when $M_\rm{env}\sim M_\rm{core}$. Here we show that many of these
apparent $f_\rm{env}\sim50\%$ planets are less envelope rich than they seem,
after accounting for tidal heating. We present a new framework for modeling
sub-Saturn interiors that incorporates envelope inflation due to tides, which
are driven by the observed non-zero eccentricities, as well as potential
obliquities. Consequently, when we apply our models to known sub-Saturns, we
infer lower $f_\rm{env}$ than tides-free estimates. We present a case study of
K2-19 b, a moderately eccentric sub-Saturn. Neglecting tides, K2-19 b appears
to have $f_\rm{env}\sim50\%$, poised precariously near the runaway threshold;
by including tides, we find $f_\rm{env}\sim10\%$, resolving the tension.
Through a systematic analysis of $4-8\ R_{\oplus}$ planets, we find that most
(but not all) of the similarly envelope-rich planets have more modest envelopes
of $f_\rm{env}\sim10\%-20\%$. Thus, many sub-Saturns may be understood as
sub-Neptunes that have undergone significant radius inflation, rather than a
separate class of objects. Tidal radius inflation likely plays an important
role in other size classes of planets including ultra-low-density Jupiter-size
planets like WASP-107 b.

the latter often subdivided into vibrational and rotational motions.
Experimentally identifying the relative roles of these collective modes is
extremely challenging, particularly in the face of possible shape coexistence.
Model-independent, invariant quantities describing the deformation of a nucleus
in the intrinsic frame have long been known but their determination potentially
requires a large quantity of experimental data to achieve convergence. Through
comparison with the nuclear shell model, the question of convergence will be
addressed. Shell-model calculations performed in the $sd$- and $pf$-shell model
spaces are used to determine electric-quadrupole matrix elements for a
multitude of low-lying states. Relative contributions to the rotationally
invariant quantities from multiple states can therefore be determined. It is
found that on average, the inclusion of four intermediate states results in the
leading-order invariant, $\left<Q^2\right>$, converging to within 10% of its
true value and the triaxiality term, $\left<\cos{\left(3\delta\right)}\right>$,
converging to its true value, though some variance remains. Higher-order
quantities relating to the softness of the nuclear shape are found to converge
more slowly. The convergence of quadrupole rotationally invariant sum rules was
quantified in the $sd$- and $pf$-shell model spaces and indicates the challenge
inherent in a full determination of nuclear shape. The present study is limited
to relatively small valence spaces. Larger spaces, such as the rare-earth
region, potentially offer faster convergence.

pb$^{-1}$ taken at $\sqrt{s}$ = 4.6 GeV with the BESIII detector. Using eleven
Cabibbo-favored $\bar{\Lambda}_c^-$ decay modes and the double-tag technique,
this absolute branching fraction is measured to be $\mathcal{B}(\Lambda_c^+ \to

the second systematic. The relative deviation between the branching fractions
for the inclusive decay and the observed exclusive decays is $(18.7\pm8.3)\%$,
which indicates that there may be some unobserved decay modes with a neutron or
excited baryons in the final state.

high-density plasmas (n > 10^19 m-3) at relatively moderate powers (< 2 kW) in
argon. However, to produce similar high-density plasmas for fusion relevant
gases such as hydrogen, deuterium and helium, much higher RF powers are needed.
For very high RF powers, thermal issues of the RF-transparent dielectric
window, used in the RF source design, limit the plasma operation timescales. To
mitigate this constraint, we have designed, built and tested a novel
liquid-cooled RF window which allows steady state operations at high power (up
to 20 kW). De-ionized (DI) water, flowing between two concentric dielectric RF
windows, is used as the coolant. We show that a full azimuthal blanket of DI
water does not degrade plasma production. We obtain steady-state, high-density
plasmas (n > 10^19 m-3, T_e ~ 5 eV) using both argon and hydrogen. From
calorimetry on the DI water, we measure the net heat that is being removed by
the coolant at steady state conditions. Using infra-red (IR) imaging, we
calculate the constant plasma heat deposition and measure the final steady
state temperature distribution patterns on the inner surface of the ceramic
layer. We find that the heat deposition pattern follows the helical shape of
the antenna. We also show the consistency between the heat absorbed by the DI
water, as measured by calorimetry, and the total heat due to the combined
effect of the plasma heating and the absorbed RF. These results are being used
to answer critical engineering questions for the 200 kW RF device (MPEX:
Materials Plasma Exposure eXperiment) being designed at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory (ORNL) as a next generation plasma material interaction (PMI)
device.

algorithms for near-term quantum devices. In digital quantum computing, it has
been shown that random parameterized quantum circuits are able to express
complex distributions intractable by a classical computer, leading to the
demonstration of quantum supremacy. However, their chaotic nature makes
parameter optimization challenging in variational approaches. Evidence of
similar classically-intractable expressibility has been recently demonstrated
in analog quantum computing with driven many-body systems. A thorough
investigation of trainability of such analog systems is yet to be performed. In
this work, we investigate how the interplay between external driving and
disorder in the system dictates the trainability and expressibility of
interacting quantum systems. We show that if the system thermalizes, the
training fails at the expense of the a large expressibility, while the opposite
happens when the system enters the many-body localized (MBL) phase. From this
observation, we devise a protocol using quenched MBL dynamics which allows
accurate trainability while keeping the overall dynamics in the quantum
supremacy regime. Our work shows the fundamental connection between quantum
many-body physics and its application in machine learning. We conclude our work
with an example application in generative modeling employing a well studied
analog many-body model of a driven Ising spin chain. Our approach can be

challenged by privacy concerns, power consumption, and maintenance issues.
Alternatively, embedding new sensors in the environment is limited by the

leveraging WiFi association logs for this purpose. While these provide coarse
approximations of location, these are easily obtainable and depict multiple
users on campus over a semester. We explore how these coarse collocations are
related to individual performance. Specifically, we inspect the association
between individual performance and the collocation behaviors of project group
members. We study 163 students (in 54 project groups) over 14 weeks. After
describing how we determine collocation with the WiFi logs, we present a study
to analyze how collocation within groups relates to a student's final score. We
find collocation behaviors show a significant correlation (Pearson's r = 0.24)
with performance -- better than both peer feedback or individual behaviors like
attendance. Finally, we discuss how repurposing WiFi logs can facilitate
applications for domains like mental wellbeing and physical health.

training levels also matters, different sets of training levels can boost
generalisation over all levels. In the GVGAI competition agents are scored

multiple constraints, e.g., high broad-spectrum potency and low toxicity. We
propose CLaSS (Controlled Latent attribute Space Sampling) - an efficient
computational method for attribute-controlled generation of molecules, which
leverages guidance from classifiers trained on an informative latent space of
molecules modeled using a deep generative autoencoder. We screen the generated
molecules for additional key attributes by using deep learning classifiers in
conjunction with novel features derived from atomistic simulations. The
proposed approach is demonstrated for designing non-toxic antimicrobial
peptides (AMPs) with strong broad-spectrum potency, which are emerging drug
candidates for tackling antibiotic resistance. Synthesis and testing of only
twenty designed sequences identified two novel and minimalist AMPs with high
potency against diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including
one multidrug-resistant and one antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae, via
membrane pore formation. Both antimicrobials exhibit low in vitro and in vivo
toxicity and mitigate the onset of drug resistance. The proposed approach thus
presents a viable path for faster and efficient discovery of potent and
selective broad-spectrum antimicrobials.

a valuable framework to distinguish the cosmological anisotropy from any other

irreversibly lost. In other words, compilation and decompilation of Java code
is not symmetric. Consequently, decompilation, which aims at producing source
code from bytecode, relies on strategies to reconstruct the information that
has been lost. Different Java decompilers use distinct strategies to achieve
proper decompilation. In this work, we hypothesize that the diverse ways in
which bytecode can be decompiled has a direct impact on the quality of the
source code produced by decompilers. In this paper, we assess the strategies of
eight Java decompilers with respect to three quality indicators: syntactic
correctness, syntactic distortion and semantic equivalence modulo inputs. Our
results show that no single modern decompiler is able to correctly handle the
variety of bytecode structures coming from real-world programs. The highest
ranking decompiler in this study produces syntactically correct, and
semantically equivalent code output for 84%, respectively 78%, of the classes
in our dataset. Our results demonstrate that each decompiler correctly handles
a different set of bytecode classes. We propose a new decompiler called
Arlecchino that leverages the diversity of existing decompilers. To do so, we
merge partial decompilation into a new one based on compilation errors.
Arlecchino handles 37.6% of bytecode classes that were previously handled by no
decompiler. We publish the sources of this new bytecode decompiler.

partitioning the state space and also improve the performance of a single agent
by combining decisions of all the agents. Secondly, we apply action refinement

converted into a random walk on a graph, i.e., a Markov process, we extend the
intransitiveness concept to such systems. The end of the game generally
consists in the appearance of a pre-defined pattern. In the language of random
walk this corresponds to an absorbing trap, since once that the game has
reached this condition the game comes to an end. Therefore, the
intransitiveness of the game can be mapped into a problem of competition among
traps. We analyse in details random walkers on several kind of networks (rings,
scale-free, hierarchical and city-inspired) with several variations: traps can
be partially absorbing, the walker can be biased and the initial distribution
can be arbitrary. We found that the transitivity concept can be quite useful

again based on the ideal sample which is defined as the combination of the
observed and unobserved samples, provided the same null hypothesis has already

dubious, one can bound the PIV of an inference based on bounded belief about
the mean counterfactual outcomes, which is often needed in this case.

diagnosis data from 28,490,650 patients EHR dataset. Fine-tuning experiments
are conducted on two disease-prediction tasks: (1) prediction of heart failure
in patients with diabetes and (2) prediction of pancreatic cancer from two
clinical databases. Med-BERT substantially improves prediction accuracy,
boosting the area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) by
2.02-7.12%. In particular, pre-trained Med-BERT substantially improves the
performance of tasks with very small fine-tuning training sets (300-500
samples) boosting the AUC by more than 20% or equivalent to the AUC of 10 times
larger training set. We believe that Med-BERT will benefit disease-prediction
studies with small local training datasets, reduce data collection expenses,
and accelerate the pace of artificial intelligence aided healthcare.

estimating expected shot value (ESV) in continuous time. Our approach is a
three-step recipe: 1) a generative model for a full-resolution functional
representation of ball and player trajectories using an infinite Bayesian
Gaussian mixture model (GMM), 2) conditioning of the GMM on observed positional
data, and 3) the prediction of shot outcomes given the functional encoding of a
shot event. From the ESV we derive three metrics of central interest: value
added with shot taking (VAST), Shot IQ, and value added with court coverage
(VACC), which respectively attribute value to shot execution, shot selection
and movement around the court. We rate player performance at the 2019 US Open
on these advanced metrics and show how each adds a novel perspective to
performance evaluation in tennis that goes beyond simple counts of outcomes by
quantitatively assessing the decisions players make throughout a point.

mechanism to capture user interests from historical behaviors. User interests
intuitively follow a hierarchical pattern such that users generally show
interests from a higher-level then to a lower-level abstraction. Modeling such
an interest hierarchy in an attention network can fundamentally improve the
representation of user behaviors. We, therefore, propose an improvement over
DIN to model arbitrary interest hierarchy: Deep Interest with Hierarchical
Attention Network (DHAN). In this model, a multi-dimensional hierarchical
structure is introduced on the first attention layer which attends to an
individual item, and the subsequent attention layers in the same dimension
attend to higher-level hierarchy built on top of the lower corresponding
layers. To enable modeling of multiple dimensional hierarchies, an expanding
mechanism is introduced to capture one to many hierarchies. This design enables
DHAN to attend different importance to different hierarchical abstractions thus
can fully capture user interests at different dimensions (e.g. category, price,
or brand).To validate our model, a simplified DHAN has applied to Click-Through
Rate (CTR) prediction and our experimental results on three public datasets
with two levels of the one-dimensional hierarchy only by category. It shows the
superiority of DHAN with significant AUC uplift from 12% to 21% over DIN. DHAN
is also compared with another state-of-the-art model Deep Interest Evolution
Network (DIEN), which models temporal interest. The simplified DHAN also gets
slight AUC uplift from 1.0% to 1.7% over DIEN. A potential future work can be a
combination of DHAN and DIEN to model both temporal and hierarchical interests.

Interface quasi-Newton (CIQN). It is designed for computationally intensive
applications using an MPI multi-code partitioned scheme. The algorithm allows
to reuse information from previous time steps, feature that has been previously
proposed to accelerate convergence. Through algebraic manipulation, an
efficient usage of the computational resources is achieved by: avoiding
construction of dense matrices and reduce every multiplication to a
matrix-vector product and reusing the computationally expensive loops. This
leads to a compact version of the original quasi-Newton algorithm. Altogether
with an efficient communication, in this paper we show an efficient scalability
up to 4800 cores. Three examples with qualitatively different dynamics are
shown to prove that the algorithm can efficiently deal with added mass
instability and two-field coupled problems. We also show how reusing histories
and filtering does not necessarily makes a more robust scheme and, finally, we
prove the necessity of this HPC version of the algorithm. The novelty of this
article lies in the HPC focused implementation of the algorithm, detailing how
to fuse and combine the composing blocks to obtain an scalable MPI

Our design addresses practical issues including interference among multiple

partially opaque due to absorption of light by ambient cosmic dust. This
implies that the Friedmann equations valid for the transparent universe must be
modified for the opaque universe. The paper studies a scenario when the opacity
steeply rises with redshift. In this case, the light-matter interactions become
important, because cosmic opacity produces radiation pressure that
counterbalances gravitational forces. The presented theoretical model assumes
the Universe expanding according to the standard FLRW metric but with the scale
factor $a(t)$ depending on both types of forces: gravity as well as radiation
pressure. The modified Friedmann equations predicts a cyclic
expansion/contraction evolution of the Universe within a limited range of scale
factors with no initial singularity. The model avoids dark energy and removes
some other tensions of the standard cosmological model. The paper demonstrates
that considering light-matter interactions in cosmic dynamics is crucial and
can lead to new cosmological models essentially different from the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. This emphasizes necessity of new observations and studies
of cosmic opacity and cosmic dust at high redshifts for more realistic
modelling of the evolution of the Universe.

transfer component with a pairwise margin loss function. It learns
discriminative deep features to group together utterances and discover multiple
latent intent categories within them in an unsupervised manner. We finally
hierarchically link mutually related intents into domains, forming an
intent-domain taxonomy. ADVIN significantly outperforms baselines on three

we develop a novel ensemble-based scheme for combining temporal windows of
varying lengths that are processed in parallel. For applications where the
increased computational requirements of this approach are not practical, we
also introduce a new ""approximate"" ensemble scheme that achieves significant
computational efficiencies without unduly compromising the original performance
gains provided by the ensemble approach. We demonstrate our ensemble scheme on
the visual place recognition (VPR) task, introducing a new Brisbane-Event-VPR

Almost 60% percent of the 6,000 observations can be covered (assuming a

contrasts previous literature findings. Link penalty, link elimination,

impressive performance, training GANs remains to this day more of an art than a

Generators are susceptible to mode dropping and convergence to random patterns,
