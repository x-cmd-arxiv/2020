to social prejudices and mass injustice. The prevalent existence of cognitive
biases in large volumes of historical data can pose a threat of being
manifested as unethical and seemingly inhuman predictions as outputs of AI
systems trained on such data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a
bias-aware multi-objective learning framework that given a set of identity
attributes (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and a subset of sensitive categories
of the possible classes of prediction outputs, learns to reduce the frequency
of predicting certain combinations of them, e.g. predicting stereotypes such as
`most blacks use abusive language', or `fear is a virtue of women'. Our
experiments conducted on an emotion prediction task with balanced class priors
shows that a set of baseline bias-agnostic models exhibit cognitive biases with
respect to gender, such as women are prone to be afraid whereas men are more
prone to be angry. In contrast, our proposed bias-aware multi-objective
learning methodology is shown to reduce such biases in the predictied emotions.

absorption peaks that are commonly identified with exciton and trions (or
charged excitons). In this paper, we show that excitons and trions in doped 2D
materials can be described by two coupled Schrodinger-like equations - one
two-body equation for excitons and another four-body equation for trions. In
electron doped 2D materials, a bound trion state is identified with a four-body
bound state of an exciton and an excited conduction band electron-hole pair. In
doped 2D materials, the exciton and the trions states are the not the
eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian and their respective Schrodinger equations
are coupled due to Coulomb interactions. The strength of this coupling
increases with the doping density. Solutions of these two coupled equations can
quantitatively explain all the prominent features experimentally observed in
the optical absorption spectra of 2D materials including the observation of two
prominent absorption peaks and the variation of their energy splittings and
spectral shapes and strengths with the electron density. The optical
conductivity obtained in our work satisfies the optical conductivity sum rule
exactly. A superposition of exciton and trion states can be used to construct a
solution of the two coupled Schrodinger equations and this solution resembles
the variational exciton-polaron state, thereby establishing the relationship
between our approach and Fermi polaron physics.

quantization and pruning through gradient based optimization. Bayesian Bits
employs a novel decomposition of the quantization operation, which sequentially
considers doubling the bit width. At each new bit width, the residual error
between the full precision value and the previously rounded value is quantized.
We then decide whether or not to add this quantized residual error for a higher
effective bit width and lower quantization noise. By starting with a
power-of-two bit width, this decomposition will always produce
hardware-friendly configurations, and through an additional 0-bit option,
serves as a unified view of pruning and quantization. Bayesian Bits then
introduces learnable stochastic gates, which collectively control the bit width
of the given tensor. As a result, we can obtain low bit solutions by performing
approximate inference over the gates, with prior distributions that encourage
most of them to be switched off. We experimentally validate our proposed method
on several benchmark datasets and show that we can learn pruned, mixed
precision networks that provide a better trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency than their static bit width equivalents.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.CR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial attacks against conventional Deep Learning (DL) systems and
algorithms have been widely studied, and various defenses were proposed.
However, the possibility and feasibility of such attacks against Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) are less explored. As DRL has achieved great
success in various complex tasks, designing effective adversarial attacks is an
indispensable prerequisite towards building robust DRL algorithms. In this
paper, we introduce two novel adversarial attack techniques to
\emph{stealthily} and \emph{efficiently} attack the DRL agents. These two
techniques enable an adversary to inject adversarial samples in a minimal set
of critical moments while causing the most severe damage to the agent. The
first technique is the \emph{critical point attack}: the adversary builds a
model to predict the future environmental states and agent's actions, assesses
the damage of each possible attack strategy, and selects the optimal one. The
second technique is the \emph{antagonist attack}: the adversary automatically
learns a domain-agnostic model to discover the critical moments of attacking
the agent in an episode. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our techniques. Specifically, to successfully attack the DRL agent, our
critical point technique only requires 1 (TORCS) or 2 (Atari Pong and Breakout)
steps, and the antagonist technique needs fewer than 5 steps (4 Mujoco tasks),
which are significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

The classical Cahn-Hilliard model is minimally modified by supplementing the
equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau dynamics with particle number conserving currents
which cannot be derived from a free energy, reflecting the microscopic
departure from action-reaction symmetry. The strength of the asymmetry in the
interaction determines whether the steady state exhibits a macroscopic phase
separation or a traveling density wave displaying global polar order. The
latter structure, which is equivalent to an active self-propelled smectic
phase, coarsens via annihilation of defects, whereas the former structure
undergoes Ostwald ripening. The emergence of traveling density waves, which is
a clear signature of broken time-reversal symmetry in this active system, is a
generic feature of any multi-component mixture with microscopic non-reciprocal
interactions.

crossover in few-layer MoS$_2$ FETs by using a gate-drain underlap design to
induce a differential response from traps at the MoS$_2$-HfO$_2$ channel-gate

trap-driven anti-clockwise hysteresis at high gate voltages in underlap FETs

classification problem, where the three-dimensional shape is learned offline
using Gaussian mixture modeling. The estimate is refined by minimizing two
different robust loss functions based on local feature correspondences. The
resulting pseudo-measurements are then processed and fused with an extended

directly on the $SE\text{(3)}$ manifold, uncoupling the process and measurement
models from the global attitude state representation. It is validated on

as Graph Edit Distance (GED) is important in many real-world applications.
Computing exact GED values is typically an NP-hard problem and traditional
algorithms usually achieve an unsatisfactory trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide a data-driven
solution for this task, which is more efficient while maintaining prediction
accuracy in small graph (around 10 nodes per graph) similarity computation.
Existing GNN-based methods, which either respectively embeds two graphs (lack
of low-level cross-graph interactions) or deploy cross-graph interactions for
whole graph pairs (redundant and time-consuming), are still not able to achieve
competitive results when the number of nodes in graphs increases. In this
paper, we focus on similarity computation for large-scale graphs and propose
the ""embedding-coarsening-matching"" framework CoSimGNN, which first embeds and
coarsens large graphs with adaptive pooling operation and then deploys
fine-grained interactions on the coarsened graphs for final similarity scores.
Furthermore, we create several synthetic datasets which provide new benchmarks
for graph similarity computation. Detailed experiments on both synthetic and
real-world datasets have been conducted and CoSimGNN achieves the best
performance while the inference time is at most 1/3 of that of previous
state-of-the-art.

character. In order to validate numerical methods and codes used for biomedical
flow computations, the U.S. food and drug administration (FDA) established an
experimental benchmark, which was a pipe with gradual contraction and sudden
expansion representing a nozzle. The experimental results for various Reynolds
numbers ranging from 500 to 6500 were publicly released. Previous and recent
computational investigations of flow in the FDA nozzle found limitations in
various CFD approaches and some even questioned the adequacy of the benchmark
itself. This communication reports the results of a lattice Boltzmann method
(LBM) based direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach applied to the FDA
nozzle benchmark for transitional cases of Reynolds numbers 2000 and 3500. The
goal is to evaluate if a simple off the shelf LBM would predict the
experimental results without the use of complex models or synthetic turbulence
at the inflow. LBM computations with various spatial and temporal resolutions
are performed - in the extremities of 44 million to 2.8 billion lattice cells -
conducted respectively on 32 CPU cores of a desktop to more than 300'000 cores
of a modern supercomputer to explore and characterize miniscule flow details

a Reynolds number 2000 like the FDA's experiments and acceptable agreement in
jet breakdown locations, average velocity, shear stress and pressure is found
for both the Reynolds numbers.

is more than 85% complete for $R < 20.6$, $D_{n}4000> 1.5$ and $M_{\star} >

We measure the stacked lensing signal from the HSC deep imaging. The central
stellar velocity dispersion is directly proportional to the velocity dispersion
derived from the lensing $\sigma_{\rm Lens}$, $\sigma_{\rm Lens} =
(1.05\pm0.15)\sigma_{\rm SHELS}+(-21.17\pm35.19)$. The independent
spectroscopic and weak lensing velocity dispersions probe different scales,
$\sim3$kpc and $\gtrsim$ 100 kpc, respectively, and strongly indicate that the
observable central stellar velocity dispersion for quiescent galaxies is a good
proxy for the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo. We thus demonstrate
the power of combining high-quality imaging and spectroscopy to shed light on
the connection between galaxies and their dark matter halos.

binaries and, during the process of merger, emit low-frequency gravitational
radiation in the process. In this paper we consider the galaxy 3C66B, which was
used as the target of the first multi-messenger search for gravitational waves.
Due to the observed periodicities present in the photometric and astrometric
data of the source of the source, it has been theorized to contain a
supermassive black hole binary. Its apparent 1.05-year orbital period would
place the gravitational wave emission directly in the pulsar timing band. Since
the first pulsar timing array study of 3C66B, revised models of the source have
been published, and timing array sensitivities and techniques have improved
dramatically. With these advances, we further constrain the chirp mass of the
potential supermassive black hole binary in 3C66B to less than $(1.65\pm0.02)
\times 10^9~{M_\odot}$ using data from the NANOGrav 11-year data set. This
upper limit provides a factor of 1.6 improvement over previous limits, and a
factor of 4.3 over the first search done. Nevertheless, the most recent orbital
model for the source is still consistent with our limit from pulsar timing
array data. In addition, we are able to quantify the improvement made by the
inclusion of source properties gleaned from electromagnetic data to `blind'
pulsar timing array searches. With these methods, it is apparent that it is not
necessary to obtain exact a priori knowledge of the period of a binary to gain
meaningful astrophysical inferences.

allowed inside the droplet during the process. This feeding procedure is now
viewed as a proper boundary condition that is a mixed or a generalized feeding

the bias in the power spectrum estimator of the redshifted 21-cm signal from

find, that for the visibility based power spectrum estimators, particularly
those use nearby baseline correlations to avoid noise bias, the bias in the

simulations, which demonstrate that GCs with DM can originate from nucleated
dwarfs orbiting the ancient MW. The simulated stripped nuclei (i.e., GCs) have
the central DM densities ranging from 0.1 to several ${\rm M_\odot pc^{-3}}$,
depending on the orbits and the masses of the host dwarf galaxies. However, GCs
born outside the central regions of their hosts can have no/little DM after
their hosts are destroyed and the GCs become the Galactic halo GCs. These
results suggest that only GCs originating from stellar nuclei of dwarfs can
possibly have DM. We further calculate the expected $\gamma$-ray emission from
these simulated GCs and compare them to observations of $\omega$ Cen. Given the
large range of DM densities in the simulated GCs, we suggest that the recent
possible detection of DM annihilation from GCs should be more carefully

Previous works on CNN acceleration utilize low-rank approximation of the
original convolution layers to reduce computation cost. However, these methods
are very difficult to conduct upon sparse models, which limits execution
speedup since redundancies within the CNN model are not fully exploited. We
argue that kernel granularity decomposition can be conducted with low-rank
assumption while exploiting the redundancy within the remaining compact
coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose PENNI, a CNN model
compression framework that is able to achieve model compactness and hardware
efficiency simultaneously by (1) implementing kernel sharing in convolution

various stages, from building, incrementally deploying, and maintaining the

Virtualization (NFV) are two core tenets of network softwarization. SDN offers
a logically centralized control plane by abstracting away the control of the
network devices in the data plane. NFV virtualizes dedicated hardware
middleboxes and deploys them on top of servers and data centers as network
functions. Thus, network softwarization enables efficient management of the
system by enhancing its control and improving the reusability of the network

deviations from additive interaction among three on more binary exposures. The
relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI) is used as measure of additive
interaction. First, we concentrate on three risk factors - we propose to
decompose the total RERI to: the RERI owned to the joint presence of all 3 risk
factors and the RERI of any two risk factors, given that the third is absent.
We then extend this approach, to >3 binary risk factors. For illustration, we
use a sample from data from the Greek EPIC cohort and we investigate the
association with overall mortality of Mediterranean diet, body mass index
(BMI), and, smoking. Our formulae enable better interpretability of any
evidence for deviations from additivity owned to more than two risk factors and
provide simple ways of communicating such results from a public health
perspective by attributing any excess relative risk to specific combinations of
these factors.

Neural Network (TDNN) that applies statistics pooling to project

In this paper, we propose multiple enhancements to this architecture based on
recent trends in the related fields of face verification and computer vision.
Firstly, the initial frame layers can be restructured into 1-dimensional
Res2Net modules with impactful skip connections. Similarly to SE-ResNet, we
introduce Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks in these modules to explicitly model
channel interdependencies. The SE block expands the temporal context of the
frame layer by rescaling the channels according to global properties of the
recording. Secondly, neural networks are known to learn hierarchical features,
with each layer operating on a different level of complexity. To leverage this
complementary information, we aggregate and propagate features of different
hierarchical levels. Finally, we improve the statistics pooling module with
channel-dependent frame attention. This enables the network to focus on
different subsets of frames during each of the channel's statistics estimation.
The proposed ECAPA-TDNN architecture significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
TDNN based systems on the VoxCeleb test sets and the 2019 VoxCeleb Speaker

dynamical system in a provably-safe way. Inspired by the fragility of
data-driven perception systems used by autonomous vehicles, we formulate the
problem that arises when a sensing modality fails or is found to be
untrustworthy during autonomous operation. We cast this problem as a
differential game played between the dynamical system being controlled and the
external system factor(s) for which observations are lost. The game is a
zero-sum Stackelberg game in which the controlled system (leader) is trying to
find a trajectory which maximizes a function representing the safety of the
system, and the unobserved factor (follower) is trying to minimize the same
function. The set of winning initial configurations of this game for the
controlled system represent the set of all states in which safety can be
maintained with respect to the external factor, even if observability of that
factor is lost. This is the set we refer to as the Eyes-Closed Safety Kernel.
In practical use, the policy defined by the winning strategy of the controlled
system is only needed to be executed whenever observability of the external
system is lost or the system deviates from the Eyes-Closed Safety Kernel due to
other, non-safety oriented control schemes. We present a means for solving this
game offline, such that the resulting winning strategy can be used for
computationally efficient, provably-safe, online control when needed. The
solution approach presented is based on representing the game using the
solutions of two Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equations. We illustrate
the applicability of our framework by working through a realistic example in
which an autonomous car must avoid a dynamic obstacle despite potentially
losing observability.

industrial applications is accompanied by several security concerns. A major
security concern is their probable abuse by adversaries towards their malicious
intent. Understanding and analyzing IoT malicious behaviors is crucial,
especially with their rapid growth and adoption in wide-range of applications.
However, recent studies have shown that machine learning-based approaches are
susceptible to adversarial attacks by adding junk codes to the binaries, for
example, with an intention to fool those machine learning or deep
learning-based detection systems. Realizing the importance of addressing this
challenge, this study proposes a malware detection system that is robust to
adversarial attacks. To do so, examine the performance of the state-of-the-art
methods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and
augmentation techniques. In particular, we study the robustness of such methods
against two black-box adversarial methods, GEA and SGEA, to generate
Adversarial Examples (AEs) with reduced overhead, and keeping their
practicality intact. Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show
the relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected
sample. Upon optimization and with small perturbation, by use of SGEA, all the
IoT malware samples are misclassified as benign. This highlights the
vulnerability of current detection systems under adversarial settings. With the
landscape of possible adversarial attacks, we then propose DL-FHMC, a
fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for malware detection and
classification, that is robust to AEs with a capability to detect 88.52% of the
malicious AEs.

of magnitude higher than that obtained in typical layered material based NDR

called evaporative lithography emerged after the connection between the coffee
ring effect taking place in drying colloidal droplets and naturally occurring
inhomogeneous vapor flux densities from liquid--vapor interfaces was
established. Essential control of the colloidal particle deposit patterns is
achieved in this method by producing ambient conditions that induce a
nonuniform evaporation profile from the colloidal liquid surface. Evaporative
lithography is part of a wider field known as ""evaporative-induced
self-assembly"" (EISA). EISA involves methods based on contact line processes,
methods employing particle interaction effects, and evaporative lithography. As
a rule, evaporative lithography is a flexible and single-stage process with
such advantages as simplicity, low price, and the possibility of application to
almost any substrate without pretreatment. Since there is no mechanical impact
on the template in evaporative lithography, the template integrity is preserved
in the process. The method is also useful for creating materials with localized
functions, such as slipperiness and self-healing. For these reasons,
evaporative lithography attracts increasing attention and has a number of
noticeable achievements at present. We also analyze limitations of the approach

its strong adaptability to dynamic circumstances and potential for broad
applications such as autonomous and anonymous surveillance. With the help of
deep learning techniques, it has also witnessed substantial progress and
currently achieved around 90\% accuracy in benign environment. On the other
hand, research on the vulnerability of skeleton-based action recognition under

about deploying such techniques into real-world systems. However, filling this
research gap is challenging due to the unique physical constraints of skeletons

towards understanding the adversarial vulnerability of skeleton-based action
recognition. We first formulate generation of adversarial skeleton actions as a
constrained optimization problem by representing or approximating the
physiological and physical constraints with mathematical formulations. Since
the primal optimization problem with equality constraints is intractable, we
propose to solve it by optimizing its unconstrained dual problem using ADMM. We
then specify an efficient plug-in defense, inspired by recent theories and
empirical observations, against the adversarial skeleton actions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the attack and defense method
under different settings.

films from colloidal solutions with bimodal particle size distribution. Such
distributions are formed in a natural way in mixed (slightly turbid) solutions
of cationic and anionic surfactants, where nanosized micelles coexist with
micronsized precipitated particles. Experiment: Without evaporation of water,
the films thin down to thickness < 100 nm. Upon water evaporation from the
film, one observes spontaneous film thickening (above 300 nm) and appearance of
a dynamic vortex with a spot of thinner film in the center. The vortex wall has
a stepwise profile with step-height equal to the effective micelle diameter
(ca. 8 nm) and up to 20-30 stratification steps. Results: For thicknesses
greater than 100 nm, stratification in foam films from micellar solutions has
never been observed so far. It evidences for the formation of a thick colloidal
crystal of micelles in the evaporating film. The role of the bigger,
micronsized particles is to form a filtration cake in the Plateau border, which
supports the thick film. The developed quantitative mechanical model shows that
the stepwise vortex profile is stabilized by the balance of hydrodynamic and
surface tension forces. Vortex is observed not only in films from catanionic
surfactant solutions, but also in films from silica and latex particle
suspensions, which contain smaller surfactant micelles.

GeV-scale neutrinos from the Fermilab NuMI beam. These detectors are also
sensitive to the flux of neutrinos which are emitted during a core-collapse

nearby galactic supernovae. This technique has been used by NOvA to
self-trigger on potential core-collapse supernovae in our galaxy, with an
estimated sensitivity reaching out to 10~kpc distance while achieving a
detection efficiency of 23\% to 49\% for supernovae from progenitor stars with

traditional hard timing constraints are relaxed to allow bounded deadline
misses for improving design flexibility and runtime resiliency. Safety
verification is a key issue for weakly-hard systems, as it ensures system
safety under allowed deadline misses. Previous works are either for linear
systems only, or limited to a certain type of nonlinear systems (e.g., systems
that satisfy exponential stability and Lipschitz continuity of the system
dynamics). In this work, we propose a new technique for infinite-time safety
verification of general nonlinear weakly-hard systems. Our approach first
discretizes the safe state set into grids and constructs a directed graph,
where nodes represent the grids and edges represent the reachability relation.
Based on graph theory and dynamic programming, our approach can effectively
find the safe initial set (consisting of a set of grids), from which the system
can be proven safe under given weakly-hard constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, when compared with the
state-of-the-art. An open source implementation of our tool is available at

theory should be considered classically explainable. Here we take the criterion
to be that the theory admits of a generalized-noncontextual ontological model.
Existing works on generalized noncontextuality have focused on experimental
scenarios having a simple structure, typically, prepare-measure scenarios.
Here, we formally extend the framework of ontological models as well as the
principle of generalized noncontextuality to arbitrary compositional scenarios.
We leverage this process-theoretic framework to prove that, under some
reasonable assumptions, every generalized-noncontextual ontological model of a
tomographically local operational theory has a surprisingly rigid and simple
mathematical structure; in short, it corresponds to a frame representation
which is not overcomplete. One consequence of this theorem is that the largest
number of ontic states possible in any such model is given by the dimension of
the associated generalized probabilistic theory. This constraint is useful for
generating noncontextuality no-go theorems as well as techniques for
experimentally certifying contextuality. Along the way, we extend known results
concerning the equivalence of different notions of classicality from
prepare-measure scenarios to arbitrary compositional scenarios. Specifically,
we prove a correspondence between the following three notions of classical
explainability of an operational theory: (i) admitting a noncontextual
ontological model, (ii) admitting of a positive quasiprobability
representation, and (iii) being simplex-embeddable.

outage performance analysis for an AmBackCom system with multiple backscatter

minimizes the signal-to-interference-plus noise ratio (SINR) at the backscatter

Galerkin (DG) schemes for the compressible Euler equations under gravitational
fields. A notable feature of these schemes is that they are well-balanced for a
general hydrostatic equilibrium state, and at the same time, provably preserve
the positivity of density and pressure. In order to achieve the well-balanced
and positivity-preserving properties simultaneously, a novel DG spatial
discretization is carefully designed with suitable source term reformulation
and a properly modified Harten-Lax-van Leer contact (HLLC) flux. Based on some
technical decompositions as well as several key properties of the admissible
states and HLLC flux, rigorous positivity-preserving analyses are carried out.
It is proven that the resulting well-balanced DG schemes, coupled with strong
stability preserving time discretizations, satisfy a weak positivity property,
which implies that one can apply a simple existing limiter to effectively
enforce the positivity-preserving property, without losing high-order accuracy
and conservation. The proposed methods and analyses are applicable to the Euler
system with general equation of state. Extensive one- and two-dimensional
numerical tests demonstrate the desired properties of these schemes, including
the exact preservation of the equilibrium state, the ability to capture small
perturbation of such state, the robustness for solving problems involving low
density and/or low pressure, and good resolution for smooth and discontinuous

indirect control of the environment via quantum measurements on quantum probes

ergodic theory for Riemann surface laminations, with an emphasis on singular
holomorphic foliations by curves. The central notions of these developments are
leafwise Poincar\'e metric, directed positive harmonic currents, multiplicative
cocycles and Lyapunov exponents. We deal with various ergodic theorems for such
laminations: Random and Operator Ergodic Theorems, (Geometric) Birkhoff Ergodic
Theorems, Oseledec Multiplicative Ergodic Theorem and Unique Ergodicity
Theorems. Applications of these theorems are also given. In particular, we
define and study the canonical Lyapunov exponents for a large family of
singular holomorphic foliations on compact projective surfaces. Topological and
algebro-geometric interpretations of these characteristic numbers are also
treated.
  These results highlight the strong similarity as well as the fundamental
differences between the ergodic theory of maps and that of Riemann surface
laminations. Most of the results reported here are known. However, sufficient
conditions for abstract heat diffusions to coincide with the leafwise heat
diffusions (Subsection 5.2) are new ones.

rates (CFRs): comparing a large-scale study from China (17 Feb) with early
reports from Italy (9 Mar), we find that CFRs are lower in Italy for every age
group, but higher overall. This phenomenon is explained by a stark difference
in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating
example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these
can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming a
coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We
curate an age-stratified CFR dataset with >750k cases and conduct a case study,
investigating total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between
different countries and at different points in time. This allows us to separate
age-related effects from others unrelated to age and facilitates a more
transparent comparison of CFRs across countries at different stages of the
Covid-19 pandemic. Using longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign
reversal of the direct causal effect in mid-March which temporally aligns with
the reported collapse of the healthcare system in parts of the country.
Moreover, we find that direct and indirect effects across 132 pairs of
countries are only weakly correlated, suggesting that a country's policy and
case demographic may be largely unrelated. We point out limitations and
extensions for future work, and, finally, discuss the role of causal reasoning
in the broader context of using AI to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.

industrial applications. One form of such damage is linked to H clustering, for
which the atomic origin remains contended, particularly for non-hydride forming
metals. In this work, we systematically studied H clustering behavior in bcc
metals represented by W, Fe, Mo, and Cr, combining first-principles
calculations, atomistic and Monte Carlo simulations. H clustering has been
shown to be energetically favorable, and can be strongly facilitated by
anisotropic stress field, dominated by the tensile component along one of the
<001> crystalline directions. We showed that the stress effect can be well
predicted by the continuum model based on H formation volume tensor, and that H
clustering is thermodynamically possible at edge dislocations, evidenced by
nanohydride formation at rather low levels of H concentration. Moreover,
anisotropy in the stress effect is well reflected in nanohydride morphology
around dislocations, with nanohydride growth occurring in the form of thin
platelet structures that maximize one <001> tension. In particular, the <001>
type edge dislocation, with the <001> tensile component maximized, has been
shown to be highly effective in facilitating H aggregation, thus expected to
play an important role in H clustering in bcc metals, in close agreement with
recent experimental observations. This work explicitly and quantitatively
clarifies the anisotropic nature of stress effect on H energetics and H
clustering behaviors, offering mechanistic insights critical towards
understanding H-induced damages in metals.

distributes gradient computations across worker machines, need to overcome two
limitations: delays caused by slow running machines called 'stragglers', and
communication overheads. Recently, Ye and Abbe [ICML 2018] proposed a
coding-theoretic paradigm to characterize a fundamental trade-off between
computation load per worker, communication overhead per worker, and straggler
tolerance. However, their proposed coding schemes suffer from heavy decoding
complexity and poor numerical stability. In this paper, we develop a
communication-efficient gradient coding framework to overcome these drawbacks.
Our proposed framework enables using any linear code to design the encoding and
decoding functions. When a particular code is used in this framework, its
block-length determines the computation load, dimension determines the
communication overhead, and minimum distance determines the straggler
tolerance. The flexibility of choosing a code allows us to gracefully trade-off
the straggler threshold and communication overhead for smaller decoding
complexity and higher numerical stability. Further, we show that using a
maximum distance separable (MDS) code generated by a random Gaussian matrix in
our framework yields a gradient code that is optimal with respect to the
trade-off and, in addition, satisfies stronger guarantees on numerical
stability as compared to the previously proposed schemes. Finally, we evaluate
our proposed framework on Amazon EC2 and demonstrate that it reduces the
average iteration time by 16% as compared to prior gradient coding schemes.

typical mixtures, this approach admits a significantly smaller memory increase

measurements of time delay have been conducted on astronomical scales. It was
asserted in 2010 that gravitational wave detectors on Earth could be used to
measure Shapiro delay on a terrestrial scale via massive rotating systems.
Building on that work, we consider how measurements of Shapiro delay can be
made using next-generation gravitational wave detectors. We perform an analysis
for measuring Shapiro delay with the next-generation gravitational wave
detectors Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope to determine how precisely the
effect can be measured. Using a rotating mass unit design, we find that Cosmic
Explorer and Einstein Telescope can measure the Shapiro delay signal with
amplitude signal to noise ratios upwards of $\sim28 $ and $\sim43$ in 1 year of
integration time, respectively. By measuring Shapiro delay with this technique,
next-generation interferometers will allow for terrestrial measurements of

two stars is $q_s = 0.289\pm 0.011$, and their projected separation is $s_s =

is $s_p = 2.2\pm 0.8\,$AU. For this lens system to have stable orbits, the
three-dimensional separation of either the primary and secondary stars or the
planet and primary star must be much larger than that these projected
separations. Since we do not know which is the case, the system could include
either a circumbinary or a circumstellar planet. Because there is no
measurement of the microlensing parallax effect or lens system brightness, we
can only make a rough Bayesian estimate of the lens system masses and
brightness. We find host star and planet masses of $M_{L1} =
0.35^{+0.30}_{-0.20}\,M_\odot$, $M_{L2} = 0.10^{+0.09}_{-0.06}\,M_\odot$, and
$m_p = 144^{+126}_{-82}\,M_\oplus$, and the $K$-band magnitude of the combined
brightness of the host stars is $K_L = 19.7^{+0.7}_{-1.0}$. The separation
between the lens and source system will be $\sim 90\,$mas in mid-2020, so it

states when their phase angular velocity fulills the synchronisation condition,
i.e. at the threshold of superradiance. The presence of these stationary clouds
at the linear level is intimately linked to the existence of Kerr black holes
with synchronised hair at the non-linear level. These configurations are very
similar to the atomic orbitals of the electron in a hydrogen atom. They can be
labeled by four quantum numbers: $n$, the number of nodes in the radial
direction; $\ell$, the orbital angular momentum; $j$, the total angular
momentum; and $m_j$, the azimuthal total angular momentum. These synchronised
configurations are solely allowed for particular values of the black hole's
mass, angular momentum and electric charge. Such quantization results in an
existence surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of Kerr-Newman black
holes. The phenomenology of stationary scalar clouds has been widely addressed
over the last years. However, there is a gap in the literature concerning their
vector cousins. Following the separability of the Proca equation in
Kerr(-Newman) spacetime, this work explores and compares scalar and vector
stationary clouds around Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes, extending previous
research.

secondary goal and very relevant for the high-quality time series that TESS
will make during its two year all-sky survey. Using TESS for asteroseismology
introduces strong timing requirements, especially for coherent oscillators.
Although the internal clock on board TESS is precise in its own time, it might
have a constant drift and will thus need calibration, or offsets might
inadvertently be introduced. Here we present simultaneously ground- and
space-based observations of primary eclipses of several binary systems in the
Southern ecliptic hemisphere, used to verify the reliability of the TESS
timestamps. From twelve contemporaneous TESS/ground observations we determined
a time offset equal to 5.8 +/- 2.5 sec, in the sense that the Barycentric time
measured by TESS is ahead of real time. The offset is consistent with zero at
2.3-sigma level. In addition, we used 405 individually measured mid-eclipse
times of 26 eclipsing binary stars observed solely by TESS to test the
existence of a potential drift with a monotonic growth (or decay) affecting the
observations of all stars. We find a drift corresponding to sigma_drift = 0.009
+/- 0.015 sec/day. We find that the measured offset is of a size that will not
become an issue for comparing ground-based and space data for coherent
oscillations for most of the targets observed with TESS.

promising observational probe of the early universe. Current- and
next-generation radio interferometers such as the Hydrogen Epoch of
Reionization Array (HERA) and Square Kilometre Array (SKA) are projected to
measure the 21 cm auto power spectrum from the EoR. Another observational
signal of this era is the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) signal in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB), which will be observed by the upcoming Simons
Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 experiments. The 21 cm signal and the contribution
to the kSZ from the EoR are expected to be anti-correlated, the former coming
from regions of neutral gas in the intergalactic medium and the latter coming
from ionized regions. However, the naive cross-correlation between the kSZ and
21 cm maps suffers from a cancellation that occurs because ionized regions are
equally likely to be moving toward or away from the observer and so there is no
net correlation with the 21 cm signal. We present here an investigation of the
21 cm-kSZ-kSZ bispectrum, which should not suffer the same cancellation as the
simple two-point cross-correlation. We show that there is a significant and
non-vanishing signal that is sensitive to the reionization history, suggesting
the statistic may be used to confirm or infer the ionization fraction as a
function of redshift. In the absence of foreground contamination, we forecast
that this signal is detectable at high statistical significance with HERA and
SO. The bispectrum we study suffers from the fact that the kSZ signal is
sensitive only to Fourier modes with long-wavelength line-of-sight components,
which are generally lost in the 21 cm data sets owing to foreground
contamination. We discuss possible strategies for alleviating this
contamination, including an alternative four-point statistic that may help
circumvent this issue.

exponentially small in the driving frequency. Recently, the exponential
suppression of heating has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold
atoms, realizing a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an
unbounded spectrum and, hence, is beyond the reach of previous theoretical
approaches. Here, we study this model with two semiclassical approaches valid,
respectively, at large and weak interaction strengths. In both limits, we
compute the heating rates by studying the statistical probability to encounter
a many-body resonance, and obtain a quantitative agreement with the exact
diagonalization of the quantum model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance

dust-correction approach that uses empirical relationships between infrared

galaxy formation with a simple -- but self-consistent -- dust model and use it
to jointly fit high-$z$ rest-UV luminosity functions (LFs) and colour-magnitude
relations ($M_{\mathrm{UV}}$-$\beta$). In doing so, we find that UV colours
evolve with redshift (at fixed UV magnitude), as suggested by observations,
even in cases without underlying evolution in dust production, destruction,
absorption, or geometry. The observed evolution in our model arises due to the
reduction in the mean stellar age and rise in specific star formation rates
with increasing $z$. The UV extinction, $A_{\mathrm{UV}}$, evolves similarly
with redshift, though we find a systematically shallower relation between
$A_{\mathrm{UV}}$ and $M_{\mathrm{UV}}$ than that predicted by IRX-$\beta$
relationships derived from $z \sim 3$ galaxy samples. Finally, assuming that
high $1600 \r{A}$ transmission ($\gtrsim 0.6$) is a reliable LAE indicator,
modest scatter in the effective dust surface density of galaxies can explain
the evolution both in $M_{\mathrm{UV}}$-$\beta$ and LAE fractions. These

understand the physical properties involved in the leakage of LyC photons, we
investigate the connection between the HI covering fraction, HI velocity width,
the Lyman alpha (LyA) properties and escape of LyC photons in a sample of 22
star-forming galaxies including 13 LCEs. We fit the stellar continua, dust
attenuation, and absorption lines between 920 and 1300 A to extract the HI
covering fractions and dust attenuation. Additionally, we measure the HI
velocity widths of the optically thick Lyman series and derive the LyA
equivalent widths (EW), escape fractions (fesc), peak velocities and fluxes at
the minimum of the LyA profiles. Overall, we highlight strong correlations
between the presence of low HI covering fractions and (1) low LyA peak
velocities; (2) more flux at the profile minimum; and (3) larger EW(LyA),
fesc(LyA), and fesc(LyC). Hence, low column density channels are crucial ISM
ingredients for the leakage of LyC and LyA photons. Additionally, galaxies with
narrower HI absorption velocity widths have higher LyA equivalent widths,
larger LyA escape fractions, and lower LyA peak velocity separations. This
suggests that these galaxies have low HI column density. Finally, we find that
dust regulates the amount of LyA and LyC radiation that actually escapes the
ISM. Overall, the ISM porosity is one origin of strong LyA emission and enables
the escape of ionizing photons in low-z leakers. However, this is not enough to
explain the largest fesc(LyC) observed, which indicates that the most extreme
LCEs are likely density-bounded along all lines of sight to the observer.
Overall, the neutral gas porosity constrains a lower limit to the escape
fraction of LyC and LyA photons, providing a key estimator of the leakage of
ionizing photons.

neutron-rich nuclear matter, especially its symmetry energy term, compared to
what people have already learned from analyzing the GW170817 and NICER data.
While the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) inferred from the three data
sets are approximately the same, the corresponding high-density symmetry
energies at densities above about $2\rho_0$ are very different, indicating that
the radii of massive NSs carry reliable information about the high-density
behavior of nuclear symmetry energy with little influence from the remaining
uncertainties of the SNM EOS.

considers neutrino production in the jet through interactions with photons from
a weak broad line region; (iii) a proton synchrotron model, where high-energy
protons in the jet produce $\gamma$-rays via synchrotron; and (iv) an
intergalactic cascade scenario, where neutrinos are produced in the
intergalactic medium by interactions of a high-energy cosmic-ray beam escaping
the jet. The Poisson probability to detect one muon neutrino in ten years from

high X-ray flux-state period following the neutrino detection is $0.06\%$,

T$_C$ and a simple crystal structure; yet there exists little information from
ARPES about the electronic properties of this model system. Here we present an
ARPES study of doping-, temperature-, and momentum-dependent systematics of
near-nodal dispersion anomalies in Hg1201. The data reveal a hierarchy of three
distinct energy scales -a sub-gap low-energy kink, an intermediate-energy kink
near 55 meV, and a peak-dip-hump structure. The first two features are
attributed to the coupling of electrons to Ba-derived optical phonons and
in-plane bond-stretching phonons, respectively. The nodal peak-dip-hump
structure appears to have a common doping-dependence in several single-layer
cuprates, and is interpreted as a manifestation of pseudogap physics at the
node. These results establish several universal phenomena, both in terms of
connecting multiple experimental techniques for a single material, and in terms
of connecting comparable spectral features in multiple structurally similar
cuprates.

the exact and the mean-field methods, the local and string order parameters on

found a topological phase with oscillating string order with a period of four
lattice spacings, not reported before for this model. A detailed analysis of

with additional $U(1)$ symmetry brings about, in agreement with the
Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem and its extensions, plateaux of magnetization and
some additional conserving quantities. We have shown that in the $XYZ$ chain,
where the plateaux are smeared, the robust oscillating string order parameter
is continuously connected to its $XXZ$ limit. Also, the non-trivial winding
number and zero-energy localized Majorana edge states, as additional attributes
of topological order, are robust in that phase, even off the line of $U(1)$
symmetry.

multiple facets of current understanding of muscle, as a rheological material

work loops emerge by splicing together force versus length loops corresponding
to different constant stimuli. Using published muscle datasets and a detailed
sarcomere model, we find that the hypothesis accurately predicts work loops and
helps understand them in terms of rheological behaviors measured at

social services catering to users with varied levels of need. In the absence of
price discrimination and centralized admission, the provider relies on sharing
information about wait times to improve welfare. We consider a stylized model
with heterogeneous users who differ in their private outside options: low-need
users have an acceptable outside option to the social service, whereas
high-need users have no viable outside option. Upon arrival, a user decides to
wait for the service by joining an unobservable first-come-first-serve queue,
or leave and seek her outside option. To reduce congestion and improve social
outcomes, the service provider seeks to persuade more low-need users to avail
their outside option, and thus better serve high-need users. We characterize
the Pareto-optimal signaling mechanisms and compare their welfare outcomes
against several benchmarks. We show that if either type is the overwhelming
majority of the population, information design does not provide improvement
over sharing full information or no information. On the other hand, when the
population is a mixture of the two types, information design not only Pareto
dominates full-information and no-information mechanisms, in some regimes it
also achieves the same welfare as the ""first-best"", i.e., the Pareto-optimal
centralized admission policy with knowledge of users' types.

that of the NIR pacemaker is 40 min. Their reality as derived from observed

evidence for a star that revolves around the BH of Sgr A* in a slightly
elliptical precessing orbit, at a distance of 3-3.5 Schwarzschild radii of the
BH. The period of the X-ray pacemaker, which is not a periodicity of the flare
occurrences themselves, is the epicyclic period of the star orbital motion.
This is the time interval between 2 successive passages of the star through the
peri-center of its orbit. The NIR pacemaker period is the sidereal binary
period of the star revolution. The origin of the X-ray flares is in episodes of
intense mass loss from the star that occur preferably near the pericenter phase
of the binary revolution. The NIR flares originate or are triggered by
processes that are internal to the star. The radiation emitted in the direction
of Earth is slightly modulated by the changing aspect ratio of the two
components of the BH\star binary to the line of sight from Earth at the
sidereal binary frequency.

the three steps of Reconstruction, Computation, and Quantization (RCQ). Unlike
Mutual-Information-Maximization Quantized Belief Propagation (MIM-QBP), RCQ can
approximate either belief propagation or Min-Sum decoding. One problem faced by
MIM-QBP decoder is that it cannot work well when the fraction of degree-2
variable nodes is large. However, sometimes a large fraction of degree-2
variable nodes is necessary for a fast encoding structure, as seen in the IEEE
802.11 standard and the DVB-S2 standard. In contrast, the proposed RCQ decoder
may be applied to any off-the-shelf LDPC code, including those with a large
fraction of degree-2 variable nodes.Our simulations show that a 4-bit Min-Sum
RCQ decoder delivers frame error rate (FER) performance around 0.1dB of
full-precision belief propagation (BP) for the IEEE 802.11 standard LDPC code
in the low SNR region.The RCQ decoder actually outperforms full-precision BP in
the high SNR region because it overcomes elementary trapping sets that create
an error floor under BP decoding. This paper also introduces Hierarchical
Dynamic Quantization (HDQ) to design the non-uniform quantizers required by RCQ
decoders. HDQ is a low-complexity design technique that is slightly
sub-optimal. Simulation results comparing HDQ and an optimal quantizer on the
symmetric binary-input memoryless additive white Gaussian noise channel show a
loss in mutual information between these two quantizers of less than $10^{-6}$
bits, which is negligible for practical applications.

psychology. Infodemic of misinformation is an important secondary crisis
associated to the pandemic. Infodemics can amplify the real negative
consequences of the pandemic in different dimensions: social, economic and even
sanitary. For instance, infodemics can lead to hatred between population groups
that fragment the society influencing its response or result in negative habits
that help the pandemic propagate. On the contrary, reliable and trustful
information along with messages of hope and solidarity can be used to control
the pandemic, build safety nets and help promote resilience. We propose the
foundation of a framework to characterize leaders in Twitter based on the
analysis of the social graph derived from the activity in this social network.
Centrality metrics are used to characterize the topology of the network and the
nodes as potential leaders. These metrics are compared with the user popularity
metrics managed by Twitter. We then assess the resulting topology of clusters
of leaders visually. We propose this tool to be the basis for a system to
detect and empower users with a positive influence in the collective behavior
of the network and the propagation of information.

statistics seem to be the raw confirmed case and case fatalities counts.
Focusing on Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, we look at how these two
values could be put in perspective to reflect the dynamics of the virus spread.
In particular, we find that merely considering the confirmed case counts would
be very misleading. The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction
of confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region)
generally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region)
15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing
trend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not
representative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort.
This we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests
and for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model
parameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed
case counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also
fatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone
to be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the
national level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are
taking place at the regional level. These findings are based on the official
data of total death counts up to 15th April 2020 released by ISTAT and up to
10th May 2020 for the number of cases. In this work we do not fit models but we
rather investigate whether this task is possible at all. This work also informs
about a new tool to collect and harmonize official statistics coming from
different sources in the form of a package for the R statistical environment

iteratively, starting with a strong clustering-based diarization. We also
extend the TS-VAD approach to the multi-microphone case using a simple

being closer or farther than $D$. This property offers a powerful mechanism to
balance accuracy and latency. Given a strict time budget, Bi3D can detect
objects closer than a given distance in as little as a few milliseconds, or
estimate depth with arbitrarily coarse quantization, with complexity linear
with the number of quantization levels. Bi3D can also use the allotted

finds application from statistics to robotics. The goal is to find an
approximate probability density function (PDF) from a chosen family that is in
some sense 'closest' to the full Bayesian posterior. Closeness is typically
defined through the selection of an appropriate loss functional such as the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. In this paper, we explore a new formulation
of variational inference by exploiting the fact that (most) PDFs are members of
a Bayesian Hilbert space under careful definitions of vector addition, scalar
multiplication and an inner product. We show that, under the right conditions,
variational inference based on KL divergence can amount to iterative
projection, in the Euclidean sense, of the Bayesian posterior onto a subspace
corresponding to the selected approximation family. We work through the details
of this general framework for the specific case of the Gaussian approximation
family and show the equivalence to another Gaussian variational inference
approach. We furthermore discuss the implications for systems that exhibit
sparsity, which is handled naturally in Bayesian space, and give an example of
a high-dimensional robotic state estimation problem that can be handled as a
result. We provide some preliminary examples of how the approach could be
applied to non-Gaussian inference and discuss the limitations of the approach
in detail to encourage follow-on work along these lines.

narrow and elongate in convergent extension movements due to anisotropies in
external forces or in internal cell-generated forces. However, the mechanisms
that allow or prevent tissue reorganization, especially in the presence of
strongly anisotropic forces, remain unclear. We study this question in the
converging and extending Drosophila germband epithelium, which displays planar
polarized myosin II and experiences anisotropic forces from neighboring
tissues, and we show that in contrast to isotropic tissues, cell shape alone is
not sufficient to predict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement. From
theoretical considerations and vertex model simulations, we predict that in
anisotropic tissues two experimentally accessible metrics of cell patterns, the
cell shape index and a cell alignment index, are required to determine whether
an anisotropic tissue is in a solid-like or fluid-like state. We show that
changes in cell shape and alignment over time in the Drosophila germband
predict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement in both wild-type and snail twist
mutant embryos, where our theoretical prediction is further improved when we
also account for cell packing disorder. These findings suggest that convergent
extension is associated with a transition to more fluid-like tissue behavior,
which may help accommodate tissue shape changes during rapid developmental
events.

numbers of quark colors and flavors.) While the large-$N_c$ helicity evolution
involves gluons only, the large-$N_c \& N_f$ evolution includes contributions
from quarks as well. We find that adding quarks to the evolution makes quark
helicity distribution oscillate as a function of $x$. Our numerical results in
the large-$N_c \& N_f$ limit lead to the $x$-dependence of the flavor-singlet
quark helicity distribution which is well-approximated by \begin{align} \Delta
\Sigma (x, Q^2)\bigg|_{\mbox{large-}N_c \& N_f} \sim \left( \frac{1}{x}

$\alpha_h^q (N_f=0) = (4/\sqrt{3}) \sqrt{\alpha_s N_c/(2 \pi)}$ obtained

average $\left<T_\mu{}_\nu\right>$ of the stress-energy-momentum tensor of an
arbitrarily coupled massless scalar field in one-dimensional boxes in flat
spacetime. The study addresses a box with periodic boundary condition (a
circle) and boxes with reflecting edges (with Dirichlet's or Neumann's boundary
conditions at the endpoints). The expressions for $\left<T^\mu{}^\nu\right>$
are obtained from finite-temperature Green functions. In an appendix, in order
to control divergences typical of two dimensions, these Green functions are
calculated for related backgrounds with arbitrary number of dimensions and for
scalar fields of arbitrary mass, and specialized in the text to two dimensions
and for massless fields. The ambiguities arise due to the presence in
$\left<T^\mu{}^\nu\right>$ of double series that are not absolutely convergent.
The order in which the two associated summations are evaluated matters, leading
to two different thermodynamics for each type of box. In the case of a circle,
it is shown that the ambiguity corresponds to the classic controversy in the
literature whether or not zero mode contributions should be taken into account
in computations of partition functions. In the case of boxes with reflecting
edges, it results that one of the thermodynamics corresponds to a total energy
(obtained by integrating the non homogeneous energy density over space) that
does not depend on the curvature coupling parameter $\xi$ as expected; whereas
the other thermodynamics curiously corresponds to a total energy that does
depend on $\xi$. Thermodynamic requirements (such as local and global
stability) and their restrictions to the values of $\xi$ are considered.

semi-supervised approach that regularizes the model through Local
Distributional Smoothness. With that, adversarial perturbations are added to
the inputs making the posterior distribution more consistent. Therefore,
entropy-based Active Learning becomes robust by querying more informative
samples without requiring additional components. The first set of experiments
studies the impact of an adapted VAT for joint-NLU tasks within low labeled
data regimes. The second set shows the effect of VirAAL in an Active Learning
(AL) process. Results demonstrate that VAT is robust even on multi-task
training, where the adversarial noise is computed from multiple loss functions.
Substantial improvements are observed with entropy-based AL with VirAAL for
querying data to annotate. VirAAL is an inexpensive method in terms of AL
computation with a positive impact on data sampling. Furthermore, VirAAL
decreases annotations in AL up to 80% and shows improvements over existing data
augmentation methods. The code is publicly available.

the success of scaling laws in motivating models which match plateau properties

increasing the number of parameters usually leads to better quality. The two
easiest ways to increase the number of parameters is to increase the size of
the network, e.g. width, or to train a deep ensemble; both approaches improve
the performance in practice. In this work, we consider a fixed memory budget
setting, and investigate, what is more effective: to train a single wide
network, or to perform a memory split -- to train an ensemble of several
thinner networks, with the same total number of parameters? We find that, for
large enough budgets, the number of networks in the ensemble, corresponding to
the optimal memory split, is usually larger than one. Interestingly, this
effect holds for the commonly used sizes of the standard architectures. For
example, one WideResNet-28-10 achieves significantly worse test accuracy on
CIFAR-100 than an ensemble of sixteen thinner WideResNets: 80.6% and 82.52%
correspondingly. We call the described effect the Memory Split Advantage and

the desired QoS to all mobile users and traffic types still keeping costs under

for applications in sunlight-driven water splitting. Several studies have shown
that its photocatalytic activity is greatly enhanced by high concentrations of
Mo and W dopants. In the present work, we performed \textit{ab initio}
calculations to assess the most favorable relative position between Mo-related
pairs in BiVO$_4$. Surprisingly, we verify that the lowest energy configuration
for Mo$_{\text{V}}$ pairwise defects in BiVO$_4$ occurs on nearest-neighbor

crystal lattice. Similar results were observed for W$_{\text{V}}$ defect pairs
in W-doped BiVO$_4$. We show that the origin of this effect lies in a favorable
hybridization between the atomic orbitals of the impurities that is only
verified when they are closest to each other, resulting in an enthalpy gain
that overcomes the repulsive components of the pair formation energy. As a
consequence, Mo and/or W doped BiVO$_4$ are likely to present donor-donor
defect complexes, which is an outcome that can be applied in experimental
approaches for improving the photocatalytic activity of these metal oxides.

characterized by a dominance of 0NN particles ($F0$ phase). However, in most
part of the phase diagram these fluid ($F$) phases are indistinguishable.
Discontinuous transitions are observed between all the four phases, yielding
several coexistence surfaces in the system, among which a fluid-fluid and a
solid-solid demixing surface. The former one is limited by a line of critical
points and a line of triple points (where the phases $RF$-$F0$-$S2$ coexist),
both meeting at a special point, after which the fluid-fluid coexistence
becomes metastable. Another line of triple points is found, connecting the

surface is also observed meeting the $F$-$S1$ coexistence one at a line of
tricritical points. Furthermore, a thermodynamic anomaly characterized by
minima in isobaric curves of the total density of particles is found, yielding
three surfaces of minimal density in the activity space, depending on which
activity is kept fixed during its calculation.

Linguistic Probing Tasks) generalizable to standard pre-trained V+L models,
aiming to decipher the inner workings of multimodal pre-training (e.g., the
implicit knowledge garnered in individual attention heads, the inherent
cross-modal alignment learned through contextualized multimodal embeddings).
Through extensive analysis of each archetypal model architecture via these
probing tasks, our key observations are: (i) Pre-trained models exhibit a
propensity for attending over text rather than images during inference. (ii)
There exists a subset of attention heads that are tailored for capturing
cross-modal interactions. (iii) Learned attention matrix in pre-trained models
demonstrates patterns coherent with the latent alignment between image regions
and textual words. (iv) Plotted attention patterns reveal
visually-interpretable relations among image regions. (v) Pure linguistic
knowledge is also effectively encoded in the attention heads. These are
valuable insights serving to guide future work towards designing better model
architecture and objectives for multimodal pre-training.

that $\frac{adim(G)}{bdim(G)}$ and $\frac{bdim(G)}{dim(G)}$ can both be
arbitrarily large, where $dim(G)$ denotes the metric dimension of $G$. We also
examine the effect of vertex deletion on the adjacency dimension and the

directions correlated with energy) structure is reported for ultra-high energy
cosmic ray (UHECR) energies above 10$^{19}$ eV using seven years of data from
the Telescope Array (TA) surface detector and updated to 10 years. Previous
energy-position correlation studies have made assumptions regarding magnetic
field shapes and strength, and UHECR composition. Here the assumption tested is
that, since the supergalactic plane is a fit to the average matter density of
the local Large Scale Structure (LSS), UHECR sources and intervening
extragalactic magnetic fields are correlated with this plane. This
supergalactic deflection hypothesis is tested by the entire field-of-view (FOV)
behavior of the strength of intermediate-scale energy-angle correlations. These
multiplets are measured in spherical cap section bins (wedges) of the FOV to
account for coherent and random magnetic fields. The structure found is
consistent with supergalactic deflection, the previously published energy
spectrum anisotropy results of TA (the hotspot and coldspot), and toy-model
simulations of a supergalactic magnetic sheet. The seven year data post-trial
significance of this supergalactic structure of multiplets appearing by chance,
on an isotropic sky, is found by Monte Carlo simulation to be 4.2$\sigma$. The
ten years of data post-trial significance is 4.1$\sigma$. Furthermore, the
starburst galaxy M82 is shown to be a possible source of the TA Hotspot, and an
estimate of the supergalactic magnetic field using UHECR measurements is
presented.

illustrate the utility of our approach, we focus on the TG gas confined to an

nonequilibrium thermodynamics of the TG gas and obtain exact and
computationally tractable expressions---in terms of Fredholm determinants---for
the mean work, the work probability distribution function, the nonadiabaticity

TG gas, our results for the mean work and the nonadiabaticity parameter reduce
to those derived previously using an alternative approach. We next propose to
use periodic modulation of the trap frequency in order to drive the system to
highly non-equilibrium states by taking advantage of the phenomenon of
parametric resonance. Under such driving protocol, the nonadiabaticity
parameter may reach large values, which indicates a large amount of
irreversible work being done on the system as compared to sudden quench
protocols considered previously. This scenario is realizable in ultracold atom

representation. The second approach directly projects the QCLE onto the Floquet
adiabatic basis. Both approaches yield a form which is similar to the usual
QCLE with two modifications: 1. The electronic degrees of freedom are expanded
to infinite dimension. 2. The nuclear motion follows Floquet quasi-energy
surfaces. However, the second approach includes an additional cross derivative
force due to the dual dependence on time and nuclear motion of the Floquet
adiabatic states. Our analysis and numerical tests indicate that this cross
derivative force is a factitious artifact, suggesting that one cannot safely
exchange the order of Floquet state projection with adiabatic transformation.
Our results are in accord with similar findings by Izmaylov et al., who found
that transforming to the adiabatic representation must always be the last

mortality reductions between screening and control arms. These mortality
reductions result from a combination of the screening regimen, screening
technology and the effect of the early, screening-induced, treatment. This
motivates addressing these different aspects separately. Here we are interested
in the causal effect of early versus delayed treatments on cancer mortality
among the screening-detectable subgroup, which under certain assumptions is
estimable from conventional randomized screening trial using instrumental
variable type methods. To define the causal effect of interest, we formulate a
simplified structural multi-state model for screening trials, based on a
hypothetical intervention trial where screening detected individuals would be
randomized into early versus delayed treatments. The cancer-specific mortality
reductions after screening detection are quantified by a cause-specific hazard
ratio. For this, we propose two estimators, based on an estimating equation and
a likelihood expression. The methods extend existing instrumental variable
methods for time-to-event and competing risks outcomes to time-dependent
intermediate variables. Using the multi-state model as the basis of a data

boiling occur in the LB simulations? For instance, the existing LB studies
showed that the boiling on a hydrophobic surface begins at a lower wall
superheat than that on a hydrophilic surface, which qualitatively agrees well
with experimental studies, but no one has yet explained how this phenomenon
appears in the LB simulations and what happened in the simulations after
changing the wettability of the heating surface. In this paper, the LB boiling
mechanism is revealed by analyzing boiling on a flat surface with mixed
wettability and boiling on a structured surface with homogeneous wettability.
Through a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, when the same wall
superheat is applied, in the LB boiling simulations the fluid density near the
heating surface decreases faster on a hydrophobic surface than that on a
hydrophilic surface. Accordingly, a lower wall superheat can induce the phase
transition from liquid to vapor on a hydrophobic surface than that on a
hydrophilic surface. Furthermore, a similar theoretical analysis shows that the
fluid density decreases fastest at concave corners in the case of a structured
surface with homogeneous wettability, which explains why vapor bubbles are
nucleated at concave corners in the LB simulations of boiling on structured
surfaces.

stemming from a globalizing semiconductor supply chain and increased
third-party IP (intellectual property) usage. Trojan detection is of paramount
importance for ensuring systems with confidentiality, integrity, and
availability. Existing methods for hardware Trojan detection in FPGA (field
programmable gate array) devices include test-time methods, pre-implementation
methods, and run-time methods. The first two methods provide effective ways of
detecting some Trojans; however, Trojans may be specifically designed to avoid
detection at test-time or before implementation making run-time detection a
more attractive option. Run-time detection and removal of Trojans is highly
desirable due to the wide range of critical systems which are deployed on FPGAs
and may be difficult or costly to remove from operation. Many parallels can be
drawn between hardware and natural systems, and one example creates an analogy
between hardware attacks and biological attacks. We propose a
CRISPR-Cas-inspired (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats)
method for detecting hardware Trojans in FPGAs. The fundamental concepts of the
Type 1-E CRISPR-Cas mechanism are discussed and simulated to predict the flow
of genetic information through this biological system. The basic structure of
this system is utilized to propose a novel run-time Trojan detection method
titled CADEFT (CRISPR-Cas-based Algorithm for DEtection of FPGA Trojans).
Different levels of FPGA application design flow are explored, and CADEFT is
proposed for realization at the bitstream level to monitor the configuration
bitstream and the run-time properties of the FPGA. The flexibility of CADEFT
originates in the CRISPR-Cas mechanism's ability to recognize similar albeit

novel learning-based approach to reconstruct an HDR image by recovering the

deep learning-based methods apply the same convolutional filters on

large number of images for image inpainting task and then fine-tune it on HDR
reconstruction. Since most of the HDR examples contain smooth regions that are
simple to reconstruct, we propose a sampling strategy to select challenging
training patches during the HDR fine-tuning stage. We demonstrate through

quantum phase transition between a topological state, called a $\mathbb{Z}_2$
quantum spin liquid, and a conventional superfluid using large-scale quantum
Monte Carlo simulations. Our results show that the universal conductivity at
the quantum critical point becomes a simple fraction of its value at the
conventional insulator-to-superfluid transition. Moreover, a dynamically
self-dual optical conductivity emerges at low temperatures above the transition
point, indicating the presence of the elusive vison particles. Our study opens
the door for the experimental detection of anyons in a broader regime, and has
ramifications in the study of quantum materials, programmable quantum

accretion disc emission. Here we focus on an X-ray-bright type 2 AGN, NGC 2110,
and utilize 2-20 keV X-ray variation monitored by MAXI to trace disc emission,
instead of optical-UV variation. Comparing it with light curves in the WISE
infrared (IR) W1 band ($\lambda = 3.4$ $\mu$m) and W2 band ($\lambda = 4.6$
$\mu$m) with cross-correlation analyses, we found candidates of the dust
reverberation time lag at $\sim60$ days, $\sim130$ days, and $\sim1250$ days
between the X-ray flux variation and those of the IR bands. By examining the
best-fitting X-ray and IR light curves with the derived time lags, we found
that the time lag of $\sim130$ days is most favoured. With this time lag, the
relation between the time lag and luminosity of NGC 2110 is consistent with
those in type 1 AGNs, suggesting that the dust reverberation in NGC 2110 mainly
originates in hot dust in the torus innermost region, the same as in type 1

deployable structures by exploring the transient dynamics under free
deployment, with the Miura-origami tube being selected as the object of study
because it possesses relatively simple geometry, exceptional kinematic
properties, and wide applications. In detail, a preliminary free deployment
test is performed, which indicates that the transient oscillation in the
transverse direction is nonnegligible and the tube deployment is no longer a
single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) mechanism. Based on experimental observations,
four assumptions are made for modeling purposes, and a 2N-DOF dynamic model is
established for an N-cell Miura-origami tube to predict the transient
oscillations in both the deploying and the transverse directions. Employing the
settling times and the overshoot values as the transient dynamic indexes, a
comprehensive parameter study is then carried out. It reveals that both the
physical and geometrical parameters will significantly affect the transient
deploying dynamics, with some of the parameter dependence relationships being
counter-intuitive. The results show that the relationships between the
transient dynamic behaviors and the examined parameters are sometimes
contradictory in the deploying and the transverse directions, suggesting the

considerable attention due to its scalability to large datasets and neural
networks. However, several important questions remain unanswered, such as (i)
whether the Gaussian mechanism is an appropriate option for certifying
$\ell_2$-norm robustness, and (ii) whether there is an appropriate randomized
(smoothing) mechanism to certify $\ell_\infty$-norm robustness. To shed light
on these questions, we argue that the main difficulty is how to assess the
appropriateness of each randomized mechanism. In this paper, we propose a
generic framework that connects the existing frameworks in
\cite{lecuyer2018certified, li2019certified}, to assess randomized mechanisms.
Under our framework, for a randomized mechanism that can certify a certain
extent of robustness, we define the magnitude of its required additive noise as
the metric for assessing its appropriateness. We also prove lower bounds on
this metric for the $\ell_2$-norm and $\ell_\infty$-norm cases as the criteria
for assessment. Based on our framework, we assess the Gaussian and Exponential
mechanisms by comparing the magnitude of additive noise required by these
mechanisms and the lower bounds (criteria). We first conclude that the Gaussian
mechanism is indeed an appropriate option to certify $\ell_2$-norm robustness.
Surprisingly, we show that the Gaussian mechanism is also an appropriate option
for certifying $\ell_\infty$-norm robustness, instead of the Exponential
mechanism. Finally, we generalize our framework to $\ell_p$-norm for any

nebula: Frosty Leo. The observations were carried out in J, H and K' bands
using the new polarimeter POLICAN mounted on the 2.1m telescope of the
Guillermo Haro Astrophysical Observatory, Sonora, Mexico. The most prominent
result observed in the polarization maps is a large and well defined dusty
envelope (35\arcsec\ diameter in H-band). The polarization position angles in
the envelope are particularly well ordered and nearly parallel to the equator
of the nebula (seen in J and H bands). The nebula presents a known bipolar
outflow and the envelope completely wraps around it. Within the bipolar lobes,
we find high polarization levels ranging from $60\%$ (J band) to $90\%$ (K'
band) and the polarization angles trace a centrosymmetric pattern. We found the
remnants of superwind shells at the edges of the bipolar lobes and the duration
of this phase is around 600 yrs. The origin of polarization features in the
nebula is most likely due to a combination of single and multiple scattering.
Our results clearly demonstrate new structures that provide new hints on the
evolution of Frosty Leo from its previous asymptotic giant branch phase.

the popularity of different elements of culture is a product of two factors: a
random factor and a Qfactor, or talent. The latter is fixed for an individual

individuals can consistently produce high-impact work. They extract the
Q-factors for different scientists, writers, and movie makers from statistical
data on popularity of their work. However, in their article they reluctantly
state that there is little correlation between popularity and quality ratings

the data of the original Q-factor article and obtained a correlation between
the citation-based Q-factor and Nobel Prize winning of merely 0.19. I also
briefly review few other experiments that found a meager, sometimes even
negative, correlation between popularity and quality of cultural products. I
conclude that, if there is an ability associated with a high Q-factor it should
be more of a marketing ability than an ability to produce a higher quality

hypergraph on the vertex set $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. We establish a threshold
result for the existence of a spanning tree in $\mathcal{G}_{n,r,s}$,
restricting to $n$ satisfying the necessary divisibility conditions.
Specifically, we show that when $s\geq 5$, there is a positive constant
$\rho(s)$ such that for any $r\geq 2$, the probability that
$\mathcal{G}_{n,r,s}$ contains a spanning tree tends to 1 if $r > \rho(s)$, and
otherwise this probability tends to zero. The threshold value $\rho(s)$ grows
exponentially with $s$. As $\mathcal{G}_{n,r,s}$ is connected with probability
which tends to 1, this implies that when $r \leq \rho(s)$, most $r$-regular
$s$-uniform hypergraphs are connected but have no spanning tree. When $s=3,4$
we prove that $\mathcal{G}_{n,r,s}$ contains a spanning tree with probability
which tends to 1, for any $r\geq 2$. Our proof also provides the asymptotic
distribution of the number of spanning trees in $\mathcal{G}_{n,r,s}$ for all

known in the trivial case of 2-regular graphs, or for cubic graphs.

of indivisible goods among $n$ agents that have subadditive valuations over the
goods. We first consider the Nash social welfare as our objective and design a
polynomial-time algorithm that, in the value oracle model, finds an
$8n$-approximation to the Nash optimal allocation. Subadditive valuations
include XOS (fractionally subadditive) and submodular valuations as special
cases. Our result, even for the special case of submodular valuations, improves
upon the previously best known $O(n \log n)$-approximation ratio of Garg et al.
(2020).
  More generally, we study maximization of $p$-mean welfare. The $p$-mean
welfare is parameterized by an exponent term $p \in (-\infty, 1]$ and
encompasses a range of welfare functions, such as social welfare ($p = 1$),
Nash social welfare ($p \to 0$), and egalitarian welfare ($p \to -\infty$). We
give an algorithm that, for subadditive valuations and any given $p \in
(-\infty, 1]$, computes (in the value oracle model and in polynomial time) an
allocation with $p$-mean welfare at least $\frac{1}{8n}$ times the optimal.
  Further, we show that our approximation guarantees are essentially tight for
XOS and, hence, subadditive valuations. We adapt a result of Dobzinski et al.
(2010) to show that, under XOS valuations, an $O \left(n^{1-\varepsilon}
\right)$ approximation for the $p$-mean welfare for any $p \in (-\infty,1]$
(including the Nash social welfare) requires exponentially many value queries;
here, $\varepsilon>0$ is any fixed constant.

a moderate angle ($\alpha \leq 30^{\circ}$) to a uniform flow are investigated
experimentally and numerically, and a large experimental data set is provided.
The dynamics are shown to differ significantly from the zero-angle-of-attack
case, commonly called the inverted-flag configuration. Four distinct dynamical
regimes arise at finite angles: a small oscillation around a small-deflection
equilibrium (deformed regime), a small-amplitude flapping motion, a
large-amplitude flapping motion and a small oscillation around a
large-deflection equilibrium (deflected regime). The small-amplitude flapping
motion appears gradually as the flow speed is increased and is consistent with
a limit-cycle oscillation caused by the quasi-steady fluid forcing. The
large-amplitude flapping motion is observed to appear at a constant critical
flow speed that is independent of angle of attack. Its characteristics match
those of the large-amplitude vortex-induced vibration present at zero angle of
attack. The flow speed at which the plate enters the deflected regime decreases
linearly as the angle of attack is increased, causing the flapping motion to
disappear for angles of attack greater than $\alpha \approx 28^{\circ}$.
Finally, the effect of aspect ratio on the plate dynamics is considered, with
reduced aspect ratio plates being shown to lack sharp distinctions between
regimes.

we introduce a novel sample relation consistency (SRC) paradigm to effectively

consistency of individual predictions, our framework explicitly enforces the
consistency of semantic relation among different samples under perturbations,
encouraging the model to explore extra semantic information from unlabeled

difficult exercise and that a multilayer (ML) structure is suitable for such
fabrication only in a narrow parameter range. This parameter range is sought by
varying both the stoichiometric SiC barrier thickness and the Si-rich SiC well
thickness between 3 and 9 nm and comparing them to single layers (SL). The
samples processed for this investigation were deposited by plasma-enhanced
chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and subsequently subjected to thermal
annealing at 1000-1100${\deg}$C for crystal formation. Bulk information about
the entire sample area and depth were obtained by structural and optical
characterization methods: information about the mean Si NC size was determined
from grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements.
Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to gain insight into
the structure of the Si-C network, and spectrophotometry measurements were
performed to investigate the absorption coefficient and to estimate the bandgap
$E_{04}$. All measurements showed that the influence of the ML structure on the
Si NC size, on the Si-C network and on the absorption properties is subordinate
to the influence of the overall Si content in the samples, which we identified
as the key parameter for the structural and optical properties. We attribute
this behavior to interdiffusion of the barrier and well layers. Because the

Based on the established framework, we develop a MEC cache management mechanism
that consists of the MEC cache partition, video segment deletion, and MEC cache
space transfer. Then, a joint optimization algorithm that combines video
segment cache and transcoding in the MEC server and resource allocation is
proposed. In the algorithm, the clients' channel state and the playback status

priority, video segment presentation switch and continuous playback time.
Considering the above four factors, we develop a utility function model of

video segment cache and transcoding strategy and resource allocation strategy

decomposition's of S0 and spiral galaxies using SDSS images, we found that bars
are bluer in S0 galaxies compared to the spiral galaxies. Most of the S0s in
our sample have stellar masses $\sim L_{*}$ galaxies. The environment might
have played an important role as most of the S0s with bluer bars are in the
intermediate-density environment. The possibility of minor mergers and tidal
interactions which occurs frequently in the intermediate-density environment
might have caused either a bar to form and/or induce star formation in the
barred region of S0 galaxies. The underlying discs show the usual behaviour
being redder in S0s compared to spiral galaxies while the bulges are red and
old for both S0 and spiral galaxies. The finding of bluer bars in S0 galaxies
is a puzzling issue and poses an interesting question at numerical and
theoretical studies most of which shows that the bars are long-lived structures
with old stellar populations.

model: Given a network of $n$ nodes with each node having a clock value
$\delta(v) \in \{0,\ldots T-1\}$, the goal is to synchronize the clock values
of all nodes such that they have the same value in any round. As is standard in
clock synchronization, we assume \emph{arbitrary activations} for all nodes,
i.e., the nodes start their protocol at an arbitrary round (not limited to
$\{0,\ldots,T-1\}$). We give an asymptotically optimal algorithm that runs in
$4D + \Bigl\lfloor \frac{D}{\lfloor T/4 \rfloor} \Bigr \rfloor \cdot (T \mod 4)
= O(D)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of the network. Once all nodes are in
sync, they beep at the same round every $T$ rounds. The algorithm drastically
improves on the $O(T D)$-bound of [ACGL'13] (where $T$ is required to be at
least $4n$, so the bound is no better than $O(nD)$). Our algorithm is very
simple as nodes only have to maintain $3$ bits in addition to the $\lceil \log
T \rceil$ bits needed to maintain the clock. Furthermore we investigate the
complexity of \emph{self-stabilizing} solutions for the clock synchronization
problem: We first show lower bounds of $\Omega(\max\{T,n\})$ rounds on the
runtime and $\Omega(\log(\max\{T,n\}))$ bits of memory required for any such
protocol. Afterwards we present a protocol that runs in $O(\max\{T,n\})$ rounds
using at most $O(\log(\max\{T,n\}))$ bits at each node, which is asymptotically
optimal with regards to both, runtime and memory requirements.

stringy integrals, whose configuration spaces are the so-called binary

modeling of PCMO RRAM by drift diffusion (DD) in the presence of fixed oxygen
ion vacancy traps and self-heating (SH) in Technology Computer Aided Design
(TCAD) (but without oxygen ionic transport) was able to explain the
experimentally observed space charge limited conduction (SCLC) characteristics,
prior to resistive switching. Further, transient analysis using DD+SH model was
able to reproduce the experimentally observed fast current increase at ~100 ns
timescale, prior to resistive switching. However, a complete quantitative
transient current transport plus resistive switching model requires the
inclusion of ionic transport. We propose a Reaction-Drift (RD) model for oxygen
ion vacancy related trap density variation, which is combined with the DD+SH
model. Earlier we have shown that the Set transient consists of 3 stages and
Reset transient consists of 4 stages experimentally. In this work, the DD+SH+RD
model is able to reproduce the entire transient behavior over 10 ns - 1 s range
in timescale for both the Set and Reset operations for different applied biases
and ambient temperatures. Remarkably, a universal Reset experimental behavior,
log(I) is proportional to (m X log(t)) where m~-1/10 is reproduced in
simulations. This model is the first model for PCMO RRAMs to significantly
reproduce transient Set/Reset behavior. This model establishes the presence of
self-heating and ionic-drift limited resistive switching as primary physical

crystallization of stoichiometric SiC and Si-rich SiC using conventional rapid
thermal annealing (RTA) and nonequilibrium millisecond range flash lamp
annealing (FLA). The investigated Si$_x$C$_{1-x}$ films were prepared by
plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and annealed at temperatures from

effusion, Si and SiC NC growth, and SiC crystallinity. Both the Si content and
the choice of the annealing process affect the crystallization behavior. It is
shown that under certain conditions, FLA can be successfully utilized for the
formation of Si NC in a SiC matrix, which closely resembles Si NC in a SiC
matrix achieved by RTA. The samples must have excess Si, and the flash energy
should not exceed 40 J/cm$^2$ and 47 J/cm$^2$ for Si$_{0.63}$C$_{0.37}$ and
Si$_{0.77}$C$_{0.23}$ samples, respectively. Under these conditions, FLA
succeeds in producing Si NC of a given size in less crystalline SiC than RTA
does. This result is discussed in terms of nucleation and crystal growth using
classical crystallization theory. For FLA and RTA samples, an opposite
relationship between NC size and Si content was observed and attributed either
to the dependence of H effusion on Si content or to the optical absorption

renormalon in $SU(N)$ QCD(adj.), the $SU(N)$ gauge theory with $n_W$-flavor
adjoint Weyl fermions on~$\mathbb{R}^3\times S^1$ with the $\mathbb{Z}_N$
twisted boundary condition. First, we show that, for arbitrary finite~$N$, a
logarithmic factor in the vacuum polarization of the ""photon"" (the gauge boson
associated with the Cartan generators of~$SU(N)$) disappears under the
$S^1$~compactification. Since the IR renormalon is attributed to the presence
of this logarithmic factor, it is concluded that there is no IR renormalon in
this system with finite~$N$. This result generalizes the observation made by
Anber and~Sulejmanpasic [J. High Energy Phys.\ \textbf{1501}, 139 (2015)] for
$N=2$ and~$3$ to arbitrary finite~$N$. Next, we point out that, although
renormalon ambiguities do not appear through the Borel procedure in this
system, an ambiguity appears in an alternative resummation procedure in which a
resummed quantity is given by a momentum integration where the inverse of the
vacuum polarization is included as the integrand. Such an ambiguity is caused
by a simple zero at non-zero momentum of the vacuum polarization. Under the
decompactification~$R\to\infty$, where $R$ is the radius of the $S^1$, this
ambiguity in the momentum integration smoothly reduces to the IR renormalon
ambiguity in~$\mathbb{R}^4$. We term this ambiguity in the momentum integration
""renormalon precursor"". The emergence of the IR renormalon ambiguity
in~$\mathbb{R}^4$ under the decompactification can be naturally understood with
this notion.

a potential solution to address the asymmetric traffic demands in 5G wireless

configuration, D-TDD flexibly allocates percentage of subframes to UL and DL
transmissions to accommodate the traffic within each cell. However, the
unaligned transmissions bring in extra interference which degrades the
potential gain achieved by D-TDD. In this work, we propose an analytical
framework to study the performance of multi-antenna small cell networks with

from opposite transmission direction in neighboring cells. With tools from
stochastic geometry, we derive explicit expressions and tractable tight upper
bounds for success probability and network throughput. The proposed analytical
framework allows to quantify the effect of key system parameters, such as UL/DL
configuration, cluster size, antenna number, and SINR threshold. Our results
show the superiority of the clustered D-TDD over the traditional D-TDD, and
reveal the fact that there exists an optimal cluster size for DL performance,
while UL performance always benefits from a larger cluster.

pairing Hamiltonian for an even-even $N=Z$ system is investigated. For this
purpose we follow the evolution of the ground state from an unperturbed regime
up to a strongly interacting one in a formalism of collective pairs. These
pairs are those resulting from the diagonalization of the pairing Hamiltonian
in a space of two particles coupled to isospin $T=1$. The ground state is found
to rapidly evolve from a product of distinct $T=0$ quartets, each one formed by
two of the above pairs, to a condensate of identical quartets built only with
the pair corresponding to the lowest energy. This finding establishes a link
between the complicated structure of the exact ground state and the simple
approximation scheme of the Quartet Condensation Model. The mechanism at the
basis of this quartet condensation turns out to be the same which is
responsible for the development of a pair condensate in the ground state of a
like-particle pairing Hamiltonian.

networks. In this article, we consider an IRS-aided downlink multiple-input

minimization problem by jointly optimizing the beamforming vector at the BS and
the phase-shift matrix at the IRS, while taking into account the transmit power

$\lambda(V)-\lambda(V^*)\geq C ||V-V^*||_{L^1(\Omega)}^2$ for some $C>0$. The
proof relies on two notions of derivatives for shape optimization: parametric

radial competitors, and shape derivatives to deal with normal deformation of
the ball. A dichotomy is then established to extend the result to all other

there is an error at each position, apparently due to the way of pre-training
it using mask language modeling. In this work, we propose a novel neural
architecture to address the aforementioned issue, which consists of a network
for error detection and a network for error correction based on BERT, with the
former being connected to the latter with what we call soft-masking technique.
Our method of using `Soft-Masked BERT' is general, and it may be employed in

the network design, the major difference of these competing approaches lies in
using a supervised or self-supervised optimization loss function, which require

molecules, industrial turbines to astronomical objects. However, it still lacks
an efficient and reliable method for real-time image processing of a
fast-rotating object. Since the Fourier spectrum of a rotating object changes
rapidly, the traditional Fourier transform (FT) techniques become extremely
complicated and time consuming. Here, we propose a Laguerre-Gaussian (LG)
transform to analyze the rotating object with LG-mode basis. The rotation
operation provides a feasible way to acquire LG spectrum, which is similar to
the function of lens in FT. Particularly, the obtained LG spectrum does not
change even the object working at a high rotating speed. By analyzing the LG
spectrum, one can perform image processing such as reconstruction, edge
enhancement, and pattern replication. Such LG transform provides an efficient
and convenient way to real-time monitor and analyze a fast-rotating object in
scientific research and industry.

  An ORB-SLAM Extension","Accepted at 2020 Fifteenth International Conference on Ecological
  Vehicles and Renewable Energies (EVER)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electric vhicles and autonomous driving dominate current research efforts in
the automotive sector. The two topics go hand in hand in terms of enabling
safer and more environmentally friendly driving. One fundamental building block
of an autonomous vehicle is the ability to build a map of the environment and
localize itself on such a map. In this paper, we make use of a stereo camera
sensor in order to perceive the environment and create the map. With live
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), there is a risk of
mislocalization, since no ground truth map is used as a reference and errors
accumulate over time. Therefore, we first build up and save a map of visual
features of the environment at low driving speeds with our extension to the
ORB-SLAM\,2 package. In a second run, we reload the map and then localize on
the previously built-up map. Loading and localizing on a previously built map
can improve the continuous localization accuracy for autonomous vehicles in
comparison to a full SLAM. This map saving feature is missing in the original
ORB-SLAM\,2 implementation.
  We evaluate the localization accuracy for scenes of the KITTI dataset against
the built up SLAM map. Furthermore, we test the localization on data recorded
with our own small scale electric model car. We show that the relative
translation error of the localization stays under 1\% for a vehicle travelling
at an average longitudinal speed of 36 m/s in a feature-rich environment. The
localization mode contributes to a better localization accuracy and lower
computational load compared to a full SLAM. The source code of our contribution
to the ORB-SLAM2 will be made public at:

utilize the information in big or complex data. However, they can be difficult
to estimate using standard approaches, and variational inference methods are a
popular alternative. Key to the success of these is the selection of an
approximation to the target density that is accurate, tractable and fast to
calibrate using optimization methods. Most existing choices can be inaccurate
or slow to calibrate when there are many latent variables. Here, we propose a
family of tractable variational approximations that are more accurate and
faster to calibrate for this case. It combines a parsimonious parametric
approximation for the parameter posterior, with the exact conditional posterior
of the latent variables. We derive a simplified expression for the
re-parameterization gradient of the variational lower bound, which is the main
ingredient of efficient optimization algorithms used to implement variational
estimation. To do so only requires the ability to generate exactly or
approximately from the conditional posterior of the latent variables, rather
than to compute its density. We illustrate using two complex contemporary
econometric examples. The first is a nonlinear multivariate state space model
for U.S. macroeconomic variables. The second is a random coefficients tobit
model applied to two million sales by 20,000 individuals in a large consumer
panel from a marketing study. In both cases, we show that our approximating
family is considerably more accurate than mean field or structured Gaussian
approximations, and faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo. Last, we show how to
implement data sub-sampling in variational inference for our approximation,
which can lead to a further reduction in computation time. MATLAB code
implementing the method for our examples is included in supplementary material.

phenomenon in which the system initially approaches thermal equilibrium with
respect to the first reservoir, but after a longer time converges to the
thermal state dictated by the temperature of the second environment. Using
analytical arguments and numerical simulations, we analyze the occurrence of
this phenomenon, and how it depends on temperatures and coupling strengths. The
phenomenology gets even richer if the system is placed between two such
non-equilibrium environments. In this case, the energy current through the
system may exhibit transient features and even switch direction, before the
system eventually reaches a non-equilibrium steady state.

velocity field, the AGKE provide a natural definition of scales in the
inhomogeneous directions, and describe fluxes across such scales too. Compared
to the Generalized Kolmogorov Equation, which is recovered as their half trace,
the AGKE can describe inter-component energy transfers occurring via the
pressure-strain term and contain also budget equations for the off-diagonal

a third example, the AGKE are computed for a separating and reattaching flow.
The process of spanwise-vortex formation in the reverse boundary layer within

edge, together with the thermally induced morphological transition from stripe
domains to skyrmions. The unidirectional diffusion of skyrmions from the hot

theoretically explained by the combined contribution from repulsive forces

In the context of Bayesian optimization under unknown constraints (BOC),
typical strategies for safe learning explore conservatively and avoid failures
by all means. On the other side of the spectrum, non conservative BOC
algorithms that allow failing may fail an unbounded number of times before

harvesting device attached to a vibrating table which provides a unidirectional

limiting the displacements and deformations of components within. The masses in

average power is bounded by $\frac{mLA\omega^3}{\pi}$, for motions in 1, 2, or
3 dimensions; with both rectilinear and rotary motions as special cases; and
with either single or multiple degrees of freedom. The limiting displacement
profile of the moving masses for extracting maximum power is discontinuous, and
not physically realizable. But smooth approximations can be nearly as good:
with $15$ terms in a Fourier approximation, the upper limit is $99$\% of the
theoretical maximum. Purely sinusoidal solutions are limited to $\frac{\pi}{4}$
times the theoretical maximum. For both single-degree-of-freedom linear
resonant devices and nonresonant whirling devices where the energy extraction
mimics a linear torsional damper, the maximum average power output is
$\frac{mLA\omega^3}{4}$. Thirty-six experimental energy harvesting devices in
the literature are found to extract power amounts ranging from $0.0036$\% to
$29$\% of the theoretical maximum. Of these thirty-six, twenty achieve less

that energy extraction above $\frac{0.2 mLA\omega^3}{\pi}$ may be considered

ability to discern objects) is predominantly described by the full width at
half maximum (FWHM) of its point spread function (psf)---the diameter of the
blurring density at half of its maximum. Classical wave optics suggests a
linear relationship between FWHM and resolution also manifested in the well
known Abbe and Rayleigh criteria, dating back to the end of 19th century.
However, during the last two decades conventional light microscopy has
undergone a shift from microscopic scales to nanoscales. This increase in
resolution comes with the need to incorporate the random nature of observations
(light photons) and challenges the classical view of discernability, as we
argue in this paper. Instead, we suggest a statistical description of
resolution obtained from such random data. Our notion of discernability is
based on statistical testing whether one or two objects with the same total
intensity are present. For Poisson measurements we get linear dependence of the
(minimax) detection boundary on the FWHM, whereas for a homogeneous Gaussian
model the dependence of resolution is nonlinear. Hence, at small physical
scales modeling by homogeneous gaussians is inadequate, although often
implicitly assumed in many reconstruction algorithms. In contrast, the Poisson
model and its variance stabilized Gaussian approximation seem to provide a
statistically sound description of resolution at the nanoscale. Our theory is
also applicable to other imaging setups, such as telescopes.

agents in dangerous dynamic networks. The danger is posed by the presence in
the network of a black hole BH, a harmful site that destroys all incoming
agents without leaving any trace. The problem of determining the location of
the black hole in a network, known as black hole search BHS, has been
extensively studied in the literature, but always and only assuming that the
network is static. At the same time, the existing results on mobile agents
computing in dynamic networks never consider the presence of harmful sites.
  In this paper we start filling this research gap by studying black hole
search in temporal rings, specifically focusing on 1-interval connectivity
adversarial dynamics. The problem is solved if within finite time at least one
agent survives and knows the location of BH. The main complexity parameters of
BHS is the number of agents (called size) needed to solve the problem, and the
number of moves (called cost) performed by the agents; in synchronous systems,
such as temporal rings, an additional complexity measure is the amount of time
until termination occurs.
  Feasibility and complexity depend on many parameters; in particular: whether
the agents start from the same safe node or from possibly distinct safe
locations, the size $n$ of the ring, whether or not $n$ is known, and the type
of inter-agent communication (whiteboards, tokens, face-to-face, visual). In
this paper, we provide a complete feasibility characterization for all
instances of those parameters; all our algorithms are size optimal.
Furthermore, we establish lower bounds on the cost (i.e., the number of moves)
and time of size-optimal solutions for all instances of those parameters and
show that our algorithms achieve those bound.

and the advantages of \emph{cell-free} (CF) massive multiple-input

optimal \emph{energy efficiency} (EE). To address this fundamental topic, we
assume that each access point (AP) is deployed with multiple antennas and
serves multiple users on the same time-frequency resource while the APs are
Poisson point process (PPP) distributed, which approaches realistically their
opportunistic spatial randomness. Relied on tools from stochastic geometry, we
derive a lower bound on the downlink average achievable spectral efficiency
(SE). Next, we consider a realistic power consumption model for CF massive MIMO
systems. These steps enable the formulation of a tractable optimization problem
concerning the downlink EE per unit area, which results in the analytical
determination of the optimal pilot reuse factor, the AP density, and the number
of AP antennas and users that maximize the EE. Notably, the EE per unit area
and not just the EE is the necessary metric to describe CF systems, where we
meet multi-point transmission. Hence, we provide useful design guidelines for
CF massive MIMO systems relating to fundamental system variables towards
optimal EE. Among the results, we observe that a lower pilot reuse factor
enables a decrease of the interference, and subsequently, higher EE up to a
specific value. Overall, it is shown that the CF massive MIMO technology is a
promising candidate for next-generation networks achieving simultaneously high
SE and EE per unit area.

engineering in which a given risk of an accident has severity and probability
of occurring. Timely information on accidents is important for engineers to
anticipate and reuse previous failures to approximate the risk of accidents in
a new city. However, this is challenging in the context of autonomous vehicles
because of the sparse nature of data on the operational scenarios (driving
trajectories in a new city). Our approach was to mitigate data sparsity by
reducing the state space through monitoring of multiple-vehicles operations. We
then minimized the risk of accidents by determining proper allocation of tests

only calculates the error between predictions and ground-truth labels for

framework, with the first stage to quickly localize the prostate region and the
second stage to precisely segment the prostate by a multi-task UNet
architecture. We introduce a novel online metric learning module through
voxel-wise sampling in the multi-task network. Therefore, the proposed network
has a dual-branch architecture that tackles two tasks: 1) a segmentation
sub-network aiming to generate the prostate segmentation, and 2) a voxel-metric
learning sub-network aiming to improve the quality of the learned feature space
supervised by a metric loss. Specifically, the voxel-metric learning
sub-network samples tuples (including triplets and pairs) in voxel-level
through the intermediate feature maps. Unlike conventional deep metric learning
methods that generate triplets or pairs in image-level before the training
phase, our proposed voxel-wise tuples are sampled in an online manner and
operated in an end-to-end fashion via multi-task learning. To evaluate the
proposed method, we implement extensive experiments on a real CT image dataset

effectively learn more representative voxel-level features compared with the
conventional learning methods with cross-entropy or Dice loss. And the

to device technology. Because of their intrinsic confinement, the properties of
two-dimensional semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
are more sensitive to defects than traditional bulk materials. The
technological adoption of TMDs is dependent on the mitigation of deleterious
defects and guided incorporation of functional foreign atoms. The first step
towards impurity control is the identification of defects and assessment of
their electronic properties. Here, we present a comprehensive study of point
defects in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) grown by chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, CO-tip
noncontact atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force spectroscopy, density
functional theory, and tight-binding calculations. We observe four different
substitutional defects: chromium (Cr$_{\text{W}}$) and molybdenum
(Mo$_{\text{W}}$) at a tungsten site, oxygen at sulfur sites in both bottom and
top layers (O$_{\text{S}}$ top/bottom), as well as two negatively charged
defects (CDs). Their electronic fingerprints unambiguously corroborate the
defect assignment and reveal the presence or absence of in-gap defect states.
The important role of charge localization, spin-orbit coupling, and strain for
the formation of deep defect states observed at substitutional defects in
WS$_2$ as reported here will guide future efforts of targeted defect
engineering and doping of TMDs.

Rayleigh fading (or line-of-sight propagation) on the transmitter-RIS link and
Rayleigh fading on the RIS-receiver link, we prove that the SNR is a random

robots to assist elderly or disabled people to live independently. Smart robot
toys offer a compelling interactive play experience for children and
increasingly capable autonomous vehicles (AVs) the promise of hands-free

are deployed in safety cages, social robots are designed to operate in human
environments and interact closely with humans; the likelihood of robot
accidents is therefore much greater for social robots than industrial robots.
This paper sets out a draft framework for social robot accident investigation;
a framework which proposes both the technology and processes that would allow
social robot accidents to be investigated with no less rigour than we expect of
air or rail accident investigations. The paper also places accident
investigation within the practice of responsible robotics, and makes the case
that social robotics without accident investigation would be no less

  Images Segmentation",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Convex Shapes (CS) are common priors for optic disc and cup segmentation in
eye fundus images. It is important to design proper techniques to represent
convex shapes. So far, it is still a problem to guarantee that the output
objects from a Deep Neural Convolution Networks (DCNN) are convex shapes. In
this work, we propose a technique which can be easily integrated into the
commonly used DCNNs for image segmentation and guarantee that outputs are
convex shapes. This method is flexible and it can handle multiple objects and
allow some of the objects to be convex. Our method is based on the dual
representation of the sigmoid activation function in DCNNs. In the dual space,
the convex shape prior can be guaranteed by a simple quadratic constraint on a
binary representation of the shapes. Moreover, our method can also integrate
spatial regularization and some other shape prior using a soft thresholding
dynamics (STD) method. The regularization can make the boundary curves of the
segmentation objects to be simultaneously smooth and convex. We design a very
stable active set projection algorithm to numerically solve our model. This
algorithm can form a new plug-and-play DCNN layer called CS-STD whose outputs
must be a nearly binary segmentation of convex objects. In the CS-STD block,
the convexity information can be propagated to guide the DCNN in both forward
and backward propagation during training and prediction process. As an
application example, we apply the convexity prior layer to the retinal fundus
images segmentation by taking the popular DeepLabV3+ as a backbone network.
Experimental results on several public datasets show that our method is
efficient and outperforms the classical DCNN segmentation methods.

interest are those of the selected model only. In the context of L1-penalized

via confidence intervals available to applied researchers via software packages
using a simulation study inspired by real data commonly seen in biomedical

indicate that the frequentist properties of selective confidence intervals are

respectively. Very recently, however, there has been growing interest in the
quantum simulation of systems with four spatial dimensions; this raises the
question of how vortices would behave in a higher-dimensional superfluid. In
this paper, we begin to establish the phenomenology of vortices in 4D
superfluids under rotation, where the vortex core can form a plane. In 4D, the
most generic type of rotation is a ""double rotation"" with two angles (or
frequencies). We show, by solving the Gross-Pitaesvkii equation, that the
simplest case of equal-frequency double rotation can stabilise a pair of vortex
planes intersecting at a point. This opens up a wide number of future research
topics, including unequal-frequency double rotations; the stability and
reconnection dynamics of intersecting vortex surfaces; and the possibility of
closed vortex surfaces.

the mirage of $\mathcal X$, that is, in the set of pseudowords whose finite

that the isomorphism class of the category is invariant under conjugacy.
Finally, we see that the zeta function of $\mathcal X$ is naturally encoded in

also been obtained. Although the photometric observations were focused on the
obtaining the timing information, a cursory light-curve analysis was also
performed. Extracted broadening functions clearly show the presence of a third,
slowly-rotating component. Its radial velocity is within error of the systemic
velocity of the eclipsing pair, strongly supporting the physical bond. The
observed systemic radial-velocity and third-component changes do not support
the 9 year orbit found from the timing variability. Masses of the components of
the eclipsing pair are determined with about 0.5% precision. Further

indeterminate number of valid solutions. Solving this problem with neural
networks would require access to extensive experience, either presented as a
large training set over natural images or a condensed representation from
another pre-trained network. Perceptual loss functions, which belong to the
latter category, have achieved breakthrough success in SISR and several other
computer vision tasks. While perceptual loss plays a central role in the
generation of photo-realistic images, it also produces undesired pattern
artifacts in the super-resolved outputs. In this paper, we show that the root
cause of these pattern artifacts can be traced back to a mismatch between the
pre-training objective of perceptual loss and the super-resolution objective.
To address this issue, we propose to augment the existing perceptual loss
formulation with a novel content loss function that uses the latent features of
a discriminator network to filter the unwanted artifacts across several levels
of adversarial similarity. Further, our modification has a stabilizing effect
on non-convex optimization in adversarial training. The proposed approach
offers notable gains in perceptual quality based on an extensive human
evaluation study and a competent reconstruction fidelity when tested on
objective evaluation metrics.

the stars in pure Lovelock theories. In addition, as the strength of the
Maxwell field increases, the stellar structures become more compact, i.e., the
radius of the star decreases. In the context of four dimensional

Gauss-Bonnet coupling (behaving as an effective electric charge), increases the

possible by using a driven quantum system, or more precisely, a network of

that some hard instances, where standard ground-state AQC with KPOs fails to
find their optimal solutions, can be solved by the present approach, where
nonadiabatic transitions are rather utilized. We also show that the use of the
vacuum state as an initial state leads to robustness against errors due to
dissipation, as expected, compared to the use of a really excited (nonvacuum)
state as an initial state. Thus, the present work offers new possibilities for
quantum computation and driven quantum systems.

increasingly used in anomaly-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDS).
However, ML/DL has shown to be extremely vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
especially in such security-sensitive systems. Many adversarial attacks have
been proposed to evaluate the robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Unfortunately,
existing attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks,
which make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study
on practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored.
  To bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the
gray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of
ML-based NIDSs. Our work outperforms previous ones in the following aspects:
(i) practical-the proposed attack can automatically mutate original traffic
with extremely limited knowledge and affordable overhead while preserving its
functionality; (ii) generic-the proposed attack is effective for evaluating the
robustness of various NIDSs using diverse ML/DL models and non-payload-based
features; (iii) explainable-we propose an explanation method for the fragile
robustness of ML-based NIDSs. Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme
against adversarial attacks to improve system robustness. We extensively
evaluate the robustness of various NIDSs using diverse feature sets and ML/DL
models. Experimental results show our attack is effective (e.g., >97% evasion
rate in half cases for Kitsune, a state-of-the-art NIDS) with affordable
execution cost and the proposed defense method can effectively mitigate such
attacks (evasion rate is reduced by >50% in most cases).

models. First, the different types of applications are pointed out, from
(noncommutative) quantum field theory over 2-dimensional quantum gravity up to
algebraic geometry with explicit computation of intersection numbers on the
moduli space of complex curves.
  The Kontsevich model, which has proved the Witten conjecture, is the simplest
example of a matrix field theory. Generalisations of this model will be
studied, where different potentials and the spectral dimension (defined by the
asymptotics of the external matrix) are introduced. Because they are naturally
embedded into a Riemann surface, the correlation functions are graded by the
genus and the number of boundary components. The renormalisation procedure of
quantum field theory leads to finite UV-limit.
  We provide a method to determine closed Schwinger-Dyson equations with the
usage of Ward-Takahashi identities in the continuum limit. The cubic
(Kontsevich model) and the quartic (Grosse-Wulkenhaar model) potentials are
studied separately. For the cubic potential, we show that the renormalisation
procedure is compatible with topological recursion (TR). This means that the
exact results computed by TR coincide perturbatively with the graph expansion
renormalised by Zimmermann's forest formula. For the quartic model, the first
correlation function (2-point function) is computed exactly. We give hints that
the quartic model has structurally the same properties as the hermitian
2-matrix model with genus zero spectral curve.

quadrupolar moments. It is difficult to identify the symmetry of such
hidden-order states in common x-ray or neutron scattering experiments, as there
is no signal in zero field, however alternative techniques like neutron
diffraction in external field, resonant x-ray scattering, or ultrasonic
investigations can be applied. Another possible method for characterizing
hidden order is to look at the magnetic excitation spectrum, which carries the
imprint of the multipolar interactions and the hidden order parameter in its
dispersion relations. Using a specific candidate model, the dispersion is
calculated and then compared to that measured with inelastic neutron
scattering. Until recently, only a limited amount of data which show the
presence of dispersing excitations measured along a few high-symmetry

environment and the behaviour of the host vehicle or user. The environment
determines the type and quality of radio signals available for positioning and
the behaviour can contribute additional information to the navigation solution.
In order to operate across different contexts, a context-adaptive navigation
solution introduces an element of self-awareness by detecting the operating
context and configuring the positioning system accordingly. This paper presents
the detection of both environmental and behavioural contexts as a whole,
building the foundation of a context-adaptive navigation system. Behavioural
contexts are classified using measurements from accelerometers, gyroscopes,
magnetometers and the barometer by supervised machine learning algorithms,
yielding an overall 95% classification accuracy. A connectivity dependent
filter is then implemented to improve the behavioural detection results.
Environmental contexts are detected from GNSS measurements. They are classified
into indoor, intermediate and outdoor categories using a probabilistic support
vector machine (SVM), followed by a hidden Markov model (HMM) used for
time-domain filtering. As there will never be completely reliable context
detection, the paper also shows how environment and behaviour association can
contribute to reducing the chances of the context determination algorithms
selecting an incorrect context. Finally, the proposed context-determination
algorithms are tested in a series of multi-context scenarios.

definition of reward schemes that appropriately facilitate exploration without
biasing the solution in undesirable ways, and that can be implemented on real
robotic systems without expensive instrumentation. In this paper we focus on a
setting in which goal tasks are defined via simple sparse rewards, and
exploration is facilitated via agent-internal auxiliary tasks. We introduce the
idea of simple sensor intentions (SSIs) as a generic way to define auxiliary
tasks. SSIs reduce the amount of prior knowledge that is required to define
suitable rewards. They can further be computed directly from raw sensor streams
and thus do not require expensive and possibly brittle state estimation on real
systems. We demonstrate that a learning system based on these rewards can solve
complex robotic tasks in simulation and in real world settings. In particular,
we show that a real robotic arm can learn to grasp and lift and solve a
Ball-in-a-Cup task from scratch, when only raw sensor streams are used for both

physics. The majority of the studies on transfer of learning in physics have
focused on introductory students. However, compared to advanced students,
introductory students have significantly less prior relevant knowledge and
skills which may be crucial for promoting effective transfer. Here, we examine
upper-level undergraduate and graduate students' ability to transfer their
learning about the concept of ""which-path"" information and its relation to
whether or not interference is observed from the context of the Mach Zehnder
Interferometer (MZI) to a new context of the double-slit experiment (DSE).
Students worked through a tutorial on the MZI in which they learned to use the
concept of ""which-path"" information to reason about interference of single
photons when polarizers with various orientations are placed in one or both
paths of the MZI. After working on the MZI tutorial, students were asked
similar questions in the isomorphic context of the DSE before any instruction
about the DSE and we examined the extent to which transfer of learning about
""which-path"" information occurred from the MZI to the DSE context. We find
evidence suggesting that positive transfer of learning from the MZI to the DSE
occurred despite the lack of an instructional intervention designed to help
students recognize the similarity between the two contexts. The effectiveness
of the MZI tutorial in promoting positive transfer of learning from one context
to another in quantum mechanics sheds light on the expertise of the advanced
physics students. Instructors of advanced physics courses can take advantage of
the findings presented here which shows the difference between introductory and

equipment and buildings. As the concentration of atmospheric pollutants has
increased, the accumulation of microscale and nanoscale particles on surfaces
due to advection-diffusion has led to adverse mechanical, chemical and
electrical effects that increase cooling demands and reduce the reliability of
electronic equipment. Here, we uncover the mechanisms leading to enhanced
deposition of particle matter (PM$_{10}$ and PM$_{2.5}$) on surfaces due to
turbulent axial fan flows operating at Reynolds numbers, $Re \sim 10^5$.
Qualitative observations of long-term particle deposition from the field were
combined with \textit{in situ} particle image velocimetry on a
telecommunications base station, revealing the dominant role of impingement
velocity and angle. Near-wall momentum transport for $10 < y^+ < 50$ were
explored using a quadrant analysis to uncover the contributions of turbulent
events that promote particle deposition through turbulent diffusion and eddy
impaction. By decomposing these events, the local transport behaviour of fine
particles from the bulk flow to the surface has been categorised. The
transition from deposition to clean surfaces was accompanied by a decrease in
shear velocity, turbulent stresses, and particle sweep motions with lower flux
in the wall-normal direction. Finally, using these insights, selective
filtering of coarse particles was found to promote the conditions that enhance
the deposition of fine particle matter.

channel network (PCN) assumes the underlying routing algorithm transfers the
payment via a single path. However, a path may not have sufficient capacity to
route a transaction. It is inevitable to split the payment across multiple
paths. If we run independent instances of the protocol on each path, the
execution may fail in some of the paths, leading to partial transfer of funds.
A payer has to reattempt the entire process for the residual amount. We propose
a secure and privacy-preserving payment protocol, CryptoMaze. Instead of
independent paths, the funds are transferred from sender to receiver across
several payment channels responsible for routing, in a breadth-first fashion.
Payments are resolved faster at reduced setup cost, compared to existing
state-of-the-art. Correlation among the partial payments is captured,
guaranteeing atomicity. Further, two party ECDSA signature is used for
establishing scriptless locks among parties involved in the payment. It reduces
space overhead by leveraging on core Bitcoin scripts. We provide a formal model
in the Universal Composability framework and state the privacy goals achieved
by CryptoMaze. We compare the performance of our protocol with the existing
single path based payment protocol, Multi-hop HTLC, applied iteratively on one
path at a time on several instances. It is observed that CryptoMaze requires
less communication overhead and low execution time, demonstrating efficiency
and scalability.

higher degrees. The composition identities given in this paper have not been

the tension generated by the actomyosin cortex and the adhesion of cells to the
substrate and to each other. To account for these biological and structural
contributions to cell shape, different physical models have been proposed.
However, an experimental procedure that would allow a validation of a minimal
physical model for the shape of epithelial cells in 3D has not yet been
proposed. In this study, we cultured MDCK epithelial cells on substrates with a
sinusoidal profile, allowing us to measure the shape of the cells on various
positive and negative curvatures. We found that MDCK cells are thicker in the
valleys than on the crests of sinusoidal substrates. The influence of curvature
on the shape of epithelial cells could not be understood with a model using
only differential apical, basal and lateral surface energies. However, the
addition of an apical line tension was sufficient to quantitatively account for
the experimental measurements. The model also accounts for the shape of MDCK
cells that overexpress E-cadherin. On the other hand, when reducing myosin II
activity with blebbistatin, we measured a saturation of the difference in cell
thickness between valleys and crests, suggesting the need for a term limiting
large cell deformations. Our results show that a minimal model that accounts
for epithelial cell shape needs to include an apical line tension in addition
to differential surface energies, highlighting the importance of structures
that produce anisotropic tension in epithelial cells, such as the actin belt
linking adherens junctions. In the future, our experimental procedure could be
used to test a wider range of physical models for the shape of epithelia in
curved environments, including, for example, continuous models.

Italy particularly hard, yielding the implementation of strict national
lockdown rules (Phase 1). There is now a hot ongoing debate in Italy and abroad
on what the best strategy is to restart a country to exit a national lockdown
(Phase 2). Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting
scenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other
nations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can
independently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service.
In this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is
essential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to
design effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve
this, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each
region on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using
the model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national
lockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the
spread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also
propose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be
effective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the
epidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and
mitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to
other levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states
in other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.

Dynkin automorphisms coming from the unfolding of the Dynkin diagram. This can
be seen as a non-commutative analogue of Slodowy's theorem. Finally we apply

autoencoder (VAE). In three design cases, the framework generates 142 new
crystals with user-defined formation energies, bandgap, thermoelectric (TE)

learn a closed-loop model-free control policy with deep neural network using

background image, without using any real world supervision.
  We demonstrate this methodology in eye-in-hand grasping task. We train a
closed-loop control policy model that taking the segmentation as input using

simulation to real environment. The closed-loop control policy is not only
robust with respect to discrepancies between the dynamic model of the simulated

target is moving and even learns to recover from failures. We train the
perception segmentation model using training data generated by composing real

policy learned from simulation with the perception model, we achieve an
impressive $\bf{88\%}$ success rate in grasping a tiny sphere with a real

a novel message passing algorithm based on factor graph, which yields near
optimal solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation. The beamformers are
then designed based on the predicted angles for establishing the communication
links.}With the employment of appropriate approximations, all messages on the
factor graph can be derived in a closed-form, thus reduce the complexity.
Simulation results show that the proposed DFRC based beamforming scheme is
superior to the feedback-based approach in terms of both estimation and
communication performance. Moreover, the proposed message passing algorithm
achieves a similar performance of the high-complexity particle-based methods.

in that memory is a critical component of conscious experience. So far, many

there is little research on memory consolidation during unconsciousness.
Therefore, we aim to assess the unconsciousness in terms of memory
consolidation using electroencephalogram signals. In particular, we used
unconscious state during a nap; because sleep is the only state in which
consciousness disappears under normal physiological conditions. Seven
participants performed two memory tasks (word-pairs and visuo-spatial) before
and after the nap to assess the memory consolidation during unconsciousness. As
a result, spindle power in central, parietal, occipital regions during
unconsciousness was positively correlated with the performance of location
memory. With the memory performance, there was also a negative correlation
between delta connectivity and word-pairs memory, alpha connectivity and
location memory, and spindle connectivity and word-pairs memory. We
additionally observed the significant relationship between unconsciousness and
brain changes during memory recall before and after the nap. These findings
could help present new insights into the assessment of unconsciousness by
exploring the relationship with memory consolidation.

The
basis is taken to be conceptual variables, physical variables that may be
accessible or inaccessible, i.e., it may be possible or impossible to assign
numerical values to them. In an epistemic process, the accessible variables are
just ideal observations as observed by an actor or by some communicating
actors. Group actions are defined on these variables, and using group
representation theory this is the basis for developing the Hilbert space
formalism here. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables are
derived as a result of the formalism, and in the discrete case it is argued
that the possible physical values are the eigenvalues of these operators. The
Born formula is derived under specific assumptions. The whole discussion here
is a supplement to the author's book [1]. The interpretation of quantum states
(or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions to
nature together with sharp answers to those questions. Resolutions if the
identity are then connected to the questions themselves; these may be
complementary in the sense defined by Bohr. This interpretation may be called a
general epistemic interpretation of quantum theory. It is similar to Zwirn's
recent Convival Solipsism, and also to QBism, and more generally, can be seen
as a concrete implementation of Rovelli's Relational Quantum Mechanics. The
focus in the present paper is, however, as much on foundation as on
interpretation. But the simple consequences of an epistemic interpretation for
some so called quantum paradoxes are discussed. Connections to statistical
inference theory are discussed in a preliminary way, both through an example
and through a brief discussion of quantum measurement theory.

added complexity in reaching a state with the maximum resource utilization, in
the sense that the game is essentially a set of MG that are coupled and played
in parallel. We show that a stochastic strategy, used in the MG, works well
here too. We discuss the limits in which the model reduces to other known

population movement between various states within a country during an ongoing
epidemic. We show that the total infected population in the country could be as
low as that achieved with a complete stoppage of inter-region movements for a
prolonged period, provided that the agents instead follow the above mentioned
stochastic strategy for their movement decisions between their two choices. The
objective for an agent is to stay in the lower infected state between their two
choices. We further show that it is the agents moving once between any two
states, following the stochastic strategy, who are less likely to be infected
than those not having (or not opting for) such a movement choice, when the risk
of getting infected during the travel is not considered. This shows the
incentive for the moving agents to follow the stochastic strategy.

for the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of isotropic compressible turbulence
up to the supersonic regime. Due to the multi-scale nature and coupled
temporal-spatial evolution process, HGKS provides a valid tool for the
numerical simulation of compressible turbulent flow. Based on the domain
decomposition and message passing interface (MPI), a parallel HGKS code is
developed for large-scale computation in this paper. The standard tests from
the nearly incompressible flow to the supersonic one, including Taylor-Green
vortex problem, turbulent channel flow and isotropic compressible turbulence,
are presented to validate the parallel scalability, efficiency, accuracy and
robustness of parallel implementation. The performance of HGKS for the nearly
incompressible turbulence is comparable with the high-order finite difference
scheme, including the resolution of flow structure and efficiency of
computation. Based on the accuracy of the numerical solution, the numerical
dissipation of the scheme in the turbulence simulation is quantitatively
evaluated. As a mesoscopic method, HGKS performs better than both lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM) and discrete unified gas-kinetic scheme (DUGKS), due to
its high-order accuracy. Meanwhile, based on the kinetic formulation HGKS shows
advantage for supersonic turbulent flow simulation with its accuracy and
robustness. The current work demonstrates the capability of HGKS as a powerful

superconducting detector, and its principle is based on a superconducting
resonator circuit. The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of the MKID
is an important parameter because various MKID characterization parameters
depend on it. In this paper, we propose a method to measure the Tc of the MKID
by changing the applied power of the readout microwaves. A small fraction of
the readout power is deposited in the MKID, and the number of quasiparticles in
the MKID increases with this power. Furthermore, the quasiparticle lifetime
decreases with the number of quasiparticles. Therefore, we can measure the
relation between the quasiparticle lifetime and the detector response by
rapidly varying the readout power. From this relation, we estimate the
intrinsic quasiparticle lifetime. This lifetime is theoretically modeled by Tc,
the physical temperature of the MKID device, and other known parameters. We
obtain Tc by comparing the measured lifetime with that acquired using the
theoretical model. Using an MKID fabricated with aluminum, we demonstrate this
method at a 0.3 K operation. The results are consistent with those obtained by
Tc measured by monitoring the transmittance of the readout microwaves with the
variation in the device temperature. The method proposed in this paper is
applicable to other types, such as a hybrid-type MKID.

double edge dislocations, a screw dislocation and a circular dislocation loop.
Numerical results show a high consistency in displacement field while no

generation and storage facilities in smart grid systems, an efficient
Demand-Side Management (DSM) is urgent for energy savings and peak loads
reduction. Traditional DSM works focusing on optimizing the energy activities
for a single household can not scale up to large-scale home energy management
problems. Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MA-DRL) shows a potential
way to solve the problem of scalability, where modern homes interact together
to reduce energy consumers consumption while striking a balance between energy
cost and peak loads reduction. However, it is difficult to solve such an
environment with the non-stationarity, and existing MA-DRL approaches cannot
effectively give incentives for expected group behavior. In this paper, we
propose a collective MA-DRL algorithm with continuous action space to provide
fine-grained control on a large scale microgrid. To mitigate the
non-stationarity of the microgrid environment, a novel predictive model is
proposed to measure the collective market behavior. Besides, a collective
behavior entropy is introduced to reduce the high peak loads incurred by the

  Regression Models to Improve Sales Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a variety of business situations, the introduction or improvement of
machine learning approaches is impaired as these cannot draw on existing
analytical models. However, in many cases similar problems may have already
been solved elsewhere-but the accumulated analytical knowledge cannot be tapped
to solve a new problem, e.g., because of privacy barriers. For the particular
purpose of sales forecasting for similar entities, we propose a transfer
machine learning approach based on additive regression models that lets new
entities benefit from models of existing entities. We evaluate the approach on
a rich, multi-year dataset of multiple restaurant branches. We differentiate
the options to simply transfer models from one branch to another (""zero shot"")
or to transfer and adapt them. We analyze feasibility and performance against
several forecasting benchmarks. The results show the potential of the approach
to exploit the collectively available analytical knowledge. Thus, we contribute
an approach that is generalizable beyond sales forecasting and the specific use
case in particular. In addition, we demonstrate its feasibility for a typical
use case as well as the potential for improving forecasting quality. These
results should inform academia, as they help to leverage knowledge across
various entities, and have immediate practical application in industry.

can perform various computational tasks through light-matter interaction. Here,
we demonstrate the design of optical networks in the form of multiple
diffractive layers that are trained using deep learning to transform and encode
the spatial information of objects into the power spectrum of the diffracted
light, which are used to perform optical classification of objects with a
single-pixel spectroscopic detector. Using a time-domain spectroscopy setup
with a plasmonic nanoantenna-based detector, we experimentally validated this
machine vision framework at terahertz spectrum to optically classify the images
of handwritten digits by detecting the spectral power of the diffracted light
at ten distinct wavelengths, each representing one class/digit. We also report
the coupling of this spectral encoding achieved through a diffractive optical
network with a shallow electronic neural network, separately trained to
reconstruct the images of handwritten digits based on solely the spectral
information encoded in these ten distinct wavelengths within the diffracted
light. These reconstructed images demonstrate task-specific image decompression
and can also be cycled back as new inputs to the same diffractive network to
improve its optical object classification. This unique machine vision framework
merges the power of deep learning with the spatial and spectral processing
capabilities of diffractive networks, and can also be extended to other
spectral-domain measurement systems to enable new 3D imaging and sensing
modalities integrated with spectrally encoded classification tasks performed
through diffractive optical networks.

with AI systems on job performance. From this theoretical perspective, we

are key determinants of identification with AI systems. Furthermore, the
findings show that identification with AI systems does increase job

reinforced polymer (FRP) composites. Recent trends in high-tech applications of
FRP composites exploit the limits of the load bearing capacity, generally
encompassing the development of notable nonlinear effects from geometrical and
material signatures. In this investigation, we present a comprehensive
assessment of the new Linear Elastic Brittle Interface Model (LEBIM) in
geometrically nonlinear applications undergoing mixed-mode fracture conditions.
This interface model for triggering fracture events is formulated through the
advocation of continuum-like assumptions (for initial non-zero interface
thickness) and allows the incorporation of the potential role of the in-plane
deformation effects. The performance of the present interface model is
demonstrated through the simulation of specimens with mixed-mode delamination,
with special attention for its application in samples equipped with structured
interfaces. Current predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with respect to
experimental data, validating the proposed methodology.

initial primary loading, the material may subsequently be described as
orthotropic because in pure shear there are three different principal stretches
so that the strain-induced anisotropy of the stress response is different in
each of these three directions. We derive non-linear orthotropic models for the
elastic response, stress relaxation and residual strain in order to model
accurately the inelastic features associated with cyclic stress softening. We
then develop an orthotropic version of the Arruda-Boyce eight-chain model of
elasticity and then combine it with the ideas previously developed in this
paper to produce an orthotropic constitutive relation for the cyclic
stress-softening of a carbon-filled rubber vulcanizate. The model developed
