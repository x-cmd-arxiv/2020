low-complexity self-interference cancellation at the users, thereby
considerably lowering the overall decoding complexity compared to joint

  This chapter takes a constructive approach to introduce a modern incarnation

scheme comes from classic principles of spectral methods including polynomial

fluctuations is important for reducing uncertainties due to unfolding and
extending measurements to lower momenta and larger resolution parameters. The

agreement with the form predicted in the ALICE paper, with deviations of 1--6%.
The standard deviation of energy in random cones in Angantyr exceeds the same

the assumption that the single-particle $d^2N/dy$ $dp_T$ is a gamma
distribution in the derivation of the prediction, whereas the model uses a
different distribution. This indicates that model comparisons are potentially
sensitive to the treatment of the background. We demonstrate that unfolding

also utilizes a neural sentence pair model to capture semantic similarity.
Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms all the previous
work on monolingual sentence alignment task by more than 5 points in F1. We
apply our CRF aligner to construct two new text simplification datasets,
Newsela-Auto and Wiki-Auto, which are much larger and of better quality

achieve exponential speed-ups over numerical simulators or experiments, and at

Consequently, there is a recent surge in utilizing modern machine learning (ML)
methods, such as deep neural networks, to build data-driven emulators. While
the majority of existing efforts has focused on tailoring off-the-shelf ML
solutions to better suit the scientific problem at hand, we study an often
overlooked, yet important, problem of choosing loss functions to measure the
discrepancy between observed data and the predictions from a model. Due to lack
of better priors on the expected residual structure, in practice, simple
choices such as the mean squared error and the mean absolute error are made.
However, the inherent symmetric noise assumption made by these loss functions
makes them inappropriate in cases where the data is heterogeneous or when the
noise distribution is asymmetric. We propose Learn-by-Calibrating (LbC), a
novel deep learning approach based on interval calibration for designing
emulators in scientific applications, that are effective even with
heterogeneous data and are robust to outliers. Using a large suite of
use-cases, we show that LbC provides significant improvements in generalization
error over widely-adopted loss function choices, achieves high-quality
emulators even in small data regimes and more importantly, recovers the
inherent noise structure without any explicit priors.

$\Theta$-term of the projected Hilbert space of the degrees of freedom at the

in a nonperturbative version of the Berezenskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) RG

while the nature of RG flow around the critical point is identical to that
obtained from the weak-coupling RG analysis. This coincides with a phase
transition in the many-particle entanglement, as the entanglement entropy RG
flow shows distinct features for the critical and gapped phases depending on
the value of the topological $\Theta$-term. We demonstrate the Ryu-Takyanagi
entropy bound for the many-body eigenstates comprising the EHM network,
concretizing the relation to the holographic duality principle. The scaling of

the generation of very different holographic spacetimes across the critical

minimal oscillation frequency over the BISs, mimicking a bulk gap of the
dynamical phase. Singularities emerge in the quench dynamics, with the minimal
oscillation frequency vanishing on the BISs if increasing noise to critical
strength, manifesting a dynamical topological transition, beyond which the
emergent topology breaks down. Two types of dynamical transitions are
predicted. Interestingly, we predict a sweet spot in the critical transition
when noise couples to all three spin components in the same strength, in which
case the dynamical topology survives at arbitrarily strong noise regime. This
work unveils novel features of the dynamical topology under dynamical noise,
which can be probed with control in experiment.

identifies the most critical CCFs and other hazards of digital I&C systems.
Ultimately, RESHA can help researchers make informed decisions for how, and to

tightly linked to the modern development of quantum computing and quantum

dynamic quantum game theory was initiated with strategies chosen by players in
real time. Since direct continuous observations are known to destroy quantum
evolutions (so-called quantum Zeno paradox) the necessary new ingredient for
quantum dynamic games represented the theory of non-direct observations and the
corresponding quantum filtering. Another remarkable 21st century branch of game
theory represent the so-called mean-field games (MFG), with impressive and ever
growing development.
  In this paper we are merging these two exciting new branches of game theory.
Building a quantum analog of MFGs requires the full reconstruction of its
foundations and methodology, because in $N$-particle quantum evolution
particles are not separated in individual dynamics and the key concept of the
classical MFG theory, the empirical measure defined as the sum of Dirac masses
of the positions of the players, is not applicable in quantum setting.
  As a preliminary result we derive the new nonlinear stochastic Schr\""odinger
equation, as the limit of continuously observed and controlled system of large
number of interacting quantum particles, the result that may have an
independent value. We then show that to a control quantum system of interacting
particles there corresponds a special system of classical interacting particles
with the identical limiting MFG system, defined on an appropriate Riemanian
manifold. Solutions of this system are shown to specify approximate Nash

control. Because many infectious diseases spread through close contacts,
contact tracing is a key tool for case discovery and control. However, although
contact tracing has been performed widely, the mathematical understanding of
contact tracing has not been fully established and it has not been clearly
understood what determines the efficacy of contact tracing. Here, we reveal
that, compared with ""forward"" tracing---tracing to whom disease spreads,
""backward"" tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly more
effective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but
overlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations
on both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that
even at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically
executed contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further
transmissions. We also show that---in terms of the number of prevented
transmissions per isolation---case isolation combined with a small amount of
contact tracing is more efficient than case isolation alone. By demonstrating
that backward contact tracing is highly effective at discovering
super-spreading events, we argue that the potential effectiveness of contact
tracing has been underestimated. Therefore, there is a critical need for
revisiting current contact tracing strategies so that they leverage all forms
of biases. Our results also have important consequences for digital contact
tracing because it will be crucial to incorporate the capability for backward

superfluid-to-insulator transition is a first order one, as opposed to the
isotropic cases and calculate transition temperatures for the superfluid
states, finding excellent agreement with analytical theory. At the same time,
our MPS+MF approach keeps functioning well where the current analytical
framework cannot be applied. We further confirm the qualitative and
quantitative reliability of our approach by comparison to exact quantum Monte
Carlo calculations for the full 3D arrays.

unitarity on effective field theories with such spontaneously broken Lorentz
symmetry. In addition to a maximum energy scale, there is now also a critical
velocity at which the theory breaks down. The theory therefore has different
resolving power in time and in space, and we show that these can only coincide
if cubic Lorentz-violating interactions are absent. Applying these bounds to
the Effective Field Theory of Inflation, we identify the region of parameter
space in which inflation can be both single-field and weakly coupled on
subhorizon scales. This can be implemented as a theoretical prior, and we
illustrate this explicitly using Planck observational constraints on the

algorithms for optimization on undirected graphs. In particular, we develop a
technique that, given any problem that admits a certain notion of vertex
sparsifiers, gives data structures that maintain approximate solutions in
sub-linear update and query time. We illustrate the applicability of our
paradigm to the following problems.
  (1) A fully-dynamic algorithm that approximates all-pair
maximum-flows/minimum-cuts up to a nearly logarithmic factor in
$\tilde{O}(n^{2/3})$ amortized time against an oblivious adversary, and
$\tilde{O}(m^{3/4})$ time against an adaptive adversary.
  (2) An incremental data structure that maintains $O(1)$-approximate shortest
path in $n^{o(1)}$ time per operation, as well as fully dynamic approximate
all-pair shortest path and transshipment in $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3+o(1)})$ amortized
time per operation.
  (3) A fully-dynamic algorithm that approximates all-pair effective resistance
up to an $(1+\epsilon)$ factor in $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3+o(1)} \epsilon^{-O(1)})$
amortized update time per operation.
  The key tool behind result (1) is the dynamic maintenance of an algorithmic
construction due to Madry [FOCS' 10], which partitions a graph into a
collection of simpler graph structures (known as j-trees) and approximately
captures the cut-flow and metric structure of the graph. The
$O(1)$-approximation guarantee of (2) is by adapting the distance oracles by
[Thorup-Zwick JACM `05]. Result (3) is obtained by invoking the random-walk
based spectral vertex sparsifier by [Durfee et al. STOC `19] in a hierarchical
manner, while carefully keeping track of the recourse among levels in the
hierarchy.

expander hierarchy and show a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining such a
hierarchy on a graph with $n$ vertices undergoing edge insertions and deletions
using $n^{o(1)}$ update time. An expander hierarchy is a tree representation of
graphs that faithfully captures the cut-flow structure and consequently our
dynamic algorithm almost immediately implies several results including:
  (1) The first fully dynamic algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$ worst-case update time
that allows querying $n^{o(1)}$-approximate conductance, $s$-$t$ maximum flows,
and $s$-$t$ minimum cuts for any given $(s,t)$ in $O(\log^{1/6} n)$ time. Our
results are deterministic and extend to multi-commodity cuts and flows. The key
idea behind these results is a fully dynamic algorithm for maintaining a tree
flow sparsifier, a notion introduced by R\""acke [FOCS'02] for constructing
competitive oblivious routing schemes.
  (2) A deterministic fully dynamic connectivity algorithm with $n^{o(1)}$
worst-case update time. This significantly simplifies the recent algorithm by
Chuzhoy et al.~that uses the framework of Nanongkai et al. [FOCS'17].
  (3) The first non-trivial deterministic fully dynamic treewidth decomposition
algorithm on constant-degree graphs with $n^{o(1)}$ worst-case update time that
maintains a treewidth decomposition of width $\text{tw}(G)\cdot n^{o(1)}$ where
$\text{tw}(G)$ denotes the treewidth of the current graph.
  Our technique is based on a new stronger notion of the expander
decomposition, called the boundary-linked expander decomposition. This
decomposition is more robust against updates and better captures the clustering
structure of graphs. Given that the expander decomposition has proved extremely
useful in many fields, we expect that our new notion will find more future
applications.

central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICC) have been shown to display
either linear significant receptive fields, or both, linear and nonlinear
significant receptive fields. In this study, we used reverse correlation to
probe linear and nonlinear response properties of single neurons in the cat
ICC. The receptive fields display areas of stimulus parameters leading to
enhanced or inhibited spiking activity, and thus allow investigating the
interplay to process complex sounds. Spiking responses were obtained from
neural recordings of anesthetized cats in response to dynamic moving ripple
(DMR) stimuli. The DMR sound contains amplitude and frequency modulations and
allows systematically mapping neural preferences. Correlations of the stimulus
envelope that preferably excite neurons can be mapped with the spike-triggered
covariance. The spike-triggered average and -covariance were computed for the
envelope of the DMR, separately for each frequency carrier (spanning a range of
0-5.5 octaves). This enables studying processing of the sound envelope, and to
investigate whether nonlinearities are more pronounced at the neurons'
preferred frequencies rather than at other frequencies. We find that more than
half of the neurons (n=120) display significant nonlinear response properties
at least at one frequency carrier. Nonlinearities are dominant at the neuron's
best frequency. The nonlinear preferences can have either the same or opposite
temporal receptive field pattern (e.g. on-off) as the linear preferences. No
relationship to other neural properties such as feature-selectivity,
phase-locking, or the like has been found. Thus, these nonlinearities do not
seem to be linked to a specific type of neuron but to be inherent to ICC
neurons indicating a diverse range of filtering characteristics.

different contexts, leading to the evolution of new context-oriented
programming languages. These languages introduce new software-engineering
challenges, such as: how to maintain and keep the separation of concerns of the
codebase? how to model the changing behaviors? how to verify the system
behavior? and more.
  This paper introduces Context-Oriented Behavioral Programming(COBP) - a novel
paradigm for developing context-aware systems, centered on natural and
incremental specification of context-dependent behaviors. As the name suggests,
we combine behavioral-programming(BP) - a scenario-based modeling paradigm -
with context idioms that explicitly specify when scenarios are relevant and
what information they need. The core idea is to connect the behavioral model
with a data model that represents the context, allowing an intuitive connection
between the models via update and select queries. Combining
behavioral-programming with context-oriented programming brings the best of the
two worlds, solving issues that arise when using each of the approaches in
separation.
  We begin with providing abstract semantics for COBP, laying the foundations
for applying reasoning algorithms to context-aware behavioral programs. We then
exemplify the semantics with formal specifications of systems, including a
variant of Conway's Game of Life. Finally, we present a JavaScript-based
implementation of the paradigm and provide two case studies of real-life
context-aware systems (one in robotics and another in IoT) that were developed
using this tool. Throughout the examples and case studies, we provide design
patterns and a methodology for coping with the above challenges.

removing the effects of this background star changes the slope of the spectrum,
resulting in these visible absorbers no longer being detected, eliminating the
need for a non-grey cloud model to adequately fit the data but maintaining the
strong water feature previously seen. However, our analysis of the emission
spectrum suggests the presence of TiO and an atmospheric thermal inversion,
along with a significant amount of water. Given the brightness of the host star

further characterisation with HST, or with future facilities, to better
understand the nature of its atmosphere, to confirm the presence of TiO and to

of the nodes of the graph by means of an iterative diffusion procedure that,
during the learning stage, must be computed at every epoch, until the fixed
point of a learnable state transition function is reached, propagating the
information among the neighbouring nodes. We propose a novel approach to
learning in GNNs, based on constrained optimization in the Lagrangian
framework. Learning both the transition function and the node states is the
outcome of a joint process, in which the state convergence procedure is
implicitly expressed by a constraint satisfaction mechanism, avoiding iterative
epoch-wise procedures and the network unfolding. Our computational structure
searches for saddle points of the Lagrangian in the adjoint space composed of
weights, nodes state variables and Lagrange multipliers. This process is
further enhanced by multiple layers of constraints that accelerate the
diffusion process. An experimental analysis shows that the proposed approach
compares favourably with popular models on several benchmarks.

Bayesian hierarchical model to connect the high-level population parameters to
the IceCube data, allowing us to consistently account for all relevant sources
of uncertainty in our model assumptions. Our results show that sources with a
local density of $n_0 \gtrsim 10^{-7}$ $\rm{Mpc}^{-3}$ and luminosity $L

rare sources with $n_0 \simeq 10^{-9}$ $\rm{Mpc}^{-3}$ and $L \simeq 10^{45}$

that these conclusions are strongly dependent on the source evolution
considered, for which we consider a wide range of models. In doing so, we

the possibility that Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ hosts zero Weyl points or some non-zero

statistical analysis of the simulations, and find 18 correlations describing
the assembly of $L^*$ galaxies and their dark matter haloes based on their GC
population kinematics. The correlations arise because the orbital distributions
of accreted and in-situ GCs depend on the masses and accretion redshifts of
accreted satellites, driven by the combined effects of dynamical fraction,
tidal stripping, and dynamical heating. Because the kinematics of
in-situ/accreted GCs are broadly traced by the metal-rich/metal-poor and
inner/outer populations, the observed GC kinematics are a sensitive probe of
galaxy assembly. We predict that relative to the population of $L^*$ galaxies,
the MW assembled its dark matter and stellar mass rapidly through a combination
of in-situ star formation, more than a dozen low-mass mergers, and $1.4\pm1.2$
early ($z=3.1\pm1.3$) major merger. The rapid assembly period ended early,
limiting the fraction of accreted stars. We conclude by providing detailed
quantitative predictions for the assembly history of the MW.

the emergence of a population with yet more extreme nebular emission
([OIII]+H$\beta$ EW$>$1200 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$) that is rarely seen at
lower redshifts. These objects have extremely large sSFR ($>$30 Gyr$^{-1}$), as
would be expected for systems undergoing a burst or upturn in star formation.
While this may be a short-lived phase, our results suggest that 20% of the

likely undergo intense star formation episodes regularly at z$>$6. We argue
that this population may be among the most effective ionizing agents in the

gravitationally bound clumps (stars) and be present in large number in the
galaxy today. It is therefore of utmost interest to determine if there are
novel observational signatures of this scenario. Work has shown that for
moderately large axion-photon couplings, such clumps can undergo parametric
resonance into photons, for clumps above a critical mass $M^{\star}_c$
determined precisely by some of us in Ref. [1]. In order to obtain a clump
above the critical mass in the galaxy today would require mergers. In this work
we perform full 3-dimensional simulations of pairs of axion clumps and
determine the conditions under which mergers take place through the emission of
scalar waves, including analyzing head-on and non-head-on collisions, phase
dependence, and relative velocities. Consistent with other work in the
literature, we find that the final mass from the merger
$M^{\star}_{\text{final}}\approx 0.7(M^{\star}_1+M^{\star}_2)$ is larger than
each of the original clump masses (for $M^{\star}_1\sim M^{\star}_2$). Hence,
it is possible for sub-critical mass clumps to merge and become super-critical
and therefore undergo parametric resonance into photons. We find that mergers
are expected to be kinematically allowed in the galaxy today for high
Peccei-Quinn scales, which is strongly suggested by unification ideas, although
the collision rate is small. While mergers can happen for axions with lower
Peccei-Quinn scales due to statistical fluctuations in relative velocities, as
they have a high collision rate. We estimate the collision and merger rates
within the Milky Way galaxy today. We find that a merger leads to a flux of
energy on earth that can be appreciable and we mention observational search
strategies.

other in terms of the details of their phase diagrams. Few controllable aspects
aside, this discrepancy is largely believed to be arising from the presence of
a varying degree of twist angle inhomogeneity across different samples. Real
space maps indeed reveal TBG devices splitting into several large domains of
different twist angles. Motivated by these observations, we study the quantum
mechanical tunneling across a domain wall (DW) that separates two such regions.
We show that the tunneling of the moir\'e particles can be understood by the
formation of an effective step potential at the DW. The height of this step
potential is simply a measure of the difference in twist angles. These
computations lead us to identify the global transport signatures for detecting
and quantifying the local twist angle variations. In particular, Using
Landauer-B\""uttiker formalism we compute single-channel conductance ($dI/dV$)
and Fano factor for shot noise (ratio of noise power and mean current). A
zero-bias, sub-meV transport gap is observed in the conductance which scales
with the height of the step potential. One of the key findings of our work is
that transport in presence of twist angle inhomogeneity is ""noisy"", though
sub-Poissonian. In particular, the differential Fano factor peaks near the van
Hove energies corresponding to the domains in the sample. The location and the
strength of the peak is simply a measure of the degree of twist angle
inhomogeneity.

cosmological environment at $z = 7-6$. In order to increase our statistical
sample, we adopt a strategy that allows us to follow the evolution of six
secondary MBHs concomitantly. We find that the magnitude of the
dynamical-friction induced torques is significantly smaller than that of the
large-scale, stochastic gravitational torques arising from the perturbed and
morphologically evolving galactic disc, suggesting that the standard dynamical
friction treatment is inadequate for realistic galaxies at high redshift. The
dynamical evolution of MBHs is very stochastic, and a variation in the initial
orbital phase can lead to a drastically different time-scale for the inspiral.
Most remarkably, the development of a galactic bar in the host system either
significantly accelerates the inspiral by dragging a secondary MBH into the
centre, or ultimately hinders the orbital decay by scattering the MBH in the
galaxy outskirts. The latter occurs more rarely, suggesting that galactic bars
overall promote MBH inspiral and binary coalescence. The orbital decay time can
be an order of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted relying on
dynamical friction alone. The stochasticity, and the important role of global
torques, have crucial implications for the rates of MBH coalescences in the
early Universe: both have to be accounted for when making predictions for the
upcoming LISA observatory.

observations have allowed the estimation of their dipole magnetic field,
placing them in the range $\sim10^{10}$-$10^{11}$ G. The decay of their weak
dipole fields, mediated by the Hall effect and Ohmic dissipation, cannot
provide sufficient thermal energy to power their X-ray luminosity, as opposed
to magnetars whose X-ray luminosities are comparable. Motivated by the question
of producing high X-ray power through magnetic field decay while maintaining a
weak dipole field, we explore the evolution of a crustal magnetic field that
does not consist of an ordered axisymmetric structure, but rather comprises a
tangled configuration. This can be the outcome of a non-self-excited dynamo,
buried inside the crust by fallback material following the supernova explosion.
We find that such initial conditions lead to the emergence of the magnetic
field from the surface of the star and the formation of a dipolar magnetic
field component. An internal tangled magnetic field of the order of $10^{14}$ G
can provide sufficient Ohmic heating to the crust and power CCOs, while the

improvements to explain the strong extraction of AM from stellar cores that is
observed with asteroseismology. One of the often invoked mediators of AM
transport are internal magnetic fields, even though their properties,
observational signatures and influence on stellar evolution are largely
unknown.
  Aims: We study how a fossil, axisymmetric internal magnetic field affects
period spacing patterns of dipolar gravity mode oscillations in main-sequence
stars with masses of 1.3, 2.0 and 3.0 M$_\odot$. We assess the influence of
fundamental stellar parameters on the magnitude of pulsation mode frequency
shifts.
  Methods: We compute dipolar gravity mode frequency shifts due to a fossil,
axisymmetric poloidal-toroidal internal magnetic field for a grid of stellar
evolution models, varying stellar fundamental parameters. Rigid rotation is
taken into account using the traditional approximation of rotation and the
influence of the magnetic field is computed using a perturbative approach.
  Results: We find magnetic signatures for dipolar gravity mode oscillations in
terminal-age main-sequence stars that are measurable for a near-core field
strength larger than $10^{5}$ G. The predicted signatures differ appreciably
from those due to rotation.
  Conclusions: Our formalism demonstrates the potential for the future
detection and characterization of strong fossil, axisymmetric internal magnetic
fields in gravity-mode pulsators near the end of core-hydrogen burning from
Kepler photometry, if such fields exist.

extra-galactic, luminous and rapidly-evolving transient. Both the progenitor
systems and explosion mechanisms of these rapid transients remain a mystery -
the energetics, spectral signatures, and timescales make them challenging to
interpret in established classes of supernovae and tidal disruption events. The
rich, multi-wavelength data-set of AT 2018cow has still left several
interpretations viable to explain the nature of this event. In this paper we
analyse integral-field spectroscopic data of the host galaxy, CGCG 137-068, to
compare environmental constraints with leading progenitor models. We find the
explosion site of AT 2018cow to be very typical of core-collapse supernovae
(known to form from stars with MZAMS ~8-25M), and infer a young stellar
population age at the explosion site of few times 10Myr, at slightly sub-solar
metallicity. When comparing to expectations for exotic intermediate-mass black
hole (IMBH) tidal disruption events,we find no evidence for a potential host
system of the IMBH. In particular, there are no abrupt changes in metallicity
or kinematics in the vicinity of the explosion site, arguing against the
presence of a distinct host system. The proximity of AT 2018cow to strong
star-formation in the host galaxy makes us favour a massive stellar progenitor
for this event.

this emission to observations. Both the prompt and afterglow phases are
considered. For the prompt phase, we assume the coaccelerated electrons are
injected with a power law distribution instantaneously (without additional
heating or reacceleration), which results in bright optical-UV emission in
tension with observations. For the afterglow phase, we constrain the total
kinetic energy of the blast wave by comparing electron thermal synchrotron
radiation to available radio data at $\sim~3$ days. Considering mildly
relativistic outflows with bulk Lorentz factor $\Gamma \gtrsim 2$ (slower
trans-relativistic outflows are not treated), we find that the limited
available energy does not allow for GRB 060218-like afterglows to be the main
origin of UHECRs. This analysis independently constrains the prompt phase as a
major UHECR source as well, given that the prompt energy budget is comparable

that synchrotron emission from thermal electrons is a powerful diagnostic of
the physics of mildly relativistic shocks.

tested by comparing their predictions for galaxy-galaxy-galaxy-lensing (G3L),
which is weak gravitational lensing around galaxy pairs, with observations. We
evaluate the SAMs by Henriques et al. (2015; H15) and by Lagos et al. (2012;
L12), implemented in the Millennium Run, by comparing their predictions for G3L
to observations at smaller scales than previous studies and also for pairs of
lens galaxies from different populations. We compare the G3L signal predicted
by the SAMs to measurements in the overlap of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly
survey (GAMA), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the VISTA Kilo-degree
Infrared Galaxy survey (VIKING), splitting lens galaxies into two colour and
five stellar-mass samples. Using an improved G3L estimator, we measure the
three-point correlation of the matter distribution for mixed lens pairs with
galaxies from different samples, and unmixed lens pairs with galaxies from the
same sample. Predictions by the H15 SAM agree with the observations for all
colour-selected and all but one stellar-mass-selected sample with 95%
confidence. Deviations occur for lenses with stellar masses below
$9.5h^{-2}\mathrm{M}_\odot$ at scales below $0.2h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$.
Predictions by the L12 SAM for stellar-mass selected samples and red galaxies
are significantly higher than observed, while the predicted signal for blue
galaxy pairs is too low. The L12 SAM predicts more pairs of small stellar-mass
and red galaxies than the H15 SAM and the observations, as well as fewer pairs
of blue galaxies. Likely explanations are different treatments of environmental
effects by the SAMs and different models of the initial mass function. We
conclude that G3L provides a stringent test for models of galaxy formation and
evolution.

the maximum number of input bits that each output bit depends on. In
particular, we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm that achieves large fidelity

algorithm based on a {\it non-convex concave} reformulation of the AUC
maximization, in which the communication of both the primal variable and the
dual variable between each worker and the parameter server only occurs after
multiple steps of gradient-based updates in each worker. Compared with the
naive parallel version of an existing algorithm that computes stochastic
gradients at individual machines and averages them for updating the model
parameters, our algorithm requires a much less number of communication rounds
and still achieves a linear speedup in theory. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the \textbf{first} work that solves the {\it non-convex concave
min-max} problem for AUC maximization with deep neural networks in a
communication-efficient distributed manner while still maintaining the linear
speedup property in theory. Our experiments on several benchmark datasets show
the effectiveness of our algorithm and also confirm our theory.

several extremal problems that involve well known parameters of a graph

them while holding the other two fixed. Here we focus in {\em bipartite Moore

the degree/diameter or degree/girth. The fact that there are very few bipartite
Moore graphs suggests the relaxation of some of the constraints implied by the
bipartite Moore bound. First we deal with {\em local bipartite Moore graphs}.
We find in some cases those local bipartite Moore graphs with local girths as
close as possible to the local girths given by a bipartite Moore graph. Second,
we construct a family of $(q+2)$-bipartite graphs of order $2(q^2+q+5)$ and

energy the DC consumes, but especially by how the consumed energy is spread
over time during the billing cycle. More specifically, these electricity costs
are essentially made up of two major charges: Energy Charge, a cost based on
the amount of consumed energy (in kWh), and Peak Charge, a cost based on the
maximum power (in kW) requested during the billing cycle. The latter charge
component is forced to encourage DCs to balance and regulate their power
demands over the billing cycle, allowing the utility company to manage
congestion without increasing supply. This billing model has thus called for
the development of peak power shaving approaches that reduce costs by smoothing
peak power demands over the billing cycle to minimize the Peak Charge
component. In this paper, we investigate peak power shaving approaches, and
begin by using Google data traces to quantify and provide a real sense of how
much electricity cost reduction can peak power demand shaving achieve on a
Google DC cluster. We then discuss why peak power shaving is well-suited for
reducing electricity costs of DCs, and describe two commonly used peak shaving
approaches, namely energy storage and workload modulation. We finally identify
and describe key research problems that remain unsolved and require further
investigation.

tractability than other state-of-the-art fading models. By considering transmit
antenna selection and maximal ratio combining reception at the legitimate and
eavesdropper's receiver sides, we study two relevant scenarios $(i)$ the
transmitter does not know the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI),
and $(ii)$ the transmitter has knowledge of the CSI of the eavesdropper link.
For this purpose, we first obtain novel and tractable expressions for the

backgrounds near Cepheids and assuming they match those at their positions. We
show a direct consequence of crowding by unresolved sources at Cepheid sites is
a reduction in the fractional amplitudes of their light curves. We use a simple
analytical expression to infer crowding directly from the light curve
amplitudes of >200 Cepheids in 3 SNe~Ia hosts and NGC 4258 as observed by HST
-- the first near-infrared amplitudes measured beyond the Magellanic Clouds.
Where local crowding is minimal, we find near-infrared amplitudes match Milky
Way Cepheids at the same periods. At greater stellar densities we find that the
empirically measured amplitudes match the values predicted (with no free
parameters) from crowding assessed in the conventional way from local regions,
confirming their accuracy for estimating the background at the Cepheid
locations. Extragalactic Cepheid amplitudes would need to be ~20% smaller than
measured to indicate additional, unrecognized crowding as a primary source of
the present discrepancy in H_0. Rather we find the amplitude data constrains a
systematic mis-estimate of Cepheid backgrounds to be 0.029 +/- 0.037 mag, more
than 5x smaller than the size of the present ~0.2 mag tension in H_0. We
conclude that systematic errors in Cepheid backgrounds do not provide a

Legacy ExtraGalactic UV survey (LEGUS) and 8 $\mu$m images from the IRAC camera
on the Spitzer Space Telescope for 5 galaxies within 5 Mpc, we investigate how
the 8 $\mu$m dust luminosity correlates with the stellar age on the 30--50 pc
scale of star forming regions. We construct a sample of 97 regions centered at
local peaks of 8 $\mu$m emission, each containing one or more young star
cluster candidates from the LEGUS catalogs. We find a tight anti-correlation
with a Pearson correlation coefficient of $r=-0.84\pm0.05$ between the
mass-normalized dust-only 8 $\mu$m luminosity and the age of stellar clusters
younger than 1 Gyr; the 8 $\mu$m luminosity decreases with increasing age of
the stellar population. Simple assumptions on a combination of stellar and dust
emission models reproduce the observed trend. We also explore how the scatter
of the observed trend depends on assumptions of stellar metallicity, PAH
abundance, fraction of stellar light absorbed by dust, and instantaneous versus
continuous star formation models. We find that variations in stellar
metallicity have little effect on the scatter, while PAH abundance and the
fraction of dust-absorbed light bracket the full range of the data. We also
find that the trend is better explained by continuous star formation, rather
than instantaneous burst models. We ascribe this result to the presence of
multiple star clusters with different ages in many of the regions. Upper limits
of the dust-only 8 $\mu$m emission as a function of age are provided.

distortion in an image fused by an MEF method is removed by using hue
information of the HDR one, on the basis of the constant-hue plane in the RGB

effective to correct hue-distortion caused by conventional MEF methods.

$(N_\text{TB})$ phase, identified in 2011 in liquid crystal dimers, is at the
forefront of soft matter research worldwide. This new nematic phase develops
structural chirality in the isotropic $(I)$ and the uniaxial nematic
$(N_\text{U})$ phases, despite the fact that the molecules forming the
structure are chemically achiral. Molecular, shape-induced flexopolarization
provides a viable mechanism for a qualitative understanding of $N_\text{TB}$
and the related phase transitions. The key question that remains is whether
with this mechanism one can also explain quantitatively the presently existing
experimental data. To address this issue we propose a generalization of the
mesoscopic Landau-de Gennes theory of nematics, where higher-order elastic
terms of the alignment tensor are taken into account, in addition to the
lowest-order flexopolarization coupling. The theory is not only capable of
explaining the appearance of $N_\text{TB}$ but also stays in quantitative
agreement with experimental data. In exemplary calculations, we take the data
known for CB7CB flexible dimer - the ""drosophila fly"" in the studies of
$N_\text{TB}$ [A. J\'{a}kli et al., Rev. Mod. Phys. 90, 045004 (2018)] - and
estimate the constitutive parameters of the model from temperature variation of
the nematic order parameter and the Frank elastic constants in the nematic
phase. Then we seek for relative stability and properties of the isotropic,
uniaxial nematic and twist-bend nematic phases. In particular, we evaluate
various properties of $N_\text{TB}$, like temperature variation of the
structure's wave vector, conical angle, flexopolarization, and remaining order
parameters. We also look into the fine structure of $N_\text{TB}$, like its
biaxiality - the property, which is difficult to access experimentally at the

to exploit higher frequency bands, namely mmWave bands, that were considered

perceptual prediction framework capable of temporal event segmentation by
building stable representations of objects over time and demonstrate it on long

effective. We rely on predictions of high-level features computed by a standard
deep learning backbone. For prediction, we use an LSTM, augmented with an
attention mechanism, trained in a self-supervised manner using the prediction
error. The self-learned attention maps effectively localize and track the
event-related objects in each frame. The proposed approach does not require
labels. It requires only a single pass through the video, with no separate
training set. Given the lack of datasets of very long videos, we demonstrate
our method on video from 10 days (254 hours) of continuous wildlife monitoring
data that we had collected with required permissions. We find that the approach
is robust to various environmental conditions such as day/night conditions,
rain, sharp shadows, and windy conditions. For the task of temporally locating
events, we had an 80% recall rate at 20% false-positive rate for frame-level
segmentation. At the activity level, we had an 80% activity recall rate for one
false activity detection every 50 minutes. We will make the dataset, which is

exponential decrease of the experimental fidelity with the number of qubits and

advantage for circuits deeper than a few hundred gates, while quantum runtimes
for cross-entropy benchmarking limit the region of a quantum advantage to a few

width and depth grows exponentially with respect to reduced error rates, and
our work highlights the importance of continued progress along this line.
Extrapolations of measured error rates suggest that the limiting circuit size

early implementations of the surface code and other quantum error correction

arising in a mixed population of neurons with different excitability
properties. These properties produce mixed mode oscillations (MMOs)
characterized by the combination of large amplitudes and alternate subthreshold
or small amplitude oscillations. Considering the biophysically plausible,
Izhikevich neuron model, we demonstrate that various MMOs, including MMBOs
(mixed mode bursting oscillations) and synchronized tonic spiking appear in a
randomly connected network of neurons, where a fraction of them is in a
quiescent (silent) state and the rest in self-oscillatory (firing) states. We
show that MMOs and other patterns of neural activity depend on the number of
oscillatory neighbors of quiescent nodes and on electrical coupling strengths.
Our results are verified by constructing a reduced-order network model and
supported by systematic bifurcation diagrams as well as for a small-world
network. Our results suggest that, for weak couplings, MMOs appear due to the
de-synchronization of a large number of quiescent neurons in the networks. The
quiescent neurons together with the firing neurons produce high frequency
oscillations and bursting activity. The overarching goal is to uncover a
favorable network architecture and suitable parameter spaces where Izhikevich
model neurons generate diverse responses ranging from MMOs to tonic spiking.

understood in most systems especially in the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size
systems present additional challenges. Even in low dimensions, universality of
the edge and corner contributions to free energies and response functions is
less well understood. The question arises of how universality is maintained in
correction-to-scaling in systems of the same universality class but with very
different corner geometries. 2D geometries deliver the simplest such examples
that can be constructed with and without corners. To investigate how the
presence and absence of corners manifest universality, we analyze the spanning
tree generating function on two finite systems, namely the cobweb and fan
networks. We address how universality can be delivered given that the
finite-size cobweb has no corners while the fan has four. To answer, we appeal
to the Ivashkevich-Izmailian-Hu approach which unifies the generating functions
of distinct networks in terms of a single partition function with twisted
boundary conditions. This unified approach shows that the contributions to the
individual corner free energies of the fan network sum to zero so that it
precisely matches that of the web. Correspondence in each case with results
established by alternative means for both networks verifies the soundness of
the algorithm. Its range of usefulness is demonstrated by its application to
hitherto unsolved problems-namely the exact asymptotic expansions of the
logarithms of the generating functions and the conformal partition functions
for fan and cobweb geometries. Thus, the resolution of a universality puzzle
demonstrates the power of the algorithm and opens up new applications in the
future.

in the interstellar medium by cosmic rays, meaning that the ejected materials
cannot necessarily be considered as pristine. Our high-resolution images reveal
persistent asymmetry in the dust coma, best explained by a thermal lag on the
rotating nucleus causing peak mass loss to occur in the comet nucleus
afternoon. In this interpretation, the nucleus rotates with an obliquity of 30
deg (pole direction RA = 205 deg and Dec. = 52 deg). The subsolar latitude
varied from -35 deg (southern solstice) at the time of discovery to 0 deg
(equinox) in 2020 January, suggesting the importance of seasonal effects.
Subsequent activity likely results from regions freshly activated as the
northern hemisphere is illuminated for the first time.

requires a notion of distance between causal models. While such distances have
been proposed previously, they are limited by focusing on graphical properties
of the causal models being compared. Here, we overcome this limitation by
defining distances derived from the causal distributions induced by the models,

""ladder of causation"" spanning three rungs: observational, interventional, and
counterfactual. Following this organization, we introduce a hierarchy of three
distances, one for each rung of the ladder. Our definitions are intuitively
appealing as well as efficient to compute approximately. We put our causal
distances to use by benchmarking standard causal discovery systems on both

Financial institutions increasingly rely upon data-driven methods for
developing fraud detection systems, which are able to automatically detect and
block fraudulent transactions. From a machine learning perspective, the task of
detecting fraudulent transactions is a binary classification problem.
Classification models are commonly trained and evaluated in terms of
statistical performance measures, such as likelihood and AUC, respectively.
These measures, however, do not take into account the actual business
objective, which is to minimize the financial losses due to fraud. Fraud
detection is to be acknowledged as an instance-dependent cost-sensitive
classification problem, where the costs due to misclassification vary between
instances, and requiring adapted approaches for learning a classification
model. In this article, an instance-dependent threshold is derived, based on
the instance-dependent cost matrix for transfer fraud detection, that allows
for making the optimal cost-based decision for each transaction. Two novel
classifiers are presented, based on lasso-regularized logistic regression and
gradient tree boosting, which directly minimize the proposed instance-dependent
cost measure when learning a classification model. The proposed methods are
implemented in the R packages cslogit and csboost, and compared against
state-of-the-art methods on a publicly available data set from the machine
learning competition website Kaggle and a proprietary card transaction data
set. The results of the experiments highlight the potential of reducing fraud
losses by adopting the proposed methods.

inflation from design effects and the high cost of adding study clusters (such

the preferred approach for improving power to estimate regression-adjusted
average treatment effects (ATEs), further precision gains can be achieved
through covariate selection once primary outcomes have been collected. This
article uses design-based methods underlying clustered RCTs to develop a
Lasso-OLS hybrid procedure for the post-hoc selection of covariates and ATE
estimation that avoids model overfitting and lack of transparency. In the first
stage, lasso estimation is conducted using cluster-level averages, where
asymptotic normality is proved using a new central limit theorem for finite
population regression estimators. In the second stage, ATEs and design-based
standard errors are estimated using weighted least squares with the first stage
lasso covariates. This nonparametric approach applies to continuous, binary,
and discrete outcomes. Simulation results indicate that Type 1 errors of the
second stage ATE estimates are near nominal values and standard errors are near
true ones, although somewhat conservative with small samples. The method is
demonstrated using data from a large, federally funded clustered RCT testing

by quantifying, possibly in an adversarial manner, distances to market prices.
The minimization of the calibration functional relies strongly on a variance
reduction technique based on hedging and deep hedging, which is interesting in
its own right: it allows the calculation of model prices and model implied
volatilities in an accurate way using only small sets of sample paths. For
numerical illustration we implement a SABR-type LSV model and conduct a
thorough statistical performance analysis on many samples of implied volatility
smiles, showing the accuracy and stability of the method.

allows them to be viewed as something akin to a weak semidirect product. The
motivating examples of such extensions are the Artin glueings of topological

generalise. In this paper we show that the lambda-semidirect products of

characterization of weakly Schreier extensions sheds some light on the

between two monoids comes equipped with a natural poset structure, which
induces an order on the set of lambda-semidirect products between two inverse
monoids. We show that Artin glueings are in fact lambda-semidirect products and

  using Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (SBART)",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Popular parametric and semiparametric hazards regression models for clustered
survival data are inappropriate and inadequate when the unknown effects of
different covariates and clustering are complex. This calls for a flexible
modeling framework to yield efficient survival prediction. Moreover, for some
survival studies involving time to occurrence of some asymptomatic events,
survival times are typically interval censored between consecutive clinical
inspections. In this article, we propose a robust semiparametric model for
clustered interval-censored survival data under a paradigm of Bayesian ensemble
learning, called Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees or SBART (Linero and
Yang, 2018), which combines multiple sparse (soft) decision trees to attain
excellent predictive accuracy. We develop a novel semiparametric hazards
regression model by modeling the hazard function as a product of a parametric
baseline hazard function and a nonparametric component that uses SBART to
incorporate clustering, unknown functional forms of the main effects, and
interaction effects of various covariates. In addition to being applicable for
left-censored, right-censored, and interval-censored survival data, our
methodology is implemented using a data augmentation scheme which allows for
existing Bayesian backfitting algorithms to be used. We illustrate the
practical implementation and advantages of our method via simulation studies
and an analysis of a prostate cancer surgery study where dependence on the
experience and skill level of the physicians leads to clustering of survival
times. We conclude by discussing our method's applicability in studies
involving high dimensional data with complex underlying associations.

prevent the spread of pandemics such as COVID-19. Recently, several efforts
have been initiated to track individuals, their movements, and interactions
using technologies, e.g., Bluetooth beacons, cellular data records, and
smartphone applications. Such solutions are often intrusive, potentially
violating individual privacy rights and are often subject to regulations (e.g.,
GDPR and CCPR) that mandate the need for opt-in policies to gather and use
personal information. In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers
organizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for
social distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive
and privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees
and occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties.
Quest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure
protocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's
location history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately
identifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then
informing them via opt-in mechanisms. Quest supports a range of privacy-enabled
applications to ensure adherence to social distancing, monitor the flow of
people through spaces, identify potentially impacted regions, and raise
exposure alerts. We describe the architecture, design choices, and
implementation of the proposed security/privacy techniques in Quest. We, also,
validate the practicality of Quest and evaluate it thoroughly via an actual
campus-scale deployment at UC Irvine over a very large dataset of over 50M

simultaneously mapping vertices in each network to points in Euclidean space

such joint embedding technique, the omnibus embedding of arXiv:1705.09355 ,
which has been successfully used for community detection, anomaly detection,
and hypothesis testing tasks. To date the theoretical properties of this method
have only been established under the strong assumption that the networks are
conditionally i.i.d. random dot product graphs. Herein, we take a first step in
characterizing the theoretical properties of the omnibus embedding in the
presence of heterogeneous network data. Under a latent position model, we show
the omnibus embedding implicitly regularizes its latent position estimates
which induces a finite-sample bias-variance tradeoff for latent position
estimation. We establish an explicit bias expression, derive a uniform
concentration bound on the residual, and prove a central limit theorem
characterizing the distributional properties of these estimates. These explicit
bias and variance expressions enable us to state sufficient conditions for
exact recovery in community detection tasks and develop a pivotal test
statistic to determine whether two graphs share the same set of latent
positions; demonstrating that accurate inference is achievable despite the
estimator's inconsistency. These results are demonstrated in several
experimental settings where statistical procedures utilizing the omnibus
embedding are competitive, and oftentimes preferable, to comparable embedding
techniques. These observations accentuate the viability of the omnibus
embedding for multiple graph inference beyond the homogeneous network setting.

vortical structures that serve the role of connectors for the vortical
interactions in two- and three-dimensional isotropic turbulence. The present
framework represents the vortical interactions on a network, where the vortical
elements are viewed as the nodes and the vortical interactions are regarded as
edges weighted by induced velocity. We identify closely interacting vortical
elements as vortical network communities through community detection
algorithms. We show that the inter- and intra-community interactions can be
used to decompose the governing equation for the evolution of network nodes.
These community-based interactions are used to identify the communities which
have the strongest and weakest interactions amongst them. These vortical
communities are referred to as connector and peripheral communities,
respectively. We demonstrate the influence of the network-based structures to
modify the dynamics of a collection of discrete point vortices. Taking
advantage of the strong inter-community interactions, connector community can
significantly modify the collective dynamics of vortices through the
application of multiple impulse perturbations. We then apply the
community-based framework to extract influential structures in isotropic
turbulence. The connector and peripheral communities extracted from turbulent
flows resemble shear-layer and vortex-core like structures, respectively. The
influence of the connector structures on the flow field and their neighboring
vortical structures is analyzed by adding impulse perturbations to the
connectors in direct numerical simulations. The findings are compared with the
cases of perturbing the strongest vortex tube and shear-layer regions. We find
that perturbing the connector structures enhances local turbulent mixing beyond
what are achieved by the other cases.

Models that specialize on a spatiotemporal application alleviate this obstacle
by exploiting spatial locality, allowing the dyadic relationships between
events to depend only on separation in time and relative distances in real
Euclidean space. Here we generalize this framework to any multivariate Hawkes
process, and harness it as a vessel for embedding arbitrary event types in a
hidden metric space. Specifically, we propose a Hidden Hawkes Geometry (HHG)
model to uncover the hidden geometry between event excitations in a
multivariate point process. The low dimensionality of the embedding regularizes
the structure of the inferred interactions. We develop a number of estimators
and validate the model by conducting several experiments. In particular, we
investigate regional infectivity dynamics of COVID-19 in an early South Korean
record and recent Los Angeles confirmed cases. By additionally performing
synthetic experiments on short records as well as explorations into options
markets and the Ebola epidemic, we demonstrate that learning the embedding
alongside a point process uncovers salient interactions in a broad range of
applications.

neural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours.
There have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts
from existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict
knowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts
connecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a
neural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths
by feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge
graph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for
entities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can
be trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations
between entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a
neural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in
large graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown
more effective than path-based approaches

producing entropy in the environment in order to perform molecular and cellular
functions. However, it remains unclear how broken detailed balance manifests at
macroscopic scales, and how such dynamics support higher-order biological
functions. Here we present a framework to quantify broken detailed balance by
measuring entropy production in macroscopic systems. We apply our method to the
human brain, an organ whose immense metabolic consumption drives a diverse
range of cognitive functions. Using whole-brain imaging data, we demonstrate
that the brain nearly obeys detailed balance when at rest, but strongly breaks
detailed balance when performing physically and cognitively demanding tasks.
Using a dynamic Ising model, we show that these large-scale violations of
detailed balance can emerge from fine-scale asymmetries in the interactions
between elements, a known feature of neural systems. Together, these results
suggest that violations of detailed balance are vital for cognition, and
provide a general tool for quantifying entropy production in macroscopic
systems.

conditions are near chemical equilibrium including Fe I, Fe II, Ti I, Ni I, Ca

contribute through strong lines in the UV and blue-optical. Using the PHOENIX
atmosphere model, we describe how the short-wavelength transit spectrum varies
with equilibrium temperature between 1000 K and 4000 K, as well as the effect
that the rainout of condensates has at these wavelengths. We define two
spectral indices to quantify the strength of the NUV and blue absorption
compared to that in the red-optical, finding that the NUV transit depth will
significantly exceed the transit depth from Rayleigh scattering alone for all
hot Jupiters down to around 1000 K. In the blue-optical, hot Jupiters warmer
than 2000 K will have transit depths larger than that from Rayleigh scattering,
but below 2000 K, Rayleigh scattering can dominate, if present. We further show
that these spectral indices may be used to trace the effects of rainout. We
then compare our simulated transit spectra to existing observations of

$\textit{Gaia}$ DR2 parallaxes and proper motions to reconsider WR star
membership of clusters and associations in the Galactic disk, supplemented by
recent near-IR studies of young massive clusters. We find that only 18$-$36% of
553 WR stars external to the Galactic Centre region are located in clusters, OB
associations or obscured star-forming regions, such that at least 64% of the
known disk WR population are isolated, in contrast with only 13% of O stars
from the Galactic O star Catalogue. The fraction located in clusters, OB
associations or star-forming regions rises to 25$-$41% from a global census of
663 WR stars including the Galactic Centre region. We use simulations to
explore the formation processes of isolated WR stars. Neither runaways, nor low
mass clusters, are numerous enough to account for the low cluster membership
fraction. Rapid cluster dissolution is excluded as mass segregation ensures WR
stars remain in dense, well populated environments. Only low density
environments consistently produce WR stars that appeared to be isolated during
the WR phase. We therefore conclude that a significant fraction of WR
progenitors originate in low density association-like surroundings which expand
over time. We provide distance estimates to clusters and associations host to
WR stars, and estimate cluster ages from isochrone fitting.

Albedo- and Thickness-based feedbacks to be the main amplification channels
through which CO2 anomalies impact SIE in the short/medium run. Further,
conditional forecast analyses reveal that the future path of SIE crucially
depends on the evolution of CO2 emissions, with outcomes ranging from
recovering SIE to it reaching 0 in the 2050's. Finally, Albedo and Thickness

atmosphere-exosphere degeneracy between optically thick and optically thin
mediums, raising the question of whether hydrostatic equilibrium is appropriate
for Na I lines observed at exoplanets. To this end we simulate three
non-hydrostatic, evaporative, density profiles: (i) escaping, (ii) exomoon, and
(iii) torus to examine their imprint on an alkaline exosphere in transmission.
By analyzing an evaporative curve of growth we find that equivalent widths of
$W_{\mathrm{Na D2}} \sim 1- 10$ mA are naturally driven by evaporation rates
$\sim 10^3 - 10^5$ kg/s of pure atomic Na. To break the degeneracy between
atmospheric and exospheric absorption, we suggest that if the line ratio is
$\mathrm{D2/D1} \gtrsim 1.2$ the gas is optically thin on average and roughly
indicating a non-hydrostatic structure of the atmosphere/exosphere. We show
this is the case for Na I observations at hot Jupiters WASP-49b and HD189733b

and system stack support becomes mature, it enables acceleration opportunities
within a mobile system, where the system performance envelope is scaled up with
a plethora of programmable co-processors. Thus, intelligent services designed
for mobile users can choose between running inference on the CPU or any of the
co-processors on the mobile system, or exploiting connected systems, such as
the cloud or a nearby, locally connected system. By doing so, the services can
scale out the performance and increase the energy efficiency of edge mobile
systems. This gives rise to a new challenge - deciding when inference should
run where. Such execution scaling decision becomes more complicated with the
stochastic nature of mobile-cloud execution, where signal strength variations
of the wireless networks and resource interference can significantly affect
real-time inference performance and system energy efficiency. To enable
accurate, energy-efficient deep learning inference at the edge, this paper
proposes AutoScale. AutoScale is an adaptive and light-weight execution scaling
engine built upon the custom-designed reinforcement learning algorithm. It
continuously learns and selects the most energy-efficient inference execution
target by taking into account characteristics of neural networks and available

  Attention with Joint Agent-Map Representation","Revised submission for RA-L",,,,"cs.CV cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the trajectories of surrounding agents is an essential ability for
autonomous vehicles navigating through complex traffic scenes. The future
trajectories of agents can be inferred using two important cues: the locations
and past motion of agents, and the static scene structure. Due to the high
variability in scene structure and agent configurations, prior work has
employed the attention mechanism, applied separately to the scene and agent
configuration to learn the most salient parts of both cues. However, the two
cues are tightly linked. The agent configuration can inform what part of the
scene is most relevant to prediction. The static scene in turn can help
determine the relative influence of agents on each other's motion. Moreover,
the distribution of future trajectories is multimodal, with modes corresponding
to the agent's intent. The agent's intent also informs what part of the scene
and agent configuration is relevant to prediction. We thus propose a novel
approach applying multi-head attention by considering a joint representation of
the static scene and surrounding agents. We use each attention head to generate
a distinct future trajectory to address multimodality of future trajectories.
Our model achieves state of the art results on the nuScenes prediction
benchmark and generates diverse future trajectories compliant with scene
structure and agent configuration.

determine the orbital parameters of satellites including range and range-rate

optical Doppler orbitography measurements of range-rate. The first determines
the Doppler shift directly from a heterodyne measurement of the returned
optical signal. The second aims to improve the precision of the first by
suppressing atmospheric phase noise imprinted on the transmitted optical
signal. We demonstrate the performance of each technique over a 2.2 km
horizontal link with a simulated in-line velocity Doppler shift at the far end.
A horizontal link of this length has been estimated to exhibit nearly half the
total integrated atmospheric turbulence of a vertical link to space. Without
stabilisation of the atmospheric effects, we obtained an estimated range rate
precision of 17 um/s at 1 s of integration. With active suppression of
atmospheric phase noise, this improved by three orders-of-magnitude to an
estimated range rate precision of 9.0 nm/s at 1 second of integration, and 1.1
nm/s when integrated over a 60 s. This represents four orders-of-magnitude
improvement over the typical performance of operational ground to space X-Band
systems in terms of range-rate precision at the same integration time.
  The performance of this system is a promising proof of concept for coherent
optical Doppler orbitography. There are many additional challenges associated

progress towards a 10 km horizontal link to replicate the expected atmospheric

remains unexplored. Developing fully-understandable ranking models is necessary
in some scenarios (e.g., due to legal or policy constraints) where post-hoc

lay the groundwork for intrinsically interpretable learning-to-rank by
introducing generalized additive models (GAMs) into ranking tasks. Generalized

study how to extend GAMs into ranking models which can handle both item-level

instantiate ranking GAMs, we employ neural networks instead of traditional

distilled into a set of simple and compact piece-wise linear functions that are
much more efficient to evaluate with little accuracy loss. We conduct
experiments on three data sets and show that our proposed neural ranking GAMs

modern applications in information security have become much more
time-sensitive, due to the risk of timing side-channel leakage. The timing of
such programs needs to be data-independent and precise. We describe a parallel
synchronous software model, which executes as N parallel threads on a processor
with word-length N. Each thread is a single-bit synchronous machine with
precise, contention-free timing, while each of the N threads still executes as
an independent machine. The resulting software supports fine-grained parallel
execution. In contrast to earlier work to obtain precise and repeatable timing
in software, our solution does not require modifications to the processor
architecture nor specialized instruction scheduling techniques. In addition,
all threads run in parallel and without contention, which eliminates the
problem of thread scheduling. We use hardware (HDL) semantics to describe a
thread as a single-bit synchronous machine. Using logic synthesis and code
generation, we derive a parallel synchronous implementation of this design. We
illustrate the synchronous parallel programming model with practical examples

various tasks such as building an online forward solver for the PDE or
estimating parameters from data observations. It is well understood in other
problems of numerical computation that nonlinear methods such as adaptive
approximation, $n$-term approximation, and certain tree-based methods may
provide improved numerical efficiency. For model reduction, a nonlinear method
would replace the linear space $V_n$ by a nonlinear space $\Sigma_n$. This idea
has already been suggested in recent papers on model reduction where the
parameter domain is decomposed into a finite number of cells and a linear space
of low dimension is assigned to each cell.
  Up to this point, little is known in terms of performance guarantees for such
a nonlinear strategy. Moreover, most numerical experiments for nonlinear model
reduction use a parameter dimension of only one or two. In this work, a step is
made towards a more cohesive theory for nonlinear model reduction. Framing
these methods in the general setting of library approximation allows us to give
a first comparison of their performance with those of standard linear
approximation for any general compact set. We then turn to the study these
methods for solution manifolds of parametrized elliptic PDEs. We study a very
specific example of library approximation where the parameter domain is split
into a finite number $N$ of rectangular cells and where different reduced
affine spaces of dimension $m$ are assigned to each cell. The performance of
this nonlinear procedure is analyzed from the viewpoint of accuracy of
approximation versus $m$ and $N$.

synchrony in periodic retinal spike trains could convey contextual information
of the visual input, which is extracted by computations in the retinal network.
We propose a computational model for image segmentation consisting of a
Kuramoto model of coupled oscillators whose phases model the timing of
individual retinal spikes. The phase couplings between oscillators are shaped
by the stimulus structure, causing cells to synchronize if the local contrast
in their receptive fields is similar. In essence, relaxation in the oscillator
network solves a graph clustering problem with the graph representing feature
similarity between different points in the image. We tested different model
versions on the Berkeley Image Segmentation Data Set (BSDS). Networks with
phase interactions set by standard representations of the feature graph
(adjacency matrix, Graph Laplacian or modularity) failed to exhibit
segmentation performance significantly over the baseline, a model of
independent sensors. In contrast, a network with phase interactions that takes
into account not only feature similarities but also geometric distances between
receptive fields exhibited segmentation performance significantly above
baseline.

high-throughput screenings of nano-materials, amorphous systems and materials

atomic structures into features which can be used by common machine learning

Humans usually have a difficult time directly specifying all the desirable
behaviors that a robot needs to optimize. One common approach is to learn
reward functions from collected expert demonstrations. However, learning reward
functions from demonstrations introduces many challenges: some methods require
highly structured models, e.g. reward functions that are linear in some
predefined set of features, while others adopt less structured reward functions
that on the other hand require tremendous amount of data. In addition, humans
tend to have a difficult time providing demonstrations on robots with high
degrees of freedom, or even quantifying reward values for given demonstrations.
To address these challenges, we present a preference-based learning approach,
where as an alternative, the human feedback is only in the form of comparisons
between trajectories. Furthermore, we do not assume highly constrained
structures on the reward function. Instead, we model the reward function using
a Gaussian Process (GP) and propose a mathematical formulation to actively find
a GP using only human preferences. Our approach enables us to tackle both
inflexibility and data-inefficiency problems within a preference-based learning
framework. Our results in simulations and a user study suggest that our

to translate the interest part of signal f1(t)'s TFPS along the time axis to
couple with signal f2(t)'s TFPS. Such coupling would generate a maximum if

The maximum, if normalized, is called similarity coefficient. The location of
the maximum indicates the time delay between f1(t) and f2(t). Numerical results
show that the similarity coefficient is better than the correlation coefficient
in measuring the correlation degree between two noised signals. Precision and
accuracy of the time delay estimation (TDE) based on the similarity analysis
are much better than those based on cross-correlation (CC) method and

formations is crucial for fluid flow forecasting and hydrocarbon reserves
estimation. The key challenge in these tight formations is that the majority of
the pore sizes are less than 50 nm. At this scale, the fluid properties are
affected by nanoconfinement effects due to the increased fluid-solid
interactions. For instance, gas adsorption to the pore walls could account for
up to 85% of the total hydrocarbon volume in a tight reservoir. Although there
are analytical solutions that describe this phenomenon for simple geometries,
they are not suitable for describing realistic pores, where surface roughness
and geometric anisotropy play important roles. To describe these, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are used since they consider fluid-solid and
fluid-fluid interactions at the molecular level. However, MD simulations are
computationally expensive, and are not able to simulate scales larger than a
few connected nanopores. We present a method for building and training
physics-based deep learning surrogate models to carry out fast and accurate
predictions of molecular configurations of gas inside nanopores. Since training
deep learning models requires extensive databases that are computationally
expensive to create, we employ active learning (AL). AL reduces the overhead of
creating comprehensive sets of high-fidelity data by determining where the
model uncertainty is greatest, and running simulations on the fly to minimize
it. The proposed workflow enables nanoconfinement effects to be rigorously
considered at the mesoscale where complex connected sets of nanopores control
key applications such as hydrocarbon recovery and CO2 sequestration.

SDSTs where the infinite data domain is dropped and only finite alphabets are

Register Transducers (SSRTs), which is a subclass of SDSTs. SDSTs can compare
data values using a linear order on the data domain, which can not be done by
SSRTs.
  We give a machine independent characterization of SSRTs with origin
semantics, along the lines of Myhill-Nerode theorem. Machine independent
characterizations for similar models have formed the basis of learning
algorithms and enabled us to understand fragments of the models. Origin
semantics of transducers track which positions of the output originate from
which positions of the input. Although a restriction, using origin semantics is
well justified and known to simplify many problems related to transducers. We
use origin semantics as a technical building block, in addition to
characterizations of deterministic register automata. However, we need to build
more on top of these to overcome some challenges unique to SSRTs.

computational fluid dynamics, the shape factor is not straightforwardly
available or not well-defined. We propose using the complete velocity profile

perturbation amplification factor. While this can be achieved with regression
models based on a classical fully connected neural network, such a model can be
computationally more demanding. We propose a novel convolutional neural network

Specifically, convolutional layers are first used to extract integral

to map the extracted integral quantities, along with frequency and Reynolds
number, to the output (amplification ratio). Numerical tests on classical
boundary layers clearly demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. More

two-dimensional, low-speed boundary layers, the proposed network encodes

interference is data-dependent, and also correlated within a memory array, and
hence the conventional error correction coding scheme will be inadequate. In
this work, we propose an across-array coding strategy that assigns a codeword

Since the coded bits from different arrays experience independent channels, a

adequately distributed over different memory arrays, the code actually performs
as that over an uncorrelated channel. By performing decoding based on the
scheme of treating-interference-as-noise (TIN), the ReRAM channel over
different memory arrays is equivalent to a block varying channel we defined,

  Isolation",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the last years, security kernels have played a promising role in
reshaping the landscape of platform security on today's ubiquitous embedded
devices. Security kernels, such as separation kernels, enable constructing
high-assurance mixed-criticality execution platforms. They reduce the software
portion of the system's trusted computing base to a thin layer, which enforces
isolation between low- and high-criticality components. The reduced trusted
computing base minimizes the system attack surface and facilitates the use of
formal methods to ensure functional correctness and security of the kernel.
  In this thesis, we explore various aspects of building a provably secure
separation kernel using virtualization technology. In particular, we examine
techniques related to the appropriate management of the memory subsystem. Once
these techniques were implemented and functionally verified, they provide
reliable a foundation for application scenarios that require strong guarantees

useful quantum algorithms with exponential speedups over classical counterparts
are scarce. Recent progress in quantum algorithms for linear-algebra positioned
quantum machine learning (QML) as a potential source of such useful exponential
improvements. Yet, in an unexpected development, a recent series of
""dequantization"" results has equally rapidly removed the promise of exponential
speedups for several QML algorithms. This raises the critical question whether
exponential speedups of other linear-algebraic QML algorithms persist. In this
paper, we study the quantum-algorithmic methods behind the algorithm for
topological data analysis of Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi through this lens. We
provide evidence that the problem solved by this algorithm is classically
intractable by showing that its natural generalization is as hard as simulating
the one clean qubit model -- which is widely believed to require
superpolynomial time on a classical computer -- and is thus very likely immune
to dequantizations. Based on this result, we provide a number of new quantum
algorithms for problems such as rank estimation and complex network analysis,
along with complexity-theoretic evidence for their classical intractability.
Furthermore, we analyze the suitability of the proposed quantum algorithms for
near-term implementations. Our results provide a number of useful applications
for full-blown, and restricted quantum computers with a guaranteed exponential
speedup over classical methods, recovering some of the potential for
linear-algebraic QML to become one of quantum computing's killer applications.

penumbra of sunspots. They were first discovered in chromospheric lines and
have later also been shown to exhibit signals in transition region (TR) lines.
Their origin and manner of evolution is not yet settled. We perform a
comprehensive analysis of PMJs through the use of spectral diagnostics that
span from photospheric to TR temperatures to constrain PMJ properties. We
employed high-spatial-resolution Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope observations in
the Ca II 8542 Angstrom and H-alpha lines, IRIS slit-jaw images, and IRIS
spectral observations in the Mg II h & k lines, the Mg II 2798.75 Angstrom &
2798.82 Angstrom triplet blend, the C II 1334 Angstrom & 1335 Angstrom lines,
and the Si IV 1394 Angstrom & 1403 Angstrom lines. We derived a wide range of
spectral diagnostics from these and investigated other secondary phenomena
associated with PMJs. We find that PMJs exhibit varying degrees of signal in
all of our studied spectral lines. We find low or negligible Doppler velocities
and velocity gradients throughout our diagnostics and all layers of the solar
atmosphere associated with these. Dark features in the inner wings of H-alpha
and Ca II 8542 Angstrom imply that PMJs form along pre-existing fibril
structures. We find evidence for upper photospheric heating in a subset of PMJs
through emission in the wings of the Mg II triplet lines. There is little
evidence for ubiquitous twisting motion in PMJs. There is no marked difference
in onset-times for PMJ brightenings in different spectral lines. PMJs most
likely exhibit only very modest mass-motions, contrary to earlier suggestions.
We posit that PMJs form at upper photospheric or chromospheric heights at
pre-existing fibril structures.

After the disruption, the stellar debris form an expanding gaseous stream. The
morphology and evolution of this stream is particularly interesting as it
ultimately determines the observational properties of the event itself. In this
work we perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the TDE of a star modelled as
a polytropic sphere of index {\gamma} = 5/3, and study the gravitational
stability of the resulting gas stream. We provide an analytical solution for
the evolution of the stream in the bound, unbound and marginally bound case,
that allows us to describe the stream properties and analyse the time-scales of

fueled by the failure of pressure in supporting the gas against its

the black hole tidal forces, giving analytical predictions of the time
evolution of the various forces associated to the stream. Our results point out

been ignored. Thus, existing design is incomplete and less practical. In this
paper, we propose a joint caching, computation and communications mechanism

input data uploading, task executing (with non-negligible time duration) and
computation result downloading, and mathematically characterize it. Then, we
optimize the joint caching, offloading and time allocation policy to minimize
the weighted sum energy consumption subject to the caching and deadline
constraints. The problem is a challenging two-timescale mixed integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) problem, and is NP-hard in general. We convert it into an
equivalent convex MINLP problem by using some appropriate transformations and
propose two low-complexity algorithms to obtain suboptimal solutions of the
original non-convex MINLP problem. Specifically, the first suboptimal solution
is obtained by solving a relaxed convex problem using the consensus alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM), and then rounding its optimal solution
properly. The second suboptimal solution is proposed by obtaining a stationary
point of an equivalent difference of convex (DC) problem using the penalty
convex-concave procedure (Penalty-CCP) and ADMM. Finally, by numerical results,
we show that the proposed solutions outperform existing schemes and reveal
their advantages in efficiently utilizing storage, computation and

the peak position, to the brain tumors. The perturbations induced by the
cell-modification, as a consequence to the cancerous growth, may be responsible
for the widths variation in the Raman spectrum due to vibrational lifetime
alteration enforced at the molecular levels. A consistent cancer induced effect
on the spectral width has been observed for three different brain cells Raman
modes at different frequencies . Raman spectral analysis reveals that for
cancerous cells, the FWHM varies up to 35 % in comparison with the healthy

studying the effect of similar microscopic perturbations, e.g, Fano coupling

investigate network massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission
for mmWave/THz downlink in the presence of mobility and blockage. Considering
the mmWave/THz propagation characteristics, we first propose to apply per-beam
synchronization for network massive MIMO to mitigate the channel Doppler and
delay dispersion effects. Accordingly, we establish a transmission model. We
then investigate network massive MIMO downlink transmission strategies with
only the statistical channel state information (CSI) available at the base
stations (BSs), formulating the strategy design problem as an optimization
problem to maximize the network sum-rate. We show that the beam domain is
favorable to perform transmission, and demonstrate that BSs can work
individually when sending signals to user terminals. Based on these insights,
the network massive MIMO precoding design is reduced to a network sum-rate
maximization problem with respect to beam domain power allocation. By
exploiting the sequential optimization method and random matrix theory, an
iterative algorithm with guaranteed convergence performance is further proposed
for beam domain power allocation. Numerical results reveal that the proposed
network massive MIMO transmission approach with the statistical CSI can
effectively alleviate the blockage effects and provide mobility enhancement
over mmWave and THz bands.

a quadratic function subject to quadratic constraints. Starting from the
classical convex relaxation that uses the McCormick's envelopes, we introduce
12 inequalities that are derived from the ranges of the variables of $(QP)$. We
prove that these general Triangle inequalities cut feasible solutions of the
McCormick's envelopes. We then show how we can compute a convex relaxation
$(P^*)$ which optimal value equals to the ""Shor's plus RLT plus Triangle""
semi-definite relaxation of $(QP)$ that includes the new inequalities. We also
propose a heuristic for solving this huge semi-definite program that serves as
a separation algorithm. We then solve $(QP)$ to global optimality with a
branch-and-bound based on $(P^*)$. Moreover, as the new inequalities involved
the lower and upper bounds on the original variables of $(QP)$, their use in a
branch-and-bound framework accelerates the whole process. We show on the
unitbox instances that our method outperforms the compared solvers.

turbulent plasma. It is well known that large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations
and coherent structures in such an environment obey a fractal scaling, and our
specific aim is to study for the first time the effects of the fractality of
these environments on stochastic acceleration. We have shown that an injected
Maxwellian energy distribution is heated and forms a high energy tail in a very
short time. Using standard parameters for the low solar corona, the injected
Maxwellian distribution of electrons gets heated from the initial 100 eV to 10
KeV, and the power-law index of the high energy tail is about -2.3-4.0. The
high energy tail starts around 100 keV, and reaches 10 MeV. The index of the
power-law tail depends on the system size, and it is in good agreement with
observed values for realistic system sizes. The heating and acceleration
process is very fast (\sim 2 s). The reason why the acceleration time is so
short is that the particles are trapped within small scale parts of the fractal
environment, and their scattering mean free path reduces drastically. The
presence of small scale activity also pulls easily particles from the thermal
pool, so there is no need for a seed population. The mean square displacement
in space and energy is superdiffusive for the high energy particles.

for a human operator. One major reason is due to the complex and slow dynamics
of the ship which need to be accounted for in order to successfully steer the
vehicle. In this work, a two-step optimization-based motion planner is proposed
for autonomous maneuvering of ships in constrained environments such as
harbors. A lattice-based motion planner is used in a first step to compute a
feasible, but suboptimal solution to a discretized version of the motion
planning problem. This solution is then used to enable efficient warm-start and
as a terminal manifold for a second receding-horizon improvement step. Both
steps of the algorithm use a high-fidelity model of the ship to plan feasible
and energy-efficient trajectories. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed for
automatic computation of spatial safety envelopes around the trajectory
computed by the lattice-based planner. These safety envelopes are used in the
second improvement step to obtain collision-avoidance constraints which
complexity scales very well with an increased number of surrounding obstacles.
The proposed optimization-based motion planner is evaluated with successful
results in a simulation study for autonomous docking problems in a model of the
Cape Town~harbor.

inspiralling binaries of compact stars is modified by the nonzero deformability
of the two stars. Hence, the measurement of these corrections has the potential
of providing important information on the equation of state of nuclear matter.
Extensive work has been carried out over the last decade to quantify these
corrections, but it has so far been restricted to stars with zero intrinsic
magnetic fields. While the corrections introduced by the magnetic tension and
magnetic pressure are expected to be subdominant, it is nevertheless useful to
determine the precise conditions under which these corrections become
important. To address this question, we have carried out a second-order
perturbative analysis of the tidal deformability of magnetised compact stars
under a variety of magnetic-field strengths and equations of state describing
either neutron stars or quark stars. Overall, we find that magnetically induced
corrections to the tidal deformability will produce changes in the
gravitational-wave phase evolution that are unlikely to be detected for
realistic magnetic field i.e., $B\sim 10^{10} - 10^{12}\,{\rm G}$. At the same
time, if the magnetic field is unrealistically large, i.e., $B\sim
10^{16}\,{\rm G}$, these corrections would produce a sizeable contribution to
the phase evolution, especially for quark stars. In the latter case, the
induced phase differences would represent a unique tool to measure the
properties of the magnetic fields, providing information that is otherwise hard
to quantify.

various down-stream applications, text-level parsing of discourse rhetorical
structure (DRS) has been drawing more and more attention in recent years.
However, all the previous studies on text-level discourse parsing adopt
bottom-up approaches, which much limit the DRS determination on local
information and fail to well benefit from global information of the overall
discourse. In this paper, we justify from both computational and perceptive
points-of-view that the top-down architecture is more suitable for text-level
DRS parsing. On the basis, we propose a top-down neural architecture toward
text-level DRS parsing. In particular, we cast discourse parsing as a recursive
split point ranking task, where a split point is classified to different levels
according to its rank and the elementary discourse units (EDUs) associated with
it are arranged accordingly. In this way, we can determine the complete DRS as
a hierarchical tree structure via an encoder-decoder with an internal stack.
Experimentation on both the English RST-DT corpus and the Chinese CDTB corpus
shows the great effectiveness of our proposed top-down approach towards
text-level DRS parsing.

on the CaVO lattice. Plaquette and bond operator formalisms have been employed
to obtain the triplet plaquette and bond excitations for two different
parameter regimes in the presence of nearest and next-nearest-neighbor
Heisenberg interactions based on the plaquette-resonating-valence-bond and
dimerized ground states, respectively. In the absence of magnetic field a pair
of six-fold degenerate nodal-loops with distinct topological feature is noted
in the plaquette excitations. They are found to split into three pairs of
two-fold degenerate nodal-loops in the presence of magnetic field. In the other
parameter regime, system hosts two-fold degenerate multiple nodal-lines with a
variety of shapes in the triplon dispersion bands in the presence of magnetic
field. Ground state energy and spin gap have been determined additionally for
the two regimes. Those nodal-lines are expected to be detectable in neutron
scattering experiment on the frustrated antiferromagnet, CaV$_4$O$_9$.

and has infected more than 1,436,000 people in more than 200 countries and
territories as of April 9, 2020. Detecting COVID-19 at early stage is essential
to deliver proper healthcare to the patients and also to protect the uninfected
population. To this end, we develop a dual-sampling attention network to
automatically diagnose COVID- 19 from the community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in
chest computed tomography (CT). In particular, we propose a novel online
attention module with a 3D convolutional network (CNN) to focus on the
infection regions in lungs when making decisions of diagnoses. Note that there
exists imbalanced distribution of the sizes of the infection regions between
COVID-19 and CAP, partially due to fast progress of COVID-19 after symptom
onset. Therefore, we develop a dual-sampling strategy to mitigate the
imbalanced learning. Our method is evaluated (to our best knowledge) upon the
largest multi-center CT data for COVID-19 from 8 hospitals. In the
training-validation stage, we collect 2186 CT scans from 1588 patients for a
5-fold cross-validation. In the testing stage, we employ another independent
large-scale testing dataset including 2796 CT scans from 2057 patients. Results
show that our algorithm can identify the COVID-19 images with the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.944, accuracy of
87.5%, sensitivity of 86.9%, specificity of 90.1%, and F1-score of 82.0%. With

information-theoretic security against channel attacks, but also against
attacks exploiting implementation loopholes. In recent years, much progress has
been made towards realising the first DIQKD experiments, but current proposals
are just out of reach of today's loophole-free Bell experiments. Here, we
significantly narrow the gap between the theory and practice of DIQKD with a
simple variant of the original protocol based on the celebrated
Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) Bell inequality. By using two randomly chosen
key generating bases instead of one, we show that our protocol significantly
improves over the original DIQKD protocol, enabling positive keys in the high
noise regime for the first time. We also compute the finite-key security of the
protocol for general attacks, showing that approximately 1E8 to 1E10
measurement rounds are needed to achieve positive rates using state-of-the-art
experimental parameters. Our proposed DIQKD protocol thus represents a highly
promising path towards the first realisation of DIQKD in practice.

induction, the perceptual phenomenon by which the appearance of a scene region

two displays of different dimensions. This presents a practical challenge for
the preservation of the artistic intentions of filmmakers, as it can lead to
shifts in image appearance between viewing destinations. In this work we show
that a neural field model based on the efficient representation principle is
able to predict induction effects, and how by regularizing its associated
energy functional the model is still able to represent induction but is now
invertible. From this we propose a method to pre-process an image in a
screen-size dependent way so that its perception, in terms of visual induction,
may remain constant across displays of different size. The potential of the
method is demonstrated through psychophysical experiments on synthetic images
and qualitative examples on natural images.

Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM). LIDAR provides a fast and
accurate 3D point cloud map of the environment which helps in map building.
However, processing millions of points in the point cloud becomes a
computationally expensive task. In this paper, a methodology is presented to
generate the segmented surfaces in real time and these can be used in modeling
the 3D objects. At first an algorithm is proposed for efficient map building
from single shot data of spinning Lidar. It is based on fast meshing and
sub-sampling. It exploits the physical design and the working principle of the
spinning Lidar sensor. The generated mesh surfaces are then segmented by
estimating the normal and considering their homogeneity. The segmented surfaces
can be used as proposals for predicting geometrically accurate model of objects
in the robots activity environment. The proposed methodology is compared with
some popular point cloud segmentation methods to highlight the efficacy in
terms of accuracy and speed.

Hamiltonian, eigenvalues can be purely real in a certain range of parameters,
even in the absence of parity and time-reversal symmetry. As it turns out, in
this case of purely real spectrum, the level statistics is that of the Gaussian
orthogonal ensemble. This demonstrates a general feature which we clarify that
a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian whose eigenvalues are purely real can be mapped to
a Hermitian Hamiltonian which inherits the symmetries of the original
Hamiltonian. When the spectrum contains imaginary eigenvalues, we show that the
density of states (DOS) vanishes at the origin and diverges at the spectral
edges on the imaginary axis. We show that the divergence of the DOS originates
from the Dyson singularity in chiral-symmetric one-dimensional Hermitian
systems and derive analytically the asymptotes of the DOS which is different
from that in Hermitian systems.

  tokamak core turbulence with toroidal system size",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Self-interaction is the process by which a microturbulence eigenmode that is
extended along the direction parallel to the magnetic field interacts with
itself non-linearly. This effect is particularly significant in gyrokinetic
simulations accounting for kinetic passing electron dynamics. Self-interaction
is known to generate stationary $E\times B$ zonal flow shear layers at radial
locations near low order mode rational surfaces [Weikl et. al., Phys. Plasmas
25, 072305 (2018)]. We find however that it also plays a significant role in
generating fluctuating zonal flows, which is critical to regulating transport
throughout the radial extent. Unlike the usual picture of zonal flow drive
where microturbulence eigenmodes coherently amplify the flow, the
self-interaction drive of zonal flows from these eigenmodes are uncorrelated
with each other. It is shown that the associated shearing rate of the
fluctuating zonal flows therefore reduces as more toroidal modes are resolved
in the simulation. In flux-tube simulations accounting for the full toroidal
domain, such an increase in the density of toroidal modes corresponds to an
increase in the system size, leading to a finite system size effect that is
distinct from the well-known profile shearing effect.

disks around the T Tauri stars LkCa 15 and J1610. These disks host
dust-depleted inner regions, possibly carved by massive planets, and are of
prime interest to study the imprints of planet-disk interactions. While at
moderate angular resolution they appear as a broad ring surrounding a cavity,
the continuum emission resolves into multiple rings at a resolution of
~60$\times$40 mas (~7.5 au for LkCa 15, ~6 au for J1610) and ~$7\,\mu$Jy
beam$^{-1}$ rms at 1.3 mm. In addition to a broad extended component, LkCa 15
and J1610 host 3 and 2 narrow rings, respectively, with two bright rings in
LkCa 15 being radially resolved. The rings look marginally optically thick,
with peak optical depths of ~0.5 (neglecting scattering), in agreement with
high angular resolution observations of full disks. We perform hydrodynamical
simulations with an embedded, sub-Jovian-mass planet and show that the observed
multi-ringed substructure can be qualitatively explained as the outcome of the
planet-disk interaction. We note however that the choice of the disk cooling
timescale alone can significantly impact the resulting gas and dust
distributions around the planet, leading to different numbers of rings and gaps
and different spacings between them. We propose that the massive outer disk
regions of transition disks are favorable places for planetesimals and possibly
second generation planet formation of objects with a lower mass than the
planets carving the inner cavity (typically few $M_{\rm Jup}$), and that the
annular substructures observed in LkCa 15 and J1610 may be indicative of
planetary core formation within dust-rich pressure traps. Current observations
are compatible with other mechanisms being at the origin of the observed
substructures, in particular with narrow rings generated at the edge of the CO

  Matching-Phase Difference Compensator Network Design Using GaAs Technology",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a quasi-asymmetric Doherty power amplifier (PA) is designed
without load modulation using the GaAs 0.25{\mu}m pHEMT technology to reach an
enlarged output power back-off (OPBO) with circuitry solutions in order to
overcome technology restrictions. To prevent power leakage in auxiliary PA
(PAaux) due to its extremely large off-state impedance, a Wilkinson power
combiner is added to the output. Moreover, an input asymmetric power divider is
designed to guarantee that no considerable power is delivered to main PA
(PAmain) in the high-power region to make it saturated. A two-section matching
network is proposed for PAmain, which simultaneously compensates for phase
differences of the main and auxiliary amplification paths. To control the
significant impedance variation of PAaux versus sweeping power and the
different impedance trajectories of the main and auxiliary amplification paths,
the bias and dimension selection of PAaux are analyzed to reach the desired
output power profile versus input power. These methods overcome impedance
variations and linearity degradation. To achieve the aimed 10% fractional
bandwidth, appropriate low-quality LC-networks are selected as matching
networks. The simulation results indicate the utility of the proposed structure
for microwave link applications. Continuous-wave simulations imply that the
Doherty PA has a 33dBm maximum output power and a 13.5dB power gain with less
than 1dB power gain compression in the desired frequency range (7.6-8.4GHz).
The drain efficiency of 30% at the highest input power, minimum of second and
third harmonic powers of -140dBm and -130dBm, respectively, and OPBO of 7.5dB

study the effect of itinerant electrons on the structure of skyrmion crystal

limit and treating the localized spins as classical vectors. To simulate the
system, we employ hybrid Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (hMCMC) which includes
electron diagonalization in each MCMC update for classical spins. We present
the low temperature results for $12\times 12$ system at electron density
$n=1/3$ which show a sudden jump in skyrmion number when we increase the
hopping strength of the itinerant electrons. We find that this high skyrmion

states at electron filling $n=1/3$ and also pushing the bottom energy states
further down. We show that these results hold for larger system using
travelling cluster variation of hMCMC. We expect that itinerant triangular
magnets might exhibit the possible transition between low density to high

resolve coherent sources without the need of spatial smoothing, hence avoiding

as the minimal Keller-Segel model, but a different dynamics to minimize this
entropy. Consequently, the conditions on the mass for the existence of
stationary solutions or blow-up are the same, however we make the interesting
observation that with the local sensing mechanism the blow-up in the case of

rigorous from a mathematical point via a proof of global existence of weak
solutions for arbitrary large masses and space dimension. The key difference of
our model to the minimal Keller-Segel model is that the structure of the
equation allows for a duality estimate that implies a bound on the
$(H^1)'$-norm of the solutions, which can only grow with a square-root law in
time. This additional $(H^1)'$-bound implies a lower bound on the entropy,

unbounded from below in the supercritical case. Besides, regularity and

non-principal axis (NPA) states, we investigate the relaxation of a freely
precessing triaxial ellipsoidal rotator towards its lowest-energy spin state.
Relaxation of the precession arises from internal dissipative stresses
generated by self-gravitation and inertial forces from spin. We develop a
general theory to determine the viscoelastic stresses in the rotator, under any
linear rheology, for both long-axis (LAM) and short-axis (SAM) modes. By the
methods of continuum mechanics, we calculate the power dissipated by the stress
field and the viscoelastic material strain which enables us to determine the
timescale of the precession dampening. To illustrate how the theory is used, we
apply our framework to a triaxial 1I/2017 (`Oumuamua) and 4179 Toutatis under
the Maxwell regime. For the former, employing viscoelastic parameters typical
of very cold monolithic asteroids renders a dampening timescale longer by a
factor of $10^{10}$ and higher than the timescales found in the works relying
on the $\,Q$-factor approach, whilst the latter yields a significantly shorter
timescale as a consequence of including self-gravitation. We further reduce our
triaxial theory to bodies of an oblate geometry and derive a family of
relatively simple analytic approximations determining the NPA dampening times
for Maxwell rotators, as well as a criterion determining whether
self-gravitation is negligible in the relaxation process. Our approximations
exhibit a relative error no larger than $0.2\%$, when compared to numerical
integration, for close to non-dissipative bodies and $0.002\%$ for highly
energy dissipating rotators.

Functionality, an operational overview, and a scientific pipeline will be

Unlike the aforementioned photoionised codes this application does not require
any coding experience, nor the need to derive complex mathematical models,
instead utilising the select features from Cloudy/PyCloudy and Shape. The
software was developed using a formal software development lifecycle, written
in Python and will work without the need to install any development

contrary to standard scalar-tensor theories, TMST offer extremely rich spectrum
of solutions and allow for large deviations from general relativity. One of the
most interesting objects in these theories are the topological neutron stars.
The main goal in the present paper is to study their radial stability since
many branches of solutions can exist even for a fixed value of the topological
charge. It turns out that only one of these branches is stable for each value
of the topological charge while all the rest are unstable. The stable branch is
exactly the one that spans from small to large neutron star masses having as
well moderate values of the radii in agreement with the observations. As
expected, it becomes unstable at the maximum of the mass. The frequencies of
the radial modes are examined and it turns out that in most cases the mode
frequencies are larger than the general relativistic ones and they increase
with the increase of the topological charge. All this shows that the
topological neutron stars are viable astrophysical objects that should be
explored further in order to determine their observational manifestations.

almost every major city. In these urban areas residents with different racial

famous agent-based model for residential segregation explains how such clusters
can form even if all agents are tolerant, i.e., if they agree to live in mixed
neighborhoods. For segregation to occur, all it needs is a slight bias towards
agents preferring similar neighbors. Very recently, Schelling's model has been
investigated from a game-theoretic point of view with selfish agents that
strategically select their residential location. In these games, agents can
improve on their current location by performing a location swap with another
agent who is willing to swap. We significantly deepen these investigations by
studying the influence of the underlying topology modeling the residential area
on the existence of equilibria, the Price of Anarchy and on the dynamic
properties of the resulting strategic multi-agent system. Moreover, as a new
conceptual contribution, we also consider the influence of locality, i.e., if
the location swaps are restricted to swaps of neighboring agents. We give
improved almost tight bounds on the Price of Anarchy for arbitrary underlying
graphs and we present (almost) tight bounds for regular graphs, paths and
cycles. Moreover, we give almost tight bounds for grids, which are commonly
used in empirical studies. For grids we also show that locality has a severe

galaxies declines with increasing age as a function of stellar mass ($M^*$) as
well as environment. On the filaments, metallicity of galaxies varies as a
function of their distance from the spine of the filament, such that galaxies
closer to the centre of the filaments have lower metallicity relative to their
counterparts 1 Mpc away from it. The mean age of intermediate mass galaxies
($10^{10} < M^*/M_{\odot} < 10^{10.5}$) galaxies is statistically significantly
different in different environments such that, the galaxies in clusters are
older than the filament galaxies by 1-1.5 Gyr, while their counterparts in the
voids are younger than filament galaxies by $\sim 1$ Gyr. The massive galaxies
($M^*/M_{\odot} > 10^{10.5}$), on the other hand show no such difference for
the galaxies in clusters and filaments, but their counterparts in voids are
found to be younger by $\sim 0.5$ Gyr. At fixed age however, Z of galaxies is
independent of their $M^*$ in all environments, except the most massive

compared to the one that uses a constant under-relaxation parameter. The solver
is validated against two FSI benchmarks in which a thin, finite thickness,
elastic splitter plate is attached to the lee side of a circular or square
rigid cylinder, subjected to laminar flow. In these two-dimensional benchmarks,
the flow induces a wave-like deformation in the plate, and it attains a
periodic self-sustained oscillation. We employ the FSI solver to analyze the
flow-induced vibration (FIV) of the plate in a uniform laminar free-stream flow
for a wide range of mass ratio and bending stiffness at Reynolds number ($Re$)
of 100, based on the diameter of the cylinder. At the given $Re$,
two-dimensional numerical simulations show that the FIV of the plate
effectively depends only on the mass ratio and bending stiffness. The largest

where the vortex shedding frequency of the coupled fluid-structure system is

ratio of the two quantities does not vary with radius. This ratio does,
however, decrease systematically as the stellar mass of the galaxy increases.
Analysis of the radial profiles of the two dust attenuation measures suggests
that there is a disproportionately high concentration of birth clouds
(incorporating gas, young stars and clumpy dust) nearer to the centres of
star-forming spiral galaxies.

carried out R-band polarization observations of the stars projected on the
cloud to map the pc-scale magnetic field geometry and made spectroscopic
observations of the entire cloud in 12CO, C18O and N2H+ (J=1-0) lines to
investigate its kinematic structure. We obtained a distance of 340$\pm$3 pc to
the LDN 1147/1158, complex based on the Gaia DR2 parallaxes and proper motion
values of the three YSOs associated with the complex. A single filament of

coma-shaped cloud. Based on the relationships between the ICMF, CMF, filament
orientations, outflow direction, and the presence of an hour-glass morphology
of the magnetic field, it is likely that the magnetic field had played an
important role in the star formation process in LDN 1157. Combining the proper
motions of the YSOs and the radial velocity of LDN 1147/1158 and another
complex LDN 1172/1174 which is situated $\sim2$\dgr~east of it, we found that
both the complexes are moving collectively toward the Galactic plane. The
filamentary morphology of the east-west segment of LDN 1157 may have formed as

reaction-diffusion equations that constitutes a simplified and relaxed version
of a thermodynamically consistent phase field model for tumor growth originally
introduced in [12]. The model takes the effect of chemotaxis into account but
neglects velocity contributions. The unknown quantities of the governing state
equations are the chemical potential, the (normalized) tumor fraction, and the
nutrient extra-cellular water concentration. The equation governing the
evolution of the tumor fraction is dominated by the variational derivative of a
double-well potential which may be of singular (e.g., logarithmic) type. In
contrast to the recent paper [10] on the same system, we consider in this paper
sparsity effects, which means that the cost functional contains a
nondifferentiable (but convex) contribution like the $L^1-$norm. For such
problems, we derive first-order necessary optimality conditions and conditions
for directional sparsity, both with respect to space and time, where the latter
case is of particular interest for practical medical applications in which the
control variables are given by the administration of cytotoxic drugs or by the
supply of nutrients. In addition to these results, we prove that the
corresponding control-to-state operator is twice continuously differentiable
between suitable Banach spaces, using the implicit function theorem. This
result, which complements and sharpens a differentiability result derived in

driving, since it needs to infer the latent intention from the behaviors and
interactions from traffic participants. This problem is intrinsically hard,
because each participant may behave differently under different environments
and interactions. This key is to effectively model the interlaced influence
from both spatial context and temporal context. Existing work usually encodes
these two types of context separately, which would lead to inferior modeling of
the scenarios. In this paper, we first propose a unified approach to treat time
and space dimensions equally for modeling spatio-temporal context. The proposed
module is simple and easy to implement within several lines of codes. In
contrast to existing methods which heavily rely on recurrent neural network for
temporal context and hand-crafted structure for spatial context, our method
could automatically partition the spatio-temporal space to adapt the data.
Lastly, we test our proposed framework on two recently proposed trajectory
prediction dataset ApolloScape and Argoverse. We show that the proposed method
substantially outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining its simplicity. These encouraging results further validate the

marine sediments, a source of O2. Here we compile and confront a database of C,
Fe, S and H exchanges between the fluid Earth (atmosphere, ocean, biosphere)
and lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) with the record of deoxygenation to
quantify organic carbon sources and sinks in the Cenozoic. We show that the
subduction of oxidized oceanic lithosphere and degassing of reduced gas from
the Earth's interior is a sink of oxygen, and that this sink significantly
exceeds the rate of atmospheric deoxygenation in the Pleistocene. A relative
constancy of atmospheric O2 in the Cenozoic requires that the organic carbon
cycle was a net source of O2 and sink of CO2, photosynthesis outpaced
respiration by an average of ca 40 MtC yr-1 over the last 50 million years. The
cost for the relatively invariant atmospheric oxygen concentration is the
coexistence of two photosynthetically-driven imbalances in the cycles of iron
and carbon that offset each other to near perfection. The weak escape of OC
from continents and oceans to the lithosphere is more intriguing. It
demonstrates that the organic carbon cycle remains under surprisingly strong
kinetic control, despite evolution/optimization of respiratory metabolisms and
rising atmospheric O2 for more than 2.4 billion years.

simple neighborhood queries under mixed data space, standard practice is to
consider numerical and categorical variables separately and combining them
based on some suitable distance functions. Alternatives, such as Kernel
learning or Principal Component do not explicitly consider the inter-dependence

address this issue, we explicitly decouple this task into two sub-tasks:
illumination enhancement and noise suppression. We propose to learn a two-stage

unsupervised fashion. To facilitate the unsupervised training of our model, we
construct samples with pseudo labels. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive
content loss to suppress real image noise in different regions based on
illumination intensity. In addition to conventional benchmark datasets, a new
unpaired low-light image enhancement dataset is built and used to thoroughly
evaluate the performance of our model. Extensive experiments show that our

feelings. However, the synergy between human and technology can be strengthened
if the technology is able to distinguish and react to human emotions. Models
that rely on unconscious indications of human emotions, such as
(neuro)physiological signals, hold promise in personalization of feedback and
adaptation of the interaction. The current study elaborated on adopting a
predictive approach in studying human emotional processing based on brain
activity. More specifically, we investigated the proposition of predicting
self-reported human empathy based on EEG cortical asymmetry in different areas
of the brain. Different types of predictive models i.e. multiple linear
regression analyses as well as binary and multiclass classifications were
evaluated. Results showed that lateralization of brain oscillations at specific
frequency bands is an important predictor of self-reported empathy scores.
Additionally, prominent classification performance was found during
resting-state which suggests that emotional stimulation is not required for
accurate prediction of empathy -- as a personality trait -- based on EEG data.
Our findings not only contribute to the general understanding of the mechanisms
of empathy, but also facilitate a better grasp on the advantages of applying a
predictive approach compared to hypothesis-driven studies in neuropsychological
research. More importantly, our results could be employed in the development of
brain-computer interfaces that assist people with difficulties in expressing or
recognizing emotions.

5-dimensional EGB gravity, the existence of phase transition requires a narrow
range of the 4D EGB coupling with particular critical values, while the

  Methods: A discretized Halbach permanent magnet array with a clear bore
diameter of 27 cm was designed for operation at 50 mT. Custom built gradient
coils, radiofrequency coil, gradient amplifiers and radiofrequency amplifier
were integrated and tested on both phantoms and in vivo.
  Results: Phantom results showed that the gradient non-linearity in the y- and
z-directions was less than 5% over a 15 cm field-of-view and did not need
correcting. For the x-direction, it was significantly greater, but could be
partially corrected in post-processing. Three dimensional In vivo scans of the
brain of a healthy volunteer using a turbo-spin echo sequence were acquired at
a spatial resolution of 4x4x4 mm in a time of ~2 mins. T1-weighted and
T2-weighted scans showed a good degree of tissue contrast. In addition, in vivo

field is analyzed. In contrast to previous considerations of the problem, the
initial state of the electron represents a localized wave packet, and a spatial
envelope is introduced for the laser pulse, which allows one to take into
account the finite size of both objects. Special attention is paid to
ultrashort pulses possessing a high degree of unipolarity. Within a classical
treatment (both nonrelativistic and relativistic), proportionality between the
change of the electron spin projections and the electric field area of the
pulse is clearly demonstrated. We also perform calculations of the electron
spin dynamics according to the Dirac equation. Evolving the electron wave
function in time, we compute the mean values of the spin operator in various
forms. It is shown that the classical relativistic predictions are accurately
reproduced when using the Foldy-Wouthuysen operator. The same results are
obtained when using the Lorentz transformation and the nonrelativistic (Pauli)
spin operator in the particle's rest frame.

LEGUS and Halpha-LEGUS surveys. We improve the spectral energy fitting method
used to estimate cluster ages and find that the results, particularly for older
clusters, are in better agreement with those from spectroscopy. The inclusion
of Halpha measurements, the role of stochasticity for low mass clusters, the
assumptions about reddening, and the choices of SSP model and metallicity all
have important impacts on the age-dating of clusters. A comparison with ages
derived from stellar color-magnitude diagrams for partially resolved clusters
shows reasonable agreement, but large scatter in some cases. The fraction of
light found in clusters relative to the total light (i.e., T_L) in the U, B,
and V filters in 25 different ~kpc-size regions throughout NGC 4449 correlates
with both the specific Region Luminosity, R_L, and the dominant age of the
underlying stellar population in each region. The observed cluster age
distribution is found to decline over time as dN/dt ~ t^g, with g=-0.85+/-0.15,
independent of cluster mass, and is consistent with strong, early cluster
disruption. The mass functions of the clusters can be described by a power law
with dN/dM ~ M^b and b=-1.86+/-0.2, independent of cluster age. The mass and
age distributions are quite resilient to differences in age-dating methods.
There is tentative evidence for a factor of 2-3 enhancement in both the star
and cluster formation rate ~100 - 300 Myr ago, indicating that cluster
formation tracks star formation generally. The enhancement is probably
associated with an earlier interaction event.

including dose-rate constants, radial dose functions with functional fitting
parameters, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away dose-rate tables,
Primary-Scatter separation dose tables (for some sources), and mean photon

of the egs_brachy distribution. METHODS: Datasets are calculated after a
systematic recoding of the source geometries using the egs++ geometry package
and its egs_brachy extensions. Full scatter water phantoms with varying voxel
resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. New
statistical uncertainties of source volume corrections for phantom voxels which
overlap with brachytherapy sources are implemented in egs_brachy, and all
CLRPv2 data include these uncertainties. For validation, data are compared to
CLRPv1 and other data in the literature. DATA ACCESS/FORMAT: Data are available
at https://physics.carleton.ca/ clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2. As well as
being presented graphically in comparisons to previous calculations, data are
available in Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheets for each source. APPLICATIONS: The
database has applications in research, dosimetry, and brachytherapy planning.
This comprehensive update provides the medical physics community with more
accurate TG-43 dose evaluation parameters, as well as fully-benchmarked source
models distributed with egs_brachy.

emerged many studies that model a session as a sequence or a graph via
investigating temporal transitions of items in a session. However, these
methods compress a session into one fixed representation vector without
considering the target items to be predicted. The fixed vector will restrict
the representation ability of the recommender model, considering the diversity

to a problem in polynomial time and space then the LP constructed is also of
polynomial size and its optimum solution contains $x$ as well as a complete
execution trace of the algorithm. Their method led us to the construction of a
compiler called Sparktope which we describe in this paper. This compiler allows
one to generate polynomial sized LPs for problems in P that have exponential
extension complexity, such as matching problems in non-bipartite graphs.
  In this paper we describe Sparktope, the language Sparks, and the assembler

space-time scales of solutions to a heat equation with a Caputo $\alpha$-time

integrable, and, when required, to be also in $L^p$. A main difficulty in the
analysis comes from the singularity in space at the origin of the fundamental
solution of the equation when~$N>1$.
  The rate of decay in $L^p$ norm in the characteristic scale, $|x|\asymp
t^{\alpha/2}$, dictated by the scaling invariance of the equation, is
$t^{-\frac{\alpha N}{2}(1-\frac1p)}$. In compact sets it is $t^{-\alpha/2}$ for
$N=1$, $t^{-\alpha}$ for $N\ge 3$, and $t^{-\alpha}\log t$ in the critical
dimension $N=2$. In intermediate scales, going to infinity but more slowly than
$t^{\alpha/2}$, we have an intermediate decay rate. In fast scales, going to
infinity faster than $t^{\alpha/2}$, there is no universal rate, valid for all
solutions, as we will show by means of some examples. Anyway, in such scales
solutions decay faster than in the characteristic one.
  When divided by the decay rate, solutions behave for large times in the
characteristic scale like $M$ times the fundamental solution, where $M$ is the
integral of the initial datum. The situation is very different in compact sets,
where they converge to the Newtonian potential of the initial datum if $N\ge
3$, one of the main novelties of the paper, and to a constant if $N=1,2$. In
intermediate scales they approach a multiple of the fundamental solution of the
Laplacian if $N\ge 3$, and a constant in low dimensions. The asymptotic
behavior in scales that go to infinity faster than the characteristic one
depends strongly on the behavior of the initial datum at infinity. We give
results for certain initial data with specific decays.

flexible latent dimensionality, which can be seamlessly adjusted for varying
distortion and dimensionality requirements. In the proposed RL-AEs, instead of
a deterministic bottleneck architecture, we use an over-complete representation
that is stochastically regularized with weighted dropouts, in a manner
analogous to sparse AE (SAE). Unlike SAEs, our RL-AEs employ monotonically
increasing dropout rates across the latent representation nodes such that the
latent variables become sorted by importance like in principal component
analysis (PCA). This is motivated by the rateless property of conventional PCA,
where the least important principal components can be discarded to realize
variable rate dimensionality reduction that gracefully degrades the distortion.
In contrast, since the latent variables of conventional AEs are equally
important for data reconstruction, they cannot be simply discarded to further
reduce the dimensionality after the AE model is trained. Our proposed
stochastic bottleneck framework enables seamless rate adaptation with high
reconstruction performance, without requiring predetermined latent
dimensionality at training. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed
RL-AEs can achieve variable dimensionality reduction while achieving low
distortion compared to conventional AEs.

systems and technological applications. The traditional concept of contact
angle, a purely geometrical measure related to curvature, is often used for
characterizing the wetting state of a system. It can be determined from Young's
equation by applying equilibrium thermodynamics. However, whether contact angle
is a representative measure of wetting for systems with significant complexity
is unclear. Herein, we hypothesize that topological principles based on the
Gauss-Bonnet theorem could yield a robust measure to characterize wetting.
  Theory and Experiments We introduce a macroscopic contact angle based on the
deficit curvature of the fluid interfaces that are imposed by contacts with
other immiscible phases. We perform sessile droplet simulations followed by
multiphase experiments for porous sintered glass and Bentheimer sandstone to
assess the sensitivity and robustness of the topological approach and compare
the results to other traditional approaches.
  Findings We show that the presented topological principle is consistent with
thermodynamics under the simplest conditions through a variational analysis.
Furthermore, we elucidate that at sufficiently high image resolution the
proposed topological approach and local contact angle measurements are
comparable. While at lower resolutions, the proposed approach provides more
accurate results being robust to resolution-based effects. Overall, the
presented concepts open new pathways to characterize the wetting state of
complex systems and theoretical developments to study multiphase systems.

optimize and compare several steady-state and transient gradient-echo based
qMRI methods, such as magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), for joint T1 and
T2 mapping. The impact of undersampling was also evaluated, assuming incoherent
aliasing that is treated as noise by parameter estimation. In-vivo validation
of the efficiency metric was also performed. Transient methods such as MRF can
be up to 3.5 times more efficient than steady-state methods, when spatial
undersampling is ignored. If incoherent aliasing is treated as noise during
least-squares parameter estimation, the efficiency is reduced in proportion to
the SNR of the data, with reduction factors of 5 often seen for practical SNR
levels. In-vivo validation showed a very good agreement between the theoretical
and experimentally predicted efficiency. This work presents and validates an
efficiency metric to optimize and compare the performance of qMRI methods.
Transient methods were found to be intrinsically more efficient than
steady-state methods, however the effect of spatial undersampling can
significantly erode this advantage.

various copy mechanisms to fill slots with values. Our model has no need to
maintain a list of candidate values. Instead, all values are extracted from the
dialog context on-the-fly. A slot is filled by one of three copy mechanisms:
(1) Span prediction may extract values directly from the user input; (2) a
value may be copied from a system inform memory that keeps track of the
system's inform operations; (3) a value may be copied over from a different
slot that is already contained in the dialog state to resolve coreferences
within and across domains. Our approach combines the advantages of span-based
slot filling methods with memory methods to avoid the use of value picklists
altogether. We argue that our strategy simplifies the DST task while at the
same time achieving state of the art performance on various popular evaluation
sets including Multiwoz 2.1, where we achieve a joint goal accuracy beyond 55%.

dramatically smaller state and observation spaces. Evaluation in a simulated 3D

break-up by dewetting from the holes grooved at the triple junctions down to

at long distances, and superfluid-like at short distances. The presence of the
superfluid degrees of freedom then gives specific contributions to the bulk
viscosity, the shear viscosity, and diffusion coefficients of the ordinary
theory at long distances which we compute. This determines, in some cases, the
leading dependence of the transport parameters of QCD on the pion mass. We
analyze the predictions of this computation, as the system approaches the
$O(4)$ critical point.

results in the color image processing, because it treats the color image as a
whole rather than as a separate color space component, thus it can make full
use of the high correlation among RGB channels. Recently, low-rank quaternion
matrix completion (LRQMC) methods have proven very useful for color image
inpainting. In this paper, we propose three novel LRQMC methods based on three
quaternion-based bilinear factor (QBF) matrix norm minimization models.
Specifically, we define quaternion double Frobenius norm (Q-DFN), quaternion
double nuclear norm (Q-DNN) and quaternion Frobenius/nuclear norm (Q-FNN), and
then show their relationship with quaternion-based matrix Schatten-p (Q-
Schatten-p ) norm for certain p values. The proposed methods can avoid
computing quaternion singular value decompositions (QSVD) for large quaternion
matrices, and thus can effectively reduce the calculation time compared with
existing (LRQMC) methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art low-rank
(quaternion) matrix completion methods.

The potential of reset controllers to solve this important challenge has been

non-linear controllers, the stability analysis for these controllers is complex
and relies on parametric models of the systems which may hinder the
applicability of these controllers in industry. The well-known Hbeta method
tries to solve this significant issue. However, assessing the H\b{eta}
condition in the frequency-domain is complex, especially for high dimensional
plants. In addition, it cannot be used to assess UBIBS stability of reset
control systems in the case of reseting to non-zero values. These problems have
been solved in this paper for the first order reset elements, and an
easy-to-use frequency approach for assessing stability of reset control systems

a practical example.

distribution at small $S_{\perp}$ region but a suppression at large $S_{\perp}$

more pencil-like. We demonstrate that for events with 2 jets in the final-state

with medium-induced gluon radiation. However, for events with $\ge 3$~jets,
parton energy loss in the QCD medium leads to the events more pencil-like due
to jet number reduction, where less energetic jets may lose their energies and
then fall off the jet selection kinematic cut. These two effects offset each
other and in the end result in more jetty events in heavy-ion collisions
relative to that in p+p.

showing that acetylene and aliphatic species form efficiently in the dust

carbon. The incorporation of alkyl substituents into aromatics can be
rationalized by a mechanism involving hydrogen abstraction followed by methyl
addition. All the species detected in gas phase are incorporated into the

multiple biases at once, researchers can underestimate -- or overestimate --
their joint impact. We show that it is possible to bound the total composite
bias due to these three sources, and to use that bound to assess the
sensitivity of a risk ratio to any combination of these biases. We derive
bounds for the total composite bias under a variety of scenarios, providing
researchers with tools to assess their total potential impact. We apply this
technique to a study where unmeasured confounding and selection bias are both
concerns, and to another study in which possible differential exposure
misclassification and unmeasured confounding are concerns. We also show that a
""multi-bias E-value"" can describe the minimal strength of joint bias-parameter
association necessary for an observed risk ratio to be compatible with a null
causal effect (or with other pre-specified effect sizes). This may provide
intuition about the relative impacts of each type of bias. The approach we

correcting spurious sample correlations due to hidden confounders in
genome-wide gene expression data. In applications where some confounding
factors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and
latent variance components in random effect models is a challenge that has so
far relied on numerical gradient-based optimizers to maximize the likelihood
function. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting solution is poorly
characterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove
analytically that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen
orthogonal to the known confounding factors, in other words, that
maximum-likelihood latent variables explain sample covariances not already
explained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted
maximum-likelihood method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing
the likelihood on the restricted subspace orthogonal to the known confounding
factors, and show that this reduces to probabilistic PCA on that subspace. The
method then estimates the variance-covariance parameters by maximizing the
remaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using a
newly derived analytic solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based
optimizers, our method attains greater or equal likelihood values, can be
computed using standard matrix operations, results in latent factors that don't
overlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by several orders of
magnitude. Hence the restricted maximum-likelihood method facilitates the
application of random effect modelling strategies for learning latent variance
components to much larger gene expression datasets than possible with current
methods.

energy associated with data transfers in data-intensive applications such as
HE. This paper introduces CiM-HE, a Computing-in-memory (CiM) architecture that
can support operations for the B/FV scheme, a somewhat homomorphic encryption
scheme for general computation. CiM-HE hardware consists of customized
peripherals such as sense amplifiers, adders, bit-shifters, and sequencing
circuits. The peripherals are based on CMOS technology, and could support
computations with memory cells of different technologies. Circuit-level
simulations are used to evaluate our CiM-HE framework assuming a 6T-SRAM

implementations, and (ii) an FPGA-based HE accelerator implementation. When
compared to a CPU solution, CiM-HE obtains speedups between 4.6x and 9.1x, and
energy savings between 266.4x and 532.8x for homomorphic multiplications (the
most expensive HE operation). Also, a set of four end-to-end tasks, i.e., mean,

COVID-19 antivirals either through accurate in-silico screens or by effectively
guiding on-going at-scale experimental efforts. However, existing prediction
tools have limited ability to accommodate scarce or fragmented training data
currently available. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to learn
predictors that can generalize or extrapolate beyond the heterogeneous data.
Our method builds on and extends recently proposed invariant risk minimization,
adaptively forcing the predictor to avoid nuisance variation. We achieve this
by continually exercising and manipulating latent representations of molecules
to highlight undesirable variation to the predictor. To test the method we use
a combination of three data sources: SARS-CoV-2 antiviral screening data,
molecular fragments that bind to SARS-CoV-2 main protease and large screening
data for SARS-CoV-1. Our predictor outperforms state-of-the-art transfer
learning methods by significant margin. We also report the top 20 predictions
of our model on Broad drug repurposing hub.

authorities have put in place a series of measures, including quarantines,
social distancing, and travel restrictions. While these strategies have
effectively dealt with the critical situations of outbreaks, the combination of
the pandemic and mobility controls has slowed China's economic growth,
resulting in the first quarterly decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since
GDP began to be calculated, in 1992. To characterize the potential shrinkage of
the domestic economy, from the perspective of mobility, we propose two new
economic indicators: the New Venues Created (NVC) and the Volumes of Visits to
Venue (V^3), as the complementary measures to domestic investments and
consumption activities, using the data of Baidu Maps. The historical records of
these two indicators demonstrated strong correlations with the past figures of
Chinese GDP, while the status quo has dramatically changed this year, due to
the pandemic. We hereby presented a quantitative analysis to project the impact
of the pandemic on economies, using the recent trends of NVC and V^3. We found
that the most affected sectors would be travel-dependent businesses, such as
hotels, educational institutes, and public transportation, while the sectors
that are mandatory to human life, such as workplaces, residential areas,
restaurants, and shopping sites, have been recovering rapidly. Analysis at the
provincial level showed that the self-sufficient and self-sustainable economic
regions, with internal supplies, production, and consumption, have recovered
faster than those regions relying on global supply chains.

formation histories (SFHs). From the SFHs, we are able to build maps indicating
the present-day distribution of stellar populations of different ages in each
galaxy. We find small negative mean age gradients in most spiral galaxies,
especially at high stellar mass, which reflects the formation times of stellar
populations at different galactocentric radii. We show that the youngest
(<10^{8.5} years) populations exhibit significantly more extended distributions
than the oldest (>10^{9.5} years), again with a strong dependence on stellar
mass. By interpreting the radial profiles of ""time slices"" as indicative of the
size of the galaxy at the time those populations had formed, we are able to
trace the simultaneous growth in mass and size of the spiral galaxies over the
last 10 Gyr. Despite finding that the evolution of the measured light-weighted
radius is consistent with inside-out growth in the majority of spiral galaxies,
the evolution of an equivalent mass-weighted radius has changed little over the
same time period. Since radial migration effects are likely to be small, we
conclude that the growth of disks in spiral galaxies has occurred predominantly
through an inside-out mode (with the effect greatest in high-mass galaxies),
but this has not had anywhere near as much impact on the distribution of mass
within spiral galaxies.

clinicians and accelerate the diagnosis process. Chest computed tomography (CT)
has been recognized as an informative tool for diagnosis of the disease. In
this study, we propose to conduct the diagnosis of COVID-19 with a series of

describing CT images from different views, a unified latent representation is
learned which can completely encode information from different aspects of
features and is endowed with promising class structure for separability.
Specifically, the completeness is guaranteed with a group of backward neural
networks (each for one type of features), while by using class labels the
representation is enforced to be compact within COVID-19/community-acquired
pneumonia (CAP) and also a large margin is guaranteed between different types
of pneumonia. In this way, our model can well avoid overfitting compared to the
case of directly projecting highdimensional features into classes. Extensive
experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparison
methods, and rather stable performances are observed when varying the numbers

jet forms, and droplets with a broad size distribution are ejected. Large
droplets (greater than about 125 {\mu}m in diameter) fall to the ground within
about 2 m, while turbulent clouds transport a mist of small aerosolized
droplets over significant distances (~ 5 m), consistent with reported
experimental findings. A loosely fitted simple cotton cloth mask (with a pore
size ~ 4 microns) qualitatively changes the propagation of the high velocity
jet, and largely eliminates the turbulent cloud downstream of the mask. About
12\% of the airflow leaks around the sides of a mask, considering a uniform gap
of only 1 mm all around, between the face and the mask. The spread of ejecta is
also changed, with most large droplets trapped at the mask surface. We present
the viral load in the air and deposited around the person, and show that
wearing even a simple cloth mask substantially decreases the extent of spatial
spread of virus particles when an infected person coughs or sneezes.

prior probability shifts, where the training set distribution differs from the

classifier to become unfair towards specific population subgroups. While the
fairness notion called Proportional Equality (PE) accounts for such shifts, a
procedure to ensure PE-fairness was unknown.
  In this work, we propose a method, called CAPE, which provides a
comprehensive solution to the aforementioned problem. CAPE makes novel use of
prevalence estimation techniques, sampling and an ensemble of classifiers to
ensure fair predictions under prior probability shifts. We introduce a metric,
called prevalence difference (PD), which CAPE attempts to minimize in order to
ensure PE-fairness. We theoretically establish that this metric exhibits
several desirable properties.
  We evaluate the efficacy of CAPE via a thorough empirical evaluation on
synthetic datasets. We also compare the performance of CAPE with several
popular fair classifiers on real-world datasets like COMPAS (criminal risk

for different cosmological models: the LCDM model with a conventional value of
the dark energy (DE) density, the open model OCDM with no DE, the standard SCDM
model with no DE, and the Hyper-DE HCDM model with an enhanced DE density
value. We find ensembles of superclusters of these models for five evolutionary
stages, corresponding to the present epoch z = 0, and to redshifts z = 1, 3,
10, 30. We use diameters of the largest superclusters and the number of
superclusters as percolation functions to describe properties of the ensemble
of superclusters in the cosmic web. We analyse the size and mass distribution
of superclusters in models and in real Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) based
samples. In all models numbers and volumes of supercluster cocoons are
independent on cosmological epochs. Supercluster masses increase with time, and
geometrical sizes in comoving coordinates decrease with time, for all models.
LCDM, OCDM and HCDM models have almost similar percolation parameters. This
suggests that the essential parameter, which defines the evolution of
superclusters, is the matter density. The DE density influences the growth of
the amplitude of density perturbations, and the growth of masses of
superclusters, albeit significantly less strongly. The HCDM model has the
largest speed of the growth of the amplitude of density fluctuations, and the
largest growth of supercluster masses during the evolution. Geometrical
diameters and numbers of HCDM superclusters at high threshold densities are
larger than for LCDM and OCDM superclusters. SCDM model has about two times
more superclusters than other models; SCDM superclusters have smaller diameters

In this paper, we first generalize the formulation of edge-perturbing attacks
and strictly prove the vulnerability of GCNs to such attacks in node
classification tasks. Following this, an anonymous graph convolutional network,
named AN-GCN, is proposed to counter against edge-perturbing attacks.
Specifically, we present a node localization theorem to demonstrate how the GCN
locates nodes during its training phase. In addition, we design a staggered
Gaussian noise based node position generator, and devise a spectral graph
convolution based discriminator in detecting the generated node positions.
Further, we give the optimization of the above generator and discriminator.
AN-GCN can classify nodes without taking their position as input. It is
demonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks in node
classification tasks, as AN-GCN classifies nodes without the edge information
and thus makes it impossible for attackers to perturb edges anymore. Extensive
evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the general edge-perturbing
attack model in manipulating the classification results of the target nodes.
More importantly, the proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification
accuracy without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the
state-of-the-art GCN.

presented in the discussions about potential economic impacts. For a good
answer to the question - will the restrictions cause as much harm as COVID19? -
credible evidence-based estimates are required, rather than simply rhetoric.
Here we provide some preliminary estimates to compare the impact of the current
restrictions against the direct impact of the virus. Since most countries are
currently taking an approach that reduces the number of COVID19 deaths, the
estimates we provide for deaths from COVID19 are deliberately taken from the
low end of the estimates of the infection fatality rate, while estimates for
deaths from an economic recession are deliberately computed from double the
high end of confidence interval for severe economic recessions. This ensures
that an adequate challenge to the status quo of the current restrictions is
provided. Our analysis shows that strict restrictions to eradicate the virus
are likely to lead to at least eight times fewer total deaths than an immediate
return to work scenario.

and some idiosyncratic white noise components. For the stationary components,
we assume that the factor process captures the temporal-dependence and the
idiosyncratic white noise series explains, jointly with the factors, the
cross-sectional dependence. The estimation of nonsingular linear loading spaces
is carried out in two steps. First, we use an eigenanalysis of a nonnegative
definite matrix of the data to separate the unit-root processes from the
stationary ones and a modified method to specify the number of unit roots. We
then employ another eigenanalysis and a projected principal component analysis
to identify the stationary common factors and the white noise series. We
propose a new procedure to specify the number of white noise series and, hence,
the number of stationary common factors, establish asymptotic properties of the
proposed method for both fixed and diverging $p$ as the sample size $n$
increases, and use simulation and a real example to demonstrate the performance

fact, some papers in the last month have explored the effect of several
messages on people's intentions to engage in pandemic response behaviour. In
this paper, we make two contributions. First, we explore the effect of messages
on people's actual engagement, and not on intentions. Specifically, our
dependent variables are the level of understanding of official COVID-19
pandemic response governmental informative panels, measured through
comprehension questions, and the time spent on reading these rules. Second, we
test a novel set of appeals built through the theory of norms. One message
targets the personal norm (what people think is the right thing to do), one
targets the descriptive norm (what people think others are doing), and one
targets the injunctive norm (what people think others approve or disapprove
of). Our experiment is conducted online with a representative (with respect to
gender, age, and location) sample of Italians. Norms are made salient using a
flier. We find that norm-based fliers had no effect on comprehension and on

calculating the precessional angular velocity generated by the gyroscopic
torque. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to deduce the
force equilibrium equation and precession equilibrium equation and so forth.
From the force equilibrium equation, one can infer the angular velocity of
revolution for the particles. Meanwhile, from the precession equilibrium
equation, it is capable of ascertaining the precessional angular velocity
induced by the torque derivative, including the angular velocity of Larmor
precession. Especially, some ingredients of torque derivative are in direct
proportion to the field strengths. The study reveals that the precessional
angular velocity induced by the torque derivative is independent of that
generated by the torque. The precessional angular velocity, induced by the

dimension of precessional velocity. It will be of great benefit to
understanding further the precessional angular velocity of the spin angular

inter-operator coordination arising in the optimization problem so that the

threshold. While this problem is easily solvable if a centralized unit could
access information of all secondary operators, it becomes challenging in a
realistic scenario. In this paper, considering a satellite setting, we
alleviate this problem by proposing two approaches to reduce the information
exchange level among the secondary operators. In the first approach, we
formulate an RA scheme based on a partial information sharing method which
enables distributed optimization across secondary operators. In the second
approach, instead of exchanging secondary users (SUs) information, the
operators only exchange their contributions of the interference-level and RA is
performed locally across secondary operators. These two approaches, for the
first time in this context, provide a trade-off between performance and level
of inter-operator information exchange. Through the numerical simulations, we
explain this trade-off and illustrate the penalty resulting from partial

performance. Still, the available optimisations keep increasing, and their
effect depends on the specific program, making the task human intractable.
Researchers proposed several techniques to search in the space of compiler
optimisations. Some approaches focus on finding better search algorithms, while
others try to speed up the search by leveraging previously collected knowledge.
The possibility to effectively reuse previous compilation results inspired us
toward the investigation of techniques derived from the Recommender Systems
field. The proposed approach exploits previously collected knowledge and
improves its characterisation over time. Differently from current
state-of-the-art solutions, our approach is not based on performance counters
but relies on Reaction Matching, an algorithm able to characterise programs
looking at how they react to different optimisation sets. The proposed approach
has been validated using two widely used benchmark suites, cBench and
PolyBench, including 54 different programs. Our solution, on average, extracted
90% of the available performance improvement 10 iterations before current
state-of-the-art solutions, which corresponds to 40% fewer compilations and
performance tests to perform.

Automated detection of these symptoms could offer clues as to the early onset

researchers to develop methods that use widely available sensors to measure and
quantify the presence of PD symptoms such as tremor, rigidity and braykinesia.
However, most of these approaches operate under controlled settings, such as in

In this work, we present a method for automatically identifying tremorous

We propose a Multiple-Instance Learning approach, wherein a subject is

issues often make data analysis and decision-making complicated and
challenging. In this study, we have developed a generative adversarial network
(GAN) based traffic sensor data imputation framework (TSDIGAN) to efficiently
reconstruct the missing data by generating realistic synthetic data. In recent
years, GANs have shown impressive success in image data generation. However,
generating traffic data by taking advantage of GAN based modeling is a

Furthermore, Oscillation in presence of obstacles or in narrow passages is
another disadvantage of the method which makes it unqualified for many planning

approach which employs a prior path between origin and goal configuration of
the robot. Therefore, the planner guarantees to lead the robot to goal area

stage, we intend to use randomized sampling methods such as Rapidly-exploring

low-rank decoder is illustrated on $\mu$-ECoG data from the primary auditory

separation from CO2/N2/H2O gaseous mixtures in bilayer graphtriyne. The gas
uptake capacity, permeability as well as selectivity of the layers were
simulated based on an improved formulation of force fields tested on accurate
ab initio calculations on specific systems for mixture separation in
post-combustion process. The effect of pressure and temperature on the
separation performances of graphtriyne layers was investigated. Compared with
the single layer graphtriyne, bilayer graphtriyne can adsorb more molecules
with relatively good selectivity, due to the action of the interlayer region as
an adsorption site. The interlayer adsorption selectivity of CO2/N2 and CO2/H2O
at a temperature of 333 K and a pressure of 4 atm have been found to be equal
to about 20.23 and 1.85, respectively. We also observed that the bilayer
graphtriyne membrane has high CO2 and H2O permeances compared to N2 with
permeance selectivity ranging from 4.8 to 6.5. Moreover, we found that
permeation and adsorption depend on the applied temperature; at high
temperatures permeation and adsorption tend to decrease for all molecules.
