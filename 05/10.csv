defined which compares an increment in hydrostatic pressure with the
corresponding increment in relative volume. Its positivity provides a stringent
criterion for physically reasonable response involving the second derivatives
of the strain energy function. Also, an average (or secant) bulk modulus is
defined by comparing the current stress with the relative volume change. The
positivity of this bulk modulus provides a physically reasonable response
criterion less stringent than the former. The concept of incremental bulk
modulus is extended to anisotropic elasticity. For states of uniaxial tension
an incremental Poisson's ratio and an incremental Young's modulus are similarly
defined for nonlinear isotropic elasticity and have properties similar to those
of the incremental bulk modulus. The incremental Poisson's ratios for the
isotropic constraints of incompressibility, Bell, Ericksen, and constant area
are considered. The incremental moduli are all evaluated for a specific example
of the compressible neo-Hookean solid. Bounds on the ground state Lam\'{e}
elastic moduli, assumed positive, are given which are sufficient to guarantee
the positivity of the incremental bulk and Young's moduli for all strains.
However, although the ground state Poisson's ratio is positive we find that the
incremental Poisson's ratio becomes negative for large enough axial extensions.

where the contribution from the anisotropic stress to the overall energy
density grows as $a^{-6}$, with $a$ the scale factor. Classically, whether or
not this contribution becomes important before the bounce depends on its
initial value, which can always be sufficiently fine tuned to make it
irrelevant. However, vacuum quantum fluctuations inevitably provide a
non-vanishing source of anisotropic stress. In this work, we compute the
minimum amount of shear that is obtained if one assumes that it vanishes
initially, but lets quantum fluctuations build it up. In practice, we consider
a massless test scalar field, and describe its quantum fluctuations by means of
the stochastic ""inflation"" (though here applied to a contracting phase)
formalism. We find that, if the equation-of-state parameter of the contraction
satisfies $w>-1/9$, regardless of when the contracting phase is initiated, the
time at which the shear becomes sizeable is always when the Hubble scale
approaches the Planck mass (which is also where the bounce is expected to take
place). However, if $w<-1/9$, the shear backreaction becomes important much
earlier, at a point that depends on the overall amount of contraction.

edge existence over all layers. We then adapt an information-theoretic measure
of general correlation called the conditional mutual information, which uses
the estimated joint probability distribution, to quantify the pairwise

temporal, allowing us to identify if knowledge of a certain layer can provide
additional information about the evolution of another layer.

collective behaviors. However, limited by the scale of existing video datasets,
few human analysis approaches have reported their performance on such complex

Human-in-Events or HiEve (Human-centric video analysis in complex Events), for
the understanding of human motions, poses, and actions in a variety of
realistic events, especially in crowd and complex events. It contains a record
number of poses (>1M), the largest number of action instances (>56k) under
complex events, as well as one of the largest numbers of trajectories lasting
for longer time (with an average trajectory length of >480 frames). Based on
this dataset, we present an enhanced pose estimation baseline by utilizing the
potential of action information to guide the learning of more powerful 2D pose
features. We demonstrate that the proposed method is able to boost the
performance of existing pose estimation pipelines on our HiEve dataset.
Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to benchmark recent video
analysis approaches together with our baseline methods, demonstrating that
HiEve is a challenging dataset for human-centric video analysis. We expect that
the dataset will advance the development of cutting-edge techniques in

transferring knowledge from seen classes to unseen classes. This knowledge
transfer is possible because of underlying semantic space which is common to
seen and unseen classes. Most existing approaches learn a projection function
using labelled seen class data which maps visual data to semantic data. In this
work, we propose a shallow but effective neural network-based model for
learning such a projection function which aligns the visual and semantic data
in the latent space while simultaneously making the latent space embeddings
discriminative. As the above projection function is learned using the seen
class data, the so-called projection domain shift exists. We propose a
transductive approach to reduce the effect of domain shift, where we utilize
unlabeled visual data from unseen classes to generate corresponding semantic
features for unseen class visual samples. While these semantic features are
initially generated using a conditional variational auto-encoder, they are used
along with the seen class data to improve the projection function. We
experiment on both inductive and transductive setting of ZSL and generalized
ZSL and show superior performance on standard benchmark datasets AWA1, AWA2,
CUB, SUN, FLO, and APY. We also show the efficacy of our model in the case of
extremely less labelled data regime on different datasets in the context of

has a promising performance of reconstruction of delay differential equation
from sampling data. In the new method, a parameterized dictionary of candidate
functions is constructed against the traditional expanded dictionary. The
parameterized dictionary uses a function with variables to represent a series
of functions. It accordingly has the ability to express functions in the
continuous function space so that the dimension of the dictionary can be
exponentially decreased. This is particularly important when an exhaustion of
candidate functions is needed to construct appropriate dictionary. The
reconstruction of delay differential equation is such the case that each
possible delay item should be considered as the basis to construct the
dictionary and this naturally induces the curse of dimensionality.
Correspondingly, the parameterized dictionary uses a variable to model the
delay item so the curse disappears. Based on the parameterized dictionary, the
reconstruction problem is then rewritten and treated as a mixed-integer
nonlinear programming with both binary and continuous variables. To the best of
our knowledge, such optimization problem is hard to solve with the traditional
mathematical methods while the emerging evolutionary computation provides
competitive solutions. Hence, the evolutionary computation technique is
considered and a typical algorithm named particle swarm optimization is adopted
in this paper. Experiments are carried out in 5 test systems including 3
well-known chaotic delay differential equations such as Mackey-Glass system.
The experiment result shows the effectiveness of the new method to reconstruct

of an Orowan loop that penetrated in the precipitate. The precipitate was
finally sheared after several Orowan loops were piled-up. The number of loops
necessary to shear the precipitate decreased as precipitate cross-section
decreased and the temperature increased but was independent of the precipitate

of disorders and external excitations also need to be considered. In this work,
we present a systematic study on quantum transport of graphene ribbons with

universal behavior of the electron transmission. Using a tight-binding model in
combination with Non-Equilibrium Green Functions formalism, we show that
Gaussian deformation influences strongly the electronic properties of ribbons
in which the electron transmission decreases remarkably in high energy regions
even if small deformations are considered. Interestingly, it unveils that the
first plateau of the transmission of semi-metallic armchair ribbons is just
weakly affected in the case of small deformations. However, significant large
Gaussian bumps can induce a strong drop of this plateau and a transport gap is
formed. The transmission at the zero energy is found to decrease exponentially
with increasing the size of the Gaussian bump. Moreover, the gap of
semi-conducting ribbons is enlarged with large deformations. The opening or the
widening of the transport gap in large deformed armchair structures is
interpreted by a formation of a three-zone behavior along the transport
direction of the hopping profile. On the other hand, a transport gap is not
observed in zigzag ribbons regardless of the size of Gaussian bumps. This
behavior is due to the strong localization of edge states at the energy point E

gradient of the accelerators. Developing a non-contacting detection technology
to accurately locate these surface defects is the key to improve the
performance of SRF cavities and hence the accelerators. In a recent
proof-of-concept experiment (Phys. Rev. Applied, 11, 044003 (2019)), we
demonstrated that a molecular tagging velocimetry (MTV) technique based on the
tracking of a He$_2^*$ molecular tracer line created nearby a surface hot spot

technique practically useful, here we describe our further development of a
stereoscopic MTV setup for tracking the tracer line's motion in
three-dimensional (3D) space. We simulate a quench spot by applying a transient
voltage pulse to a small heater mounted on a substrate plate. Images of the
drifted tracer line, taken with two cameras from orthogonal directions, are
used to reconstruct the line profile in 3D space. A new algorithm for analyzing
the 3D line profile is developed, which incorporates the finite size effect of
the heater. We show that the center location of the heater can be reproduced on
the substrate surface with an uncertainty of only a few hundred microns,

Moreover, for the designed phase-shift profile, we show that there exists an

However, the location of the laser source and the properties of the emitted

This equivalence allows us to study the mirror-assisted system, employing the
image method from geometric optics, instead of directly analyzing the original

divided into several parts and all participants in the same part play an
equivalent role. The search for ideal secret sharing schemes for some special
interesting families of multipartite access structures, has been carried out by
many authors. In this paper a new concept of study of ideal access structures
is proposed. We do not consider special classes of access structures defined by
imposing certain prescribed assumptions, but we investigate all access
structures obtained from uniform polymatroids using the method developed by
Farr\`as, Mart\'i-Farr\'e and Padr\'o. They satisfy necessary condition to be
ideal, i.e., they are matroid ports. Moreover some objects in this family can
be useful for the applications of secret sharing. The choice of uniform
polymatroids is motivated by the fact that each such polymatroid defines ideal
access structures. The method presented in this article is universal and can be
continued with other classes of polymatroids in further similar studies. Here
we are especially interested in hierarchy of participants determined by the
access structure and we distinguish two main classes: they are compartmented
and hierarchical access structures. The vast majority of papers discussing
hierarchical access structures consider access structures which are compartment
or totally hierarchical. The main results are summarized in Section 4, which
presents situations where partial hierarchy properties may arise. In
particular, hierarchical orders of obtained structures are described. It is
surprising, that the hierarchical orders of access structures obtained from
uniform polymatroids are flat, i.e., every chain has at most 2 elements. The
ideality of some families of hierarchical access structures is proved in
Section 5.

compression exhibits a highly localized behavior that can endanger the
structural stability of a sample. Recent experiments revealed that the
mechanical response of a crystal is very sensitive to both the presence of a
quenched disorder in the sample and the orientation of the crystal. In this
work, we study the influence of disorder and crystal orientation on the large
strain response of a 2D FCC crystal with three active glide planes using a very
simple Eulerian plasticity model in the FE framework. Our numerical and
theoretical results on clean crystal pillars suggest that a single plane or
many gliding planes can be activated depending on the crystal orientation.
While in the former case, the deformation is localized, leading to ductile
rupture, in the latter, a complex interplay between active planes takes place,
resulting in a more uniform deformation. The strain-localization can be avoided
when inhomogeneities are engineered inside the crystal, or the crystal
orientation is altered because of the activation of multiple slip systems,
resulting in a ""patchwork"" of the distribution of the slip systems.

possible to develop investigations on how scientific works are viewed along
time, often before the first citations appear. This provides the main theme of
the present work. More specifically, our research was motivated by preliminary
observations that the view profiles along time tend to present a piecewise
linear nature. A methodology was then delineated in order to identify the main
segments in the view profiles, which allowed several related measurements to be
derived. In particular, we focused on the inclination and length of each
subsequent segment. Basic statistics indicated that the inclination can vary
substantially along subsequent segments, while the segment lengths resulted
more stable. Complementary joint statistics analysis, considering pairwise
correlations, provided further information about the properties of the views.
In order to better understand the view profiles, we performed respective
multivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis and
hierarchical clustering. The results suggest that a portion of the polygonal
views are organized into clusters or groups. These groups were characterized in
terms of prototypes indicating the relative increase or decrease along
subsequent segments. Four respective distinct models were then developed for
representing the observed segments. It was found that models incorporating
joint dependencies between the properties of the segments provided the most

relevant to the stability are the followings; (i) skyrmion number along the
developed surface, and (ii) the monopole charge in the bulk defined as the
integral over the surface enclosing a singular magnetic configuration. As long
as the magnetic configuration is slowly varying, the former is conserved while
its changes is associated with nonzero monopole charge. The skyrmion number and

magnet protection system, namely the quench heaters and a novel protection
system called Coupling-Loss Induced Quench (CLIQ). An important outcome is that
magnet protection has to be evaluated for its impact on the beam and designed
accordingly. In particular, CLIQ, which is to protect the new HL-LHC triplet
magnets, constitutes the fastest known failure in the LHC if triggered
spuriously. A schematic change of CLIQ to mitigate the hazard is presented.

decision making. Hence, the development of accurate forecasts is a valuable
field of research to further improve the efficiency of water utilities.
Focusing on probabilistic multi-step-ahead forecasting, a time series model is
introduced, to capture typical autoregressive, calendar and seasonal effects,
to account for time-varying variance, and to quantify the uncertainty and
path-dependency of the water demand process. To deal with the high complexity
of the water demand process a high-dimensional feature space is applied, which
is efficiently tuned by an automatic shrinkage and selection operator (lasso).
It allows to obtain an accurate, simple interpretable and fast computable
forecasting model, which is well suited for real-time applications. The
complete probabilistic forecasting framework allows not only for simulating the
mean and the marginal properties, but also the correlation structure between
hours within the forecasting horizon. For practitioners, complete probabilistic
multi-step-ahead forecasts are of considerable relevance as they provide
additional information about the expected aggregated or cumulative water
demand, so that a statement can be made about the probability with which a
water storage capacity can guarantee the supply over a certain period of time.
This information allows to better control storage capacities and to better
ensure the smooth operation of pumps. To appropriately evaluate the forecasting
performance of the considered models, the energy score (ES) as a strictly
proper multidimensional evaluation criterion, is introduced. The methodology is
applied to the hourly water demand data of a German water supplier.

the autonomous community of Andalusia in Spain and the mainland of Greece. We
start with a 0D compartmental epidemiological model consisting of Susceptible,
Exposed, Asymptomatic, (symptomatically) Infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, and
deceased populations. We emphasize the importance of the viral latent period
and the key role of an asymptomatic population. We optimize model parameters
for both regions by comparing predictions to the cumulative number of infected
and total number of deaths via minimizing the $\ell^2$ norm of the difference
between predictions and observed data. We consider the sensitivity of model
predictions on reasonable variations of model parameters and initial
conditions, addressing issues of parameter identifiability. We model both
pre-quarantine and post-quarantine evolution of the epidemic by a
time-dependent change of the viral transmission rates that arises in response
to containment measures. Subsequently, a spatially distributed version of the
0D model in the form of reaction-diffusion equations is developed. We consider
that, after an initial localized seeding of the infection, its spread is
governed by the diffusion (and 0D model ""reactions"") of the asymptomatic and
symptomatically infected populations, which decrease with the imposed
restrictive measures. We inserted the maps of the two regions, and we imported
population-density data into COMSOL, which was subsequently used to solve
numerically the model PDEs. Upon discussing how to adapt the 0D model to this
spatial setting, we show that these models bear significant potential towards
capturing both the well-mixed, 0D description and the spatial expansion of the

to single-phase and multi-phase systems to obtain an optimal current
decomposition under any distorted voltage source supply and load condition.
This could be the case in microgrids or smart grids. Moreover, it is possible
to define different strategies based on instantaneous or averaged quantities

paper considers a fundamental maximum throughput routing problem -- the

can be (much) larger than the edge capacities. Hence, in addition to assigning
requests to valid flows for each routed commodity, an admission control
mechanism is required which prevents overloading the network when routing
commodities. We make several contributions. On the theoretical side we obtain
substantially improved bi-criteria approximation algorithms for this NP-hard

to convert their fractional solutions into integer solutions via randomized
rounding. One is an exponential-size formulation (solvable in polynomial time
using a separation oracle) that considers a ""packing"" view and allows a more
flexible approach, while the other is a compact (polynomial-size) edge-flow
formulation that allows for easy solving via standard LP solvers. We obtain a
polynomial-time randomized algorithm that yields an arbitrarily good
approximation on the weighted throughput, while violating the edge capacity
constraints by only a small multiplicative factor. We also describe a
deterministic rounding algorithm by derandomization, using the method of
pessimistic estimators. We complement our theoretical results with a proof of

Darcy velocity, penetration depth, and fractional ratios of the mass flow rate.
These parameters are comparable between the solvent, dilute suspensions, and

$I_{\alpha,\beta}(\lambda)=\int_\mathbb{R}E_{\alpha,\beta}\left(i^\alpha\lambda
\phi(x)\right)\psi(x)dx,$ for the range $0<\alpha\leq 2,\,\beta>0$. This
extends the variety of estimates obtained in the first part, where integrals
with functions $E_{\alpha,\beta}\left(i \lambda \phi(x)\right)$ have been
studied. Several generalisations of the van der Corput lemmas are proved. As an
application of the above results, the generalised Riemann-Lebesgue lemma, the
Cauchy problem for the time-fractional Klein-Gordon and time-fractional
Schr\""{o}dinger equations are considered.

matrix estimation is frequently employed as a method for inferring gene

typically either assume that the population covariance matrix has some
particular structure, for example sparsity, or apply shrinkage to better
estimate the population eigenvalues. In this paper, we study a new approach to
estimating high-dimensional covariance matrices. We first frame covariance
matrix estimation as a compound decision problem. This motivates defining a
class of decision rules and using a nonparametric empirical Bayes g-modeling

would like to first find its corresponding point p' in a neighboring view, and
then combine the features at p' with the features at p, thus leading to a
3D-aware feature at p. Inspired by stereo matching, the epipolar transformer
leverages epipolar constraints and feature matching to approximate the features
at p'. Experiments on InterHand and Human3.6M show that our approach has
consistent improvements over the baselines. Specifically, in the condition

equations by deep neural networks, especially in the high-dimensional case.
Unlike classical numerical methods, such as finite difference method and finite
element method, the enforcement of boundary conditions in deep neural networks
is highly nontrivial. One general strategy is to use the penalty method. In the
work, we conduct a comparison study for elliptic problems with four different
boundary conditions, i.e., Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin, and periodic boundary
conditions, using two representative methods: deep Galerkin method and deep
Ritz method. In the former, the PDE residual is minimized in the least-squares
sense while the corresponding variational problem is minimized in the latter.
Therefore, it is reasonably expected that deep Galerkin method works better for
smooth solutions while deep Ritz method works better for low-regularity
solutions. However, by a number of examples, we observe that deep Ritz method
can outperform deep Galerkin method with a clear dependence of dimensionality
even for smooth solutions and deep Galerkin method can also outperform deep
Ritz method for low-regularity solutions. Besides, in some cases, when the
boundary condition can be implemented in an exact manner, we find that such a
strategy not only provides a better approximate solution but also facilitates
the training process.

prediction accuracy, we first perform a pre-processing to integrate the
historical data of pollen concentration and various inferential signals from
other covariates such as the meteorological data. We then propose a novel
algorithm which encompasses three-stage regressions: in Stage 1, a regression
model to predict the start/end date of a airborne-pollen allergy season is
trained from a feature matrix extracted from 12 time series of the covariates
with a rolling window; in Stage 2, a regression model to predict the
corresponding uncertainty is trained based on the feature matrix and the
prediction result from Stage 1; in Stage 3, a weighted linear regression model
is built upon prediction results from Stage 1 and 2. It is observed and proved
that Stage 3 contributes to the improved forecasting accuracy and the reduced
uncertainty of the multi-variate triple-regression algorithm. Based on
different allergy sensitivity level, the triggering concentration of the pollen
- the definition of the allergy season can be customized individually. In our
backtesting, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.7 days was achieved using the
algorithm. We conclude that this algorithm could be applicable in both generic

commuters. Hence, it is critical to accurately detect and recognize the NRTC in
a real-time manner. The advancement of road traffic detectors and loop
detectors provides researchers with a large-scale multivariable
temporal-spatial traffic data, which allows the deep research on NRTC to be
conducted. However, it remains a challenging task to construct an analytical
framework through which the natural spatial-temporal structural properties of
multivariable traffic information can be effectively represented and exploited
to better understand and detect NRTC. In this paper, we present a novel
analytical training-free framework based on coupled scalable Bayesian robust
tensor factorization (Coupled SBRTF). The framework can couple multivariable
traffic data including traffic flow, road speed, and occupancy through sharing
a similar or the same sparse structure. And, it naturally captures the
high-dimensional spatial-temporal structural properties of traffic data by
tensor factorization. With its entries revealing the distribution and magnitude
of NRTC, the shared sparse structure of the framework compasses sufficiently
abundant information about NRTC. While the low-rank part of the framework,
expresses the distribution of general expected traffic condition as an
auxiliary product. Experimental results on real-world traffic data show that
the proposed method outperforms coupled Bayesian robust principal component
analysis (coupled BRPCA), the rank sparsity tensor decomposition (RSTD), and
standard normal deviates (SND) in detecting NRTC. The proposed method performs
even better when only traffic data in weekdays are utilized, and hence can
provide more precise estimation of NRTC for daily commuters.

number of possible paths that go through all combinations of mediators. Most
existing mediation inference solutions either explicitly impose that the
mediators are conditionally independent given the exposure, or ignore any
potential directed paths among the mediators. In this article, we propose a
novel hypothesis testing procedure to evaluate individual mediation effects,
while taking into account potential interactions among the mediators. Our
proposal thus fills a crucial gap, and greatly extends the scope of existing
mediation tests. Our key idea is to construct the test statistic using the
logic of Boolean matrices, which enables us to establish the proper limiting
distribution under the null hypothesis. We further employ screening, data

power of the test. We show our test can control both the size and false

the presence of multiple sources of interference, where the UAVs are deployed
to collect data from a set of wireless sensors. We demonstrate that the
placement of the UAVs play a key role in prolonging the lifetime of the network
since the required transmission powers of the UAVs are closely related to their
locations in space. In the proposed scenario, the UAVs transmit the gathered
data to a primary UAV called \textit{leader}, which is in charge of forwarding
the data to the base station (BS) via a backhaul UAV network. We deploy tools
from spectral graph theory to tackle the problem due to its high non-convexity.
Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly
improve the lifetime of the UAV network.

pre-designed strategies that are solely based on expert knowledge, the proposed
data-driven subsampling strategy employs deep neural network architectures to
simulate the effect of removing candidate combinations of samples from each
training input vector, in a manner inspired by how wrapper feature selection
models work. The subsampled data is then processed by another deep learning
classifier that recognizes each of the considered 10 modulation types. We show
that the proposed subsampling strategy not only introduces drastic reduction in
the classifier training time, but can also improve the classification accuracy
to higher levels than those reached before for the considered dataset. An
important feature herein is exploiting the transferability property of deep
neural networks to avoid retraining the wrapper models and obtain superior
performance through an ensemble of wrappers over that possible through solely
relying on any of them.

linear combinations of simultaneously transmitted messages while exploiting the
linear properties of lattice codes and the additive nature of a shared medium.
The scheme was originally designed for relay networks, yet, it was found useful
in other communication problems, such as MIMO communication. Works in the
current literature assume a fixed number of transmitters and receivers in the
system. However, following the increase in communication networks density, it
is interesting to investigate the performance of CF when the number of
transmitters is large.
  In this work, we show that as the number of transmitters grows, CF becomes
degenerated, in the sense that a relay prefers to decode only one (strongest)
user instead of any other linear combination of the transmitted codewords,
treating the other users as noise. Moreover, the system's sum-rate tends to
zero as well. This makes scheduling necessary in order to maintain the superior
abilities CF provides. We thus examine the problem of scheduling for CF. We
start with insights on why good scheduling opportunities can be found. Then, we
provide an asymptotically optimal, polynomial-time scheduling algorithm and
analyze its performance. We conclude that with proper scheduling, CF is not
merely non-degenerated, but, in fact, provides a gain for the system sum-rate,
up to the optimal scaling law of $O(\log{\log{L}})$.

The zero-quasienergy of dark Floquet state has been shown to be not a real
zero, but a vanishingly small negative imaginary number which will cause
undesirable physical effect in long-time evolution of quantum states, which is
extremely different from the conservative counterpart. Another important
finding is that the value of the system's effective decay, determined by the
size of the non-zero imaginary part of the dark-Floquet-state-related
quasienergy, depends not on how many localized lossy sites there are but on
which one of the lossy sites is nearest to the driven site. Thus, for specially
designed local dissipation, by controlling the driving parameters, it is
possible for us to drive the system to a dark Floquet state with a much lower
level of overall probability loss as compared to the undriven case and with
good stability over enough longer evolution time. These results are applicable
to the multisite lattice system with an odd number of sites and may be
significant for long-time control of decay in a vast family of multistate

feature vectors mostly having large dimension, thereby increasing the
computation complexity of the whole classification model. Feature Selection
(FS) can serve as an intermediate step to reduce the size of the feature
vectors by restricting them only to the essential and relevant features. In our
paper, we have addressed this issue by introducing a new FS algorithm, called
Hybrid Swarm and Gravitation based FS (HSGFS). This algorithm is made to run on
3 feature vectors introduced in the literature recently - Distance-Hough

prepared at block, text-line and word level, consisting of officially
recognized 12 Indic scripts are used for the evaluation of our method. An
average improvement in the range of 2-5 % is achieved in the classification
accuracies by utilizing only about 75-80 % of the original feature vectors on
all three datasets. The proposed methodology also shows better performance when

PTIME, where logic has to be understood in a very general way comprising
computation models over structures. In this article we first refute Gurevich's
conjecture. For this we extend the seminal research of Blass, Gurevich and
Shelah on {\em choiceless polynomial time} (CPT), which exploits deterministic
Abstract State Machines (ASMs) supporting unbounded parallelism to capture the
choiceless fragment of PTIME. CPT is strictly included in PTIME. We observe
that choice is unavoidable, but that a restricted version suffices, which
guarantees that the final result is independent from the choice. Such a version
of polynomially bounded ASMs, which we call {\em insignificant choice
polynomial time} (ICPT) will indeed capture PTIME. Even more, insignificant
choice can be captured by ASMs with choice restricted to atoms such that a {\em
local insignificance condition} is satisfied. As this condition can be
expressed in the logic of non-deterministic ASMs, we obtain a logic capturing
PTIME. Furthermore, using inflationary fixed-points we can capture problems in
PTIME by fixed-point formulae in a fragment of the logic of non-deterministic
ASMs plus inflationary fixed-points. We use this result for our second
contribution showing that PTIME differs from NP. For the proof we build again
on the research on CPT first establishing a limitation on permutation classes
of the sets that can be activated by an ICPT computation. We then prove an
inseparability theorem, which characterises classes of structures that cannot
be separated by the logic. In particular, this implies that SAT cannot be
decided by an ICPT computation.

direct tidal interaction of elliptical galaxies with gravitational fields
sourced by the cosmic large-scale structure. Setting up a linear intrinsic
alignment model for elliptical galaxies which parameterises the reaction of the
galaxy to an external tidal shear field is controlled by the velocity
dispersion, we predict intrinsic correlations and cross-correlations with weak
lensing for both shapes and sizes, juxtaposing both types of spectra with
lensing. We quantify the observability of the intrinsic shape and size
correlations and estimate with the Fisher-formalism how well the alignment
parameter can be determined from the Euclid weak lensing survey. Specifically,
we find a contamination of the weak lensing convergence spectra with an
intrinsic size correlation amounting to up to 10% over a wide multipole range
$\ell=100\ldots300$, with a corresponding cross-correlation exhibiting a sign
change, similar to the cross-correlation between weak lensing shear and
intrinsic shapes. A determination of the alignment parameter yields a precision

requires good feature representations to capture the distribution of the data

aspects are dealt with independently and thus traditional feature learning
alone does not suffice in partitioning the data meaningfully. Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) naturally lend themselves to learning data distributions in
a latent space. Since we wish to efficiently discriminate between different
clusters in the data, we propose a method based on VAEs where we use a Gaussian
Mixture prior to help cluster the images accurately. We jointly learn the
parameters of both the prior and the posterior distributions. Our method
represents a true Gaussian Mixture VAE. This way, our method simultaneously
learns a prior that captures the latent distribution of the images and a
posterior to help discriminate well between data points. We also propose a
novel reparametrization of the latent space consisting of a mixture of discrete
and continuous variables. One key takeaway is that our method generalizes
better across different datasets without using any pre-training or learnt
models, unlike existing methods, allowing it to be trained from scratch in an
end-to-end manner. We verify our efficacy and generalizability experimentally

learning from demonstration to accomplish BabySteps. In the second phase, the
agent uses curriculum-based reinforcement learning to maximize rewards on
navigation tasks with increasingly longer instructions. We create two new
benchmark datasets (of long navigation tasks) and use them in conjunction with
existing ones to examine BabyWalk's generalization ability. Empirical results

because it affects measurements of elemental abundances and distorts surface
brightness of the object. It is predicted that RS can occur in plasmas of
supernova remnants (SNRs). Although several authors reported hints of RS in
SNRs, no strong observational evidence has been established so far. We perform
a high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the SNR N49 with the Reflection Grating
Spectrometer aboard XMM-Newton. The RGS spectrum of N49 shows a high G-ratio of
O VII He$\alpha$ lines as well as O VIII Ly$\beta$/$\alpha$ and Fe XVII
(3s-2p)/(3d-2p) ratios which cannot be explained by the emission from a thin
thermal plasma. These line ratios can be well explained by the effect of RS.
Our result implies that RS has a large impact particularly on a measurement of
the oxygen abundance.

Floquet solutions and their associated quasienergies and thus construct the
general non-Floquet solutions of the dissipative spin-orbit coupled bosonic
system. Based on detailed analysis of the Floquet quasienergy spectrum, the
profound effect of system parameters and the periodic driving field on the
stability of spin-dependent tunneling is investigated analytically and
numerically for both balanced and unbalanced gain-loss between two wells. Under
balanced gain and loss, we find that the stable spin-flipping tunneling is
preferentially suppressed with the increase of gain-loss strength. When the
ratio of Zeeman field strength to periodic driving frequency $\Omega/\omega$ is
even, there is a possibility that \emph{continuous} stable parameter regions
will exist. When $\Omega/\omega$ is odd, nevertheless, only \emph{discrete}
stable parameter regions are found. Under unbalanced gain and loss, whether
$\Omega/\omega$ is even or odd, we can get parametric equilibrium conditions
for the existence of stable spin tunneling. The results could be useful for the
experiments of controlling stable spin transportation in a non-Hermitian

the effect of social distancing laws on consumer spending in the COVID-19

of the virus and the laws aiming to contain it: Denmark and Sweden were
similarly exposed to the pandemic but only Denmark imposed significant
restrictions on social and economic activities. We estimate that aggregate
spending dropped by around 25 percent in Sweden and, as a result of the
shutdown, by 4 additional percentage points in Denmark. This implies that most
of the economic contraction is caused by the virus itself and occurs regardless
of social distancing laws. The age gradient in the estimates suggest that
social distancing reinforces the virus-induced drop in spending for low
health-risk individuals but attenuates it for high-risk individuals by lowering
the overall prevalence of the virus in the society.

achieved very good results, but it is still not satisfactory for some nuclear
masses. Although there are many studies in Odd-Even staggering (OES) of nuclear
masses, but the research on nuclear masses by using the systematicness of OES
is indeed very few. Our purpose in this paper is to describe an empirical
formula for Odd-Even staggering of nuclear masses that can be useful in
describing and predicting nuclear masses. We empirically obtained the formula
of odd-Z (odd-N) nuclei and even-Z (even-N) nuclei based on studying the OES of
nuclear masses (AME2012). With the proton (neutron) empirical pairing gap from
the OES of the binding energies and AME2012 database, the root-mean-square
deviation of even-Z nuclei and odd-Z nuclei that we have successfully obtained
208 keV and 238 keV, respectively. The RMSD of even-N nuclei and odd-N nuclei
is 222 keV and 240 keV. The result shows that our predicted values are compared
well with values in AME2016, and some predicted values agree better with the
experimental values. These results demonstrate that our empirical formulas have
good accuracy and reliability. Another advantage of these formulas is that they
use less known nuclear masses to predict unknown nuclear masses. In addition,
this paper also uses BP neural network to study proton Odd-Even staggering of
nuclear masses (even-Z and odd-Z nuclei) and neutron Odd-Even staggering of
nuclear masses (even-N and odd-N nuclei). The RMSD of even-Z and odd-Z nuclei
is 141 keV and 159 keV; the RMSD of even-N and odd-N nuclei is 150 keV and 160
keV. The results show that the RMSD of nuclear masses based on neural network
60-80 keV decrease than that based on empirical formula (the accuracy is
increased by about 32%). Accurate nuclear mass is helpful to the research of
nuclear physics, nuclear technology and astrophysics.

spectrum of low-lying electronic states and their dissociation curves, at the

cylindrical symmetry and angular momentum as a good quantum number for
nontrivial angles between the bond axis and magnetic field, we introduce the
almost quantized angular momentum (AQAM) and show that it provides useful
information about states in arbitrary orientations. In general, strong magnetic
fields dramatically rearrange the spectrum, with the orbital Zeeman effect
bringing down states of higher angular momentum below the states with pure
$\sigma$ character as the field strength increases. In addition, the spin
Zeeman effect pushes triplet states below the lowest singlet; in particular, a
field of one atomic unit is strong enough to push a quintet state below the
triplets. In general, the angle between the bond axis and the magnetic field
also continuously modulates the degree of $\sigma$, $\pi$, and $\delta$
character of bonds and the previously identified perpendicular paramagnetic
bonding mechanism is found to be common among excited states. Electronic states
with preferred skew field orientations are identified and rationalized in terms
of permanent and induced electronic currents.

possesses a duality between chiral symmetry breaking and pion condensation. For
the first time this was revealed in the QCD motivated toy model. Then it was
demonstrated in effective models as well and new additional dualities being
found. We briefly recap the main features of this story and then discuss its
applications as a tool to explore the QCD phase structure. The most appealing
application is the possibility of getting the results on the QCD phase diagram
at large baryon density. Taking the idea from large $1/N_{c}$ universalities it
was argued that the scenario of circumventing the sign problem with the help of
dualities seems plausible. It is also discussed that there is a persistent
problem about whether there should be catalysis or anti-catalysis of chiral
symmetry breaking by chiral imbalance. One can probably say that the issue is
settled after lattice results (first principle approach), where the catalysis
was observed. But they used an unphysically large pion mass so it is still
interesting to get additional indications that this is the case. It is shown
just by the duality property that there exists catalysis of chiral symmetry
breaking. So, having in mind our results and the earlier lattice simulations,
one can probably claim that this issue is settled. It is demonstrated that the
duality can be used to obtain new results. As an example, it is showcased how
the phase structure of dense quark matter with chiral imbalance (with
possibility of inhomogeneous phases) can be obtained from the knowledge of a
QCD phase diagram with isopin asymmetry.

reliable radar points from generator. Then an efficient radar odometry is

the nature of dark energy affects the cosmological constraints on the total

from the neutrino mass hierarchies, i.e., the degenerate hierarchy (DH), the
normal hierarchy (NH), and the inverted hierarchy (IH). We employ the current
cosmological observations to do the analysis, including the Planck 2018
temperature and polarization power spectra, the baryon acoustic oscillations
(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SNe), and the Hubble constant $H_0$ measurement.
In the $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ model, we obtain the upper limits of the
neutrino mass $\sum m_\nu < 0.123$ eV (DH), $\sum m_\nu < 0.156$ eV (NH), and
$\sum m_\nu < 0.185$ eV (IH) at the $95\%$ C.L., using the Planck+BAO+SNe data
combination. For the $w$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ model and the CPL+$\sum m_\nu$ model,
larger upper limits of $\sum m_\nu$ are obtained compared to those of the
$\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ model. The most stringent constraint on the neutrino

mixing rate of a turbulent jet. This system comprises six independently
operated unsteady minijet actuators, two hot-wire sensors placed in the jet,
and genetic programming for the unsupervised learning of a near-optimal control
law. The ansatz of this law includes multi-frequency open-loop forcing,
sensor-feedback and nonlinear combinations thereof. Mixing performance is
quantified by the decay rate of the centreline mean velocity of jet.
Intriguingly, the learning process of AI control discovers the classical
forcings, i.e. axisymmetric, helical and flapping achievable from conventional
control techniques, one by one in the order of increased performance, and
finally converges to a hitherto unexplored forcing. Careful examination of the
control landscape unveils typical control laws, generated in the learning
process, and their evolutions. The best AI forcing produces a complex turbulent
flow structure that is characterized by periodically generated mushroom
structures, helical motion and oscillating jet column, all enhancing the mixing
rate and vastly outperforming others. Being never reported before, this flow
structure is examined in various aspects, including the velocity spectra, mean

visualization images in three orthogonal planes, all compared with other
classical flow structures. Along with the knowledge of the minijet-produced
flow and its effect on the initial condition of the main jet, these aspects
cast valuable insight into the physics behind the highly effective mixing of

learned lossy image compression methods. Precise estimation of the

However, existing deep learning based entropy modeling methods generally assume
the latent codes are statistically independent or depend on some side
information or local context, which fails to take the global similarity within
the context into account and thus hinder the accurate entropy estimation. To
address this issue, we propose a non-local operation for context modeling by
employing the global similarity within the context. Specifically, we first
introduce the proxy similarity functions and spatial masks to handle the
missing reference problem in context modeling. Then, we combine the local and
the global context via a non-local attention block and employ it in masked
convolutional networks for entropy modeling. The entropy model is further
adopted as the rate loss in a joint rate-distortion optimization to guide the
training of the analysis transform and the synthesis transform network in
transforming coding framework. Considering that the width of the transforms is
essential in training low distortion models, we finally produce a U-Net block
in the transforms to increase the width with manageable memory consumption and
time complexity. Experiments on Kodak and Tecnick datasets demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed context-based non-local attention block in entropy
modeling and the U-Net block in low distortion compression against the existing

model on synthetic hazy images, which are less able to generalize well to real
hazy images due to domain shift. To address this issue, we propose a domain
adaptation paradigm, which consists of an image translation module and two
image dehazing modules. Specifically, we first apply a bidirectional
translation network to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real domains by
translating images from one domain to another. And then, we use images before
and after translation to train the proposed two image dehazing networks with a
consistency constraint. In this phase, we incorporate the real hazy image into
the dehazing training via exploiting the properties of the clear image (e.g.,
dark channel prior and image gradient smoothing) to further improve the domain
adaptivity. By training image translation and dehazing network in an end-to-end
manner, we can obtain better effects of both image translation and dehazing.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that
our model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms.

second order in the coupling by the topological term . In analogy to the
topological $\theta$ term, the Gauss-Bonnet term is introduced into the
effective action with a complex coupling to implement signed energy shifts. We
investigate the rigid color flux-sheets between two static color sources near
the critical point in the light of the topologically induced shifts. The
Yang-Mills lattice data of the potential of static quark-antiquark $Q\bar{Q}$
in a heatbath is compared to the string potential. The Monte-Carlo data
correspond to link-integrated Polyakov-loop correlators averaged over SU(3)
gauge configurations at $\beta=6.0$. Substantial improvement in the fit
behavior is displayed over the nonperturbative source separation distance $0.2$

and discrete values. Despite the availability of many libraries, data sets with
mixed data types require intensive pre-processing steps, and it remains a
challenge to describe the relationships between variables. The data
understanding phase is an important step in the data mining process, however,
without making any assumptions on the data, the search space is
super-exponential in the number of variables. Methods: We propose graphical
hypergeometric networks (HNet), a method to test associations across variables
for significance using statistical inference. The aim is to determine a network
using only the significant associations in order to shed light on the complex
relationships across variables. HNet processes raw unstructured data sets and
outputs a network that consists of (partially) directed or undirected edges
between the nodes (i.e., variables). To evaluate the accuracy of HNet, we used
well known data sets and in addition generated data sets with known ground
truth. The performance of HNet is compared to Bayesian structure learning.
Results: We demonstrate that HNet showed high accuracy and performance in the
detection of node links. In the case of the Alarm data set we can demonstrate
on average an MCC score of 0.33 + 0.0002 (P<1x10-6), whereas Bayesian structure
learning resulted in an average MCC score of 0.52 + 0.006 (P<1x10-11), and
randomly assigning edges resulted in a MCC score of 0.004 + 0.0003 (P=0.49).
Conclusions: HNet can process raw unstructured data sets, allows analysis of
mixed data types, it easily scales up in number of variables, and allows
detailed examination of the detected associations. Availability:

descriptor systems using a tangential interpolation projection method based on
the Iterative Rational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA). Our primary focus is to reduce
the system into a second-order form so that the structure of the original
system can be preserved. For this purpose, the IRKA based tangential
interpolatory method is modified to deal with the second-order structure of the
underlying descriptor system efficiently in an implicit way. The paper also
shows that by exploiting the symmetric properties of the system the
implementing computational costs can be reduced significantly. Theoretical
results are verified for the model reduction of the piezo actuator based
adaptive spindle support which is second-order index-1 differential-algebraic

multi-talker environment given a target speaker's reference speech. We recently
proposed a time-domain solution, SpEx, that avoids the phase estimation in
frequency-domain approaches. Unfortunately, SpEx is not fully a time-domain
solution since it performs time-domain speech encoding for speaker extraction,
while taking frequency-domain speaker embedding as the reference. The size of
the analysis window for time-domain and the size for frequency-domain input are
also different. Such mismatch has an adverse effect on the system performance.
To eliminate such mismatch, we propose a complete time-domain speaker
extraction solution, that is called SpEx+. Specifically, we tie the weights of
two identical speech encoder networks, one for the encoder-extractor-decoder
pipeline, another as part of the speaker encoder. Experiments show that the
SpEx+ achieves 0.8dB and 2.1dB SDR improvement over the state-of-the-art SpEx
baseline, under different and same gender conditions on WSJ0-2mix-extr database
respectively.

initiated. We show that for any such symplectic $4$-orbifold $X$, there is a
canonically constructed symplectic $4$-orbifold $Y$, together with a cyclic
orbifold covering $Y\rightarrow X$, such that $Y$ has at most isolated Du Val
singularities and a trivial orbifold canonical line bundle. The minimal
resolution of $Y$, to be denoted by $\tilde{Y}$, is a symplectic Calabi-Yau
$4$-manifold endowed with a natural symplectic finite cyclic action, extending
the deck transformations of the orbifold covering $Y\rightarrow X$.
Furthermore, we show that when $b_1(X)>0$, $\tilde{Y}$ is a $T^2$-bundle over
$T^2$ with symplectic fibers, and when $b_1(X)=0$, $\tilde{Y}$ is either an
integral homology $K3$ surface or a rational homology $T^4$; in the latter
case, the singular set of $X$ is completely classified. To further investigate
the topology of $X$, we introduce a general successive symplectic blowing-down
procedure, which may be of independent interest. Under suitable assumptions,
the procedure allows us to successively blow down a given symplectic rational
$4$-manifold to $CP^2$, during which process we can canonically transform a
given configuration of symplectic surfaces to a ""symplectic arrangement"" of
pseudoholomorphic curves in $CP^2$. The procedure is reversible; by a sequence
of successive blowing-ups in the reversing order, one can recover the original
configuration of symplectic surfaces up to a smooth isotopy.

machine translation to speed up the inference time by generating all words in

optimize each word independently. However, such a learning process fails to
consider the sentence-level consistency, thus resulting in inferior generation
quality of these non-autoregressive models. In this paper, we propose a
Non-Autoregressive Image Captioning (NAIC) model with a novel training

NAIC as a multi-agent reinforcement learning system where positions in the

that a velodrome consists of two parallel straights and two semicircular arcs.
We neglect the effects of the track inclination along the straights and assume
the track inclination along the curves to be constant. For either segment, we
consider two distinct black-line speeds. For the latter, the lean-angle
expression is derived based on a noninertial frame of the cyclist. Among
conclusions quantified by this model is the fact that a constant-cadence
approach to an individual pursuit does not minimize the required power.

strengths. It can be used to reproduce the frustrated SF with the 4 sublattice
$ 90^{\circ} $ coplanar spin structure plus its excitations in the weak

Through an examination of aspects of peer review including anonymity, trust,
expertise, and the question of who has standing to evaluate research, we find
that objectivity in peer review differs significantly from other uses of the
term objectivity in science. In peer review it is not required for this
objectivity to have correspondence to an outside world, instead it is enough
for it to operate inside the ""rules"" of the community. Neither is the
objectivity here empirical in the sense of using data about the scientific
problem in question. Rather, the objectivity is one of judgment, cleaving to
the epistemological standards of a community that are formed by background
assumptions and beliefs. As a consequence, we highlight the role of
subjectivity in what is usually taken as a practice of objectivity, and arrive
at the insight that objectivity is not defined by one core value, but a balance
of transparency, confidentiality, trust, representation, and living up to
community standards. As such, objectivity in peer review is a highly specific
sense of the term that is not reducible to that used in other aspects of
scientific practice.

return of the underlying price process. According to Black (1972), where there
exist heterogeneous views on the instantaneous mean return, this will result in
arbitrage opportunities. Behavioral finance proponents argue that such
heterogenous views are likely to occur and this will not impact option pricing
models proposed by rational dynamic asset pricing theory and will not give rise
to volatility smiles. To rectify this, a leading advocate of behavioral finance
has proposed a behavioral option pricing model. As there may be unexplored
links between the behavioral and rational approaches to option pricing, in this
paper we revisit Shefrin (2008) option pricing model as an example and suggest
one approach to modify this behavioral finance option pricing formula to be
consistent with rational dynamic asset pricing theory by introducing arbitrage
transaction costs which offset the gains from arbitrage trades.

with a perfectly conducting step-like surface, a sharp Sommerfeld radiation
condition (SRC) for the first time, an analytic formula of the far-field
pattern, and a high-accuracy numerical solver. We adopt the Wiener-Hopf method
to compute the Green function for a cracked half plane, a background for the
perturbed half plane. We rigorously show that the Green function asymptotically
satisfies a universal-direction SRC (uSRC) and radiates purely outgoing at
infinity. This helps to propose an implicit transparent boundary condition for
the scattered wave, by either a cylindrical incident wave due to a line source
or a plane incident wave. Then, a well-posedness theory is established via an
associated variational formulation. The theory reveals that the scattered wave,
post-subtracting a known wave field, satisfies the same uSRC so that its
far-field pattern is accessible theoretically. For a plane-wave incidence,
asymptotic analysis shows that merely subtracting reflected plane waves, due to
non-uniform heights of the step-like surface at infinity, from the scattered
wave in respective regions produces a discontinuous wave satisfying the uSRC as
well. Numerically, we adopt a previously developed perfectly-matched-layer
(PML) boundary-integral-equation method to solve the problem. Numerical results
demonstrate that the PML truncation error decays exponentially fast as
thickness or absorbing power of the PML increases, of which the convergence
relies heavily on the Green function exponentially decaying in the PML.

predict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or
results are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow
