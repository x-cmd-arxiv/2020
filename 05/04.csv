subsequently manipulate algorithmically selected physical processes, objects or
qualities in a domain. Organizationally real digital representations are those
that, beyond the mere capacity to, actually get woven into everyday work
practices. Empirically, we draw on a four-year case study of offshore oil and
gas production. Our case provides a vivid illustration of Internet of Things
(IoT) based visualizations and data driven predictions characteristic for
efforts of digitally transforming industrial process and manufacturing
enterprises. We contribute by identifying and discussing three mechanisms
through which digital representations become organizationally real: (i) noise
reduction (the strategies and heuristics to filter out signal from noise), (ii)
material tethering (grounding the digital representations to a corresponding
physical measurement) and (iii) triangulating (in the absence of a direct
correspondence, corroborating digital representations relative to other
representations).

more complex answer than in a cold paradigm. It has been highlighted here that
whether warm inflation exits gracefully depends on three independent choices:
The form of the potential, the choice of the warm inflation model (i.e., on the
form of its dissipative coefficient) and the regime, of weak or strong
dissipation, characterizing the warm inflation dynamics. Generic conditions on
slow-roll parameters and several constraints on the different model parameters

However, MI is unfortunately intractable in continuous and high-dimensional

discover useful representation. However, most of the existing methods are not
capable of providing an accurate estimation of MI with low-variance when the MI
is large. We argue that directly estimating the gradients of MI is more
appealing for representation learning than estimating MI in itself. To this
end, we propose the Mutual Information Gradient Estimator (MIGE) for
representation learning based on the score estimation of implicit
distributions. MIGE exhibits a tight and smooth gradient estimation of MI in
the high-dimensional and large-MI settings. We expand the applications of MIGE
in both unsupervised learning of deep representations based on InfoMax and the
Information Bottleneck method. Experimental results have indicated significant
performance improvement in learning useful representation.

graphs: after suitably metrising the space of graph partitions, we restrict
Laplacians to the clusters thus arising and use their spectral gaps to define
several notions of partition energies; this is the graph counterpart of the
well-known theory of spectral minimal partitions on planar domains and includes
the setting in [Band \textit{et al}, Comm.\ Math.\ Phys.\ \textbf{311} (2012),
815--838] as a special case. We focus on the existence of optimisers for a
large class of functionals defined on such partitions, but also study their
qualitative properties, including stability, regularity, and parameter
dependence. We also discuss in detail their interplay with the theory of nodal
partitions. Unlike in the case of domains, the one-dimensional setting of
metric graphs allows for explicit computation and analytic -- rather than
numerical -- results. Not only do we recover the main assertions in the theory
of spectral minimal partitions on domains, as studied in [Conti \textit{et al},

(1) the pandemic has had a negative effect on developers' wellbeing and

understand the climate of a planet. The meteorological measurements by the
instruments onboard InSight at a latitude of 4.5$^{\circ}$N make a uniquely
rich dataset to study the active turbulent dynamics of the daytime PBL on Mars.
Here we use the high-sensitivity continuous pressure, wind, temperature
measurements in the first 400 sols of InSight operations (from northern late
winter to midsummer) to analyze wind gusts, convective cells and vortices in
Mars' daytime PBL. We compare InSight measurements to turbulence-resolving
Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). The daytime PBL turbulence at the InSight landing
site is very active, with clearly identified signatures of convective cells and
a vast population of 6000 recorded vortex encounters, adequately represented by
a power-law with a 3.4 exponent. While the daily variability of vortex
encounters at InSight can be explained by the statistical nature of turbulence,
the seasonal variability is positively correlated with ambient wind speed,
which is supported by LES. However, wind gustiness is positively correlated to
surface temperature rather than ambient wind speed and sensible heat flux,
confirming the radiative control of the daytime martian PBL; and fewer
convective vortices are forming in LES when the background wind is doubled.
Thus, the long-term seasonal variability of vortex encounters at the InSight
landing site is mainly controlled by the advection of convective vortices by
ambient wind speed. Typical tracks followed by vortices forming in the LES show
a similar distribution in direction and length as orbital imagery.

number of standard cones recognized by advanced conic solvers such as MOSEK 9.
Such extended formulations are often significantly larger and more complex than
equivalent conic natural formulations, which can use a much broader class of
exotic cones. We define an exotic cone as a proper cone for which we can
implement tractable logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barrier oracles
for either the cone or its dual cone. In this paper we introduce Hypatia, a
highly-configurable open-source conic primal-dual interior point solver with a
generic interface for exotic cones. Hypatia is written in Julia and accessible
through JuMP, and currently implements around two dozen useful predefined cones
(some with multiple variants). We define some of Hypatia's exotic cones, and
for conic constraints over these cones, we analyze techniques for constructing
equivalent representations using the standard cones. For optimization problems
from a variety of applications, we introduce natural formulations using these
exotic cones, and we show that the natural formulations are simpler and
lower-dimensional than the equivalent extended formulations. Our computational
experiments demonstrate the potential advantages, especially in terms of solve
time and memory usage, of solving the natural formulations with Hypatia

curve as input data and can further be extended either for constructing
customized optimal dynamical decoupling protocols or for obtaining critical
qubit attributes such as its proximity to the sample surface. Our results can
be applied to a wide range of qubit platforms, and provide a framework for
improving qubit performance with applications not only in quantum computing and

generation for improving aggregate diversity. The algorithm iteratively finds
items that are rarely recommended yet are high-quality and add them to the
users' final recommendation lists. This is done by solving the maximum flow

diversity and fair distribution of recommended items, the algorithm can be
adapted to other recommendation scenarios using different underlying

tools, Govt. and the policymakers may not be paying attention to the risk of
hospital-based transmission. To explore more on this important route and its
possible impact on lockdown effect, we developed a mechanistic model with
hospital-based transmission. Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six
states (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar
Pradesh) and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the
model. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the basic ($R_{0}$), the
community ($R_{C}$), and the hospital ($R_{H}$) reproduction numbers for those
seven locations. To obtain a reliable forecast of future COVID-19 cases, a BMA
post-processing technique is used to ensemble the mechanistic model with a
hybrid statistical model. Using the ensemble model, we forecast COVID-19
notified cases (daily and cumulative) from May 3, 2020, till May 20, 2020,
under five different lockdown scenarios in the mentioned locations. Our
analysis of the mechanistic model suggests that most of the new COVID-19 cases
are currently undetected in the mentioned seven locations. Furthermore, a
global sensitivity analysis of four epidemiologically measurable \&
controllable parameters on $R_{0}$ and as well on the lockdown effect, indicate
that if appropriate preventive measures are not taken immediately, a much
larger COVID-19 outbreak may trigger from hospitals and quarantined centers. In
most of the locations, our ensemble model forecast indicates a substantial
percentage of increase in the COVID-19 notified cases in the coming weeks in

the Higgs-fermion couplings could still be linear, but they could lay on
multiple lines. Then, the angle subtended by these lines, with respect to the

the Two-Higgs doublet Model (2HDM). Models where fermion masses arise from
higher-dimensional operators, may also result in large deviations from the SM

function of the fermion masses. In the case of neutrino masses, when they arise
from the see-saw mechanism, one finds that the Higgs Yukawa couplings will show
a non-linear mass relation.

in risk) tests whether past extreme events of a time series help predicting
future extreme events of another time series. The topology and connectedness of
networks built with Granger causality in tail can be used to measure systemic
risk and to identify risk transmitters. Here we introduce a novel test of
Granger causality in tail which adopts the likelihood ratio statistic and is
based on the multivariate generalization of a discrete autoregressive process
for binary time series describing the sequence of extreme events of the
underlying price dynamics. The proposed test has very good size and power in
finite samples, especially for large sample size, allows inferring the correct
time scale at which the causal interaction takes place, and it is flexible
enough for multivariate extension when more than two time series are considered
in order to decrease false detections as spurious effect of neglected
variables. An extensive simulation study shows the performances of the proposed
method with a large variety of data generating processes and it introduces also
the comparison with the test of Granger causality in tail by [Hong et al.,

pointing out some crucial aspects related to the false detections of Granger
causality for tail events. An empirical application to high frequency data of a

experimental thermal processing (which under space conditions could be
equivalent to the expected processing by shock waves or high energy radiation)
of mixed aromatic/aliphatic organic matter can be used to match also the UIE

matter in space, can be achieved through the carbon arc. Simple substrates
processed in this way produce carbon soot and a plethora of organic molecules.
Fullerenes are found in space both through mid-infrared and optical
spectroscopy and it is very likely that other complex related species such as
endohedral fullerenes (i.e. fullerenes with a metal, heteroatom or molecules

the same conditions as those needed for fullerene formation provided that also
a metal vapour (e.g. interstellar/circumstellar gas) is available. The last

potentially achieved by linear discriminant analysis (LDA), which is one of the
most classical and popular classification techniques. However, the
classification problem becomes challenging for LDA because of the
high-dimensionally and the spatial dependency of the brain imaging data. To
address the challenges, researchers have proposed various ways to generalize
LDA into high-dimensional context in recent years. However, these existing
methods did not reach any consensus on how to incorporate spatially dependent
structure. In light of the current needs and limitations, we propose a new
classification method, named as Penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation LDA
(PMLE-LDA). The proposed method uses $Mat\acute{e}rn$ covariance function to
describe the spatial correlation of brain regions. Additionally, PMLE is
designed to model the sparsity of high-dimensional features. The spatial
location information is used to address the singularity of the covariance.
Tapering technique is introduced to reduce computational burden. We show in
theory that the proposed method can not only provide consistent results of
parameter estimation and feature selection, but also generate an asymptotically
optimal classifier driven by high dimensional data with specific spatially
dependent structure. Finally, the method is validated through simulations and
an application into ADNI data for classifying Alzheimer's patients.

complicated by the fact that microbial data are high dimensional and
heterogeneous. Masked by the complexity of the data, the problem of separating
signals from noise becomes challenging and troublesome. For instance, when
performing differential abundance tests, multiple testing adjustments tend to
be overconservative, as the probability of a type I error (false positive)
increases dramatically with the large numbers of hypotheses. Moreover, the
grouping effect of interest can be obscured by heterogeneity. These factors can
incorrectly lead to the conclusion that there are no differences in the
microbiome compositions. We translate and represent the problem of identifying
differential features as a dynamic layout of separating the signal from its
random background. We propose progressive permutation as a method to achieve
this process and show converging patterns. More specifically, we progressively
permute the grouping factor labels of the microbiome samples and perform
multiple differential abundance tests in each scenario. We then compare the
signal strength of the top features from the original data with their
performance in permutations, and observe an apparent decreasing trend if these
top features are true positives identified from the data. We have developed
this into a user-friendly RShiny tool and R package, which consist of functions
that can convey the overall association between the microbiome and the grouping
factor, rank the robustness of the discovered microbes, and list the
discoveries, their effect sizes, and individual abundances.

the UAV, and then the UAV forwards its received data to CEUs according to a
certain association strategy. In order to maximize the sum rate of all CEUs, we
jointly optimize the UAV mobility management, including trajectory, velocity,
and acceleration, and association strategy of CEUs to the UAV, subject to
minimum rate requirements of CEUs, mobility constraints of the UAV and causal
buffer constraints in practice. To address the mixed-integer nonconvex problem,

spectral density estimation. We perform a detailed analysis indicating how the

utilization of the radio spectrum. Besides, it is expected that CR-enabled
vehicular ad-hoc networks (CR-VANETs) enrich the communication performance of
the existing vehicular networks (VANETs). However, to ensure efficient
performance in a multi-hop communication, the routing protocol in CR-VANETs
needs to consider the autonomous mobility of the vehicles as well as the
stochastic availability of the channels. Hence, this paper introduces a
spectrum-aware mobility pattern based reactive routing protocol for CR-VANET.
The proposed protocol accommodates the dynamic behavior and selects a stable
transmission path from a source node to the destination. Therefore, the
proposed protocol is outlined as a weighted graph problem where the weight for
an edge is measured based on a parameter termed as NHDF (Next-hop Determination
Factor). The NHDF implicitly considers mobility patterns of the nodes and
channel availability to select the optimum path for communication. Therefore,
in the proposed routing protocol, the mobility pattern of a node is defined
from the viewpoint of distance, speed, direction, and node's reliability.
Furthermore, the spectrum awareness in the proposed protocol is measured over
the number of shared common channels and the channel quality. It is anticipated
that the proposed protocol shows efficient routing performance by selecting
stable and secured paths from source to destination. Simulation is carried out
to assess the performance of the protocol where it is witnessed that the
proposed routing protocol outperforms existing ones.

fields. Accurate forecasting results can effectively help decision-making. To
date, many MTS forecasting methods have been proposed and widely applied.
However, these methods assume that the predicted value of a single variable is
affected by all other variables, which ignores the causal relationship among
variables. To address the above issue, we propose a novel end-to-end deep
learning model, termed graph neural network with Neural Granger Causality
(CauGNN) in this paper. To characterize the causal information among variables,
we introduce the Neural Granger Causality graph in our model. Each variable is
regarded as a graph node, and each edge represents the casual relationship
between variables. In addition, convolutional neural network (CNN) filters with
different perception scales are used for time series feature extraction, which
is used to generate the feature of each node. Finally, Graph Neural Network
(GNN) is adopted to tackle the forecasting problem of graph structure generated
by MTS. Three benchmark datasets from the real world are used to evaluate the
proposed CauGNN. The comprehensive experiments show that the proposed method

computational systems. Whereas computers are carefully engineered to represent
and perform mathematical operations on structured data, neurobiological systems
perform analogous functions despite flexible organization and unstructured
sensory input. Recent efforts have made progress in modeling the representation
and recall of information in neural systems. However, precisely how neural
systems learn to modify these representations remains far from understood. Here
we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can learn to modify its
representation of complex information using only examples, and we explain the
associated learning mechanism with new theory. Specifically, we drive an RNN
with examples of translated, linearly transformed, or pre-bifurcated time
series from a chaotic Lorenz system, alongside an additional control signal
that changes value for each example. By training the network to replicate the
Lorenz inputs, it learns to autonomously evolve about a Lorenz-shaped manifold.
Additionally, it learns to continuously interpolate and extrapolate the
translation, transformation, and bifurcation of this representation far beyond
the training data by changing the control signal. Finally, we provide a
mechanism for how these computations are learned, and demonstrate that a single
network can simultaneously learn multiple computations. Together, our results
provide a simple but powerful mechanism by which an RNN can learn to manipulate
internal representations of complex information, allowing for the principled
study and precise design of RNNs.

our elastoresistivity measurements, which are in full agreement with published

natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Despite their performance, it is
unclear whether, or how, LSTMs learn structural features of natural languages
such as subject-verb number agreement in English. Lacking this understanding,
the generality of LSTM performance on this task and their suitability for
related tasks remains uncertain. Further, errors cannot be properly attributed
to a lack of structural capability, training data omissions, or other
exceptional faults. We introduce *influence paths*, a causal account of
structural properties as carried by paths across gates and neurons of a
recurrent neural network. The approach refines the notion of influence (the
subject's grammatical number has influence on the grammatical number of the
subsequent verb) into a set of gate or neuron-level paths. The set localizes
and segments the concept (e.g., subject-verb agreement), its constituent
elements (e.g., the subject), and related or interfering elements (e.g.,
attractors). We exemplify the methodology on a widely-studied multi-layer LSTM
language model, demonstrating its accounting for subject-verb number agreement.
The results offer both a finer and a more complete view of an LSTM's handling
of this structural aspect of the English language than prior results based on
diagnostic classifiers and ablation.

Reference-free evaluation holds the promise of web-scale comparison of MT

encoders for reference-free MT evaluation and identify their two key

coupling of semantic-similarity based metrics with target-side language

cohomology of operads enriched over a general base category. Our main result
provides an explicit formula for computing Quillen cohomology of enriched
operads, based on a procedure of taking certain infinitesimal models of their
cotangent complexes. Furthermore, we propose a natural construction of the
twisted arrow $\infty$-categories of simplicial operads. We then assert that
the cotangent complex of a simplicial operad can be represented as a spectrum
valued functor on its twisted arrow $\infty$-category.
  When working in good stable base categories such as chain complexes and
spectra, Francis and Lurie proved the existence of a fiber sequence relating
the cotangent complex of an $E_n$-algebra and its Hochschild complex, verifying
a conjecture of Kontsevich. We prove the existence of an analogue for the
$E_n$-operads themselves, in the framework of topological setting.

chemogradients where motile cells can gain an advantage over non-motile cells.
Since motility is energetically costly, cells must optimize their swimming
speed and behavior to maximize their fitness. Here we investigate how cheating
strategies might evolve where slow or non-motile microbes exploit faster ones
by sticking together and hitching a ride. Starting with physical and biological
first-principles we computationally study the effects of sticking on the
evolution of motility in a controlled chemostat environment. We find stickiness
allows slow cheaters to dominate when nutrients are dispersed at intermediate
distances. Here, slow microbes exploit faster ones until they consume the
population, leading to a tragedy of commons. For long races, slow microbes do
gain an initial advantage from sticking, but eventually fall behind. Here, fast
microbes are more likely to stick to other fast microbes, and cooperate to
increase their own population. We therefore find the nature of the hitchhiking
interaction, parasitic or mutualistic, depends on the nutrient distribution.

accelerators show promise in bridging the gap between Internet of Thing
devices' constrained resources and Convolutional/Deep Neural Networks'
(CNNs/DNNs') prohibitive energy cost. Specifically, R$^2$PIM accelerators
enhance energy efficiency by eliminating the cost of weight movements and
improving the computational density through ReRAM's high density. However, the
energy efficiency is still limited by the dominant energy cost of input and
partial sum (Psum) movements and the cost of digital-to-analog (D/A) and
analog-to-digital (A/D) interfaces. In this work, we identify three
energy-saving opportunities in R$^2$PIM accelerators: analog data locality,
time-domain interfacing, and input access reduction, and propose an innovative
R$^2$PIM accelerator called TIMELY, with three key contributions: (1) TIMELY
adopts analog local buffers (ALBs) within ReRAM crossbars to greatly enhance
the data locality, minimizing the energy overheads of both input and Psum
movements; (2) TIMELY largely reduces the energy of each single D/A (and A/D)
conversion and the total number of conversions by using time-domain interfaces
(TDIs) and the employed ALBs, respectively; (3) we develop an only-once input
read (O$^2$IR) mapping method to further decrease the energy of input accesses
and the number of D/A conversions. The evaluation with more than 10 CNN/DNN
models and various chip configurations shows that, TIMELY outperforms the
baseline R$^2$PIM accelerator, PRIME, by one order of magnitude in energy
efficiency while maintaining better computational density (up to 31.2$\times$)
and throughput (up to 736.6$\times$). Furthermore, comprehensive studies are
performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed ALB, TDI, and O$^2$IR
innovations in terms of energy savings and area reduction.

the next population is obtained following a steady-state strategy. The

applications in practice. Riemannian stochastic first-order algorithms have
been studied in the literature to solve large-scale machine learning problems

algorithms require the objective function to be differentiable, and they do not
apply to the case where the objective function is nonsmooth. In this paper, we
present two Riemannian stochastic proximal gradient methods for minimizing
nonsmooth function over the Stiefel manifold. The two methods, named R-ProxSGD
and R-ProxSPB, are generalizations of proximal SGD and proximal SpiderBoost in
Euclidean setting to the Riemannian setting. Analysis on the incremental
first-order oracle (IFO) complexity of the proposed algorithms is provided.
Specifically, the R-ProxSPB algorithm finds an $\epsilon$-stationary point with
$\O(\epsilon^{-3})$ IFOs in the online case, and $\O(n+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$
IFOs in the finite-sum case with $n$ being the number of summands in the

completion show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the existing

metasurfaces but also their entire time-domain responses. Particularly, this
study reports the importance of resistive components of diodes as well as the
limitation of our models with respect to the power dependence although still
the models effectively work when waveform-selective mechanisms are clearly
exhibited with a sufficiently large input power. Thus, the idea of the proposed
equivalent circuit models contributes not only to a greater understanding of
waveform-selective mechanisms but also to facilitating the design process of
such unique structures.

disc from $0.2$ to $7\,$pc unambiguously detected by recent ALMA observations
of molecular gas. Upon further analysis of disc dynamics, we find that the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability (KHI) results in an unavoidable catastrophe
of the disc developed at the interface between the reversely rotating parts,
and demonstrate that a close binary of supermassive black holes provides tidal
torques as the unique external sources to prevent the disc from the KH
catastrophe. We are led to the inescapable conclusion that there must be a
binary black hole at the center of NGC 1068, to prevent it from the KH
catastrophe. The binary is composed of black holes with a separation of
$0.1\,$pc from GRAVITY/VLTI observations, a total mass of $1.3\times
10^{7}\:M_{\odot}$ and a mass ratio of $\sim 0.3$ estimated from the angular
momentum budge of the global system. The KHI gives rise to forming a gap
without cold gas at the velocity interface which overlaps with the observed gap
of hot and cold dust regions. Releases of kinematic energies from the KHI of
the disc are in agreement with observed emissions in radio and $\gamma$-rays.
Such a binary is shrinking with a timescale much longer than the local Hubble
time via gravitational waves, however, the KHI leads to an efficient
annihilation of the orbital angular momentum and speed up merge of the binary,
providing a new paradigm of solving the long term issue of ""final parsec
problem"". Future observations of GRAVITY+/VLTI are expected to be able to
spatially resolve the CB-SMBHs suggested in this paper.

kilometer-scale unstable icebergs. The transient contact force applied by the
capsizing iceberg on the glacier front generates seismic waves that propagate
over teleseismic distances. The inversion of this seismic signal is of great
interest to get insight into actual and past capsize dynamics. However, the
iceberg size, which is of interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot
be recovered from the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a
complex process involving interactions between the iceberg, the glacier and the
surrounding water. This paper presents a first step towards the construction of
a complete model, and is focused on the capsize in the open ocean without
glacier front nor ice-m\'elange. The capsize dynamics of an iceberg in the open
ocean is captured by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which
allows assessing the complexity of the fluid motion around a capsizing iceberg
and how far the ocean is affected by iceberg rotation. Expressing the results
in terms of appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale
and field scale capsizes can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is
found to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect ratio and to the water and
ice densities. However, dealing at the same time with the fluid dynamics and
the contact between the iceberg and the deformable glacier front requires
highly complex coupling that often goes beyond actual capabilities of
fluid-structure interaction softwares. Therefore, we developed a
semi-analytical simplified fluid-structure model (SAFIM) that can be
implemented in solid mechanics computations dealing with contact dynamics of
deformable solids. This model accounts for hydrodynamic forces through
calibrated drag and added-mass effects, and is calibrated against the reference
CFD simulations...

  clarification of Algorithm 1",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Renormalized homotopy continuation on toric varieties is introduced as a tool
for solving sparse systems of polynomial equations, or sparse systems of
exponential sums. The cost of continuation depends on a renormalized condition
length, defined as a line integral of the condition number along all the lifted
renormalized paths.
  The theory developed in this paper leads to a continuation algorithm tracking
all the solutions between two generic systems with the same structure. The
algorithm is randomized, in the sense that it follows a random path between the
two systems. The probability of success is one. In order to produce an expected
cost bound, several invariants depending solely of the supports of the
equations are introduced. For instance, the mixed area is a quermassintegral
that generalizes surface area in the same way that mixed volume generalizes
ordinary volume. The facet gap measures for each 1-cone in the fan and for each
support polytope, how close is the supporting hyperplane to the nearest vertex.
Once the supports are fixed, the expected cost depends on the input
coefficients solely through two invariants: the renormalized toric condition
number and the imbalance of the absolute values of the coefficients. This leads
to a non-uniform polynomial complexity bound for polynomial solving in terms of
those two invariants.

small adversarial perturbations of inputs. Existing procedures to defend
against such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible
to stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case
attacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this
work, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers
guaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The
core component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a
smaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a
bottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same
encodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to
construct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to
a small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still
perform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family
of adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn
paired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all
adversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a
typo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.

invariant measure on stationary solutions of Euler equations with the extra
condition of fixed energy flow/dissipation. The asymptotic solution for large
circulation around large loops is studied as a WKB limit (instanton). The
Clebsch fields are discontinuous across minimal surface bounded by the loop,
with normal vorticity staying continuous. There is also a singular tangential
vorticity component proportional to $\delta(z)$ where $z$ is the normal
direction. Resulting flow has nontrivial topology. This singular tangent
vorticity component drops from the flux but dominates the energy dissipation as
well as the Biot-Savart integral for velocity field. This leads us to a
modified equation for vorticity distribution along the minimal surface compared
to that assumed in a loop equations, where the singular terms were not noticed.
In addition to describing vorticity distribution over the minimal surface, this
approach provides formula for the circulation PDF, which was elusive in the
Loop Equations.

dataset with only one image per category. It is challenging for modern deep
neural networks that typically require hundreds or thousands of images per
class. In this paper, we adopt metric learning for this problem, which has been
applied for few- and many-shot image classification by comparing the distance
between the test image and the center of each class in the feature space.
However, for one-shot learning, the existing metric learning approaches would
suffer poor performance because the single training image may not be
representative of the class. For example, if the image is far away from the
class center in the feature space, the metric-learning based algorithms are
unlikely to make correct predictions for the test images because the decision
boundary is shifted by this noisy image. To address this issue, we propose a
simple yet effective regression model, denoted by RestoreNet, which learns a
class agnostic transformation on the image feature to move the image closer to
the class center in the feature space. Experiments demonstrate that RestoreNet
obtains superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods on a broad range
of datasets. Moreover, RestoreNet can be easily combined with other methods to
achieve further improvement.

barrier thickness bellow a critical thickness seems to suppress the
ferroelectric nature of the BaTiO$_3$. The Josephson coupling temperature is
strongly reduced for increasing barrier thicknesses, which may be related to
the suppression of the superconducting critical temperature in the bottom

electron-nuclear cusp, and hence struggle to accurately describe core electron
properties. A recently introduced novel type of basis set, mixed
ramp-Gaussians, introduce a new primitive function called a ramp function which
addresses this issue. This paper introduces three new mixed ramp-Gaussian basis
sets - STO-R, STO-RG and STO-R2G, made from a linear combination of ramp and
Gaussian primitive functions - which are derived from the single-core-zeta
Slater basis sets for the elements Li to Ne. This derivation is done in an
analogous fashion to the famous STO-$n$G basis sets. The STO-RG basis functions
are found to outperform the STO-3G basis functions and STO-R2G outperforms
STO-6G, both in terms of wavefunction fit and other key quantities such as the
one-electron energy and the electron-nuclear cusp. The second part of this
paper performs preparatory investigations into how standard all-Gaussian basis
sets can be converted to ramp-Gaussian basis sets through modifying the core
basis functions. Using a test case of the 6-31G basis set for carbon, we
determined that the second Gaussian primitive is less important when fitting a
ramp-Gaussian core basis function directly to an all-Gaussian core basis
function than when fitting to a Slater basis function. Further, we identified
the basis sets that are single-core-zeta and thus should be most
straightforward to convert to mixed ramp-Gaussian basis sets in the future.

experiment, we measure a peak-valley response corresponding to a large and
negative Kerr nonlinearity of n2 = -1.33 x 10-15 m2/W, two orders of magnitude
larger than bulk silicon. We also characterize the variation of n2 as a
function of laser intensity, observing that n2 decreases in magnitude with
incident laser intensity, becoming saturated at n2 = -9.96 x 10-16 m2/W at high
intensities. These results verify the large third order nonlinear optical
response of 2D PdSe2 as well as its strong potential for high performance
nonlinear photonic devices.

models have the property that for half-odd-integer spins their eigenstates map
on to those of spin-1/2 Kitaev models, with well-known highly entangled quantum
spin-liquid states and Majorana fermions. For integer spins, the Hamiltonian is
made out of commuting local operators. Thus, the eigenstates can be chosen to
be completely unentangled between different sites, though with a significant
degeneracy for each eigenstate. For half-odd-integer spins, the thermodynamic
properties can be related to the spin-1/2 Kitaev models apart from an
additional degeneracy. Hence we focus here on the case of integer spins. We use
transfer matrix methods, high temperature expansions and Monte Carlo
simulations to study the thermodynamic properties of ferromagnetic and
antiferromagnetic models with spin $S=1$ and $S=2$. Apart from large residual
entropies, which all the models have, we find that they can have a variety of
different behaviors. Transfer matrix calculations show that for the different
models, the correlation lengths can be finite as $T\to 0$, become critical as
$T\to 0$ or diverge exponentially as $T\to 0$. There is a conserved $Z_2$ flux
variable associated with each hexagonal plaquette which saturates at the value
$+1$ as $T\rightarrow0$ in all models except the $S=1$ antiferromagnet where
the mean flux remains zero as $T\to 0$. We provide qualitative explanations for
these results.

called PGLP, i.e., \textit{Policy Graph based Location Privacy}, providing a
rich interface to release private locations with customizable and rigorous
privacy guarantee. First, we design the privacy metrics of PGLP by extending
differential privacy. Specifically, we formalize a user's location privacy
requirements using a \textit{location policy graph}, which is expressive and
customizable. Second, we investigate how to satisfy an arbitrarily given
location policy graph under adversarial knowledge. We find that a location
policy graph may not always be viable and may suffer \textit{location exposure}
when the attacker knows the user's mobility pattern. We propose efficient
methods to detect location exposure and repair the policy graph with optimal
utility. Third, we design a private location trace release framework that
pipelines the detection of location exposure, policy graph repair, and private
trajectory release with customizable and rigorous location privacy. Finally, we
conduct experiments on real-world datasets to verify the effectiveness of the
privacy-utility trade-off and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.

the approximation quality can be directly improved by including more spectral

(AGN) wind of the primary SMBH. We show that the emission of these CRs can
reproduce the X-ray and $\gamma$-ray flare data self-consistently with the
optical component of the November 2015 major flare. The derived emission models
are consistent with a magnetic field $B \sim 5$ G in the emission region and a

The mechanical luminosity of the AGN wind represents $\lesssim 50\%$ of the

pseudo-barrier certificates computed for each switched subsystem, using which
one can compositionally synthesize state-feedback controllers for
interconnected systems enforcing safety specifications over a finite-time
horizon. In particular, we first leverage sufficient max-type small-gain
conditions to compositionally construct augmented control barrier certificates
for interconnected systems based on the corresponding augmented pseudo-barrier
certificates of subsystems. Then we quantify upper bounds on exit probabilities
- the probability that an interconnected system reaches certain unsafe regions
- in a finite-time horizon using the constructed augmented barrier
certificates. We employ a technique based on a counter-example guided inductive
synthesis (CEGIS) approach to search for control barrier certificates of each
mode while synthesizing safety controllers providing switching signals. We
demonstrate our proposed results by applying them first to a room temperature
network containing 1000 rooms. Finally, we apply our techniques to a network of
500 switched subsystems (totally 1000 dimensions) accepting multiple barrier
certificates with a dwell-time condition, and provide upper bounds on the
probability that the interconnected system reaches some unsafe region in a

actions, to be maximally helpful to its human user. In recommender systems for
instance, the action is to choose what to recommend, and the optimization task
is to recommend items the user prefers. The optimization is done based on
earlier user's feedback (e.g. ""likes"" and ""dislikes""), and the algorithms
assume the feedback to be faithful. That is, when the user clicks ""like,"" they
actually prefer the item. We argue that this fundamental assumption can be
extensively violated by human users, who are not passive feedback sources.
Instead, they are in control, actively steering the system towards their goal.
To verify this hypothesis, that humans steer and are able to improve
performance by steering, we designed a function optimization task where a human
and an optimization algorithm collaborate to find the maximum of a
1-dimensional function. At each iteration, the optimization algorithm queries
the user for the value of a hidden function $f$ at a point $x$, and the user,
who sees the hidden function, provides an answer about $f(x)$. Our study on 21
participants shows that users who understand how the optimization works,
strategically provide biased answers (answers not equal to $f(x)$), which
results in the algorithm finding the optimum significantly faster. Our work
highlights that next-generation intelligent systems will need user models
capable of helping users who steer systems to pursue their goals.

integer programming formulation that models hierarchical menus as a combination
of the exact set covering problem and the assignment problem. It organizes
commands into ordered groups of ordered groups via a novel objective function
based on information foraging theory. It minimizes, on the one hand, the time
required to select a command whose location is known from previous usage and,
on the other, the time wasted in irrelevant parts of the menu while searching
for commands whose location is not known. The convergence of these two factors
yields usable, well-ordered command hierarchies from a single model. In
generated menus, the lead (first) elements of a group or tab are good
indicators of the remaining contents, thereby facilitating the search process.
In a controlled usability evaluation, the performance of computationally
designed menus was 25 faster than existing commercial designs with respect to
selection time. The algorithm is efficient for large, representative instances

estimation of the depth of Jupiter's zonal jets, showing that the winds extend
approximately $3000$ km beneath the cloud-level. This estimate was based on an
analysis using a combination of all measured odd gravity harmonics $J_{3}$,
$J_{5}$, $J_{7}$, and $J_{9}$, but the wind profile dependence on each of them
separately has not been investigated. Furthermore, these calculations assumed
the meridional profile of the cloud-level wind extends to depth. However, it is
possible that the interior jet profile varies from that of the cloud-level as
hinted by the Juno microwave measurement that find a smoother nadir brightness
temperature profile at depth compared to the cloud-level. Here we analyze in
detail the possible meridional and vertical structure of Jupiter's deep
jet-streams. We find that each odd gravity harmonic constrains the flow at a
different depth, with $J_{3}$ being the most dominant at depths below $3000$
km, $J_{5}$ being the most restrictive overall, and $J_{9}$ not constraining
the flow at all if the other odd harmonics are within the measurement range.
Interior flow profiles constructed from perturbations to the cloud-level winds
allow a more extensive range of vertical wind profiles, yet when the profiles
differ substantially from the cloud-level, the ability to match the gravity
data reduces significantly. Overall, we find that while interior wind profiles
that do not resemble the cloud-level are possible, they are statistically
unlikely. However, slightly smoother profiles, which resemble the Juno's
microwave radiometer temperature profile at depth, are still compatible with
the gravity measurements.

into an unconstrained optimization problem with the same cost function as the
original problem and a constrained optimization problem with a modified cost
function and dynamics that have been precompensated according to the solution
of the unconstrained problem. In the case of linear systems subject to a
quadratic cost, the unconstrained problem has the familiar LQR solution and the
constrained problem reduces to a minimum-norm projection. This implies that
solving linear MPC problems is equivalent to precompensating a system using LQR
and applying MPC to penalize only the control input. We propose to call this a
constraint-separation principle and discuss the utility of both constraint
separation and general decomposition in the design of MPC schemes and the
development of numerical solvers for MPC problems.

Previous works have shown promising gains assuming the availability of perfect
channel state information (CSI) at the base station (BS) and the IRS, which is
impractical due to the passive nature of the reflecting elements. This paper
makes one of the preliminary contributions of studying an IRS-assisted
multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system under
imperfect CSI. Different from the few recent works that develop least-squares
(LS) estimates of the IRS-assisted channel vectors, we exploit the prior
knowledge of the large-scale fading statistics at the BS to derive the Bayesian
minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimates under a protocol in which
the IRS applies a set of optimal phase shifts vectors over multiple channel
estimation sub-phases. The resulting mean squared error (MSE) is both
analytically and numerically shown to be lower than that achieved by the LS
estimates. Joint designs for the precoding and power allocation at the BS and
reflect beamforming at the IRS are proposed to maximize the minimum user
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) subject to a transmit power

to play an important role in future wireless networks. However, different from
conventional terrestrial communication systems, UAVs typically have rather
limited onboard energy on one hand, and require additional flying energy
consumption on the other hand, which renders energy-efficient UAV communication
with smart energy expenditure of paramount importance. In this paper, via
extensive flight experiments, we aim to firstly validate the recently derived
theoretical energy model for rotary-wing UAVs, and then develop a general model
for those complicated flight scenarios where rigorous theoretical model
derivation is quite challenging, if not impossible. Specifically, we first
investigate how UAV power consumption varies with its flying speed for the
simplest straight-and-level flight. With about 12,000 valid power-speed data
points collected, we first apply the model-based curve fitting to obtain the
modelling parameters based on the theoretical closed-form energy model in the
existing literature. In addition, in order to exclude the potential bias caused
by the theoretical energy model, the obtained measurement data is also trained
using a model-free deep neural network. It is found that the obtained curve
from both methods can match quite well with the theoretical energy model. Next,
we further extend the study to arbitrary 2-dimensional (2-D) flight, where, to
our best knowledge, no rigorous theoretical derivation is available for the
closed-form energy model as a function of its flying speed, direction, and
acceleration. To fill the gap, we first propose a heuristic energy model for
these more complicated cases, and then provide experimental validation based on
the measurement results for circular level flight.

however, have intrinsic randomness due to their use of (pseudo)random numbers,
so they give different results when run twice with the same input parameters

indices, used in global sensitivity analysis, can be extended to stochastic

two-phase Stefan condition. Unlike many reaction-diffusion models of malignant
invasion, the moving boundary model explicitly describes the motion of the
sharp front between the cancer and surrounding tissues without needing to
introduce degenerate nonlinear diffusion. Numerical simulations suggest the
model gives rise to very interesting travelling wave solutions that move with
speed $c$, and the model supports both malignant invasion and malignant
retreat, where the travelling wave can move in either the positive or negative
$x$-directions. Unlike the well-studied Fisher-Kolmogorov and Porous-Fisher
models where travelling waves move with a minimum wave speed $c \ge c^* > 0$,
the moving boundary model leads to travelling wave solutions with $|c| <

show that they are associated with several features of the classical
Fisher-Kolmogorov phase plane that are often disregarded as being nonphysical.
We show, numerically, that the phase plane analysis compares well with long

that the image of the matrix in a sufficiently large feature space is low-rank.
However, these nonlinear methods fail in the presence of sparse noise or

data matrix that lies in a low dimensional nonlinear manifold. RNLMF is robust
to sparse noise and outliers and scales to matrices with thousands of rows and

tight correspondence with quantum query complexity. For any decision problem
$f$, the minimum complexity of a span program for $f$ is equal, up to a
constant factor, to the quantum query complexity of $f$. Moreover, this
correspondence is constructive. A span program for $f$ with complexity $C$ can
be compiled into a bounded error quantum algorithm for $f$ with query
complexity $O(C)$, and vice versa.
  In this work, we prove an analogous connection for quantum time complexity.
In particular, we show how to convert a quantum algorithm for $f$ with time
complexity $T$ into a span program for $f$ such that it compiles back into a
quantum algorithm for $f$ with time complexity $\widetilde{O}(T)$. While the
query complexity of quantum algorithms obtained from span programs is
well-understood, it is not generally clear how to implement certain
query-independent operations in a time-efficient manner. We show that for span
programs derived from algorithms with a time-efficient implementation, we can
preserve the time efficiency when implementing the span program. This means in
particular that span programs not only fully capture quantum query complexity,
but also quantum time complexity.
  One practical advantage of being able to convert quantum algorithms to span
programs in a way that preserves time complexity is that span programs compose
very nicely. We demonstrate this by improving Ambainis's variable-time quantum
search result using our construction through a span program composition for the
OR function.

optimal fit to a given set of data. In this article we restrict ourselves to
the Riemannian manifold of positive definite operators (matrices) on a Hilbert
space of finite dimension. There is a unique geodesic curve connecting two
positive definite operators, and it is given by the weighted geometric mean.
The function that measures the squared Riemannian metric distance between an
operator and a geodesic curve is not convex nor geodesically convex in the
operators generating the curve. This is a marked difference to the situation in
linear regression. The literature mainly tries to find numerical solutions that
approximate the optimal curve in a single point.
  We suggest to apply a distance measure slightly coarser than the Riemannian
metric. The ensuing control function faithfully identifies geodesic curves, and
it coincides with the standard control function based on the Riemannian metric
for commuting operators. The control function constructed in this way is
geodesically convex. We are therefore able to find a global and uniquely
defined optimal fit to any given set of data. The generators of the geodesic
curve may also be determined as the unique solution to two operator equations.

distribution of the young stellar population and relate it to the associated
molecular cloud. Aims. The second Gaia data release (DR2) enables us to
investigate the Taurus complex in three dimensions, starting from a previously
defined robust membership. The molecular cloud structured in filaments can be
traced in emission using the public far-infrared maps from Herschel. Methods.
From a compiled catalog of spectroscopically confirmed members, we analyze the
283 sources with reliable parallax and proper motions in the Gaia DR2 archive.
We fit the distribution of parallaxes and proper motions with multiple
populations described by multivariate Gaussians. We compute the cartesian
Galactic coordinates (X,Y,Z) and, for the populations associated with the main
cloud, also the galactic space velocity (U,V,W). We discuss the spatial
distribution of the populations in relation to the structure of the filamentary
molecular cloud traced by Herschel. Results. We discover the presence of six
populations which are all well defined in parallax and proper motions, with the
only exception being Taurus D. The derived distances range between 130 and 160
pc. We do not find a unique relation between stellar population and the
associated molecular cloud: while the stellar population seems to be on the
cloud surface, both lying at similar distances, this is not the case when the
molecular cloud is structured in filaments. Taurus B is probably moving in the
direction of Taurus A, while Taurus E appears to be moving towards them.
Conclusions. The Taurus region is the result of a complex star formation
history which most probably occurred in clumpy and filamentary structures that
are evolving independently.

minimized is not convex, so that the necessary stationarity conditions of the
functional may admit multiple solutions. The solution obtained in an actual
computation is typically one out of several local minimizers. Evidence of
multiple solutions induced by small perturbations of numerical or physical
parameters was occasionally recorded but not explicitly investigated in the
literature. In this work, we focus on this issue and advocate a paradigm shift,
away from the search for one particular solution towards the simultaneous
description of all possible solutions (local minimizers), along with the
probabilities of their occurrence. Inspired by recent approaches advocating
measure-valued solutions (Young measures as well as their generalization to
statistical solutions) and their numerical approximations in fluid mechanics,
we propose the stochastic relaxation of the variational brittle fracture
problem through random perturbations of the functional. We introduce the
concept of stochastic solution, with the main advantage that point-to-point
correlations of the crack phase fields in the underlying domain can be
captured. These stochastic solutions are represented by random fields or random
variables with values in the classical deterministic solution spaces. In the
numerical experiments, we use a simple Monte Carlo approach to compute
approximations to such stochastic solutions. The final result of the
computation is not a single crack pattern, but rather several possible crack
patterns and their probabilities. The stochastic solution framework using
evolving random fields allows additionally the interesting possibility of
conditioning the probabilities of further crack paths on intermediate crack
patterns.

the framework of the quantum version of the Separation of Variables (SoV) in
the case of a simple model: the XXX Heisenberg chain of spin 1/2 with twisted
(quasi-periodic) boundary conditions. We first detail all steps of our method
in the case of anti-periodic boundary conditions. The model can be solved in
the SoV framework by introducing inhomogeneity parameters. The action of local
operators on the eigenstates are then naturally expressed in terms of multiple
sums over these inhomogeneity parameters. We explain how to transform these
sums over inhomogeneity parameters into multiple contour integrals. Evaluating
these multiple integrals by the residues of the poles outside the integration
contours, we rewrite this action as a sum involving the roots of the Baxter
polynomial plus a contribution of the poles at infinity. We show that the
contribution of the poles at infinity vanishes in the thermodynamic limit, and
that we recover in this limit for the zero-temperature correlation functions
the multiple integral representation that had been previously obtained through
the study of the periodic case by Bethe Ansatz or through the study of the
infinite volume model by the q-vertex operator approach. We finally show that
the method can easily be generalized to the case of a more general non-diagonal
twist: the corresponding weights of the different terms for the correlation
functions in finite volume are then modified, but we recover in the
thermodynamic limit the same multiple integral representation than in the
periodic or anti-periodic case, hence proving the independence of the
thermodynamic limit of the correlation functions with respect to the particular
form of the boundary twist.

scale-invariant damping and mass. It is known that the global behavior of the
solution depends on the size of the coefficients in front of the damping and
mass at initial time $t=0$. Indeed, the solution satisfies the similar decay
estimate to that of the corresponding heat equation if it is large and to that
of the modified wave equation if it is small. In our previous paper, we obtain
the scattering result and its asymptotic order for the data in the energy space
$H^1\times L^2$ when the coefficients are in the wave regime. In fact, the
threshold of the coefficients relies on the spatial decay of the initial data.
Namely, it varies depending on $r$ when the initial data is in $L^r$ ($1\leq r
< 2$). In the present paper, we will show the scattering result and the
asymptotic order in the wave regime for $L^r$-data, which is wider than the
wave regime for the data in the energy space. Moreover, we give an improvement
of the asymptotic order obtained in our previous paper for the data in the
energy space.

demodulate a received signal to two outputs. More importantly, we also
establish a mathematical framework to theoretically characterize our proposed
microfluidic circuits. Based on this, we first derive the output concentration
distribution of our proposed AND gate design, and provide the insight into the
selection of design parameters to ensure an exhibition of desired behaviour. We
further derive the output concentration distributions of the QCSK transmitter
and receiver. Simulation results obtained in COMSOL Multiphysics not only show
the desired behaviour of all the proposed microfluidic circuits, but also
demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed mathematical framework.

  Requirements",,,,,"cs.SE cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  [Context] Natural language (NL) is pervasive in software requirements
specifications (SRSs). However, despite its popularity and widespread use, NL
is highly prone to quality issues such as vagueness, ambiguity, and
incompleteness. Controlled natural languages (CNLs) have been proposed as a way
to prevent quality problems in requirements documents, while maintaining the
flexibility to write and communicate requirements in an intuitive and
universally understood manner. [Objective] In collaboration with an industrial
partner from the financial domain, we systematically develop and evaluate a
CNL, named Rimay, intended at helping analysts write functional requirements.
[Method] We rely on Grounded Theory for building Rimay and follow well-known
guidelines for conducting and reporting industrial case study research.
[Results] Our main contributions are: (1) a qualitative methodology to
systematically define a CNL for functional requirements; this methodology is
general and applicable to information systems beyond the financial domain, (2)
a CNL grammar to represent functional requirements; this grammar is derived
from our experience in the financial domain, but should be applicable, possibly
with adaptations, to other information-system domains, and (3) an empirical
evaluation of our CNL (Rimay) through an industrial case study. Our
contributions draw on 15 representative SRSs, collectively containing 3215 NL
requirements statements from the financial domain. [Conclusion] Our evaluation
shows that Rimay is expressive enough to capture, on average, 88% (405 out of
460) of the NL requirements statements in four previously unseen SRSs from the
financial domain.

  spindles and delta oscillations in the sedated rat","Schizophrenia Research, Elsevier, In press",,,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: In patients with psychotic disorders, sleep spindles are reduced,
supporting the hypothesis that the thalamus and glutamate receptors play a
crucial etio-pathophysiological role, whose underlying mechanisms remain
unknown. We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved
in the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods: An
electrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to
investigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single
psychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the
sensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results:
Under the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency:
10-16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1-4Hz) oscillations were recorded in the
frontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual
juxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and
glutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN
cells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials
(7 to 15 APs at 200-700Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine
fleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing
gamma-(30-80Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing
pattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode.
Furthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC
connectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine
effects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations.
Conclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor
hypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta
oscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN
activities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating
system and the corticothalamic pathway.

(S--C) transition, which is an acceleration of the stellar evolution from the
nuclear to the thermal time scales occurring when the fractional mass of the
helium core reaches a critical value, about 0.1. It occurs in the 1.4 to 7
M$_\odot$ mass range due to impossibility of maintaining the thermal
equilibrium after the nuclear energy sources in the core disappear. We present
the distributions of the hydrogen abundance, the energy generation rate and the
temperature for stars crossing that limit. We confirm that a sharp S--C limit
is present for strictly isothermal cores, but it is much smoother for real
stars. The way the boundary of the core is defined is important for the picture
of this transition. With a strict definition of the core as the region where
the helium abundance is close to null, it occurs in an extended range of the
fractional core mass of roughly 0.03 to 0.11. The cause of that is a gradual
core contraction causing a correspondingly gradual loss of the core
isothermality with the increasing core mass. On the other hand, when using
definitions allowing for some H abundance in the core, the S--C transition is
found to be sharper, at the fractional core mass of between about 0.07 and
0.11. Still, it is more a smooth transition than a sharp limit. We have also
searched for specific signatures of that transition, and found that it is
associated with the stellar radius first decreasing and then increasing again.
We have considered whether the S--C limit can be used as a diagnostic
constraining the evolutionary status of accreting X-ray binaries, but found
such uses unfounded.

  These results enable conversion of credible sets to confidence sets. In the

probabilistic forecasting of the hourly intraday electricity prices is
performed by simulating trajectories in every trading window to receive a
realistic ensemble to allow for more efficient intraday trading and redispatch.
A generalized additive model is fitted to the price differences with the
assumption that they follow a zero-inflated distribution, precisely a mixture
of the Dirac and the Student's t-distributions. Moreover, the mixing term is
estimated using a high-dimensional logistic regression with lasso penalty. We
model the expected value and volatility of the series using i.a. autoregressive
and no-trade effects or load, wind and solar generation forecasts and
accounting for the non-linearities in e.g. time to maturity. Both the in-sample
characteristics and forecasting performance are analysed using a rolling window
forecasting study. Multiple versions of the model are compared to several
benchmark models and evaluated using probabilistic forecasting measures and
significance tests. The study aims to forecast the price distribution in the
German Intraday Continuous Market in the last 3 hours of trading, but the
approach allows for application to other continuous markets, especially in

varying degree of quasi two-dimensionality of their low-energy excitations.
Here, we start by classifying important families of correlated materials
according to a simple measure for the tetragonal anisotropy of their ab initio
electronic (band) structure. Second, we investigate the impact of a
progressively large anisotropy in driving the non-locality of many-body
effects. To this end, we tune the Hubbard model from isotropic cubic in three
dimensions to the two-dimensional limit and analyze it using the dynamical
vertex approximation. For sufficiently isotropic hoppings, we find the
self-energy to be well separable into a static non-local and a dynamical local
contribution. While the latter could potentially be obtained from dynamical
mean-field approaches, we find the former to be non-negligible in all cases.
Further, by increasing the model-anisotropy, we quantify the degree of quasi
two-dimensionality which causes this ""space-time separation"" to break down. Our
systematic analysis improves the general understanding of electronic
correlations in anisotropic materials, heterostructures and ultra-thin films,
and provides useful guidance for future realistic studies.

an integer such that $\text{PL}(u)\leq k$ for every factor $u$ of $w$ then $w$
is ultimately periodic.
  Suppose that $w$ is an infinite word and $k$ is an integer such
$\text{PL}(u)\leq k$ for every factor $u$ of $w$. Let $\Omega(w,k)$ be the set
of all factors $u$ of $w$ that have more than $\sqrt[k]{k^{-1}\vert u\vert}$
palindromic prefixes. We show that $\Omega(w,k)$ is an infinite set and we show
that for each positive integer $j$ there are palindromes $a,b$ and a word $u\in
\Omega(w,k)$ such that $(ab)^j$ is a factor of $u$ and $b$ is nonempty. Note
that $(ab)^j$ is a periodic word and $(ab)^ia$ is a palindrome for each $i\leq
j$. These results justify the following question: What is the palindromic
length of a concatenation of a suffix of $b$ and a periodic word $(ab)^j$ with
""many"" periodic palindromes?
  It is known that $\lvert\text{PL}(uv)-\text{PL}(u)\rvert\leq \text{PL}(v)$,
where $u$ and $v$ are nonempty words. The main result of our article shows that
if $a,b$ are palindromes, $b$ is nonempty, $u$ is a nonempty suffix of $b$,
$\vert ab\vert$ is the minimal period of $aba$, and $j$ is a positive integer
with $j\geq3\text{PL}(u)$ then $\text{PL}(u(ab)^j)-\text{PL}(u)\geq 0$.

in strongly scattering acoustic media. We consider the Helmholtz equation,
which is the scalar wave equation in the frequency domain with constant density
and variable velocity, and transform it to an integral equation of the
Lippmann-Schwinger type. To directly solve the discretized problem with matrix
inversion is time-consuming, therefore we use iterative methods. The Born
series is a well-known scattering series which gives the solution with
relatively small cost, but it has limited use as it only converges for small
scattering potentials. There exist other scattering series with preconditioners
that have been shown to converge for any contrast, but the methods might
require many iterations for models with high contrast. Here we develop new
preconditioners based on randomized matrix approximations and hierarchical
matrices which can make the scattering series converge for any contrast with a
low number of iterations. We describe two different preconditioners; one is
best for lower frequencies and the other for higher frequencies. We use the
fast Fourier transform both in the construction of the preconditioners and in
the iterative solution, and this makes the methods efficient. The performance
of the methods are illustrated by numerical experiments on two 2D models.

the form of a so-called synchronizing word can be answered in polynomial time.
In this paper, we extend this algorithmic question to deterministic automata
beyond finite automata. We prove that the question of synchronizability becomes
undecidable even when looking at deterministic one-counter automata. This is
also true for another classical mild extension of regularity, namely that of
deterministic one-turn push-down automata. However, when we combine both
restrictions, we arrive at scenarios with a PSPACE-complete (and hence
decidable) synchronizability problem. Likewise, we arrive at a decidable
synchronizability problem for (partially) blind deterministic counter automata.
  There are several interpretations of what synchronizability should mean for
deterministic push-down automata. This is depending on the role of the stack:
should it be empty on synchronization, should it be always the same or is it
arbitrary? For the automata classes studied in this paper, the complexity or
decidability status of the synchronizability problem is mostly independent of
this technicality, but we also discuss one class of automata where this makes a
difference.

against this pandemic. Motivated by this notion, this article proposes a deep
learning based framework for automating the task of monitoring social
distancing using surveillance video. The proposed framework utilizes the YOLO
v3 object detection model to segregate humans from the background and Deepsort
approach to track the identified people with the help of bounding boxes and

popular state-of-the-art models, e.g. faster region-based CNN (convolution

precision (mAP), frames per second (FPS) and loss values defined by object
classification and localization. Later, the pairwise vectorized L2 norm is
computed based on the three-dimensional feature space obtained by using the
centroid coordinates and dimensions of the bounding box. The violation index
term is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol.
From the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort
tracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to
monitor the social distancing in real-time.

introduces Deep learning (DL)-based framework to approximately predict the

speeds up the total design cycle. Neural Network-based multi-target regression

designs extracted from the IBM processor. The DL model is trained using the
generated dataset. The proposed DL-based framework is validated using a new set
of power grid specifications (obtained by perturbing the designs used in the
training phase). The results show that the predicted power grid design is
closer to the original design with minimal prediction error (~2%). The proposed
DL-based approach also improves the design cycle time with a speedup of ~6X for
standard power grid benchmarks.

general theory of relativity (GR). The extreme difference in binding energy
between neutron stars and white dwarfs allows for precision tests of the SEP
via the technique of pulsar timing.
  To date, the best limit on the validity of SEP under strong-field conditions
was obtained with a unique pulsar in a triple stellar system, PSR J0337+1715.
We report here on an improvement of this test using an independent data set
acquired over 6 years with the Nan\c cay radio telescope (NRT). The
improvements arise from a uniformly sampled data set, a theoretical analysis,
and a treatment that fixes some short-comings in the previously published
results, leading to better precision and reliability of the test.
  In contrast to the previously published test, we use a different long-term
timing data set, developed a new timing model and an independent numerical
integration of the motion of the system, and determined the masses and orbital
parameters with a different methodology that treats the parameter $\Delta$,
describing a possible strong-field SEP violation, identically to all other
parameters.
  We obtain a violation parameter $\Delta = (+0.5 \pm 1.8) \times 10^{-6}$ at
95\% confidence level, which is compatible with and improves upon the previous
study by 30\%. This result is statistics-limited and avoids limitation by
systematics as previously encountered. We find evidence for red noise in the
pulsar spin frequency, which is responsible for up to 10\% of the reported
uncertainty. We use the improved limit on SEP violation to place constraints on
a class of well-studied scalar-tensor theories, in particular we find
$\omega_{\rm BD} > 140\,000$ for the Brans-Dicke parameter. The conservative
limits presented here fully take into account current uncertainties in the

nano-whirls leads to fundamentally interesting and technologically relevant
consequences - the skyrmion Hall effect of the texture and the topological Hall
effect of the electrons. Furthermore, it grants skyrmions in a ferromagnetic
surrounding great stability even at small sizes, making skyrmions aspirants to
become the carriers of information in the future. Still, the utilization of
skyrmions in spintronic devices has not been achieved yet, among other reasons,
due to shortcomings in their current-driven motion. In this review, we present
recent trends in the field of topological spin textures that go beyond
skyrmions. The majority of these objects can be considered a combination of
multiple subparticles, such as the bimeron, or the skyrmion analogues in
different magnetic surroundings, such as antiferromagnetic skyrmions, as well
as three-dimensional generalizations, such as hopfions. We classify the
alternative magnetic quasiparticles - some of them observed experimentally,
others theoretical predictions - and present the most relevant and auspicious
advantages of this emerging field.

the advent of the spin-orbit torque. The latter phenomenon can allow one to
overcome two main drawbacks of magnonic devices - low energy efficiency of
conversion of electrical signals into spin wave signals, and fast spatial decay
of spin waves in thin-film waveguiding structures. At first glance, the
excitation and amplification of spin waves by spin-orbit torques can seem to be
straightforward. Recent research indicates, however, that the lack of the
mode-selectivity in the interaction of spin currents with dynamic magnetic
modes and the onset of dynamic nonlinear phenomena represent significant
obstacles. Here, we discuss the possible route to overcoming these limitations,
based on the suppression of nonlinear spin-wave interactions in magnetic
systems with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We show that this approach
enables efficient excitation of coherent magnetization dynamics and propagating
spin waves in extended spatial regions, and is expected to enable practical
implementation of complete compensation of spin-wave propagation losses.

theoretical predictions based on classical theory for pressure and temperature

the emergence of periodic behaviour from a chaotic regime. Self-switching
occurs in balanced regimes of operation and is well captured by a simple
coupled dynamical system featuring only the self- and cross-phase Kerr
nonlinearities. Switching phenomena are due to temporal instabilities of
symmetry-broken states combined with attractor merging that restores the broken
symmetry on average. Self-switching of counter-propagating light is robust for
realising controllable, all-optical generation of waveforms, signal encoding
and chaotic cryptography.

gravity should be effectively two dimensional in the ultraviolet and recovers
to be four dimensional in the infrared. A relationship has been established
between the running of effective dimension and that of the entropy inside
particle horizon of the universe, i.e., as the effective dimension runs from
two to four, the corresponding entropy runs from the holographic entropy to the
normal entropy appropriate to radiation. These results can be generalized to
higher dimensional cases.

3D space. The sequence of stable circular orbits disappears at $1.6095\cdots$
times the radius of the ring, which corresponds to the innermost stable

between the ISCO and the outermost stable circular orbit in 5D space. There

GHz, at microwaves from 1 - 15 GHz by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN),
and at high frequencies (212 GHz) by the Solar Submillimetre Telescope (SST).
Also, hard X-rays from these flares were simultaneously detected by the Reuven
Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The flux and
polarisation radio spectra were fit using a model that simulates
gyrosynchrotron emission in a spatially-varying 3D magnetic field loop
structure. For the {modelling}, the magnetic loop geometry was fixed and the
field strength was the only free parameter of the magnetic field. In addition,
a uniform electron distribution was {assumed by} the model, with the number
density of energetic electrons and the electron spectral index as free
parameters. The fitted model reproduced reasonably well the observed degree of
polarisation and radio flux spectra for each event yielding the physical
parameters of the loop and flaring sources. Our results indicate that the high
degree of polarisation during a solar flare can be explained by two sources
located at the {footpoints} of highly asymmetric magnetic loops whereas low
polarisation degrees arise from footpoint sources of symmetric magnetic loops.

Anterior eye images have large variations of the eye position and brightness of
illumination. This makes the classification difficult. If we focus on the
cornea, positions of opacified areas in the corneas are different between cases
of the infective and non-infective diseases. Therefore, we solve the anterior
eye image classification task by using an object detection approach targeting
the cornea. This approach can be said as ""anatomical structure focused image

used to define a classification result of a image. In our experiments using
anterior eye images, 88.3% of images were correctly classified by the proposed

290,000 full-disc Ca II K observations from 43 datasets spanning the period
1892-2019. All images were consistently processed with an automatic procedure
that performs the photometric calibration (if needed) and the limb-darkening
compensation. The processing also accounts for artefacts plaguing many of the
images, including some very specific artefacts such as bright arcs found in
Kyoto and Yerkes data. We have produced a plage area time-series from each
analysed dataset. We found that the differences between the plage areas derived
from individual archives are mainly due to the differences in the central
wavelength and the bandpass used to acquire the data at the various sites. We
have empirically cross-calibrated and combined the results obtained from each
dataset to produce a composite series of plage areas. ""Backbone"" series are
used to bridge all the series together. We have also shown that the selection
of the backbone series has little effect on the final plage area composite. We
have quantified the uncertainty of determining the plage areas with our
processing due to shifts in the central wavelength and found it to be less than
0.01 in fraction of the solar disc for the average conditions found on
historical data. We also found the variable seeing conditions during the
observations to slightly increase the plage areas during activity maxima. We
provide the so far most complete time series of plage areas based on corrected
and calibrated historical and modern Ca II K images. Consistent plage areas are
now available on 88% of all days from 1892 onwards and on 98% from 1907

surge of interest in ultracool dwarfs as potential planet hosts. Planetary
systems around ultracool dwarfs represent our best chance of characterising
temperate rocky-planet atmospheres with JWST. However, TRAPPIST-1 remains the
only known system of its kind, and the occurrence rate of planets around
ultracool dwarfs is still poorly constrained. We seek to perform a complete
transit search on the ultracool dwarfs observed by NASA's K2 mission to
constrain the occurrence rate of planets around these stars. We filter and
characterise the sample of ultracool dwarfs observed by K2, by fitting their
spectral energy distributions and using parallaxes from Gaia. We build an
automatic pipeline to perform photometry, detrend the lightcurves, and search
for transits. Using extensive injection-recovery tests of our pipeline, we
compute the detection sensitivity of our search, and thus the completeness of
our sample. We infer the planetary occurrence rates within a hierarchical
Bayesian model (HBM) to treat uncertain planetary parameters. With the
occurrence rate parametrised by a step-wise function, we show a convenient way
to directly marginalise over the second level of our HBM (the planet
parameters). Our method is applicable generally and can greatly speed up
inference with larger catalogues of detected planets. We detect one planet in
our sample of 702 ultracool dwarfs: a previously-validated mini-Neptune. We
thus infer a mini-Neptune (2 - 4Re) occurrence rate of {\eta} = 0.20+0.16-0.11

clustering is guaranteed to produce a subspace-preserving data affinity where
two points are connected only if they are from the same subspace. On the other
hand, however, data points from the same subspace may not be well-connected,
leading to the issue of over-segmentation. We introduce dropout to address the
issue of over-segmentation, which is based on randomly dropping out data points
in self-expressive model. In particular, we show that dropout is equivalent to
adding a squared $\ell_2$ norm regularization on the representation
coefficients, therefore induces denser solutions. Then, we reformulate the
optimization problem as a consensus problem over a set of small-scale
subproblems. This leads to a scalable and flexible sparse subspace clustering
approach, termed Stochastic Sparse Subspace Clustering, which can effectively
handle large scale datasets. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and real

polarisation (Resta polarisation) of the CI. This Chern invariant defined from

Chern states in equilibrium. The non-equilibrium behavior of the invariant is
probed by ramping the paradigmatic Haldane model of graphene from its trivial

efficiently in approaching the topological state, thereby establishing the
existence of an optimal topological state preparation. Furthermore, to ensure
the near adiabatic dynamics across the quantum critical point, we propose a
novel counter-diabatic scheme. The topological nature of the prepared state is
firmly established by observing an emerging $U(1)$ topological charge. We also
compute the edge current in the time evolved state of the system under a

corrections are essential for preventing biased results. However, in most
published papers of clinical prediction models, the point estimates of the
prediction accuracy measures are corrected by adequate bootstrap-based
correction methods, but their confidence intervals are not corrected, e.g., the
DeLong's confidence interval is usually used for assessing the C-statistic.
These naive methods do not adjust for the optimism bias and do not account for
statistical variability in the estimation of parameters in the prediction
models. Therefore, their coverage probabilities of the true value of the
prediction accuracy measure can be seriously below the nominal level (e.g.,
95%). In this article, we provide two generic bootstrap methods, namely (1)
location-shifted bootstrap confidence intervals and (2) two-stage bootstrap
confidence intervals, that can be generally applied to the bootstrap-based
optimism correction methods, i.e., the Harrell's bias correction, 0.632, and
0.632+ methods. In addition, they can be widely applied to various methods for
prediction model development involving modern shrinkage methods such as the
ridge and lasso regressions. Through numerical evaluations by simulations, the
proposed confidence intervals showed favourable coverage performances. Besides,
the current standard practices based on the optimism-uncorrected methods showed
serious undercoverage properties. To avoid erroneous results, the
optimism-uncorrected confidence intervals should not be used in practice, and
the adjusted methods are recommended instead. We also developed the R package
predboot for implementing these methods (https://github.com/nomahi/predboot).
The effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated via applications to
the GUSTO-I clinical trial.

the mixing character of dipolar mixed modes changes with stellar evolution, as
well as with frequency within each stellar model. This is achieved by
monitoring the variations in the coupling strength and the period spacing of
dipolar mixed modes in red-giant models. These parameters are measured by
fitting the asymptotic expansion of mixed modes to the model frequencies of a
grid of red-giant models with masses between 1.0 and 2.0 $M_\odot$ and three
different chemical abundances. The coupling strength and the period spacing
decrease with stellar evolution. We find that the slopes of their decreasing
trends depend on the radial order of the pressure mode component. A
non-negligible increase of the coupling strength with frequency by up to around
40\% is found in the observable frequency range for a set of red-giant models.
On the contrary, no significant changes of the period spacing with frequency
are found. The changes in the mixing character of the modes are in most cases
affected by the model mass and metallicity. Buoyancy glitches also have an
impact on the mixing character. Significant fluctuations in the estimated
coupling strength and period spacing are found for models approaching the
luminosity bump, if the glitch impact of the frequencies is not considered in
the applied asymptotic expansion.

observed solar XUV spectrum taken from Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) as a
proxy for an active sun-like star. We find large changes in mixing ratios of
most chemical species in planets orbiting A-type stars that radiate strong XUV
flux inducing a very effective photodissociation. For some species, these
changes can propagate very deep into the planetary atmosphere to pressures of
around 1 bar. To observe disequilibrium chemistry we favor hot Jupiters with
temperatures Teq=1000 K and ultra-hot Jupiters with Teq=3000$ K that also have
temperature inversion in their atmospheres. On the other hand, disequilibrium
calculations predict little changes in spectra of planets with intermediate
temperatures. We also show that stellar activity similar to the one of the
modern Sun drives important changes in mixing ratio profiles of atmospheric
species. However, these changes take place at very high atmospheric altitudes

optical light curves to constrain for the first time the thermal inertia of
twelve large main-belt asteroids. We also modelled previously
well-characterised targets such as (1) Ceres or (4) Vesta as they constitute
important benchmarks. Using the scale as a free parameter, most targets
required a re-scaling $\sim$5\% consistent with what would be expected given
the absolute calibration error bars. This constitutes a good cross-validation
of the scaled shape models, although some targets required larger re-scaling to
reproduce the IR data. We obtained low thermal inertias typical of large main
belt asteroids studied before, which continues to give support to the notion
that these surfaces are covered by fine-grained insulating regolith. Although
the wavelengths at which PACS observed are longwards of the emission peak for
main-belt asteroids, they proved to be extremely valuable to constrain size and
thermal inertia and not too sensitive to surface roughness. Finally, we also
propose a graphical approach to help examine how different values of the

for a non-lacunary sequence $(a_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} $ of increasing integers.
This is partially due to the fact that second moment of the triple correlation
function is difficult to control, and thus standard techniques involving
variance bounds are not applicable. We circumvent this impasse by using an
argument inspired by works of Rudnick--Sarnak--Zaharescu and Heath-Brown, which
connects the triple correlation function to some modular counting problems.
  In an appendix we comment on the relationship between discrepancy and
correlation functions, answering a question of Steinerberger.

be used as therapeutics in vascular degenerative diseases. On the one hand,
there are so called endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which are typically
derived from adult blood. They carry the marker CD34, but the true nature and
definition of EPCs is still controversial. On the other hand, there are
embryonic precursors of endothelial cells (PECs), which also express CD34, and
can be differentiated from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent
stem cells (iPSCs) in vitro. In this study, it was aimed to compare these two
different CD34 positive cell populations by full genome transcriptional
profiling (RNAseq). To this end, we firstly optimised a PEC differentiation
protocol and found that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical
for the transition of cells from mesodermal precursors to PECs. Additionally,
principal component analysis (PCA) of RNAseq data showed that blood-derived
EPCs clustered far from iPS-derived PECs which illustrates these populations
are fundamentally different. This data will be useful to better define these
cell populations and facilitating the translation of regenerative approaches in
this field as well as providing potentially novel diagnostic tools.

bidders to construct a bid list corresponding to non-trivial demand, allowing

parameter update algorithms which can be proven stable in the presence of

stability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial

non-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex
optimization. In particular, our algorithm reaches an $\epsilon$ sub-optimal
point in at most $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ iterations when
regressors are constant - matching lower bounds due to Nesterov of
$\Omega(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$, up to a $\log(1/\epsilon)$ factor and provides
guaranteed bounds for stability when regressors are time-varying. We provide
numerical experiments for a variant of Nesterov's provably hard convex
optimization problem with time-varying regressors, as well as the problem of
recovering an image with a time-varying blur and noise using streaming data.

their stellar populations. However, these structures are often very faint
compared to their host galaxy, and spectroscopic analysis of NSCs is hampered
by contamination of light from the rest of the system. With the introduction of
wide-field IFU spectrographs, new techniques have been developed to model the
light from different components within galaxies, making it possible to cleanly
extract the spectra of the NSCs and study their properties with minimal
contamination from the light of the rest of the galaxy. This work presents the
analysis of the NSCs in a sample of 12 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster
observed with MUSE. Analysis of the stellar populations and star-formation
histories reveal that all the NSCs show evidence of multiple episodes of star
formation, indicating that they have built up their mass further since their
initial formation. The NSCs were found to have systematically lower
metallicities than their host galaxies, which is consistent with a scenario for
mass-assembly through mergers with infalling globular clusters, while the
presence of younger stellar populations and gas emission in the core of two
galaxies is indicative of in-situ star formation. We conclude that the NSCs in
these dwarf galaxies likely originated as globular clusters that migrated to
the core of the galaxy which have built up their mass mainly through mergers
with other infalling clusters, with gas-inflow leading to in-situ star
formation playing a secondary role.

dimensional impenetrable sound-soft axis-symmetric obstacle from measurements
of the scattered field at multiple frequencies. This problem has important
applications in locating and identifying obstacles with axial symmetry in
general, such as, land mines. We present a two-part framework for recovering
the shape of the obstacle. In part 1, we introduce an algorithm to find the
axis of symmetry of the obstacle by making use of the far field pattern. In
part 2, we recover the shape of the obstacle by applying the recursive
linearization algorithm (RLA) with multifrequency measurements of the scattered
field. In the RLA, a sequence of inverse scattering problems using increasing
single frequency measurements are solved. Each of those problems is ill-posed
and nonlinear. The ill-posedness is treated by using a band-limited
representation for the shape of the obstacle, while the nonlinearity is dealt
with by applying the damped Gauss-Newton method. When using the RLA, a large
number of forward scattering problems must be solved. Hence, it is paramount to
have an efficient and accurate forward problem solver. For the forward problem,
we apply separation of variables in the azimuthal coordinate and Fourier
decompose the resulting problem, leaving us with a sequence of decoupled
simpler forward scattering problems to solve. Numerical examples for the
inverse problem are presented to show the feasibility of our two-part framework
in different scenarios, particularly for objects with non-smooth boundaries.

neutrinos and/or right-handed neutrinos are first described by the low-energy
effective field theory (LNEFT) between the electroweak scale and the chiral

LNEFT up to dimension-6 by including both the lepton-number-conserving (LNC)

We translate the bounds on the LNEFT Wilson coefficients from the COHERENT

with sterile neutrinos (SMNEFT) to constrain new physics above the electroweak

probe for {\tau} neutrino flavor component and s quark component in the
quark-neutrino interactions involving two (one) active neutrinos and for the
effective operators without any active neutrino fields. The CE{\nu}NS process
places the most stringent bound on all other Wilson coefficients. By assuming
one dominant Wilson coefficient at a time in SMNEFT and negligible sterile
neutrino mass, the most stringent limits on the new physics scale are 2.7 - 10

This is consistent with results previously reported by other investigators of

dust to the interstellar medium (ISM). Dust grains formed by AGB stars are
thought to be large. However, as dust nucleation and growth within their
outflows are still not understood, the dust-grain size distribution (GSD) is
unknown. This is an important uncertainty regarding our knowledge of the
chemical and physical history of interstellar dust, as AGB dust forms $\sim$
70% of the starting point of its evolution. We expand on our chemical kinetics
model, which uniquely includes a comprehensive dust-gas chemistry. The GSD is
now allowed to deviate from the commonly assumed canonical Mathis et al. (1977)
distribution. We find that the specific GSD can significantly influence the
dust-gas chemistry within the outflow. Our results show that the level of
depletion of gas-phase species depends on the average grain surface area of the
GSD. Gas-phase abundance profiles and their possible depletions can be
retrieved from observations of molecular emission lines when using a range of
transitions. Due to degeneracies within the prescription of GSD, specific
parameters cannot be retrieved, only (a lower limit to) the average grain
surface area. Nonetheless, this can discriminate between dust composed of
predominantly large or small grains. We show that when combined with other
observables such as the spectral energy distribution and polarised light,
depletion levels from molecular gas-phase abundance profiles can constrain the
elusive GSD of the dust delivered to the ISM by AGB outflows.

approximate treatment of the equivalent hard-core radius of a roomy nuclear
cluster and pions, while the second approach is rigorously derived here using a
self-consistent treatment of classical excluded volumes of light (anti)nuclei

structural distribution of five different types of cones in the retina
underlies this exquisite ability to sample light. It was recently found that
each cone population as well as their total population display a disordered
pattern in which long wave-length density fluctuations vanish. This property,
known as hyperuniformity is also present in perfect crystals. In situations
like the avian retina in which both the global structure and that of each
component display hyperuniformity, the system is said to be multi-hyperuniform.
In this work, we aim at devising a minimal statistical-mechanical model that
can reproduce the main features of the spatial distribution of photoreceptors
in avian retina, namely the presence of disorder, multi-hyperuniformity and
local hetero-coordination. This last feature is key to avoid local clustering
of the same type of photoreceptors, an undesirable feature for the efficient
sampling of light. For this purpose we formulate a simple model that
definitively exhibits the required structural properties, namely an equimolar
three-component mixture (one component to sample each primary color, red,
green, and blue) of non-additive hard disks to which a long-range logarithmic
repulsion is added between like particles. A Voronoi analysis of our idealized
system of photoreceptors shows that the space-filling Voronoi polygons
interestingly display a rather uniform area distribution, symmetrically
centered around that of a regular lattice, a structural property also found in
human retina. Disordered multi-hyperuniformity offers an alternative to
generate photoreceptor patterns with minimal long-range concentration and
density fluctuations. This is the key to overcome the difficulties in devising
an efficient visual system in which crystal-like order is absent.

materials for light emitting applications. In addition, they can be used as

self-assemble and transform on solid substrates. Yet, the mechanism behind the
process and the atomic arrangement of their assemblies remain unclear. Here, we
present the transformation of self-assembled stacks of CsPbBr$_3$ nanoplatelets
in solution, capturing the different stages of the process by keeping the
solutions at room temperature and monitoring the nanocrystal morphology over a
period of a few months. Using ex-situ transmission electron microscopy and
surface analysis, we demonstrate that the transformation mechanism can be
understood as oriented attachment, proceeding through the following steps: i)
desorption of the ligands from the particles surfaces, causing the merging of
nanoplatelet stacks, which first form nanobelts; ii) merging of neighboring
nanobelts that form more extended nanoplates; and iii) attachment of nanobelts
and nanoplates, which create objects with an atomic structure that resemble a
mosaic made of broken nanotiles. We reveal that the starting nanoplatelets
merge seamlessly and defect-free on an atomic scale in small and thin
nanobelts. However, aged nanobelts and nanoplates, which are mainly stabilized
by amine/ammonium ions, link through a bilayer of CsBr. In this case, the
atomic columns of neighboring perovskite lattices shift by a half-unit-cell,
forming Ruddlesden-Popper planar faults.

are stored longer than their lifetime, which incurs additional storage cost.
This paper presents two new blockchain architectures i.e. p-LiTiChain and

degree of freedom in the design of blockchain of finite-lifetime blocks in

secular (roughly monotonic in time) variability in a sample of 59 young stellar
objects (YSOs) revealed that 35 are variable in at least one of the two
surveys. This variability is dominated by secular changes. Of those objects
with secular variability, 14 objects ($22\%$ of the sample) show correlated
secular variability over mid-IR and sub-mm wavelengths. Variable accretion is
the likely mechanism responsible for this type of variability. Fluxes of YSOs
that vary in both wavelengths follow a relation of $\log_{10} F_{4.6}(t)=\eta
\log_{10} F_{850}(t)$ between the mid-IR and sub-mm, with $\eta=5.53\pm0.29$.
This relationship arises from the fact that sub-mm fluxes respond to the dust
temperature in the larger envelope whereas the mid-IR emissivity is more
directly proportional to the accretion luminosity. The exact scaling relation,
however, depends on the structure of the envelope, the importance of viscous
heating in the disc, and dust opacity laws.

stacking are widely-established approaches that regularly achieve top-notch
predictive performance. Stacking (also called ""stacked generalization"") is an
ensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least
one layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of
those models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the
predictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be
a cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous
space of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and
features that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from,
and instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models)
that perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present
a knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of
visualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our
system, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics,
managing data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data
set, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the
predictive performance. In consequence, our proposed tool helps users to decide
between distinct models and to reduce the complexity of the resulting stack by
removing overpromising and underperforming models. The applicability and
effectiveness of StackGenVis are demonstrated with two use cases: a real-world

distinct regions as a function of frequency, each dominated by different types
of quasiparticles. The low-frequency intraband response is captured by a narrow
Drude peak from a high-mobility electron pocket of double Weyl quasi-particles,
and the temperature dependence of the spectral weight is consistent with its
Fermi velocity. By subtracting the low-frequency sharp Drude and phonon peaks
at low temperatures, we reveal two intermediate quasi-linear inter-band
contributions separated by a kink at 0.2 eV. Using Wannier tight-binding models
based on first-principle calculations, we link the optical conductivity above
and below 0.2 eV to interband transitions near the double Weyl fermion and a
threefold fermion, respectively. We analyze and determine the chemical
potential relative to the energy of the threefold fermion, revealing the
importance of transitions between a linearly dispersing band and a flat band.
More strikingly, below 0.1 eV our data are best explained if spin-orbit
coupling is included, suggesting that at these energies the optical response is
governed by transitions between a previously unobserved four-fold spin-3/2 node
and a Weyl node. Our comprehensive combined experimental and theoretical study
provides a way to resolve different types of multifold fermions in CoSi at
different energy. More broadly our results provide the necessary basis to
interpret the burgeoning set of optical and transport experiments in chiral

  Control Constraints and Beyond",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Parabolic optimal control problems with control constraints are generally
challenging, from either theoretical analysis or algorithmic design
perspectives. Conceptually, the well-known alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) can be directly applied to such a problem. An attractive
advantage of this direct ADMM application is that the control constraint can be
untied from the parabolic PDE constraint; these two inherently different
constraints thus can be treated individually in iterations. At each iteration
of the ADMM, the main computation is for solving an unconstrained parabolic
optimal control problem. Because of its high dimensionality after
discretization, the unconstrained parabolic optimal control problem at each
iteration can be solved only inexactly by implementing certain numerical scheme
internally and thus a two-layer nested iterative scheme is required. It then
becomes important to find an easily implementable and efficient inexactness
criterion to execute the internal iterations, and to prove the overall
convergence rigorously for the resulting two-layer nested iterative scheme. To
implement the ADMM efficiently, we propose an inexactness criterion that is
independent of the mesh size of the involved discretization, and it can be
executed automatically with no need to set empirically perceived constant
accuracy a prior. The inexactness criterion turns out to allow us to solve the
resulting unconstrained optimal control problems to medium or even low accuracy
and thus saves computation significantly, yet convergence of the overall
two-layer nested iterative scheme can be still guaranteed rigorously.
Efficiency of this ADMM implementation is promisingly validated by preliminary
numerical results. Our methodology can also be extended to a range of optimal

  In differentially private algorithms there is usually an issue of balancing
the privacy and utility. In this regime, in most cases, having both optimality

mechanism to achieve a controllable trade-off, quantified by a parameter,
between the accuracy of the online algorithm and its privacy. Depending on the
parameter, our mechanism can be optimal with weaker differential privacy or
suboptimal, yet more privacy-preserving. We conduct a detailed accuracy and

  Application to morpho-logic",,,,,"math.CT cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A general definition of mathematical morphology has been defined within the
algebraic framework of complete lattice theory. In this framework, dealing with
deterministic and increasing operators, a dilation (respectively an erosion) is
an operation which is distributive over supremum (respectively infimum). From
this simple definition of dilation and erosion, we cannot say much about the
properties of them. However, when they form an adjunction, many important
properties can be derived such as monotonicity, idempotence, and extensivity or
anti-extensivity of their composition, preservation of infimum and supremum,
etc. Mathematical morphology has been first developed in the setting of sets,
and then extended to other algebraic structures such as graphs, hypergraphs or
simplicial complexes. For all these algebraic structures, erosion and dilation
are usually based on structuring elements. The goal is then to match these
structuring elements on given objects either to dilate or erode them. One of
the advantages of defining erosion and dilation based on structuring elements
is that these operations are adjoint. Based on this observation, this paper
proposes to define, at the abstract level of category theory, erosion and
dilation based on structuring elements. We then define the notion of
morpho-category on which erosion and dilation are defined. We then show that
topos and more precisely topos of presheaves are good candidates to generate
morpho-categories. However, topos do not allow taking into account the notion
of inclusion between substructures but rather are defined by monics up to
domain isomorphism. Therefore we define the notion of morpholizable category
which allows generating morpho-categories where substructures are defined along
inclusion morphisms. {A direct application of this framework is to generalize
modal morpho-logic to other algebraic structures than simple sets.

reduces bandwidth consumption while preserving classification accuracy of
edge-cloud collaborative DL. Specifically, to reduce bandwidth consumption, for
resource-limited edge servers, we develop a lightweight autoencoder with a
classification guidance for compression with classification driven feature
preservation, which allows edges to only upload the latent code of raw data for
accurate global training on the Cloud. Additionally, we design an adjustable
quantization scheme adaptively pursuing the tradeoff between bandwidth
consumption and classification accuracy under different network conditions,
where only fine-tuning is required for rapid compression ratio adjustment.
Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared with DNN training
with raw data, CDC consumes 14.9 times less bandwidth with an accuracy loss no
more than 1.06%, and compared with DNN training with data compressed by AE
without guidance, CDC introduces at least 100% lower accuracy loss.

achieve a globally accurate model, such approaches are generally unsuited for
systems with unbounded state spaces. Furthermore, a globally accurate model is
not required to achieve good performance in many common control applications,
e.g., local stabilization tasks. In this paper, we propose an active learning
strategy for Gaussian process state space models that aims to obtain an
accurate model on a bounded subset of the state-action space. Our approach aims
to maximize the mutual information of the exploration trajectories with respect
to a discretization of the region of interest. By employing model predictive
control, the proposed technique integrates information collected during
exploration and adaptively improves its exploration strategy. To enable
computational tractability, we decouple the choice of most informative data
points from the model predictive control optimization step. This yields two
optimization problems that can be solved in parallel. We apply the proposed
method to explore the state space of various dynamical systems and compare our
approach to a commonly used entropy-based exploration strategy. In all

problem, which is reasonable since it allows us to calculate cosmological
bounds from data samplers by performing an expansion of the cosmological
observables around present time. Nevertheless, this approach is not properly an
inverse scattering solution since the method only circumvents the problem to
fit the equation of state (EoS) parameters (model-dependent) by replacing it
with their fit of its cosmographic parameters (with a polynomial
series-dependence). Therefore, can we construct a new cosmography approach
where the cosmodynamical parameters can be fitted and then employ them to
analyse the kinematics via its generic cosmographic parameters? By all means,
without experimenting the problem of truncation of the series that all
cosmography proposals in the literature argue. In this work we present a
generic EoS depending solely on the form of $f_i(z)$ and its derivative is
found, where this function can be any polynomial (mimicking a dark energy-like
term) that allow the dynamics of a specific cosmological density. We test our
generic EoS with standard cosmological models and with polynomials proposals as
Pad\'e and Chebyshev approximants. Interesting enough, a Pad\'e (2,2)
approximant has been considered inside a $f(z)$CDM-like model showing a
transition in $z=1$. Also, we found that this is not assured since models with
these characteristics have degeneracy and truncation problems that experiment a
divergence at this redshift limit. To explore our results, also we present a
new supernovae sample trained via a deep learning tool called
Recurrent-Bayesian (RNN+BNN) network that can solve problems as overfitting at
lower redshifts and increase the density of data points in this region, which
can help to discern between cosmographies at 2-$\sigma$ of precision.

the natural environment, this paper investigates the spatial and temporal
characteristics of Night Time Light (NTL) radiance and Air Quality Index (AQI)
before and during the pandemic in mainland China. Our results show that the
monthly average NTL brightness is much lower during the quarantine period than
before. This study categorizes NTL into three classes: residential area,
transportation and public facilities and commercial centers, with NTL radiance
ranges of 5-20, 20-40 and greater than 40 nW/(cm*cm*sr), respectively. We found
that the Number Of Pixels (NOP) with NTL detection increased in the residential
area and decreased in the commercial centers for most of the provinces after
the shutdown, while transportation and public facilities generally stayed the
same. More specifically, we examined these factors in Wuhan, where the first
confirmed cases were reported, and where the earliest quarantine measures were
taken. Observations and analysis of pixels associated with commercial centers
were observed to have lower NTL radiance values, indicating a dimming behavior,
while residential area pixels recorded increased levels of brightness, after
the beginning of the lockdown. The study also discovered a significant
decreasing trend in the daily average AQI for the whole country, with cleaner
air in most provinces during February and March, compared to January 2020. In
conclusion, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 has had a crucial impact on
people's daily lives and activity ranges through the increased implementation
of lockdown and quarantine policies. On the other hand, the air quality of
China has improved with the reduction of non-essential industries and motor
vehicle usage.

resources are controlled, by retrofitting tile-based fault containment through
well known mechanisms, while securing low-overhead quorum-based consensus on
all critical operations, in particular privilege management and, thus,
management of containment domains. Allowing versatile redundancy management,
Midir promotes resilience for all software levels, including at low level. We

Bayesian
Optimization (BO) invests a lot of computation time to generate the candidate
solution that best balances the predicted value and the uncertainty given all
previous data, taking increasingly more time as the number of evaluations
performed grows. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) on the other hand rely on search
heuristics that typically do not depend on all previous data and can be done in
constant time. Both the BO and EA community typically assess their performance
as a function of the number of evaluations. However, this is unfair once we
start to compare the efficiency of these classes of algorithms, as the overhead
times to generate candidate solutions are significantly different. We suggest
to measure the efficiency of generate-and-test search algorithms as the
expected gain in the objective value per unit of computation time spent. We
observe that the preference of an algorithm to be used can change after a
number of function evaluations. We therefore propose a new algorithm, a
combination of Bayesian optimization and an Evolutionary Algorithm, BEA for
short, that starts with BO, then transfers knowledge to an EA, and subsequently
runs the EA. We compare the BEA with BO and the EA. The results show that BEA
outperforms both BO and the EA in terms of time efficiency, and ultimately
leads to better performance on well-known benchmark objective functions with
many local optima. Moreover, we test the three algorithms on nine test cases of
robot learning problems and here again we find that BEA outperforms the other
algorithms.
