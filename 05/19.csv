mobile robots. This area is currently underexplored but is crucial for many
practical applications such as autonomous exploration and decision making.
Inspired by industrial demands, we first propose a novel translation-invariant
visual memory for recalling and identifying interesting scenes, then design a
three-stage architecture of long-term, short-term, and online learning. This
enables our system to learn human-like experience, environmental knowledge, and
online adaption, respectively. Our approach achieves much higher accuracy than
the state-of-the-art algorithms on challenging robotic interestingness

follow-up of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from compact binary mergers is the
prompt discovery of the electromagnetic counterpart. Ideally, the GW detection
and localization must be reported early enough to allow for telescopes to slew
to the location of the GW-event before the onset of the counterpart. However,
the time available for early warning is limited by the short duration spent by
the dominant ($\ell = m = 2$) mode within the detector's frequency band.
Nevertheless, we show that, including higher modes - which enter the detector's
sensitivity band well before the dominant mode - in GW searches, can enable us
to significantly improve the early warning ability for compact binaries with
asymmetric masses (such as neutron-star-black-hole binaries). We investigate
the reduction in the localization sky-area when the $\ell = m = 3$ and $\ell =
m = 4$ modes are included in addition to the dominant mode, considering typical
slew-times of electromagnetic telescopes ($30-60$ sec). We find that, in LIGO's
projected ""O5"" (""Voyager"") network with five GW detectors, some of the
neutron-star-black-hole mergers, located at a distance of $40$ Mpc, can be
localized to a few hundred sq. deg. $\sim 45$ sec prior to the merger,
corresponding to a reduction-factor of $3-4$ ($5-6$) in sky-area. For a
third-generation network, we get gains of up to 1.5 minutes in early warning
times for a localization area of $100$ sq. deg., even when the source is placed
at $100$ Mpc.

switchover times between the queues are large relative to the processing times

hybrid dynamical system. We then ""translate"" the solution to that fluid problem
to a binomial-exhaustive policy for the underlying stochastic system, and prove
that this policy is asymptotically optimal in a large-switchover-time scaling

harvesting and desalination. The efficiency of these applications depends
strongly on liquid-solid slip, arising from a favorable ratio between viscosity
and interfacial friction. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that
wall slip increases strongly when water is cooled below its melting point. For
water on graphene, the slip length is multiplied by up to a factor of five and
reaches $230$nm at the lowest simulated temperature, $T \sim 225$K; experiments
in nanopores can reach much lower temperatures and could reveal even more
drastic changes. The predicted fast increase in water slip can also be detected
at supercoolings reached experimentally in bulk water, as well as in droplets
flowing on anti-icing surfaces. We explain the anomalous slip behavior in the
supercooled regime by a decoupling between viscosity and bulk density
relaxation dynamics, and we rationalize the wall-type dependency of the
enhancement in terms of interfacial density relaxation dynamics. By providing
fundamental insights on the molecular mechanisms of hydrodynamic transport in
both interfacial and bulk water in the supercooled regime, this study is
relevant to the design of anti-icing surfaces and it also paves the way to
explore new behaviors in supercooled nanofluidic systems.

efficient is squeezing. Squeezed states of atoms and light improve the sensing
of the phase, magnetic field, polarization, mechanical displacement. They
promise to considerably increase signal-to-noise ratio in imaging and
spectroscopy, and are already used in real-life gravitational-wave detectors.
But despite being more robust than other states, they are still very fragile,
which narrows the scope of their application. In particular, squeezed states
are useless in measurements where the detection is inefficient or the noise is
high. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a remedy against loss and noise:
strong noiseless amplification before detection. This way, we achieve
loss-tolerant operation of an interferometer fed with squeezed and coherent
light. With only 50\% detection efficiency and with noise exceeding the level
of squeezed light more than 50 times, we overcome the shot-noise limit by 6~dB.
Sub-shot-noise phase sensitivity survives up to 87\% loss. Application of this
technique to other types of optical sensing and imaging promises a full use of
quantum resources in these fields.

signposts for the existence of planetesimals and exoplanets. Giant planet
formation is therefore expected to play a key role in the evolution of the
disk. This is indirectly confirmed by extant sub-millimeter near-infrared
images of young protoplanetary and cool dusty debris disks around main sequence
stars usually showing substantial spatial structures. A majority of recent
discoveries of imaged giant planets have been obtained around young, early-type
stars hosting a circumstellar disk. In this context, we have carried out a
direct imaging program designed to maximize our chances of giant planet
discovery and targeting twenty-two young, early-type stars. About half of them
show indication of multi-belt architectures. Using the IRDIS dual-band imager
and the IFS integral field spectrograph of SPHERE to acquire high-constrast
coronagraphic differential near-infrared images, we have conducted a systematic
search in the close environment of these young, dusty and early-type stars. We
confirmed that companions detected around HIP 34276, HIP 101800 and HIP 117452
are stationary background sources and binary companions. The companion
candidates around HIP 8832, HIP 16095 and HIP 95619 are determined as
background contamination. For stars for which we infer the presence of debris
belts, a theoretical minimum mass for planets required to clear the debris gaps
can be calculated . The dynamical mass limit is at least $0.1 M_J$ and can
exceed $1 M_J$. Direct imaging data is typically sensitive to planets down to
$\sim 3.6 M_J$ at 1 $''$, and $1.7 M_J$ in the best case. These two limits
tightly constrain the possible planetary systems present around each target.
These systems will be probably detectable with the next generation of planet
imagers.

continuous gathering of and learning from streams of data. Real-time

improved inference in these applications. Further, these applications often
involve data that are either inherently gathered at geographically distributed
entities or that are intentionally distributed across multiple machines for
memory, computational, and/or privacy reasons. Training of models in this
distributed, streaming setting requires solving stochastic optimization
problems in a collaborative manner over communication links between the
physical entities. When the streaming data rate is high compared to the
processing capabilities of compute nodes and/or the rate of the communications
links, this poses a challenging question: how can one best leverage the
incoming data for distributed training under constraints on computing
capabilities and/or communications rate? A large body of research has emerged
in recent decades to tackle this and related problems. This paper reviews
recently developed methods that focus on large-scale distributed stochastic
optimization in the compute- and bandwidth-limited regime, with an emphasis on
convergence analysis that explicitly accounts for the mismatch between
computation, communication and streaming rates. In particular, it focuses on
methods that solve: (i) distributed stochastic convex problems, and (ii)
distributed principal component analysis, which is a nonconvex problem with
geometric structure that permits global convergence. For such methods, the
paper discusses recent advances in terms of distributed algorithmic designs
when faced with high-rate streaming data. Further, it reviews guarantees

not explain why the weak interaction breaks chiral symmetry. Various unified
theories got us closer to an answer, but too often the explanation consists of
labeling the $\operatorname{SU}(2)_w$ singlet representations as right-handed,
and the doublet ones as left handed. This by itself does not ensure a chiral
preference, because chirality itself, arising in the Dirac spinors, is not a
property of the internal gauge group representations. Something deeper than
mere labeling is required. In this paper, some of the progress using exterior
and Clifford algebras is reviewed, and a possible explanation for chiral
asymmetry is presented. It is shown how such a solution is present, rather
implicitly, in a model proposed in a previous article.

good use of six species at the central branch of the Wilson Dirac spectrum and

insights we discuss the prohibition of additive mass renormalization for all
the six species, SSB of $U(1)_{\overline V}$ in strong-coupling QCD, the
absence of the sign problem, and the usefulness for many-flavor QCD simulation.
We then construct several varieties of the central-branch fermions and study
their properties. In particular, we investigate the two-flavor version, where
the Dirac spectrum has seven branches and two species live at the central
branch. Although the hypercubic symmetry is broken, the other symmetries are
the same as those of the original one. We study this setup in terms of lattice
perturbation theory, strong-coupling QCD, the absence of sign problem, and the
parameter tuning for Lorentz symmetry restoration. By comparing the properties
of the original and two-flavor version, we find that the existence of
hypercubic symmetry as well as $U(1)_{\overline V}$ is essential for the
absence of additive mass renormalization of all the central-branch species. As
the other two-flavor version, we investigate the central-branch
staggered-Wilson fermion, which is obtained from the eight-flavor
central-branch Wilson fermion via spin diagonalization. We argue that it is
free from any additive mass renormalization and is regarded as a minimally
doubled fermion with less symmetry breaking.

approximate a broad range of functions. An important problem in the theory of
deep neural networks is expressivity; that is, we want to understand the
functions that are computable by a given network. We study real infinitely
differentiable (smooth) hierarchical functions implemented by feedforward
neural networks via composing simpler functions in two cases:
  1) each constituent function of the composition has fewer inputs than the
resulting function;
  2) constituent functions are in the more specific yet prevalent form of a
non-linear univariate function (e.g. tanh) applied to a linear multivariate
function.
  We establish that in each of these regimes there exist non-trivial algebraic
partial differential equations (PDEs), which are satisfied by the computed
functions. These PDEs are purely in terms of the partial derivatives and are
dependent only on the topology of the network. For compositions of polynomial
functions, the algebraic PDEs yield non-trivial equations (of degrees dependent
only on the architecture) in the ambient polynomial space that are satisfied on
the associated functional varieties. Conversely, we conjecture that such PDE
constraints, once accompanied by appropriate non-singularity conditions and
perhaps certain inequalities involving partial derivatives, guarantee that the
smooth function under consideration can be represented by the network. The
conjecture is verified in numerous examples including the case of tree
architectures which are of neuroscientific interest. Our approach is a step
toward formulating an algebraic description of functional spaces associated
with specific neural networks, and may provide new, useful tools for
constructing neural networks.

in high-stakes application domains such as healthcare and transportation.
Explaining the behavior of these agents is challenging, as the environments in
which they act have large state spaces, and their decision-making can be
affected by delayed rewards, making it difficult to analyze their behavior. To
address this problem, several approaches have been developed. Some approaches
attempt to convey the $\textit{global}$ behavior of the agent, describing the
actions it takes in different states. Other approaches devised $\textit{local}$
explanations which provide information regarding the agent's decision-making in
a particular state. In this paper, we combine global and local explanation
methods, and evaluate their joint and separate contributions, providing (to the
best of our knowledge) the first user study of combined local and global
explanations for RL agents. Specifically, we augment strategy summaries that
extract important trajectories of states from simulations of the agent with
saliency maps which show what information the agent attends to. Our results
show that the choice of what states to include in the summary (global
information) strongly affects people's understanding of agents: participants
shown summaries that included important states significantly outperformed
participants who were presented with agent behavior in a randomly set of chosen
world-states. We find mixed results with respect to augmenting demonstrations
with saliency maps (local information), as the addition of saliency maps did
not significantly improve performance in most cases. However, we do find some
evidence that saliency maps can help users better understand what information
the agent relies on in its decision making, suggesting avenues for future work
that can further improve explanations of RL agents.

encapsulate information on the properties of exotic clouds. The slope is
usually attributed to the Rayleigh scattering caused by tiny aerosol particles,
whereas recent retrieval studies have suggested that the slopes are often
steeper than the canonical Rayleigh slopes. Here, we propose that photochemical
haze formed in vigorously mixing atmospheres can explain such super-Rayleigh
slopes. We first analytically show that the spectral slope can be steepened by
the vertical opacity gradient in which atmospheric opacity increases with
altitude. Using a microphysical model, we demonstrate that such opacity
gradient can be naturally generated by photochemical haze, especially when the
eddy mixing is substantially efficient. The transmission spectra of hazy
atmospheres can be demarcated into four typical regimes in terms of the haze
mass flux and eddy diffusion coefficient. We find that the transmission
spectrum can have the spectral slope 2--4 times steeper than the Rayleigh slope
if the eddy diffusion coefficient is sufficiently high and the haze mass flux
falls into a moderate value. Based on the eddy diffusion coefficient suggested
by a recent study of atmospheric circulations, we suggest that photochemical
haze preferentially generates super-Rayleigh slopes at planets with equilibrium
temperature of 1000--1500 K, which might be consistent with results of recent
retrieval studies. Our results would help to interpret the observations of
spectral slopes from the perspective of haze formation.

occulted a m$_v= $15.3 star with ID 130957813463146112 in the Gaia DR2 stellar
catalog. 12 positive occultation chords were obtained from Italy, France,
Slovenia and Switzerland. Also, 4 negative detections were obtained near the
north and south limbs. This represents the best observed stellar occultation by
a TNO other than Pluto, in terms of the number of chords published thus far.
From the 12 chords, an accurate elliptical fit to the instantaneous projection
of the body, compatible with the near misses, can be obtained. The resulting
ellipse has major and minor axes of 543 $\pm$ 18 km and 460 $\pm$ 11 km,
respectively, with a position angle of 3 $\pm$ 1 degrees for the minor axis.
This information, combined with rotational light curves obtained with the 1.5m
telescope at Sierra Nevada Observatory and the 1.23m telescope at Calar Alto
observatory, allows us to derive possible 3D shapes and density estimations for
the body, based on hydrostatic equilibrium assumptions. The effective area
equivalent diameter is $\sim$ 84 km smaller than the radiometrically derived
diameter using thermal data from Herschel and Spitzer Space Telescopes. This
might indicate the existence of an unresolved satellite of up to $\sim$ 300 km
in diameter, to account for all the thermal flux, although the occultation and
thermal diameters are compatible within their error bars given the considerable
uncertainty of the thermal results. The existence of a potential satellite also
appears to be consistent with other ground-based data presented here. From the
effective occultation diameter combined with H$_V$ measurements we derive a
geometric albedo of 0.147 $\pm$ 0.005, which would be somewhat smaller if
2002TC302 has a satellite. The best occultation light curves do not show any
signs of ring features or any signatures of a global atmosphere.

restrictions, and the personal protective measures adopted, such as wearing a
mask and washing hands frequently. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the model is
experimentally validated with data of all the Italian regions, some European
countries, and the US. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the accuracy of the model results
is measured through the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and Lewis
criteria; fitting parameters are in good agreement with previous literature.
RESULTS: the epidemic curves for different countries and the amount of
undetected and asymptomatic cases are estimated, which are likely to represent
the main source of infections in the near future. The model is applied to the
Hubei case study, which is the first place to relax mobility restrictions.
Results show different possible scenarios. Mobility and the adoption of
personal protective measures greatly influence the dynamics of the infection,
determining either a huge and rapid secondary epidemic peak or a more delayed
and manageable one. CONCLUSIONS: mathematical models can provide useful
insights for healthcare decision makers to determine the best strategy in case
of future outbreaks.

giving a common generalization of results of West on permutations and
Anders--Archer on forests. We further define a new object, the forest-Young

forests. In particular, this allows us to generalize the above result to a
bijection between forests avoiding $\{(\sigma_1)k(k-1), (\sigma_2)k(k-1),
\dots, (\sigma_\ell)k(k-1)\}$ and forests avoiding $\{(\sigma_1)(k-1)k,

Using ideas from the Fermi Gas formalism and the Clustering method, we evaluate

while following specific artistic constraints, has been a fundamental goal for
the game and animation industry for decades. Popular techniques include
key-framing, physics-based simulation, and database methods via motion graphs.
Recently, motion generators based on deep learning have been introduced.
Although these learning models can automatically generate highly intricate
stylized motions of arbitrary length, they still lack user control. To this
end, we introduce the problem of long-term inbetweening, which involves
automatically synthesizing complex motions over a long time interval given very
sparse keyframes by users. We identify a number of challenges related to this
problem, including maintaining biomechanical and keyframe constraints,
preserving natural motions, and designing the entire motion sequence
holistically while considering all constraints. We introduce a biomechanically
constrained generative adversarial network that performs long-term inbetweening
of human motions, conditioned on keyframe constraints. This network uses a
novel two-stage approach where it first predicts local motion in the form of
joint angles, and then predicts global motion, i.e. the global path that the
character follows. Since there are typically a number of possible motions that
could satisfy the given user constraints, we also enable our network to
generate a variety of outputs with a scheme that we call Motion DNA. This
approach allows the user to manipulate and influence the output content by
feeding seed motions (DNA) to the network. Trained with 79 classes of captured
motion data, our network performs robustly on a variety of highly complex
motion styles.

field is so high that only the zeroth and first Landau levels contribute to the
magnetotransport, and ($ii$) the semiclassical situation, for which a large
number of Landau levels comes into play. A formal diagrammatic approach allowed
us to obtain expressions for the components of the electrical conductivity
tensor in both limits. In contrast to the oversimplified case of the
$\delta$-correlated disorder, the long-range impurity potential (including that
of Coulomb impurities) introduces an additional length scale, which changes the

deviate from the linear behavior as a function of magnetic field for a certain

non-identical mechanically coupled optomechanical nanocavities.
Electromechanical near-resonant excitation of one of the resonators evidences
hysteretic behaviors of the coupled mechanical modes which can, under amplitude
modulation, reach the chaotic regime. The observations, allowing to measure
directly the full phase space of the system, are accurately modeled by coupled
periodically forced Duffing resonators thanks to a complete calibration of the
experimental parameters. This shows that, besides chaos transfer from the
mechanical to the optical frequency domain, spatial chaos transfer between the
two nonidentical subsystems occurs. Upon simultaneous excitations of the
coupled membranes modes, we also demonstrate bichromatic chaos synchronization
between quadratures at the two distinct carrier frequencies of the normal
modes. Their respective quadrature amplitudes are consistently synchronized
thanks to the modal orthogonality breaking induced by the nonlinearity.
  Meanwhile, their phases show complex dynamics with imperfect synchronization
in the chaotic regime. Our generic model agrees again quantitatively with the
observed synchronization dynamics. These results set the ground for the
experimental study of yet unexplored collective dynamics of e.g synchronization

applications in signal processing, machine learning and imaging science. A
popular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact
low-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative
methods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite
nonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in
fact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number
of problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches
can still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices:
the convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition
number of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating
minimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is
to set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent
(ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient
descent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a
minimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix
sensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we
theoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges
linearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix
similar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration
cost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss
functions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank
matrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that
provably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation
tasks.

clumps, and are associated with several Class I young stellar objects (mean age
~0.44 Myr). At least three groups of ATLASGAL clumps associated with the
expanding HII regions (including the bubble N14) and embedded infrared dark
clouds, devoid of the ionized gas, are found in the system. The observed
spectral indices derived using the GMRT and THOR radio continuum data suggest
the presence of non-thermal emission with the HII regions. High resolution GMRT
radio continuum map at 1280 MHz traces several ionized clumps powered by
massive B-type stars toward N14, which are considerably young (age ~10^3 - 10^4

of clumps. The position-velocity maps of 12CO, 13CO, and C18O exhibit an
oscillatory-like velocity pattern toward the selected longitude range.
Considering the presence of different groups/sub-regions in the system, the
oscillatory pattern in velocity is indicative of the fragmentation process. All
these observed findings favour the applicability of the global collapse

vanadium dioxide (VO2) metasurfaces fabricated via scalable and etch-free
processes. Temperature-dependent infrared spectroscopy clearly shows that the
spectral emittance of fabricated tunable metasurfaces at wavelengths from 2 to
6 um is significantly enhanced when heated beyond its phase transition
temperature, where the magnetic polariton is excited with metallic VO2. The
tunable emittance spectra are also demonstrated to be insensitive to incidence
and polarization angles such that the VO2 metasurface can be treated as a
diffuse infrared emitter. Numerical optical simulation and analytical
inductance-capacitance model elucidate the suppression or excitation of
magnetic polariton with insulating or metallic VO2 upon phase transition. The
effect of enhanced thermal emission with the tunable VO2 metasurface is
experimentally demonstrated with a thermal vacuum test. For the same heating
power of 0.2 W, the steady-state temperature of the tunable VO2 metasurface
emitter after phase transition is found to be 20degC lower than that of a
reference V2O5 emitter whose static spectral emittance is almost the same as
that of the VO2 metasurface before phase transition. The radiative thermal
conductance for the tunable metasurface emitter is found to be 3.96 W/m2K with
metallic VO2 at higher temperatures and 0.68 W/m2K with insulating VO2 at lower
temperatures, clearly demonstrating almost six-fold enhancement in radiative
heat dissipation.

scalar singlet $S$ that has a large coupling to a slightly heavier sterile
neutrino that mixes with the active neutrinos. The scalar couples to standard
model fermions via Yukawa couplings, and to photons via a higher-dimensional
coupling. The KOTO signal is a result of the flavor-changing penguin process
$K_L \to \pi^0 S$ followed by the decay of $S$ to neutrinos. The sterile
neutrino produced in neutrino-nucleus scattering at MiniBooNE decays to an
active neutrino and $S$, which decays electromagnetically and creates an event

suitable for proactively preventing the spread of a disease; an approach that
relevant to certain use cases, such as international tourism, where individuals
travel across borders. In this work, we first identify the limitations
characterising DCT related to privacy issues, unwillingness of the public to
use DCT mobile apps due to privacy concerns, lack of interoperability among
different DCT applications and protocols, and the assumption that there is
limited, local mobility in the population. We then discuss the concept of a

we present the DHP Framework that uses a private blockchain and Proof of

show that our network learns to remove those unwanted shadows. To train our
second network we use a dataset of Light Stage scans of human subjects to
construct input/output pairs of input images harshly lit by a small light

complex Ginibre ensemble when $\Im z\neq 0$. This yields sharp control on the
area of the pseudospectrum $\Lambda_\epsilon(A+\gamma G_n)$ in terms of the

spacial size, depth) and construct a unique mapping from the pruning vector to

personal tastes and preferences, analysis of commercial product search logs has
shown that personalization does not always improve product search quality. Most
existing product search techniques, however, conduct undifferentiated
personalization across search sessions. They either use a fixed coefficient to
control the influence of personalization or let personalization take effect all
the time with an attention mechanism. The only notable exception is the
recently proposed zero-attention model (ZAM) that can adaptively adjust the
effect of personalization by allowing the query to attend to a zero vector.
Nonetheless, in ZAM, personalization can act at most as equally important as
the query and the representations of items are static across the collection
regardless of the items co-occurring in the user's historical purchases. Aware
of these limitations, we propose a transformer-based embedding model (TEM) for
personalized product search, which could dynamically control the influence of
personalization by encoding the sequence of query and user's purchase history
with a transformer architecture. Personalization could have a dominant impact
when necessary and interactions between items can be taken into consideration
when computing attention weights. Experimental results show that TEM
outperforms state-of-the-art personalization product retrieval models

consider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds

and sub-GeV cascade gamma-rays. We demonstrate that these models should be
accompanied by soft gamma-rays or hard X-rays as well as optical/UV emission,
which can be used for future observational tests. Although this work aims to
present models of non-jetted high-energy emission, we discuss the implications

impact of feedback on the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium

most rapidly-accreting black holes, and show that they are well-matched in
bolometric luminosity and correlation strength to real quasars. We extract
Lyman-alpha (Ly-a) absorption in spectra passing at different transverse
distances (10 kpc $\lesssim b \lesssim$ 10 Mpc) around those quasars, and
compare to observations of the mean Ly-a absorption profile. The observations
are well reproduced, except within 100 kpc from the foreground quasar, where
Simba overproduces absorption; this could potentially be mitigated by including
ionisation from the quasar itself. By comparing runs with different feedback
modules activated, we find that (mechanical) AGN feedback has little impact on
the surrounding CGM even around these most highly luminous black holes, while
stellar feedback has a significant impact. By further investigating
thermodynamic and kinematic properties of CGM gas, we find that stellar
feedback, and not AGN feedback, is the primary physical driver in determining
the average properties of the CGM around $z\sim 2-3$ quasars. We also compare
our results with previous works, and find that Simba predicts much more
absorption within 100 kpc than the Nyx and Illustris simulations, showing that
the Ly-a absorption profile can be a powerful constraint on simulations.
Instruments such as VLT-MUSE and upcoming surveys (e.g., WEAVE and DESI)
promise to further improve such constraints.

agreement between bulk and boundary quantities requires the equivalence of
partition functions on manifolds of arbitrary genus. For the single-trace

find that the mutual information and reflected entropy diverge for disjoint

dipole, moments. When such multipolar moments are placed in a metallic host,
unusual interactions between these local moments and conduction electrons
arise, in contrast to the familiar magnetic dipole interactions in the classic
Kondo problem. In this work, we consider the interaction between a single

this model can be written most naturally in the spin-orbital entangled basis of
conduction electrons. Using this basis, the perturbative renormalization group
(RG) fixed points are readily identified. There are two kinds of fixed points,
one for the two-channel Kondo and the other for a novel fixed point. We
investigate the nature of the novel fixed point non-perturbatively using
non-abelian bosonization, current algebra and conformal field theory

unidentified, non-Fermi liquid state with entangled spin and orbital degrees of

heat coefficient $C/T \sim T^{-1 + 2\Delta}$ with $\Delta=1/5$. Our results
open up the possibility of myriads of non-Fermi liquid states, depending on the

updated prediction $\Omega_{\rm IB}^{(8)}=(15.9\pm 8.2)\times 10^{-2}$ of the
Chiral Perturbation Theory for the strong isospin-breaking due to
$\pi_3-\eta_8$ mixing confirms such a tendency but is quite sensitive to the

flavour-singlet $\eta_0$ exchange contribution in this truncated octet scheme.
We rather exploit the phenomenological $\eta_8-\eta_0$ mixing as a probe for
the non-negligible flavour-singlet component of the physical $\eta$ pole to
find $\Omega_{\rm IB}^{(9)}=(35\pm7)\times 10^{-2}$ in a complete nonet scheme.
A large central value in the nonet scheme is thus substituted for a large

crucial for any astronomer attempting to map the Milky Way with Gaia DR2. We
infer the completeness of Gaia DR2 by exploiting the fact that it only contains
sources with at least five astrometric detections. The odds that a source
achieves those five detections depends on both the number of observations and
the probability that an observation of that source results in a detection. We
predict the number of times that each source was observed by Gaia and assume
that the probability of detection is either a function of magnitude or a
distribution as a function of magnitude. We fit both these models to the 1.7
billion stars of Gaia DR2, and thus are able to robustly predict the
completeness of Gaia across the sky as a function of magnitude. We extend our
selection function to account for crowding in dense regions of the sky, and
show that this is vitally important, particularly in the Galactic bulge and the

SBc galaxies favour post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (p-AGB) stars as the source of
this line excitation, rather than extreme Blue Horizontal Branch stars. The
emission-line ratios strongly exclude any contribution from recent star
formation, but are fully consistent with recent population synthesis modelling
of p-AGB emission by other authors, and favour excitation dominated by ambient
gas of approximately solar abundance, rather than ejecta from the AGB stars
themselves. The line equivalent widths are also larger than those observed in
many fully passive (e.g. elliptical) galaxies, which may also be a consequence
of a greater ambient gas density in the SFD regions.

orbit coupling, COM quickly achieves large magnitudes (of order few Bohr
magnetons) even for relatively small spin-orbit coupling strengths. As we
explain, such large COM magnitudes arise from an unconventional cooperative
spin canting of edge spins when Rashba and Ising spin orbit coupling act
together. Strikingly, COM can compete with spin moments to produce an unusual
anisotropic edge magnetoresistance oriented at an oblique angle. In particular,
this competition produces a direction along which $\mathbf{B}$ is ineffective
at gapping out the edge spectrum leaving it nearly gapless. As a result, large

properties of bars in galaxies spanning a wide range of masses, environments,
and star formation rates using the MaNGA galaxy survey. Using a
robustly-defined sample of 684 barred galaxies, we find that fractional (or
scaled) bar length correlates with the host's offset from the star-formation
main sequence. Considering the morphology of the H$\alpha$ emission we separate
barred galaxies into different categories, including barred, ringed, and
central configurations, together with H$\alpha$ detected at the ends of a bar.
We find that only low-mass galaxies host star formation along their bars, and
that this is located predominantly at the leading edge of the bar itself. Our
results are supported by recent simulations of massive galaxies, which show
that the position of star formation within a bar is regulated by a combination
of shear forces, turbulence and gas flows. We conclude that the physical
properties of a bar are mostly governed by the existing stellar mass of the
host galaxy, but that they also play an important role in the galaxy's ongoing
star formation.

the source of the lensing anomaly. The smoothing effect of lensing to the CMB
temperature power spectrum is, to some extent, degenerate with oscillatory
modulations of the primordial power spectrum, in particular if the frequency is
close to that of the acoustic peaks. We consider the possibility that the
lensing anomaly reported by the latest Planck 2018 results may be hinting at an
oscillatory modulation generated by a massive scalar field during an
alternative scenario to inflation or by a sharp feature during inflation. We
use the full TTTEEE+low E CMB likelihood from Planck to derive constraints on
these two types of models. We obtain that in both cases the $A_L$ anomaly is
mildly reduced to slightly less than $2\sigma$, to be compared with the
$2.8\sigma$ deviation from $A_L=1$ in $\Lambda$CDM. Although the oscillatory
features are not able to satisfactorily ease the lensing anomaly, we find that
the oscillatory modulation generated during an alternative scenario alone, i.e.
with $A_L=1$, presents the lowest value of $\chi^2$, with $\Delta\chi^2=-13$
compared to $\Lambda$CDM. Furthermore, the Akaike Information Criterion
suggests that such an oscillation constitutes an attractive candidate since it
has a value $\Delta{\rm AIC}=-5$ with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, comparable to
the $A_L$ parameter. We also obtain that the equation of state parameter in the

but a technological civilization did not blossom until its last. Efforts to
infer the rate of abiogenesis, based on its early emergence, are frustrated by
the selection effect that if the evolution of intelligence is a slow process,
then life's early start may simply be a prerequisite to our existence, rather
than useful evidence for optimism. In this work, we interpret the chronology of
these two events in a Bayesian framework, extending upon previous work by
considering that the evolutionary timescale is itself an unknown that needs to
be jointly inferred, rather than fiducially set. We further adopt an objective
Bayesian approach, such that our results would be agreed upon even by those
using wildly different priors for the rates of abiogenesis and evolution -
common points of contention for this problem. It is then shown that the
earliest microfossil evidence for life indicates that the rate of abiogenesis
is at least 2.8 times more likely to be a typically rapid process, rather than
a slow one. This modest limiting Bayes factor rises to 8.7 if we accept the
more disputed evidence of C13 depleted zircon deposits (Bell et al. 2015). For
intelligence evolution, it is found that a rare-intelligence scenario is
slightly favored at 3:2 betting odds. Thus, if we re-ran Earth's clock, one
should statistically favor life to frequently re-emerge, but intelligence may
not be as inevitable.

However, it is still unclear whether they typically merge within a Hubble time,
and how accretion may affect their evolution. These questions will be addressed
by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), which aim to detect the GW background (GWB)
emitted by MBHBs during the last Myrs of inspiral. Here we investigate the
influence of differential accretion on MBHB merger rates, chirp masses and the
resulting GWB spectrum. We evolve a MBHB sample from the Illustris hydrodynamic
cosmological simulation using semi-analytic models and for the first time
self-consistently evolve their masses with binary accretion models. In all
models, MBHBs coalesce with median total masses up to $1.5 \times 10^8
M_{\odot}$, up to $3-4$ times larger than in models neglecting accretion. In
our model with the largest plausible impact, the median mass ratio of
coalescing MBHBs increases by a factor $3.6$, the coalescence rate by $52.3\%$,
and the GWB amplitude by a factor $4.0$, yielding a dimensionless GWB strain
$A_{yr^{-1}} = 1 \times 10^{-15}$. Our model that favours accretion onto the
primary MBH reduces the median mass ratio of coalescing MBHBs by a factor of
$2.9$, and yields a GWB amplitude $A_{yr^{-1}} = 3.1 \times 10^{-16}$. This is
nearly indistinguishable from our model neglecting accretion, despite higher
MBHB masses at coalescence. \textbf{We further predict binary separation and
mass ratio distributions of stalled MBHBs in the low-redshift universe, and
find that these depend sensitively on binary accretion models. This presents
the potential for combined EM and GW observational constraints on merger rates

possible formation channel(s). The adopted approach combines the
characterisation of the fundamental features of the optical spectra of
$68{,}043$ S0 with heliocentric $z\lesssim 0.1$ with the exploration of a
comprehensive set of their global attributes. A principal component analysis is
used to reduce the huge number of dimensions of the spectral data to a
low-dimensional space facilitating a bias-free machine-learning-based
classification of the galaxies. This procedure has revealed that objects
bearing the S0 designation consist, despite their similar morphology, of two
separate sub-populations with statistically inconsistent physical properties.
Compared to the absorption-dominated S0, those with significant nebular
emission are, on average, somewhat less massive, more luminous with less
concentrated light profiles, have a younger, bluer and metal-poorer stellar
component, and avoid high-galaxy-density regions. Noteworthy is the fact that
the majority of members of this latter class, which accounts for at least a
quarter of the local S0 population, show star formation rates and spectral
characteristics entirely similar to those seen in late spirals. Our findings
suggest that star-forming S0 might be less rare than hitherto believed and
raise the interesting possibility of identifying them with plausible

empirical or theoretical case for the algorithm proposed in that publication

algorithm is 'best'. This is partly because there is no agreed evaluation
approach to determine their effectiveness. Moreover, each algorithm is based on
a set of assumptions, such as complete data and causal sufficiency, and tend to
be evaluated with data that conforms to these assumptions, however unrealistic
these assumptions may be in the real world. As a result, it is widely accepted
that synthetic performance overestimates real performance, although to what
degree this may happen remains unknown. This paper investigates the performance
of 15 structure learning algorithms. We propose a methodology that applies the
algorithms to data that incorporates synthetic noise, in an effort to better
understand the performance of structure learning algorithms when applied to
real data. Each algorithm is tested over multiple case studies, sample sizes,
types of noise, and assessed with multiple evaluation criteria. This work
involved approximately 10,000 graphs with a total structure learning runtime of
seven months. It provides the first large-scale empirical validation of BN
structure learning algorithms under different assumptions of data noise. The
results suggest that traditional synthetic performance may overestimate

interpolates between the classical lasso and the trimmed lasso, while taking
into account all possible $k$-sparse patterns. The generalized soft-min penalty

problems ranging from aircraft design to weather forecasting and climate
prediction. Over the last sixty years numerous turbulence models have been
proposed, largely based on physical insight and engineering intuition. Recent
advances in machine learning and data science have incited new efforts to
complement these approaches. To date, all such efforts have focused on
supervised learning which, despite demonstrated promise, encounters
difficulties in generalizing beyond the distributions of the training data. In
this work we introduce multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as an
automated discovery tool of turbulence models. We demonstrate the potential of
this approach on Large Eddy Simulations of homogeneous and isotropic turbulence
using as reward the recovery of the statistical properties of Direct Numerical
Simulations. Here, the closure model is formulated as a control policy enacted
by cooperating agents, which detect critical spatio-temporal patterns in the
flow field to estimate the unresolved sub-grid scale (SGS) physics. The present
results are obtained with state-of-the-art algorithms based on experience
replay and compare favorably with established dynamic SGS modeling approaches.
Moreover, we show that the present turbulence models generalize across grid
sizes and flow conditions as expressed by the Reynolds numbers.

of athletes and be used to maximize player performance and detect and prevent
against injury. Wellness data, which are often ordinal and multivariate,
include metrics relating to the physical, mental, and emotional status of the
athlete. Training and recovery can have significant short- and long-term
effects on athlete wellness, and these effects can vary across individual. We
develop a joint multivariate latent factor model for ordinal response data to
investigate the effects of training and recovery on athlete wellness. We use a
latent factor distributed lag model to capture the cumulative effects of
training and recovery through time. Current efforts using subjective wellness
data have averaged over these metrics to create a univariate summary of
wellness, however this approach can mask important information in the data. Our
multivariate model leverages each ordinal variable and can be used to identify
the relative importance of each in monitoring athlete wellness. The model is
applied to athlete daily wellness, training, and recovery data collected across
two Major League Soccer seasons.

internal DSLs fit naturally with a host language, while inheriting the host's
performance characteristics. External DSLs can use external optimizers and
languages but sit apart from the host. We present Sham, a toolkit designed to
enable internal DSLs with high performance. Sham provides a domain-specific
language (embedded in Racket) for implementing other high-performance DSLs,
with transparent compilation to assembly code at runtime. Sham is well suited
as both a compilation target for other embedded DSLs and for transparently
replacing DSL support code with faster versions. Sham provides seamless
inter-operation with its host language without requiring any additional effort
from its users. Sham also provides a framework for defining language syntax
which implements Sham's own language interface as well. We validate Sham's
design on a series of case studies, ranging from Krishnamurthi's classic
automata DSL to a sound synthesis DSL and a probabilistic programming language.
All of these are existing DSLs where we replaced the backend using Sham,
resulting in major performance gains. We present an example-driven description
of how Sham can smoothly enhance an existing DSL into a high-performance one.
When compared to existing approaches for implementing high-performance DSLs,
Sham's design aims for both simplicity and programmer control. This makes it
easier to port our techniques to other languages and frameworks, or borrow
Sham's innovations ""\`a la carte"" without adopting the whole approach. Sham
builds a sophisticated and powerful DSL construction toolkit atop fundamental
language features including higher-order functions, data structures, and a
foreign-function interface (FFI), all readily available in other languages.
Furthermore, Sham's approach allows DSL developers to simply write functions,
either using Sham or generating Sham, without needing to work through complex

known, we propose an efficient optimization method for the Maximum Likelihood
Estimate (MLE) of that matrix. When it is unknown, we utilize the popular
Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO) to estimate
that pattern. However, we show that even for a single Gaussian, when GLASSO is
tuned to successfully estimate the sparsity pattern, it does so at the price of
a substantial bias of the values of the nonzero entries of the matrix, and we
show that this problem only worsens in a mixture setting. To overcome this, we
discard the nonzero values estimated by GLASSO, keep only its pattern estimate
and use it within the proposed MLE method. This yields an effective two-step
procedure that removes the bias. We show that our ""debiasing"" approach
outperforms GLASSO in both the single-GMRF and the GMRF-MM cases. We also show

$g$-dimensional principally polarized abelian variety, an $(\ell)^g$-isogeny of
$(A,\lambda)$ has kernel a maximal isotropic subgroup of the $\ell$-torsion of
$A$; the image has a natural principal polarization. We define three isogeny
graphs associated to such $(\ell)^g$-isogenies -- the big isogeny graph
$\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, the little isogeny graph
$\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, and the enhanced isogeny graph
$\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$. We prove that all three isogeny
graphs are connected. One ingredient of the proof is strong approximation for
the quaternionic unitary group, which has previously been applied to moduli of
abelian varieties in charateristic $p$ by Chai, Ekedahl/Oort, and Chai/Oort.
The adjacency matrices of the three isogeny graphs are given in terms of the
Brandt matrices defined by Hashimoto, Ibukiyama, Ihara, and Shimizu. We study
some basic properties of these Brandt matrices and recast the theory using the

with $g>1$ where the regular graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ has two vertices
and is Ramanujan, and all other examples we computed with $g>1$ and two or more
vertices were not Ramanujan. In particular, the $(\ell)^g$-isogeny graph is not
in general Ramanujan for $g>1$.

annihilation cross section in the Galactic center for DM particle masses in the
range of 1-500 GeV. We obtained the sensitivity gain at least by 1.2-1.5 times
(depending on DM particle mass) with respect to the expected constraints from
12 years of observations by Fermi-LAT for the case of Einasto DM density
profile. The joint analysis of the data from both telescopes may yield the gain
up to 1.8-2.3 times. Thus the sensitivity reaches the level of annihilation
cross section $\langle \sigma v
\rangle_{\gamma\gamma}(m_\chi=100~\mbox{GeV})\approx 10^{-28}$ cm$^3$/s. This
will allow us to test the hypothesized narrow lines predicted by specific DM
models, particularly the recently proposed pseudo-Goldstone boson DM model. We
also considered the decaying DM - in this case the joint analysis may yield the
sensitivity gain up to 1.1-2.0 times reaching the level of DM lifetime

intensifies and the estimated value-at-risks by normal models are lower than

to understand the planet formation process. Our aim is to characterize the
morphology of the GG Tau A disk, one of the largest and most massive
circumbinary disks, and trace evidence for binary-disk interactions. We
obtained observations in polarized scattered light of GG Tau A using the
SPHERE/IRDIS instrument in the H-band filter. We analyze the observed disk
morphology and substructures. We run 2D hydrodynamical models simulating the
evolution of the circumbinary ring over the lifetime of the disk. The disk, as
well as the cavity and the inner region are highly structured with several
shadowed regions, spiral structures, and streamer-like filaments, some of them
detected for the first time. The streamer-like filaments appear to connect the
outer ring with the northern arc. Their azimuthal spacing suggests that they
may be generated by periodic perturbations by the binary, tearing off material
from the inner edge of the outer disk once during each orbit. By comparing
observations to hydrodynamical simulations we find that the main features, in
particular the gap size, as well as the spiral and streamer filaments, can be
qualitatively explained by the gravitational interactions of a binary with
semi-major axis of $\sim$35 au on an orbit coplanar with the circumbinary ring.

$K$ induces a classic security-usability trade-off. When $K$ is too large a
hacker can (quickly) break into a significant fraction of user accounts, but
when $K$ is too low we will start to annoy honest users by locking them out
after a few mistakes. Motivated by the observation that honest user mistakes
typically look quite different than the password guesses of an online attacker,
we introduce DALock a {\em distribution aware} password lockout mechanism to
reduce user annoyance while minimizing user risk. As the name suggests, DALock
is designed to be aware of the frequency and popularity of the password used
for login attacks while standard throttling mechanisms (e.g., $K$-strikes) are
oblivious to the password distribution. In particular, DALock maintains an
extra ""hit count"" in addition to ""strike count"" for each user which is based on
(estimates of) the cumulative probability of {\em all} login attempts for that
particular account. We empirically evaluate DALock with an extensive battery of
simulations using real world password datasets. In comparison with the
traditional $K$-strikes mechanism we find that DALock offers a superior
security/usability trade-off. For example, in one of our simulations we are
able to reduce the success rate of an attacker to $0.05\%$ (compared to $1\%$
for the $10$-strikes mechanism) whilst simultaneously reducing the unwanted
lockout rate for accounts that are not under attack to just $0.08\%$ (compared
to $4\%$ for the $3$-strikes mechanism).

superposition of $SU(1, 1)\times SU(2)$ coherent states, which has a particular
structure of excitation, characterized by a condensation of right and left
moving supertring modes. We calculate the time dependent left/right
entanglement entropy and carry out the summation over the oscillator modes of
the superstring two-point function. We show that, close to the null
singularity, the entanglement entropy is well-behaved. In particular, for
asymptotically flat observers, the closed superstring vacuum close to the
singularity appears as superstring thermal vacuum, which is unitarily
inequivalent to the asymptotically flat vacuum. Actually, we show that close to
the singularity the superstring thermalizes and the entanglement entropy
becomes a thermodynamical entropy for a supersymmetric two-dimensional gas.

sectors such as healthcare and finance, to aide in deriving useful inferences.
The sensitive and confidential nature of the data, in such sectors, raise
natural concerns for the privacy of data. This motivated the area of
Privacy-preserving Machine Learning (PPML) where privacy of the data is
guaranteed. Typically, ML techniques require large computing power, which leads
clients with limited infrastructure to rely on the method of Secure Outsourced
Computation (SOC). In SOC setting, the computation is outsourced to a set of
specialized and powerful cloud servers and the service is availed on a
pay-per-use basis. In this work, we explore PPML techniques in the SOC setting
for widely used ML algorithms-- Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and
Neural Networks.
  We propose BLAZE, a blazing fast PPML framework in the three server setting
tolerating one malicious corruption over a ring (\Z{\ell}). BLAZE achieves the
stronger security guarantee of fairness (all honest servers get the output
whenever the corrupt server obtains the same). Leveraging an input-independent
preprocessing phase, BLAZE has a fast input-dependent online phase relying on
efficient PPML primitives such as: (i) A dot product protocol for which the
communication in the online phase is independent of the vector size, the first
of its kind in the three server setting; (ii) A method for truncation that
shuns evaluating expensive circuit for Ripple Carry Adders (RCA) and achieves a
constant round complexity. This improves over the truncation method of ABY3
(Mohassel et al., CCS 2018) that uses RCA and consumes a round complexity that
is of the order of the depth of RCA.
  An extensive benchmarking of BLAZE for the aforementioned ML algorithms over
a 64-bit ring in both WAN and LAN settings shows massive improvements over
ABY3.

survival trees. Initially, a large set of survival trees are grown using the
method of random survival forest. The grown trees are then ranked from smallest
to highest value of their prediction error using out-of-bag observations for
each respective survival tree. The top ranked survival trees are then assessed
for their collective performance as an ensemble. This ensemble is initiated
with the survival tree which stands first in rank, then further trees are
tested one by one by adding them to the ensemble in order of rank. A survival
tree is selected for the resultant ensemble if the performance improves after
an assessment using independent training data. This ensemble is called an
optimal trees ensemble (OSTE). The proposed method is assessed using 17
benchmark datasets and the results are compared with those of random survival
forest, conditional inference forest, bagging and a non tree based method, the
Cox proportional hazard model. In addition to improve predictive performance,
the proposed method reduces the number of survival trees in the ensemble as

process that helps to ensure properly functioning, secure programs. Due to the
high cost of manually establishing trace links, researchers have developed
automated approaches that draw relationships between pairs of textual software
artifacts using similarity measures. However, the effectiveness of such
techniques are often limited as they only utilize a single measure of artifact
similarity and cannot simultaneously model (implicit and explicit)
relationships across groups of diverse development artifacts.
  In this paper, we illustrate how these limitations can be overcome through
the use of a tailored probabilistic model. To this end, we design and implement
a HierarchiCal PrObabilistic Model for SoftwarE Traceability (Comet) that is
able to infer candidate trace links. Comet is capable of modeling relationships
between artifacts by combining the complementary observational prowess of
multiple measures of textual similarity. Additionally, our model can
holistically incorporate information from a diverse set of sources, including
developer feedback and transitive (often implicit) relationships among groups
of software artifacts, to improve inference accuracy. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical evaluation of Comet that illustrates an improvement
over a set of optimally configured baselines of $\approx$14% in the best case
and $\approx$5% across all subjects in terms of average precision. The
comparative effectiveness of Comet in practice, where optimal configuration is
typically not possible, is likely to be higher. Finally, we illustrate Comets
potential for practical applicability in a survey with developers from Cisco

inference emerges where the smoothing is implicitly enforced by the noise model
of the decoder; ""implicit"", since during training the encoder only sees clean
samples. This is the concept of imaginary noise model, where the noise model
dictates the functional form of the variational lower bound
$\mathcal{L}(\sigma)$, but the noisy data are never seen during learning. The
model is named $\sigma$-VAE. We prove that all $\sigma$-VAEs are equivalent to
each other via a simple $\beta$-VAE expansion: $\mathcal{L}(\sigma_2) \equiv
\mathcal{L}(\sigma_1,\beta)$, where $\beta=\sigma_2^2/\sigma_1^2$. We prove a
similar result for the Laplace distribution in exponential families.
Empirically, we report an intriguing power law $\mathcal{D}_{\rm KL} \sim

$\sigma$-VAE for unseen noisy data. The experiments were performed on MNIST,

class of 2D incompressible stably stratified fluids. Our main result consists
of nearly optimal decay rates for perturbations of stationary states whose
velocities are monotone shear flows $(U(y),0)$ and have an exponential density
profile. In the case of the Couette flow $U(y)=y$, we recover the rates
predicted by Hartman in 1975, by adopting an explicit point-wise approach in
frequency space. As a by-product, this implies optimal decay rates as well as
Lyapunov instability in $L^2$ for the vorticity. For the previously unexplored
case of more general shear flows close to Couette, the inviscid damping results
follow by a weighted energy estimate. Each outcome concerning the stably
stratified regime applies to the Boussinesq equations as well. Remarkably, our
results hold under the celebrated Miles-Howard criterion for stratified fluids.

insulin to maintain their blood glucose concentration in a therapeutically
adequate target range. Although the artificial pancreas and continuous glucose
monitoring have been proven to be effective in achieving closed-loop control,
significant challenges still remain due to the high complexity of glucose
dynamics and limitations in the technology. In this work, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning model for single-hormone (insulin) and dual-hormone
(insulin and glucagon) delivery. In particular, the delivery strategies are
developed by double Q-learning with dilated recurrent neural networks. For
designing and testing purposes, the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova Type 1 simulator
was employed. First, we performed long-term generalized training to obtain a
population model. Then, this model was personalized with a small data-set of
subject-specific data. In silico results show that the single and dual-hormone
delivery strategies achieve good glucose control when compared to a standard
basal-bolus therapy with low-glucose insulin suspension. Specifically, in the
adult cohort (n=10), percentage time in target range [70, 180] mg/dL improved
from 77.6% to 80.9% with single-hormone control, and to $85.6\%$ with
dual-hormone control. In the adolescent cohort (n=10), percentage time in
target range improved from 55.5% to 65.9% with single-hormone control, and to
78.8% with dual-hormone control. In all scenarios, a significant decrease in
hypoglycemia was observed. These results show that the use of deep
reinforcement learning is a viable approach for closed-loop glucose control in
T1D.

in G in which e(g) = e(g'), there exists a (not necessarily unique) n in N such
that g = k(n)g'. These extensions generalise the notion of special Schreier
extensions, which are themselves examples of Schreier extensions. Just as in
the group case where a semidirect product could be associated to each extension
with abelian kernel, we show that to each cosetal extension (with abelian
group) kernel, we can uniquely associate a weakly Schreier split extension. The
characterization of weakly Schreier split extensions is combined with a
suitable notion of a factor set to provide a cohomology group granting a full
characterization of cosetal extensions, as well as supplying a Baer sum.

years of a planetary system through various processes, which remain to be
tested through observations. Aims. With the recent discovery, using ALMA, of
two gaseous spiral arms inside the 120 au cavity and connected to dusty
spirals, the famous protoplanetary disk around AB Aurigae presents a strong
incentive for investigating the mechanisms that lead to giant planet formation.
A candidate protoplanet located inside a spiral arm has already been claimed in
an earlier study based on the same ALMA data. Methods. We used SPHERE at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) to perform near-infrared (IR) high-contrast imaging
of AB Aur in polarized and unpolarized light in order to study the morphology
of the disk and search for signs of planet formation. Results. SPHERE has
delivered the deepest images ever obtained for AB Aur in scattered light. Among
the many structures that are yet to be understood, we identified not only the
inner spiral arms, but we also resolved a feature in the form of a twist in the
eastern spiral at a separation of about 30 au. The twist of the spiral is
perfectly reproduced with a planet-driven density wave model when projection
effects are accounted for. We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect
to the counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with
Keplerian motion on a 4-yr baseline. Another point sxce is detected near the
edge of the inner ring, which is likely the result of scattering as opposed to
the direct emission from a planet photosphere. We tentatively derived mass
constraints for these two features. Conclusions. The twist and its apparent
orbital motion could well be the first direct evidence of a connection between
a protoplanet candidate and its manifestation as a spiral imprinted in the gas
and dust distributions.

  http://vivgupt.blogspot.com/2019/06/document-vector-estimation-using.html",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Simple weighted averaging of word vectors often yields effective
representations for sentences which outperform sophisticated seq2seq neural
models in many tasks. While it is desirable to use the same method to represent
documents as well, unfortunately, the effectiveness is lost when representing
long documents involving multiple sentences. One of the key reasons is that a
longer document is likely to contain words from many different topics; hence,
creating a single vector while ignoring all the topical structure is unlikely
to yield an effective document representation. This problem is less acute in
single sentences and other short text fragments where the presence of a single
topic is most likely. To alleviate this problem, we present P-SIF, a
partitioned word averaging model to represent long documents. P-SIF retains the
simplicity of simple weighted word averaging while taking a document's topical
structure into account. In particular, P-SIF learns topic-specific vectors from
a document and finally concatenates them all to represent the overall document.
We provide theoretical justifications on the correctness of P-SIF. Through a
comprehensive set of experiments, we demonstrate P-SIF's effectiveness compared
to simple weighted averaging and many other baselines.

for the quasar HE 0413-4031 ($z=1.38$) based on the six-year monitoring by the
South African Large Telescope (SALT). We managed to estimate a time-delay of
$302.6^{+28.7}_{-33.1}$ days in the rest frame of the source using seven
different methods: interpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), discrete
correlation function (DCF), $z$-transformed DCF, JAVELIN, two estimators of
data regularity (Von Neumann, Bartels), and $\chi^2$ method. This time-delay is
below the value expected from the standard radius-luminosity relation. However,
based on the monochromatic luminosity of the source and the SED modelling, we
interpret this departure as the shortening of the time-delay due to the higher
accretion rate of the source, with the inferred Eddington ratio of $\sim 0.4$.
The MgII line luminosity of HE 0413-4031 responds to the continuum variability
as $L_{\rm line}\propto L_{\rm cont}^{0.43\pm 0.10}$, which is consistent with
the light-travel distance of the location of MgII emission at $R_{\rm out} \sim
10^{18}\,{\rm cm}$. Using the data of 10 other quasars, we confirm the
radius-luminosity relation for broad MgII line, which was previously determined
for broad H$\beta$ line for lower-redshift sources. In addition, we detect a
general departure of higher-accreting quasars from this relation in analogy to
H$\beta$ sample. After the accretion-rate correction of the light-travel
distance, the MgII-based radius-luminosity relation has a small scatter of only
$0.10$ dex.

($\Gamma = 1.61 \substack{+0.02 \\ -0.01} \rightarrow 1.54 \pm{0.02}$), while
other components remain unchanged, indicative of minimal geometric changes to

reflector is found to be ionized (log $\xi$ = $2.3 \substack{+0.1 \\ -0.2}$)

super-Eddington nature of 3C 109 initially ($\lambda_{Edd} >$ 2.09). However,
we do not find any evidence for strong reflection (R = $0.18 \substack{+0.04 \\

This puts the existing virial mass estimate of 2 $\times 10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$
into question. We explore additional ways of estimating the Eddington ratio,
some of which we find to be inconsistent with our initial SED estimate. We
obtain a new black hole mass estimate of 9.3 $\times 10^{8}$M$_{\odot}$, which
brings all Eddington ratio estimates into agreement and does not require 3C 109

science. On the one hand, it is a prerequisite for many technologically
relevant effects such as piezoelectricity, photovoltaic and nonlinear optical
properties and spin-transport phenomena. On the other hand, it may determine
abstract properties such as the electronic topology in quantum materials.
Therefore, the creation of materials where inversion symmetry can be turned on
or off by design may be the ultimate route towards controlling parity-related
phenomena and functionalities. Here, we engineer the symmetry of ultrathin
epitaxial oxide films by sub-unit-cell growth control. We reversibly activate
and deactivate inversion symmetry in the layered hexagonal manganites,
h-RMnO$_3$ with R = Y, Er, Tb. While an odd number of half-unit-cell layers
exhibits a breaking of inversion symmetry through its arrangement of MnO$_5$
bipyramids, an even number of such half-unit-cell layers takes on a
centrosymmetric structure. Here we control the resulting symmetry by tracking
the growth in situ via optical second-harmonic generation. We furthermore
demonstrate that our symmetry engineering works independent of the choice of R
and even in heterostructures mixing constituents with different R in a
two-dimensional growth mode. Symmetry engineering on the atomic level thus
suggests a new platform for the controlled activation and deactivation of
symmetry-governed functionalities in oxide-electronic epitaxial thin films.

challenge of probabilistic inference remains the primary roadblock for applying
PPLs in practice. Inference is fundamentally hard, so there is no one-size-fits

of probabilistic programs: those whose probability distributions are discrete.
Discrete distributions are common in many fields, including text analysis,
network verification, artificial intelligence, and graph analysis, but they
prove to be challenging for existing PPLs.
  We develop a domain-specific probabilistic programming language called Dice
that features a new approach to exact discrete probabilistic program inference.
Dice exploits program structure in order to factorize inference, enabling us to
perform exact inference on probabilistic programs with hundreds of thousands of
random variables. Our key technical contribution is a new reduction from
discrete probabilistic programs to weighted model counting (WMC). This
reduction separates the structure of the distribution from its parameters,
enabling logical reasoning tools to exploit that structure for probabilistic
inference. We (1) show how to compositionally reduce Dice inference to WMC, (2)
prove this compilation correct with respect to a denotational semantics, (3)
empirically demonstrate the performance benefits over prior approaches, and (4)
analyze the types of structure that allow Dice to scale to large probabilistic
programs.

its surface. Habitability depends on temperature, which is set by insolation
and the greenhouse effect, due mainly to CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 level is
increased by volcanic outgassing, and decreased by continental and seafloor
weathering. Here, I examine the climate evolution of Earth-like planets using a
globally averaged climate model that includes both weathering types. Climate is
sensitive to the relative contributions of continental and seafloor weathering,
even when the total weathering rate is fixed. Climate also depends strongly on
the dependence of seafloor weathering on CO2 partial pressure. Both these
factors are uncertain. Earth-like planets have two equilibrium climate states:
(i) an ice-free state where outgassing is balanced by both weathering types,
and (ii) an ice-covered state where outgassing is balanced by seafloor
weathering alone. The second of these has not been explored in detail before.
For some planets, neither state exists, and the climate cycles between
ice-covered and ice-free states. For some other planets, both equilibria exist,
and the climate depends on the initial conditions. Insolation increases over
time due to stellar evolution, so a planet usually encounters the ice-covered
equilibrium first. Such a planet will remain ice-covered, even if the ice-free
state appears subsequently, unless the climate receives a large perturbation.
The ice-covered equilibrium state covers a large fraction of phase space for
Earth-like planets. Many planets conventionally assigned to a star's habitable
zone may be rendered uninhabitable as a result.

both directions and find that the densities and temperatures in these

velocity components are observed in the absorption profiles of neutral and
singly-ionized atomic species toward HD 43582. These components exhibit a
combination of greatly enhanced thermal pressures and significantly reduced

recombination zone far downstream from shocks driven into neutral gas clumps.
The pressures derived for a group of ionized gas components at high positive
velocity toward HD 43582 are lower than those of the other shocked components,
pointing to pressure inhomogeneities across the remnant. A strong very high
velocity component near -620 km/s is seen in the absorption profiles of
highly-ionized species toward HD 43582. The velocity of this material is
consistent with the range of shock velocities implied by observations of soft
thermal X-ray emission from IC 443. Moderately high-velocity gas toward HD

diffusing molecules. Synaptic signaling, as a natural implementation of this
paradigm, encompasses functional components that, once understood, can
facilitate the development of synthetic DMC systems. To unleash this potential,
however, a thorough understanding of the synaptic communication channel based
on biophysical principles is needed. Since synaptic transmission critically
depends also on non-neural cells, such understanding requires the consideration
of the so-called tripartite synapse. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive
channel model of the tripartite synapse encompassing a three-dimensional,
finite-size spatial model of the synaptic cleft, molecule uptake at the
presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, reversible binding to individual
receptors at the postsynaptic neuron, and spillover to the extrasynaptic space.
Based on this model, we derive analytical time domain expressions for the
channel impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system and for the number of
molecules taken up at the presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, respectively.
These expressions provide insight into the impact of macroscopic physical
channel parameters on the decay rate of the CIR and the reuptake rate, and
reveal fundamental limits for synaptic signal transmission induced by chemical
reaction kinetics and the channel geometry. Adapted to realistic parameters,
our model produces plausible results when compared to experimental and
simulation studies and we provide results from particle-based computer
simulations to further validate the analytical model. The proposed
comprehensive channel model admits a wide range of synaptic configurations
making it suitable for the investigation of many practically relevant
questions, such as the impact of glial cell uptake and spillover on signal
transmission in the tripartite synapse.

of N effectively disjoint beams, have been measured by NASA's Magnetospheric
Multi-Scale Mission (MMS) observatories and in reconnection simulations.
Commonly used standard velocity moments generally assume a single
mean-flow-velocity for the entire distribution, which can lead to
counterintuitive results for a multibeam f(v). An example is the (false)
standard thermal energy moment of a pair of equal and opposite cold particle
beams, which is nonzero even though each beam has zero thermal energy. By
contrast, a multibeam moment of two or more beams has no false thermal energy.
A multibeam moment is obtained by taking a standard moment of each beam and
then summing over beams. In this paper we will generalize these notions,
explore their consequences and apply them to an f(v) which is sum of
tri-Maxwellians. Both standard and multibeam energy moments have coherent and
incoherent forms. Examples of incoherent moments are the thermal energy
density, the pressure and the thermal energy flux (enthalpy flux plus heat
flux). Corresponding coherent moments are the bulk kinetic energy density, the
RAM pressure and the bulk kinetic energy flux. The false part of an incoherent
moment is defined as the difference between the standard incoherent moment and
the corresponding multibeam moment. The sum of a pair of corresponding coherent
and incoherent moments will be called the undecomposed moment. Undecomposed
moments are independent of whether the sum is standard or multibeam and
therefore have advantages when studying moments of measured f(v).

perform fully first-principles microscopic calculations of the CNTs junctions
contact resistances using the Green's function based quantum transport
technique. And finally, those contact resistances are supplied as an input to a

strong dependence of the polymer filled CNTs junctions contact resistance on
the geometry of CNTs junctions, including an angle $\varphi$ between nanotubes
axes and the positions of polymer atoms around CNTs. Incorporating into the
percolation model this strong dependence as well as CNTs agglomeration, pushed

Solving a synchronized multi-arm rearrangement at a high-level involves
reasoning over a modal graph, where nodes correspond to stable object
placements and object transfer states by the arms. Edges of this graph
correspond to pick, placement and handoff operations. The objects can be viewed
as pebbles moving over this graph, which has capacity constraints. For
instance, each arm can carry a single object but placement locations can
accumulate many objects. Efficient integer linear programming-based solvers
have been proposed for the corresponding pebble problem. The current work
proposes a heuristic to guide the task planning process for synchronized

viscosity and a disk wind. The disk is heated by stellar irradiation and energy
generated by viscosity. The evolution is controlled by 3 parameters: (i) the
inflow velocity towards the central star at a reference distance and
temperature, (ii) the fraction of this inflow caused by the disk wind, and
(iii) the mass loss rate via the wind relative to the inward flux in the disk.
The model gives the disk midplane temperature and surface density as a function
of time and distance from the star. It is intended to provide an efficient way
to calculate conditions in a protoplanetary disk for use in simulations of
planet formation. In the model, disks dominated by viscosity spread radially
while losing mass onto the star. Radial spreading is the main factor reducing
the surface density in the inner disk. The disk mass remains substantial at
late times. Temperatures in the inner region are high at early times due to
strong viscous heating. Disks dominated by a wind undergo much less radial
spreading and weaker viscous heating. These disks have a much lower mass at
late times than purely viscous disks. When mass loss via a wind is significant,
the surface density gradient in the inner disk becomes shallower, and the slope
can become positive in extreme cases.

suggests that ASR will likely benefit from sparse and localized attention. In

method reduced WER by 10%$ on test-clean and 5% on test-other for streamable
transformers, resulting in a new state-of-the-art among streaming models.
Further analysis shows that WAS learns to suppress attention of non-critical

frames rather than future ones. It indicates the importance of lookahead in
attention-based ASR models.

prioritizes the processing of frames in a video repository so that processing

allocating the powers of the users' messages and APs' transmit powers, and
determining the serving links of each weak user (i.e., VLC or hybrid VLC/RF).
The paper solves such a non-convex problem by first finding closed form

allocation. The APs' transmit powers are then iteratively solved in an outer

Coupled with smartphones, the blue dot in the palm of our hands has forever
changed the way we interact with the world. Looking forward, cyber-physical
systems such as self-driving cars and aerial mobility are pushing the limits of
what localization technologies including GNSS can provide. This autonomous
revolution requires a solution that supports safety-critical operation,
centimeter positioning, and cyber-security for millions of users. To meet these
demands, we propose a navigation service from Low Earth Orbiting (LEO)
satellites which deliver precision in-part through faster motion, higher power
signals for added robustness to interference, constellation autonomous
integrity monitoring for integrity, and encryption / authentication for
resistance to spoofing attacks. This paradigm is enabled by the 'New Space'
movement, where highly capable satellites and components are now built on
assembly lines and launch costs have decreased by more than tenfold. Such a
ubiquitous positioning service enables a consistent and secure standard where
trustworthy information can be validated and shared, extending the electronic
horizon from sensor line of sight to an entire city. This enables the
situational awareness needed for true safe operation to support autonomy at
scale.

available data. Therefore, to evaluate a prediction interval's performance one
should employ conditional coverage probability, conditioning on all available

of the difference between the conditional coverage probability of a nominal
prediction interval and the conditional coverage probability of a prediction
interval obtained via a residual-based bootstrap. Applying this result, we show
that a prediction interval generated by the residual-based bootstrap has
approximately 50% probability to yield conditional under-coverage. We then
develop a new bootstrap algorithm that generates a prediction interval that

the possibility of conditional under-coverage. We complement the asymptotic

Augmented reality (AR) headset devices have evolved and are readily capable to
provide virtual 3D guidance to improve CT-guided targeting.
  Purpose: To describe the design of a three-dimensional (3D) AR-assisted
navigation system using HoloLens 2 and evaluate its performance through
CT-guided simulations.
  Materials and Methods: A prospective trial was performed assessing CT-guided
needle targeting on an abdominal phantom with and without AR guidance. A total
of 8 operators with varying clinical experience were enrolled and performed a
total of 86 needle passes. Procedure efficiency, radiation dose, and
complication rates were compared with and without AR guidance. Vector analysis
of the first needle pass was also performed.
  Results: Average total number of needle passes to reach the target reduced
from 7.4 passes without AR to 3.4 passes with AR (54.2% decrease, p=0.011).
Average dose-length product (DLP) decreased from 538 mGy-cm without AR to 318
mGy-cm with AR (41.0% decrease, p=0.009). Complication rate of hitting a
non-targeted lesion decreased from 11.9% without AR (7/59 needle passes) to 0%
with AR (0/27 needle passes). First needle passes were more nearly aligned with
the ideal target trajectory with AR versus without AR (4.6{\deg} vs 8.0{\deg}
offset, respectively, p=0.018). Medical students, residents, and attendings all
performed at the same level with AR guidance.
  Conclusions: 3D AR guidance can provide significant improvements in
procedural efficiency and radiation dose savings for targeting challenging,
out-of-plane lesions. AR guidance elevated the performance of all operators to
the same level irrespective of prior clinical experience.

  Robustness of Neural Networks","26 pages",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial noises. Adversarial
training is a general and effective strategy to improve DNN robustness (i.e.,
accuracy on noisy data) against adversarial noises. However, DNN models trained
by the current existing adversarial training methods may have much lower
standard accuracy (i.e., accuracy on clean data), compared to the same models
trained by the standard method on clean data, and this phenomenon is known as
the trade-off between accuracy and robustness and is considered unavoidable.
This issue prevents adversarial training from being used in many application
domains, such as medical image analysis, as practitioners do not want to
sacrifice standard accuracy too much in exchange for adversarial robustness.
Our objective is to lift (i.e., alleviate or even avoid) this trade-off between
standard accuracy and adversarial robustness for medical image classification
and segmentation. We propose a novel adversarial training method, named
Increasing-Margin Adversarial (IMA) Training, which is supported by an
equilibrium state analysis about the optimality of adversarial training
samples. Our method aims to preserve accuracy while improving robustness by
generating optimal adversarial training samples. We evaluate our method and the
other eight representative methods on six publicly available image datasets
corrupted by noises generated by AutoAttack and white-noise attack. Our method
achieves the highest adversarial robustness for image classification and
segmentation with the smallest reduction in accuracy on clean data. For one of
the applications, our method improves both accuracy and robustness. Our study
has demonstrated that our method can lift the trade-off between standard
accuracy and adversarial robustness for the image classification and
segmentation applications.

explore dynamical scaling relations between the stellar mass $M_{\star}$ and
the total velocity parameter at the effective radius, $R_e$, defined as
$S_{K}^{2}=KV_{R_e}^{2}+\sigma_{\star_e}^{2}$, which combines rotation velocity
$V_{R_e}$, and velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\star_e}$. We confirm that
spheroidal and spiral galaxies follow the same $M_{\star}-S_{0.5}$ scaling
relation with lower scatter than the $M_{\star}-V_{R_e}$ and
$M_{\star}-\sigma_{\star_e}$ ones. We also explore a more general Universal
Fundamental Plane described by the equation $log(\Upsilon_{e}) = log
(S_{0.5}^{2}) - log (I_{e}) - log (R_{e}) + C$, which in addition to
kinematics, $S_{0.5}$, and effective radius, $R_e$, it includes surface
brightness, $I_e$, and dynamical mass-to-light ratio, $\Upsilon_e$. We use
sophisticated Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sub-sample of 300 galaxies
from the CALIFA survey to calibrate the so called Universal Fundamental Plane.
That calibration allows us to propose both: (i) a parametrization to estimate
the difficult-to-measure dynamical mass-to-light ratio at the effective radius;
and (ii) a new dynamical mass proxy consistent with dynamical models within
$0.09\ dex$. We reproduce the relation between the dynamical mass and the
stellar mass in the inner regions of galaxies. We use the estimated dynamical
mass-to-light ratio from our analysis, $\Upsilon_{e}^{fit}$, to explore the
Universal Fundamental Plane with the MaNGA data set. We find that all classes
of galaxies, from spheroids to disks, follow this Universal Fundamental Plane
with a scatter significantly smaller $(0.05\ dex)$ than the one reported for
the $M_{\star}-S_{0.5}$ relation $(0.1\ dex)$, the Fundamental Plane $(\sim

  progression during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy",,,,,"q-bio.TO q-bio.CB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Partial hepatectomy (PHx) is a surgical intervention where a part of the
liver is removed. Due to its extraordinary capacity to regenerate, the liver is
able to regenerate about two-thirds of its mass within a few weeks.
Nevertheless, in some patients regeneration fails. Understanding the principles
and limitations underlying regeneration may permit to control this process and
prospectively improve the regeneration. Here, we established a simulation model
to mimic the process of regeneration in the liver lobe of a mouse. This model
represents each hepatocyte individually and builds upon a previous
computational model of regeneration of drug induced damage in a single liver
lobule. The present study simulates entire liver lobes that consist of hundreds
to thousands of lobules. It accounts for biomechanical control of cell cycle
progression (Biomechanical Growth Control), which has not been considered in
that previous work. The model reproduced the available experimental
observations only if BGC was taken into account. Interestingly, the model
predicted that BGC minimizes the number of proliferating neighbor cells of a
proliferating cell resulting in a checkerboard-like proliferation pattern.
Moreover, the model predicted different cell proliferation patterns in pigs and
mice that corresponded to data obtained from regenerating tissue of the two
species. In conclusion, the here established model suggest that biomechanical
control mechanisms may play a significant role in liver regeneration after PHx.

of the graph is exceedingly large. To overcome this issue, the alternating

the shortest path by sacrificing exactness that may not be absolutely essential

conditions differs for a nanoscopically rough or periodically corrugated
surface from its value for a perfectly flat surface. Wenzel's relation
attributes this difference simply to the geometric magnification of the surface
area (by a factor $r_{\rm w}$), but the validity of this idea is controversial.
We elucidate this problem by model calculations for a sinusoidal corrugation of
the form $z_{\rm wall}(y) = \Delta\cos(2\pi y/\lambda)$ , for a potential of
short range $\sigma_{\rm w}$ acting from the wall on the fluid particles. When
the vapor phase is an ideal gas, the change of the wall-vapor surface tension
can be computed exactly, and corrections to Wenzel's equation are typically of
order $\sigma_{\rm w}\Delta/\lambda^2$. For fixed $r_{\rm w}$ and fixed
$\sigma_{\rm w}$ the approach to Wenzel's result with increasing $\lambda$ may
be nonmonotonic and this limit often is only reached for $\lambda/\sigma_{\rm
w}>30$. For a non-additive binary mixture, density functional theory is used to
work out the density profiles of both coexisting phases both for planar and
corrugated walls, as well as the corresponding surface tensions. Again,
deviations from Wenzel's results of similar magnitude as in the above ideal gas
case are predicted. Finally, a crudely simplified description based on the
interface Hamiltonian concept is used to interpret corresponding simulation
results along similar lines. Wenzel's approach is found to generally hold when
$\lambda/\sigma_{\rm w}\gg 1$, $\Delta/\lambda<1$, and conditions avoiding

of deep learning models and help improve their robustness. Existing work on
adversarial attacks have mainly focused on static scenes; however, it remains
unclear whether such attacks are effective against embodied agents, which could
navigate and interact with a dynamic environment. In this work, we take the
first step to study adversarial attacks for embodied agents. In particular, we
generate spatiotemporal perturbations to form 3D adversarial examples, which
exploit the interaction history in both the temporal and spatial dimensions.
Regarding the temporal dimension, since agents make predictions based on
historical observations, we develop a trajectory attention module to explore
scene view contributions, which further help localize 3D objects appeared with
the highest stimuli. By conciliating with clues from the temporal dimension,
along the spatial dimension, we adversarially perturb the physical properties
(e.g., texture and 3D shape) of the contextual objects that appeared in the
most important scene views. Extensive experiments on the EQA-v1 dataset for
several embodied tasks in both the white-box and black-box settings have been
conducted, which demonstrate that our perturbations have strong attack and
generalization abilities.

outliers, cluster validity indices can give conflicting results in determining
the optimal number of clusters. This paper presents a new validity index for
fuzzy-possibilistic c-means clustering called Fuzzy-Possibilistic (FP) index,
which works well in the presence of clusters that vary in shape and density.
Moreover, FPCM like most of the clustering algorithms is susceptible to some
initial parameters. In this regard, in addition to the number of clusters, FPCM
requires a priori selection of the degree of fuzziness and the degree of
typicality. Therefore, we presented an efficient procedure for determining
their optimal values. The proposed approach has been evaluated using several
synthetic and real-world datasets. Final computational results demonstrate the
capabilities and reliability of the proposed approach compared with several
well-known fuzzy validity indices in the literature. Furthermore, to clarify
the ability of the proposed method in real applications, the proposed method is
implemented in microarray gene expression data clustering and medical image

learning models, realized by a student-teacher paradigm requiring small student
networks to mimic the soft target generated by well-trained teachers. However,
the teachers are commonly assumed to be complex and need to be trained on the
same datasets as students. This leads to a time-consuming training process. The
recent study shows vanilla KD plays a similar role as label smoothing and
develops teacher-free KD, being efficient and mitigating the issue of learning
from heavy teachers. But because teacher-free KD relies on manually-crafted
output distributions kept the same for all data instances belonging to the same
class, its flexibility and performance are relatively limited. To address the
above issues, this paper proposes en efficient knowledge distillation learning
framework LW-KD, short for lightweight knowledge distillation. It firstly
trains a lightweight teacher network on a synthesized simple dataset, with an
adjustable class number equal to that of a target dataset. The teacher then
generates soft target whereby an enhanced KD loss could guide student learning,
which is a combination of KD loss and adversarial loss for making student
output indistinguishable from the output of the teacher. Experiments on several
public datasets with different modalities demonstrate LWKD is effective and
efficient, showing the rationality of its main design principles.

i.e., synthetic sample generation. However, applying GAN to different data
types with diverse neural network architectures has been hindered by its
limitation in training, where the model easily diverges. Such a notorious
training of GANs is well known and has been addressed in numerous studies.
Consequently, in order to make the training of GAN stable, numerous
regularization methods have been proposed in recent years. This paper reviews
the regularization methods that have been recently introduced, most of which
have been published in the last three years. Specifically, we focus on general
methods that can be commonly used regardless of neural network architectures.
To explore the latest research trends in the regularization for GANs, the
methods are classified into several groups by their operation principles, and
the differences between the methods are analyzed. Furthermore, to provide
practical knowledge of using these methods, we investigate popular methods that
have been frequently employed in state-of-the-art GANs. In addition, we discuss
the limitations in existing methods and propose future research directions.

markets. We argue that widely accepted rules for aggregating seemingly related
trades mislead inference pertaining to durations between unrelated trades:
while any two trades executed in the same second are probably related, it is
extremely unlikely that all such pairs of trades are, in a typical sample. By
placing uncertainty about which trades are related within our model, we improve
inference for the distribution of durations between unrelated trades,
especially near zero. We introduce a normalized conditional distribution for
durations between unrelated trades that is both flexible and amenable to
shrinkage towards an exponential distribution, which we argue is an appropriate
first-order model. Thanks to highly efficient draws of state variables,
numerical efficiency of posterior simulation is much higher than in previous
studies. In an empirical application, we find that the conditional hazard
function for durations between unrelated trades varies much less than what most
studies find. We claim that this is because we avoid statistical artifacts that
arise from deterministic trade-aggregation rules and unsuitable parametric

seem as if the DTW and the LCS(-like) measures are essentially different, we

between the integer sequence and itself sorted. For a given pair of time series
of length $n$ such that the dissimilarity between any elements is an integer
between zero and $c$, we propose an integer sequence that represents any
substring-substring DTW distance as its band-substring LIS length. The length
of the produced integer sequence is $O(c n^2)$, which can be translated to
$O(n^2)$ for constant dissimilarity functions. To demonstrate that techniques
developed under the LCS(-like) measures are directly applicable to analysis of

Stokes $V$ observations obtained using ESPaDOnS@CFHT for 8 of these candidates.
We found that none of these targets can be considered members of the FK Comae
class based primarily on their inferred rotational velocities and on the
detection of spectroscopic binary companions. However, 2 targets show evidence
of magnetic activity and have anomalously high projected rotational velocities
($v\sin{i}$) relative to typical values associated with stars of similar
evolutionary states. EPIC 210426551 has a $v\sin{i}=209\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$, an
estimated mass of $1.07\,M_\odot$, and, based in part on its derived
metallicity of ${\rm [M/H]}=-0.4$, it is either an evolved main sequence (MS)

base of the red giant branch, and exhibits a $v\sin{i}=23\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$.
We find that these two objects have similar characteristics to FK Com (albeit
less extreme) and that their rapid rotation may be inconsistent with that

layer to be populated with hierarchies of self-similar wall-attached
($Type\,A$) eddies alone. While $Type\,A$ eddies represent the dominant
energetic large-scale motions at high Reynolds numbers, the scales that are not
represented by such eddies are observed to carry a significant proportion of
the total kinetic energy. Therefore, in the present study, we propose an
extended AEM that incorporates two additional representative eddies. These
eddies, named $Type\,C_A$ and $Type\,SS$, represent the self-similar but
wall-incoherent low-Reynolds number features, and the non-self-similar
wall-coherent superstructures, respectively. The extended AEM is shown to
better predict a greater range of energetic length scales and capture the low-
and high-Reynolds number scaling trends in the 2-D spectra of all three
velocity components. A discussion on spectral self-similarity and the
associated $k^{-1}$ scaling law is also presented.

$\delta$ Sct pulsation. We use Petersen diagrams (period ratios), \'echelle

of Poincare-Bendixson theorem. This limit cycle is nothing but the time
eliminated Lissajous plot of the concentrations of Adenosine-diphosphate (ADP)
and Fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) of a normal/healthy human. Deviation from this
limit cycle is equivalent to the deviation of normal physiological behaviour.
It is very important to know how long a human body will take to reach the
glycolytic stable limit cycle, if deviated from it. However, till now the
convergence time, depending upon different initial parameter values, was not
studied in detail. This may have great importance in understanding the recovery
time for a diseased individual deviated from normal cycle. Here the convergence
time for different initial conditions has been calculated in original Selkov

the limit cycle, gets saturated away from the cycle. This result seems to be a
physiological disorder. A possible mathematical way to incorporate this in the

investigated by the simplified kinetic model for surface-confined inhomogeneous
fluids. Gas dynamics of the ideal gas, the hard-sphere fluid and the real gas
are simulated by the Boltzmann equation, the Enskog equation and the simple
kinetic equation, respectively. Only the Knudsen minimum appears for the ideal
gas, while both the Knudsen minimum and the Knudsen maximum occur for the
hard-sphere fluid and the real gas under certain confinements, beyond which the
maximum and minimum may disappear. The Boltzmann equation and the Enskog
equation overestimates and underestimates the mass flow rate of the real gas
dynamics under confinement, respectively, where the volume exclusion and the
long-range intermolecular attractive potential among molecules are not
ignorable. With the increase of the channel width, gas dynamics of the
hard-sphere fluid and the real gas tends to the Boltzmann prediction gradually.
The density inhomogeneity, which hinders the flow under confinement, is more
obvious when the solid fraction is larger. The anomalous slip occurs for real
gas under constant confinement. The flow at a smaller Knudsen number (larger
solid fraction or channel width) contributes more practical amount of mass
transfer, although the rarefaction effects is more prominent at larger Knudsen
numbers. The temperature has no effect on density and velocity profiles of the
ideal gas and the hard-sphere fluid, but the energy parameter among the real
gas molecules decreases with the increasing temperature and the real gas
dynamics tends to the hard-sphere ones consequently.

and requires early-stage diagnosis. Nowadays, the deep convolutional neural
networks have achieved greatly in the computer-aided diagnosis field. However,
the construction of the deep learning models usually requires great amounts of
annotated data, which is generally high-cost. In this paper, we propose a novel

knee OA diagnosis. Particularly, we design a self-ensembling framework, which
is composed of a student network and a teacher network with the same structure.
The student network learns from both labeled data and unlabeled data and the
teacher network averages the student model weights through the training course.
A novel attention loss function is developed to obtain accurate attention
masks. With dual-consistency checking of the attention in the lesion
classification and localization, the two networks can gradually optimize the
attention distribution and improve the performance of each other, whereas the
training relies on partially labeled data only and follows the semi-supervised
manner. Experiments show that the proposed method can significantly improve the
self-ensembling performance in both knee cartilage defects classification and
localization, and also greatly reduce the needs of annotated data.

primary endpoint in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis under regulatory
standards. After the tumor progresses, it is common that patients allocated to
the control group switch to the experimental treatment, or another drug in the
same class. Such treatment switching may dilute the relative efficacy of the
new drug compared to the control group, leading to lower statistical power. It
would be possible to decrease the estimation bias by shortening the follow-up
period but this may lead to a loss of information and power. Instead we propose
a modified weighted log-rank test (mWLR) that aims at balancing these factors
by down-weighting events occurring when many patients have switched treatment.
  As the weighting should be pre-specified and the impact of treatment
switching is unknown, we predict the hazard ratio function and use it to
compute the weights of the mWLR. The method may incorporate information from
previous trials regarding the potential hazard ratio function over time.
  We are motivated by the RECORD-1 trial of everolimus against placebo in
patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma where almost 80\% of the patients
in the placebo group received everolimus after disease progression. Extensive
simulations show that the new test gives considerably higher efficiency than
the standard log-rank test in realistic scenarios.

insurance risk process. Capital injection takes place at the draw-down time of
the surplus process when it drops below a pre-specified function of its last
record maximum. The capital is continuously paid to keep the surplus above the
draw-down level until either the surplus process goes above the record high or
a Parisian type ruin occurs, which is announced at the first instance the
surplus process has undergone an excursion below the record for an independent
exponential period of time consecutively since the time the capital was first
injected. Some distributional identities concerning the excursion are
presented. Firstly, we give the Parisian ruin probability and the joint Laplace
transform (possibly killed at the first passage time above a fixed level of the
surplus process) of the ruin time, surplus position at ruin, and the total
capital injection at ruin. Secondly, we obtain the $q$-potential measure of the
surplus process killed at Parisian ruin. Finally, we give expected present
value of the total discounted capital payments up to the Parisian ruin time.
The results are derived using recent developments in fluctuation and excursion
theory of spectrally negative Levy process and are presented semi explicitly in
terms of the scale function of the Levy process. Some numerical examples are
given to facilitate the analysis of the impact of initial surplus and frequency
of observation period to the ruin probability and to the expected total capital

  14 February 2020",,,,"physics.ao-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The notion that the whole is more than the sum of its parts has a long
tradition in science. This, of course, also applies to the Earth system. With
its myriad of processes, spanning from purely physical to life and human
activity, the Earth is a vastly complex system. It may thus seem that there is
nothing simple and general to say because of this overwhelming complexity. What
I want to show here is that by formulating the Earth as a thermodynamic system,
one can identify general directions and infer simple functioning because
thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on the dynamics. At the center of
this description are energy conversions and states of disequilibrium, which are
at the core of the dynamics of Earth system processes, from convection cells to
living organisms and human societies. They are linked to each other and
interact by their exchanges of energy and mass, and ultimately affect how much
of the input of low entropy solar radiation from the Sun is converted into free
energy, energy able to perform work, before the energy gets re-emitted by the
Earth as high entropy terrestrial radiation. The emergent thermodynamic
behavior of the Earth then becomes simple because the dynamics evolve to and
operate at thermodynamic limits. Such behavior of Earth system processes
operating at the edge of their limit can then be linked to previously described
holistic theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, with similarities in the
described emergent behavior. Such a thermodynamic view, however, can go
further, as it can also be used to understand the role of human societies in
the Earth system and the potential pathways to a sustainable future.
Thermodynamics taken together with the energy conversions and interactions
within the Earth system can thus provide a basis to understand why the whole
Earth system is more, and simpler, than the sum of its spheres.

McIntosh. We then investigate how to reduce the impact of correlated predictors
in the variable selection process and how to increase understanding of the
inter-relationships among the predictors by employing Bayesian Network (BN)
models. Context: As in the original study, we use the same measures authors
obtained for Qt project in the original study. We mine data from version
control and issue tracker of Google Chrome and operationalize measures that are
close analogs to the large collection of code, process, and code review
measures used in the replicated the study. Results: Both the data from the

code review measures on defects with the results being highly sensitive to
variable selection procedure. Models without code review predictors had as good
or better fit than those with review predictors. Replication, however, confirms
with the bulk of prior work showing that prior defects, module size, and
authorship have the strongest relationship to post-release defects. The
application of BN models helped explain the observed instability by
demonstrating that the review-related predictors do not affect post-release
defects directly and showed indirect effects. For example, changes that have no
review discussion tend to be associated with files that have had many prior
defects which in turn increase the number of post-release defects.

  Imagery-derived Point Clouds",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  3D urban reconstruction of buildings from remotely sensed imagery has drawn
significant attention during the past two decades. While aerial imagery and
LiDAR provide higher resolution, satellite imagery is cheaper and more
efficient to acquire for large scale need. However, the high, orbital altitude
of satellite observation brings intrinsic challenges, like unpredictable
atmospheric effect, multi view angles, significant radiometric differences due
to the necessary multiple views, diverse land covers and urban structures in a
scene, small base-height ratio or narrow field of view, all of which may
degrade 3D reconstruction quality. To address these major challenges, we
present a reliable and effective approach for building model reconstruction
from the point clouds generated from multi-view satellite images. We utilize
multiple types of primitive shapes to fit the input point cloud. Specifically,
a deep-learning approach is adopted to distinguish the shape of building roofs
in complex and yet noisy scenes. For points that belong to the same roof shape,
a multi-cue, hierarchical RANSAC approach is proposed for efficient and
reliable segmenting and reconstructing the building point cloud. Experimental
results over four selected urban areas (0.34 to 2.04 sq km in size) demonstrate
the proposed method can generate detailed roof structures under noisy data
environments. The average successful rate for building shape recognition is
83.0%, while the overall completeness and correctness are over 70% with
reference to ground truth created from airborne lidar. As the first effort to
address the public need of large scale city model generation, the development
is deployed as open source software.

to the kinds of antisocial behavior that sometimes occur in online discussions.
Moderation can improve online discourse quality, but we lack an understanding

leveraged a natural experiment, occurring across 200,000 messages from 7,000
online mental health conversations, to evaluate the effects of moderation on
online mental health discussions. We found that participation in group mental
health discussions led to improvements in psychological perspective, and that
these improvements were larger in moderated conversations. The presence of a
moderator increased user engagement, encouraged users to discuss negative
emotions more candidly, and dramatically reduced bad behavior among chat
participants. Moderation also encouraged stronger linguistic coordination,
which is indicative of trust building. In addition, moderators who remained
active in conversations were especially successful in keeping conversations on

improve the efficacy and safety of online mental health conversations. Based on
these findings, we discuss implications and trade-offs involved in designing

planar segmentation and then using a topology graph to group the planes
together. Roof edges and vertices are then mathematically represented by
intersecting segmented planes. Technically, such solution is based on
sequential local fitting, i.e., the entire data of one building are not
simultaneously participating in determining the building model. As a
consequence, the solution is lack of topological integrity and geometric rigor.
Fundamentally different from this traditional approach, we propose a holistic
parametric reconstruction method which means taking into consideration the
entire point clouds of one building simultaneously. In our work, building
models are reconstructed from predefined parametric (roof) primitives. We first
use a well-designed deep neural network to segment and identify primitives in
the given building point clouds. A holistic optimization strategy is then
introduced to simultaneously determine the parameters of a segmented primitive.
In the last step, the optimal parameters are used to generate a watertight
building model in CityGML format. The airborne LiDAR dataset RoofN3D with
predefined roof types is used for our test. It is shown that PointNet++ applied
to the entire dataset can achieve an accuracy of 83% for primitive
classification. For a subset of 910 buildings in RoofN3D, the holistic approach
is then used to determine the parameters of primitives and reconstruct the
buildings. The achieved overall quality of reconstruction is 0.08 meters for
point-surface-distance or 0.7 times RMSE of the input LiDAR points. The study
demonstrates the efficiency and capability of the proposed approach and its

manifold is constructed in the projected subspace, which is adaptively updated

the final stage of energy conversion becomes more complex than in the fluid

the edge frames. To solve the issue, we propose an approach to anomalous
detection in which the model utilizes multiple frames of a spectrogram whose

trait from one population to another. This phenomenon appears in studying the
evolution of social features, such as languages. From the mathematical point of
view, gene-flow is modelled using bistable reaction-diffusion equations. The
unknown is the proportion $p$ of the population possessing a certain trait,
within a population $N$. Gene-flow is taken into account by assuming that the
population density $N$ depends either on $p$ or on the location $x$. Recent
applications stemming from mosquito-borne disease control problems or from the
study of bilingualism have called for the investigation of the controllability
properties of these models. At the mathematical level, this corresponds to
boundary control problems and, since we are working with proportions, the
control $u$ has to satisfy the constraints $0\leq u \leq 1$. In this article,
we provide a thorough analysis of the influence of the gene-flow effect on
boundary controllability properties. We prove that, when the population density
$N$ only depends on the trait proportion $p$, the geometry of the domain is the
only criterion that has to be considered. We then tackle the case of population
densities $N$ varying in $x$. We first prove that, when $N$ varies slowly in
$x$ and when the domain is narrow enough, controllability always holds. We then
consider the case of sharp fluctuations in $N$: we give examples that prove
that controllability may fail. Conversely, we give examples of $N$ such that
controllability will always be guaranteed. All negative controllability results
are proved by showing the existence of non-trivial stationary states, which act
as barriers. The existence of such solutions and the methods of proof are of
independent interest. Our article is completed by several numerical experiments

mismatching between estimation and the reality and non-linear residue mostly
caused by non-linear components on the audio devices. The linear residue can be
reduced with elaborate structure and methods, leaving the non-linear residue

already be raised, they are complicated and inefficient for suppression, and
would bring damage to the speech audio. In this paper, a fusion scheme by
combining adaptive filter and neural network is proposed for AEC. The echo
could be reduced in a large scale by adaptive filtering, resulting in little
residual echo. Though it is much smaller than speech audio, it could also be
perceived by human ear and would make communication annoy. The neural network
is elaborately designed and trained for suppressing such residual echo.
Experiments compared with prevailing methods are conducted, validating the

practices in its current use. First, most published methods rely on explicit
knowledge of the construction of the OOD splits. They often rely on
``inverting'' the distribution of labels, e.g. answering mostly 'yes' when the
common training answer is 'no'. Second, the OOD test set is used for model
selection. Third, a model's in-domain performance is assessed after retraining
it on in-domain splits (VQA v2) that exhibit a more balanced distribution of
labels. These three practices defeat the objective of evaluating
generalization, and put into question the value of methods specifically
designed for this dataset. We show that embarrassingly-simple methods,
including one that generates answers at random, surpass the state of the art on
some question types. We provide short- and long-term solutions to avoid these
pitfalls and realize the benefits of OOD evaluation.

in real-world scenarios. However, existing strategies failed to generate
adversarial patches with strong generalization ability. In other words, the
adversarial patches were input-specific and failed to attack images from all
classes, especially unseen ones during training. To address the problem, this
paper proposes a bias-based framework to generate class-agnostic universal
adversarial patches with strong generalization ability, which exploits both the
perceptual and semantic bias of models. Regarding the perceptual bias, since
DNNs are strongly biased towards textures, we exploit the hard examples which
convey strong model uncertainties and extract a textural patch prior from them
by adopting the style similarities. The patch prior is more close to decision
boundaries and would promote attacks. To further alleviate the heavy dependency
on large amounts of data in training universal attacks, we further exploit the
semantic bias. As the class-wise preference, prototypes are introduced and
pursued by maximizing the multi-class margin to help universal training. Taking
AutomaticCheck-out (ACO) as the typical scenario, extensive experiments
including white-box and black-box settings in both digital-world(RPC, the

observable states is discretely selected and does not correspondent to the pair
of unselected linear momentum and position states for the lower bound. This
discrete selection is such that the pair of angular uncertainties is
independent of n-fold symmetry. Herein, we demonstrate the smaller difference
between mean OAM and the product of azimuthal phase-gradient (PG) and h/2{\pi},
the larger {\phi} range of one periodic helical wavefront in a set of numerous
singular light beams, each of which utilizes the superposition comprising two
fractional OAM light beams that have a difference of {\delta} in the azimuthal

states of periodic OAM and AP by a constant product 0.187 h/2{\pi} on their
underlying uncertainties, or the pair of unlimited scale of periodic OAM and AP
uncertainties. This constant lower bound corresponds to the Robeson bound held
by linear UP for the pair of unselected observables; however, it is stronger by
2.67 times. We demonstrate a macroscopic example of the periodic-UP by
illustrating a physical interpretation of the image constructed by phase shift.
Moreover, we demonstrate that the pair of periodically angular uncertainties in
this singular light beam is compatible with the pair of angular uncertainties
by dividing and multiplying a sub-n periodic number, respectively. We
demonstrate that both OAM and AP uncertainties are two monotonic functions of
{\delta} and two various distribution types of OAM spectrum and image intensity

Replacement Path Problem: given a graph $G$, $s$ and $t$, find shortest paths
from $s$ to $t$ avoiding each edge $e$ on the shortest path from $s$ to $t$.
These paths are called replacement paths in literature. For an undirected and
unweighted graph, (Malik, Mittal, and Gupta, Operation Research Letters, 1989)
and (Hershberger and Suri, FOCS 2001) designed an algorithm that solves the
replacement path problem in $\tilde O(m+n)$ time. It is natural to ask whether
we can generalize the replacement path problem: {\em can we find all
replacement paths from a source $s$ to all vertices in $G$?} This problem is
called the Single Source Replacement Path Problem.
  Recently (Chechik and Cohen, SODA 2019) designed a randomized combinatorial
algorithm that solves the Single Source Replacement Path Problem in $\tilde
O(m\sqrt n\ + n^2)$ time. One of the questions left unanswered by their work is
the case when there are many sources, not one. When there are $n$ sources, the
combinatorial algorithm of (Bernstein and Karger, STOC 2009) can be used to
find all pair replacement path in $\tilde O(mn + n^3)$ time. However, there is
no result known for any general $\sigma$. Thus, the problem we study is defined
as follows: given a set of $\sigma$ sources, we want to find the replacement
path from these sources to all vertices in $G$. We give a randomized
combinatorial algorithm for this problem that takes $\tilde O(m\sqrt{n \sigma}

attention-based encoder-decoder models are known to suffer the length bias and
corresponding beam problem. Different approaches have been applied in simple
beam search to ease the problem, most of which are heuristic-based and require
considerable tuning. We show that heuristics are not proper modeling
refinement, which results in severe performance degradation with largely
increased beam sizes. We propose a novel beam search derived from
reinterpreting the sequence posterior with an explicit length modeling. By
applying the reinterpreted probability together with beam pruning, the obtained
final probability leads to a robust model modification, which allows reliable
comparison among output sequences of different lengths. Experimental
verification on the LibriSpeech corpus shows that the proposed approach solves
the length bias problem without heuristics or additional tuning effort. It
provides robust decision making and consistently good performance under both
small and very large beam sizes. Compared with the best results of the
heuristic baseline, the proposed approach achieves the same WER on the 'clean'
sets and 4% relative improvement on the 'other' sets. We also show that it is
more efficient with the additional derived early stopping criterion.

bilevel model to simultaneously determine the location and capacity of the
transfer infrastructure to be built considering elastic demand in a multimodal
transport network. The upper level problem is formulated as a mixed integer
linear programming problem, while the lower level problem is the capacitated
combined trip distribution assignment model that depicts both destination and
route choices of travelers via the multinomial logit formula. To solve the
model, the paper develops a matheuristics algorithm that integrates a Genetic
Algorithm and a successive linear programming solution approach. Numerical
studies are conducted to demonstrate the existence and examine two Braess like
paradox phenomena in a multimodal transport network. The first one states that
under fixed demand constructing parking spaces to stimulate the usage of Park
and Ride service could deteriorate the system performance, measured by the
total passengers travel time, while the second one reveals that under variable
demand increasing the parking capacity for the Park and Ride services to
promote the usages may fail, represented by the decline in its modal share.
Meanwhile, the last experiment suggests that constructing transfer
infrastructures at distributed stations outperforms building a large transfer
center in terms of attracting travelers using sustainable transit modes.

accent while maintaining the speaker's voice timbre. In this paper, we propose
approaches to improving accent conversion applicability, as well as quality.
First of all, we assume no reference speech is available at the conversion
stage, and hence we employ an end-to-end text-to-speech system that is trained
on native speech to generate native reference speech. To improve the quality
and accent of the converted speech, we introduce reference encoders which make
us capable of utilizing multi-source information. This is motivated by acoustic
features extracted from native reference and linguistic information, which are
complementary to conventional phonetic posteriorgrams (PPGs), so they can be
concatenated as features to improve a baseline system based only on PPGs.
Moreover, we optimize model architecture using GMM-based attention instead of
windowed attention to elevate synthesized performance. Experimental results
indicate when the proposed techniques are applied the integrated system
significantly raises the scores of acoustic quality (30$\%$ relative increase
in mean opinion score) and native accent (68$\%$ relative preference) while
retaining the voice identity of the non-native speaker.

problems. The basic idea is to learn the rank of users' preferred items through
separating items into \emph{positive} samples if user-item interactions exist,
and \emph{negative} samples otherwise. Due to the limited number of observable
interactions, pairwise ranking models face serious \emph{class-imbalance}
issues. Our theoretical analysis shows that current sampling-based methods
cause the vertex-level imbalance problem, which makes the norm of learned item
embeddings towards infinite after a certain training iterations, and
consequently results in vanishing gradient and affects the model inference
results. We thus propose an efficient \emph{\underline{Vi}tal
\underline{N}egative \underline{S}ampler} (VINS) to alleviate the
class-imbalance issue for pairwise ranking model, in particular for deep
learning models optimized by gradient methods. The core of VINS is a bias
sampler with reject probability that will tend to accept a negative candidate
with a larger degree weight than the given positive item. Evaluation results on
several real datasets demonstrate that the proposed sampling method speeds up
the training procedure 30\% to 50\% for ranking models ranging from shallow to
deep, while maintaining and even improving the quality of ranking results in
top-N item recommendation.

RV measurements between 2004 and 2019 for HD 81817 and found two periodic RV
variations. The amplitudes of RV variations are around 200 m s^-1, which are
significantly lower than that expected from a closely orbiting white dwarf
companion. Photometric data and relevant spectral lines were also analyzed to
help determine the origin of the periodic RV variations. We conclude that
627.4-day RV variations are caused by intrinsic stellar activities such as
long-term pulsations or rotational modulations of surface activities based on
H{\alpha} equivalent width (EW) variations of a similar period. On the other
hand, 1047.1-day periodic RV variations are likely to be caused by a brown
dwarf or substellar companion, which is corroborated by a recent GAIA proper
motion anomaly for HD 81817. The Keplerian fit yields a minimum mass of 27.1
M_Jup, a semimajor axis of 3.3 AU, and an eccentricity of 0.17 for the stellar
mass of 4.3 M_sun for HD 81817. The inferred mass puts HD 81817 b in the brown

that weighted prefix normality is more expressive than binary prefix normality.
Furthermore, we investigate the existence of a weighted prefix normal form

the orbitalwise scaled down SI-correction (OSIC) scheme of Vydrov et al. [J.

After validating the OSIC implementation with previously reported OSIC-LSDA
results, we examine its performance with the most successful non-empirical SCAN
meta-GGA functional. Using different forms of scaling factors to identify
one-electron regions, we assess the performance of OSIC-SCAN for a wide range

for atoms, atomization energies, dissociation and reaction energies, and
reaction barrier heights of molecules. Our results show that OSIC-SCAN provides
superior results than the previously reported OSIC-LSDA, -PBE, and -TPSS
results. Furthermore, we propose selective scaling of OSIC (SOSIC) to remove
its major shortcoming that destroys the $-1/r$ asymptotic behavior of the
potentials. The SOSIC method gives the highest occupied orbital eigenvalues
practically identical to those in PZSIC and unlike OSIC provides bound atomic
anions even with larger powers of scaling factors. SOSIC compared to PZSIC or
OSIC provides more balanced description of total energies and barrier heights.

Originally, adversarial examples were limited to adding small perturbations to

we introduce a new category of attacks that create unrestricted adversarial
examples for object detection. Our key idea is to generate adversarial objects
that are unrelated to the classes identified by the target object detector.
Different from previous attacks, we use off-the-shelf Generative Adversarial

method consists of searching over the latent normal space of the GAN for
adversarial objects that are wrongly identified by the target object detector.
We evaluate this method on the commonly used Faster R-CNN ResNet-101, Inception

SNGAN trained on CIFAR-10. The empirical results show that the generated
adversarial objects are indistinguishable from non-adversarial objects
generated by the GANs, transferable between the object detectors and robust in
the physical world. This is the first work to study unrestricted false positive

the transmission quality of the region-of-interest (ROI) parts. Firstly, the
classic deep learning based saliency detection algorithm is adopted to
decompose the continuous video sequences into ROI and non-ROI blocks. Secondly,
an effective compression method is used to reduce the data amount of side
information generated by the ROI extraction module. Then, the power allocation
scheme is formulated as a convex problem, and the optimal transmission power
for both ROI and non-ROI blocks is derived in a closed form. Finally, the
simulations are conducted to validate the proposed system by comparing with a
few of existing systems, e.g., KMV-Cast, SoftCast, and DAC-RAN. The proposed
ROIC-Cast can achieve over 4.1dB peak signal- to-noise ratio gains of ROI
compared with other systems, given the channel signal-to-noise ratio as -5dB,
0dB, 5dB, and 10dB, respectively. This significant performance improvement is
due to the automatic ROI extraction, high-efficiency data compression as well
as adaptive power allocation.

GUI-based testing. It is a tool-driven technique, which uses image recognition
for interacting with and asserting the behavior of the system under test.
Motivated by the industrial need of a large Turkish software and systems
company providing solutions in the areas of defense and IT sector, an
action-research project was recently initiated to implement VGT in several
teams and projects in the company.
  Objective: To address the above needs, we planned and carried out an
empirical investigation with the goal of assessing VGT using two tools (Sikuli
and JAutomate). The purpose was to determine a suitable approach and tool for
VGT of a given project (software product) in the company, increase the know-how
in the company's test teams.
  Method: Using an action-research case-study design, we investigated the use
of VGT in the studied organization. Specifically, using the two selected VGT
tools, we conducted a quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of VGT.
  Results: By assessing the list of Challenges, Problems and Limitations (CPL),
proposed in previous work, in the context of our empirical study, we found that
test-tool- and SUT-related CPLs were quite comparable to a previous empirical
study, e.g., the synchronization between SUT and test tools were not always
robust and there were failures in test tools' image recognition features. When
assessing the types of test maintenance activities, when executing the
automated test cases on next versions of the SUTs, for the case of the two test
tools, we found that about half of the test cases (59.1% and 47.8%) failed in
the next version.
  Conclusion: By our results, we confirm some of the previously-reported issues
when conducting VGT. Further, we highlight some additional challenges in test
maintenance when using VGT.

and performance of SR. To conquer these issues, we propose a novel adaptive
weighted attention network (AWAN) for SR, whose backbone is stacked with
multiple dual residual attention blocks (DRAB) decorating with long and short
skip connections to form the dual residual learning. Concretely, we investigate
an adaptive weighted channel attention (AWCA) module to reallocate channel-wise
feature responses via integrating correlations between channels. Furthermore, a
patch-level second-order non-local (PSNL) module is developed to capture
long-range spatial contextual information by second-order non-local operations
for more powerful feature representations. Based on the fact that the recovered
RGB images can be projected by the reconstructed hyperspectral image (HSI) and
the given CSS function, we incorporate the discrepancies of the RGB images and
HSIs as a finer constraint for more accurate reconstruction. Experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed AWAN network in terms of
quantitative comparison and perceptual quality over other state-of-the-art SR

fluids and plasmas, frequently observed also in space environments. In this
paper, kinetic effects at proton scales in the nonlinear and turbulent stage of
the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability have been studied in magnetized collisionless
plasmas by means of Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations. The main goal of this
work is to point out the back reaction on particles triggered by the evolution
of such instability, as energy reaches kinetic scales along the turbulent
cascade. Interestingly, turbulence is inhibited when Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability develops over an initial state which is not an exact equilibrium
state. On the other hand, when an initial equilibrium condition is considered,
energy can be efficiently transferred towards short scales, reaches the typical
proton wavelengths and drives the dynamics of particles. As a consequence of
the interaction of particles with the turbulent fluctuating fields, the proton
velocity distribution deviates significantly from the local thermodynamic
equilibrium, the degree of deviation increasing with the level of turbulence in
the system and being located near regions of strong magnetic stresses. These
numerical results support recent space observations from the Magnetospheric

(PSNR) and its variants for 360 videos were computed to obtain objective
quality metrics and subsequently correlated with the subjective video scores.
This study shows that a Cross-Format SPSNR-NN has a slightly higher linear and
monotonic correlation over all video sequences. Based on the audiovisual model,
a power model shows a highest correlation between test data and predicted
scores. We concluded that to enable the development of superior predictive
model, a high quality, critical, synchronized audiovisual database is required.
Furthermore, comprehensive assessor training may be beneficial prior to the
testing to improve the assessors' discrimination ability particularly with
respect to multichannel audio reproduction. In order to further improve the
performance of audiovisual quality models for immersive content, in addition to
developing broader and critical audiovisual databases, the subjective testing

demonstrate a quantum eraser protocol in a phononic interferometer where the
which-path information can be heralded during the interference process.
Omitting the heralding step yields a clear interference pattern in the
interfering half-quanta pathways; including the heralding step suppresses this
pattern. If we erase the heralded information after the interference has been
measured, the interference pattern is recovered, thereby implementing a
delayed-choice quantum erasure. The test is implemented using a closed
surface-acoustic-wave communication channel into which one superconducting
qubit can emit itinerant phonons that the same or a second qubit can later
re-capture. If the first qubit releases only half of a phonon, the system
follows a superposition of paths during the phonon propagation: either an
itinerant phonon is in the channel, or the first qubit remains in its excited
state. These two paths are made to constructively or destructively interfere by
changing the relative phase of the two intermediate states, resulting in a
phase-dependent modulation of the first qubit's final state, following
interaction with the half-phonon. A heralding mechanism is added to this
construct, entangling a heralding phonon with the signalling phonon. The first
qubit emits a phonon herald conditioned on the qubit being in its excited
state, with no signaling phonon, and the second qubit catches this heralding
phonon, storing which-path information which can either be read out, destroying
the signaling phonon's self-interference, or erased.

introduce a new image-based shapelet modelling package, SHAMFI. We also
introduce a new CUDA simulation code (WODEN) to generate point source,
Gaussian, and shapelet components into visibilities. We test performance by
modelling a simulation of Fornax A, peeling the model from simulated
visibilities, and producing a residual PS. We find the shapelet method
consistently subtracts large-angular-scale emission well, even when the
angular-resolution of the data is changed. We find that when increasing the
angular-resolution of the data, the MS CLEAN model worsens at large
angular-scales. When testing on real MWA data, the expected improvement is not
seen in real data because of the other dominating systematics still present.
Through further simulation we find the expected differences to be lower than
obtainable through current processing pipelines. We conclude shapelets are
worthwhile for subtracting extended galaxies, and may prove essential for an
EoR detection in the future, once other systematics have been addressed.

phase and asymptotically de Sitter (dS) space is established. We identify a
thermal, conformal field theory (CFT) whose partition function is, on the one
hand, equal to the partition function of closed, interacting, fundamental
strings in their Hagedorn phase yet is, on the other hand, also equal to the
Hartle-Hawking (HH) wavefunction of an asymptotically dS Universe. The
Lagrangian of the CFT is a functional of a single scalar field, the condensate
of a thermal scalar, which is proportional to the entropy density of the
strings. The correspondence has some aspects in common with the anti-de
Sitter/CFT correspondence, as well as with some of its proposed analytic
continuations to a dS/CFT correspondence, but it also has some important
conceptual and technical differences. The equilibrium state of the CFT is one
of maximal pressure and entropy, and it is at a temperature that is above but
parametrically close to the Hagedorn temperature. The CFT is valid beyond the
regime of semiclassical gravity and thus defines the initial quantum state of
the dS Universe in a way that replaces and supersedes the HH wavefunction.
Two-point correlation functions of the CFT scalar field are used to calculate
the spectra of the corresponding metric perturbations in the asymptotically dS
Universe and, hence, cosmological observables in the post-inflationary epoch.
Similarly, higher-point correlation functions in the CFT should lead to more
complicated cosmological observables.

mechanical force exerted by a turbulent flow impinging on a bluff body, and
examines the relevance of two distinct rare-event algorithms to efficiently
sample these events. The drag experienced by a square obstacle placed in a
turbulent channel flow (in two dimensions) is taken as a representative case
study. Direct sampling shows that extreme fluctuations are closely related to
the presence of a strong vortex blocked in the near wake of the obstacle. This
vortex is responsible for a significant pressure drop between the forebody and
the base of the obstacle, thus yielding a very high value of the drag. Two
algorithms are then considered to speed up the sampling of such flow scenarii,
namely the AMS and the GKTL algorithms. The general idea behind these
algorithms is to replace a long simulation by a set of much shorter ones,
running in parallel, with dynamics that are replicated or pruned, according to
some specific rules designed to sample large-amplitude events more frequently.
These algorithms have been shown to be relevant for a wide range of problems in
statistical physics, computer science, biochemistry. The present study is the
first application to a fluid-structure interaction problem. Practical evidence
is given that the fast sweeping time of turbulent fluid structures past the
obstacle has a strong influence on the efficiency of the rare-event algorithm.
While the AMS algorithm does not yield significant run-time savings as compared
to direct sampling, the GKTL algorithm appears to be effective to sample very
efficiently extreme fluctuations of the time-averaged drag and estimate related
statistics such as return times.

segmentation concept that aims to reconstruct founder sequences from a multiple
sequence alignment (MSA). Such founder sequences have the feature that each row
of the MSA is a recombination of the founders. Several linear time dynamic
programming algorithms have been previously devised to optimize segmentations
that induce founder blocks that then can be concatenated into a set of founder
sequences. All possible concatenation orders can be expressed as a founder
block graph. We observe a key property of such graphs: if the node labels
(founder segments) do not repeat in the paths of the graph, such graphs can be
indexed for efficient string matching. We call such graphs segment repeat-free
founder block graphs.
  We give a linear time algorithm to construct a segment repeat-free founder
block graph given an MSA. The algorithm combines techniques from the founder
segmentation algorithms (Cazaux et al. SPIRE 2019) and fully-functional
bidirectional Burrows-Wheeler index (Belazzougui and Cunial, CPM 2019). We
derive a succinct index structure to support queries of arbitrary length in the

  Experiments on an MSA of SAR-CoV-2 strains are reported. An MSA of size
$410\times 29811$ is compacted in one minute into a segment repeat-free founder
block graph of 3900 nodes and 4440 edges. The maximum length and total length
of node labels is 12 and 34968, respectively. The index on the graph takes only
$3\%$ of the size of the MSA.

  Forecasting","ECAI 2020 Accepted, preprint",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spatio-temporal sequence forecasting is one of the fundamental tasks in
spatio-temporal data mining. It facilitates many real world applications such
as precipitation nowcasting, citywide crowd flow prediction and air pollution
forecasting. Recently, a few Seq2Seq based approaches have been proposed, but
one of the drawbacks of Seq2Seq models is that, small errors can accumulate
quickly along the generated sequence at the inference stage due to the
different distributions of training and inference phase. That is because
Seq2Seq models minimise single step errors only during training, however the
entire sequence has to be generated during the inference phase which generates
a discrepancy between training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel
curriculum learning based strategy named Temporal Progressive Growing Sampling
to effectively bridge the gap between training and inference for
spatio-temporal sequence forecasting, by transforming the training process from
a fully-supervised manner which utilises all available previous ground-truth
values to a less-supervised manner which replaces some of the ground-truth
context with generated predictions. To do that we sample the target sequence
from midway outputs from intermediate models trained with bigger timescales
through a carefully designed decaying strategy. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed method better models long term dependencies and
outperforms baseline approaches on two competitive datasets.

  Recommendation","To appear in SIGIR'20",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a fundamental yet significant process in personalized recommendation,
candidate generation and suggestion effectively help users spot the most
suitable items for them. Consequently, identifying substitutable items that are
interchangeable opens up new opportunities to refine the quality of generated
candidates. When a user is browsing a specific type of product (e.g., a laptop)
to buy, the accurate recommendation of substitutes (e.g., better equipped
laptops) can offer the user more suitable options to choose from, thus
substantially increasing the chance of a successful purchase. However, existing
methods merely treat this problem as mining pairwise item relationships without
the consideration of users' personal preferences. Moreover, the substitutable
relationships are implicitly identified through the learned latent
representations of items, leading to uninterpretable recommendation results. In
this paper, we propose attribute-aware collaborative filtering (A2CF) to
perform substitute recommendation by addressing issues from both
personalization and interpretability perspectives. Instead of directly
modelling user-item interactions, we extract explicit and polarized item
attributes from user reviews with sentiment analysis, whereafter the
representations of attributes, users, and items are simultaneously learned.
Then, by treating attributes as the bridge between users and items, we can
thoroughly model the user-item preferences (i.e., personalization) and
item-item relationships (i.e., substitution) for recommendation. In addition,
A2CF is capable of generating intuitive interpretations by analyzing which
attributes a user currently cares the most and comparing the recommended
substitutes with her/his currently browsed items at an attribute level. The
recommendation effectiveness and interpretation quality of A2CF are
demonstrated via extensive experiments on three real datasets.

transition metal dichalcogenides, as 1T$-$TaS$_2$, where a large unit cell with
$13$ Ta atom forms weakly-coupled layers with an isotropic triangular lattice.
By using accurate variational Monte Carlo calculations, we report the phase
diagram of the $t-t^\prime$ Hubbard model on the triangular lattice,
highlighting the differences between positive and negative values of
$t^\prime/t$; this result can be captured only by including the charge
fluctuations that are always present for a finite electron-electron repulsion.
Two spin-liquid regions are detected: one for $t^\prime/t<0$, which persists
down to intermediate values of the electron-electron repulsion, and a narrower
one for $t^\prime/t>0$. The spin-liquid phase appears to be gapless, though the
variational wave function has a nematic character, in contrast to the
Heisenberg limit. We do not find any evidence for non-magnetic Mott phases in
the proximity of the metal-insulator transition, at variance with the
predictions (mainly based upon strong-coupling expansions in $t/U$) that
suggest the existence of a weak-Mott phase that intrudes between the metal and

diseases. The portability and relatively low-cost nature of Ultrasound (US)

dependent, limiting its use to only places where experts are present. Recently,
Deep Learning (DL) has been used in 2D echocardiography for automated view
classification, and structure and function assessment. Although these recent
works show promise in developing computer-guided acquisition and automated
interpretation of echocardiograms, most of these methods do not model and
estimate uncertainty which can be important when testing on data coming from a
distribution further away from that of the training data. Uncertainty estimates
can be beneficial both during the image acquisition phase (by providing
real-time feedback to the operator on acquired image's quality), and during
automated measurement and interpretation. The performance of uncertainty models
and quantification metric may depend on the prediction task and the models
being compared. Hence, to gain insight of uncertainty modelling for left
ventricular segmentation from US images, we compare three ensembling based
uncertainty models quantified using four different metrics (one newly proposed)

$\bar{\mathcal{O}}$ is exponential decay with the increase of the system size
indicating the fragility of its eigenstates, and this can be considered as an
eigenstate-version butterfly effect of the chaotic systems. For localized
systems, $\bar{\mathcal{O}}$ is almost size-independent showing the strong
robustness of the eigenstates and the broken of eigenstate thermalization
hypothesis. In addition, we find that the response of eigenstates to the change
of boundary conditions in many-body localized systems is identified with the
single-particle wave functions in Anderson localized systems. This indicates
that the eigenstates of the many-body localized systems, as the many-body wave
functions, may be independent of each other. We demonstrate that this is
consistent with the existence of a large number of quasilocal integrals of

to highly enhanced accretion from the circumstellar disk onto the protostar.
FUor-type outbursts happen in a wide variety of sources from the very embedded
ones to those with almost no sign of extended emission beyond the disk. The
subsequent eruptions might gradually clear up the obscuring envelope material
and drive the protostar on its way to become a disk-only T Tauri star. We used
VLT/VISIR to obtain the first spectra that cover the 8-13 $\mu$m mid-infrared
wavelength range in low-resolution of five recently discovered FUors. Four
objects from our sample show the 10 $\mu$m silicate feature in emission. We
study the shape and strength of the silicate feature in these objects and find
that they mostly contain large amorphous grains, suggesting that large grains
are typically not settled to the midplane in FUor disks. This is a general
characteristic of FUors, as opposed to regular T Tauri-type stars whose disks
display anything from pristine small grains to significant grain growth. We
classify our targets by determining whether the silicate feature is in emission
or in absorption, and confront them with the evolutionary scenarios on the
dispersal of the envelopes around young stars. In our sample, all Class II
objects exhibit silicate emission, while for Class I objects, the appearance of
the feature in emission or absorption depends on the viewing angle with respect
to the outflow cavity. This highlights the importance of geometric effects when
interpreting the silicate feature.

builds on an extension of Jacquard's condensed coefficients of identity, to
specify and compute with joint relationships, not only pairwise ones, including
the possibility of inbreeding. The methodology developed is applied to two

performance, in which the ability of the methodology to recover complex

mixtures with related contributors. KinMix inherits from DNAmixtures the
capacity to deal with mixtures with many contributors, in a time- and

this idea, we present a specific aggregate-enabled training phase for ML-based

segment cells in a cluster. In this regard, we introduce a novel supervised
technique for cell segmentation in a multi-task learning paradigm. A
combination of a multi-task loss, based on the region and cell boundary
detection, is employed for an improved prediction efficiency of the network.
The learning problem is posed in a novel min-max framework which enables
adaptive estimation of the hyper-parameters in an automatic fashion. The region
and cell boundary predictions are combined via morphological operations and
active contour model to segment individual cells.
  The proposed methodology is particularly suited to segment touching cells
from brightfield microscopy images without manual interventions.

which is an improvement of over 15.9% on a recent unsupervised method, and
outperforms the popular supervised U-net algorithm by at least $5.8\%$ on

reinforcement learning (RL) to execute language-like commands in simulated
worlds, as a step towards an intelligent agent or robot that can be instructed
by human users. However, the optimisation of multi-goal motor policies via deep
RL from scratch requires many episodes of experience. Consequently,
instruction-following with deep RL typically involves language generated from
templates (by an environment simulator), which does not reflect the varied or
ambiguous expressions of real users. Here, we propose a conceptually simple
method for training instruction-following agents with deep RL that are robust
to natural human instructions. By applying our method with a state-of-the-art
pre-trained text-based language model (BERT), on tasks requiring agents to
identify and position everyday objects relative to other objects in a
naturalistic 3D simulated room, we demonstrate substantially-above-chance
zero-shot transfer from synthetic template commands to natural instructions
given by humans. Our approach is a general recipe for training any deep
RL-based system to interface with human users, and bridges the gap between two
research directions of notable recent success: agent-centric motor behavior and
text-based representation learning.

often star formation organized in ring structures. We try to clarify the nature
of this phenomenon and its difference from star formation in spiral galaxies.
The luminous S0 galaxy with a large ring, UGC 5936, is studied here. By
applying long-slit spectroscopy along the major axis of UGC 5936, we have
measured gas and star kinematics, Lick indices for the main body of the galaxy,
and strong emission-line flux ratios in the ring. After inspecting the gas
excitation in the ring using line ratios diagnostic diagrams and having ensured
that it is ionized mostly by young stars, we have determined the gas oxygen
abundance by using popular strong-line methods. Also we have proved the spatial
proximity of the south-eastern dwarf satellite to UGC 5936 and have measured
its gas metallicity. The ionized gas of the ring is excited by young stars and
has solar metallicity. Star formation in the ring is rather prolonged, and its
intensity corresponds to the current HI content of UGC 5936 (to the
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation). The whole morphology of the HI distribution
implies current accretion of the cold gas from the satellite onto the outer
disc of UGC 5936; due to the satellite location and rotation in the plane of
the stellar disc of the host galaxy, the accretion is smooth and laminar
providing the favorable condition for star formation ignition.

calibrating gyrochronology in the future. We find that a linear gyrochronology

does not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late-K dwarfs spin
more slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages we find that
late-K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same

rate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and
mass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the NGC 6811 cluster,
which indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch
of inhibited evolution. We find that the oldest Kepler stars with measured

solution from a sequence of times-of-arrival (TOAs) by absolute pulse

minimize the residuals with respect to a parametrized phase model. In this
observing mode, rotational glitches are discovered, when the residuals of the
no-glitch phase model diverge after some epoch, and glitch parameters are
refined by Bayesian follow-up. Here an alternative, complementary approach is
presented which tracks the pulse frequency $f$ and its time derivative $df/dt$
with a hidden Markov model (HMM), whose dynamics include stochastic spin
wandering (timing noise) and impulsive jumps in $f$ and $df/dt$ (glitches). The
HMM tracks spin wandering explicitly, as a specific realization of a
discrete-time Markov chain. It discovers glitches by comparing the Bayes factor
for glitch and no-glitch models. It ingests standard TOAs for convenience and,
being fully automated, allows performance bounds to be calculated quickly via
Monte Carlo simulations. Practical, user-oriented plots are presented of the
false alarm probability and detection threshold (e.g. minimum resolvable glitch
size) versus observational scheduling parameters (e.g. TOA uncertainty, mean

bottom-heavy sphere forced by a transverse acoustic field and thereby establish
how density inhomogeneities may play a critical role in acoustic propulsion.
The sphere is trapped at the pressure node of a standing wave whose wavelength
is much larger than the sphere diameter. Due to its inhomogeneous density, the
sphere oscillates in translation and rotation relative to the surrounding
fluid. The perturbative flows induced by the sphere's rotation and translation
are shown to generate a rectified inertial flow responsible for a net mean
force on the sphere that is able to propel the particle within the
zero-pressure plane. To avoid an explicit derivation of the streaming flow, the
propulsion speed is computed exactly using a suitable version of the Lorentz
reciprocal theorem. The propulsion speed is shown to scale as the inverse of
the viscosity, the cube of the amplitude of the acoustic field and is a non
trivial function of the acoustic frequency. Interestingly, for some
combinations of the constitutive parameters (fluid to solid density ratio,
moment of inertia and centroid to center of mass distance), the direction of
propulsion is reversed as soon as the frequency of the forcing acoustic field
becomes larger than a certain threshold. The results produced by the model are
compatible with both the observed phenomenology and the orders of magnitude of
the measured velocities.

consider separately parameter regimes in which the underlying constitutive
curve is monotonic and non-monotonic, such that the bulk flow (in the absence
of any edge effects) is respectively homogeneous and shear banded. Phase
diagrams of the levels of edge disturbance and of bulk (or quasi-bulk) shear
banding are mapped as a function of the surface tension of the fluid-air
interface, the wetting angle where this interface meets the walls of the flow
cell, and the imposed shear rate. In particular, we explore in more detail the
basic result recently announced in Hemingway et al. (2018): that precursors to
edge fracture can induce quasi-bulk shear banding. We also appraise analytical
predictions that shear banding can induce edge fracture, Skorski and Olmsted
(2011). Although a study of remarkable early insight, that study made some
strong assumptions about the nature of the ""base state"", which we examine using
direct numerical simulation. The basic prediction that shear banding can cause
edge fracture remains valid, but with qualitatively modified phase boundaries.

second model combines vector quantization with contrastive predictive coding

normal operation (i.e. performance of the dynamic driving task without
component failures or malicious actions). Five top-level evaluation criteria
for ADS performance are identified. Implementing these requires two types of
outcome scoring rule: prescriptive (measurable rules which must always be
followed) and risk-based (undesirable outcomes which must not occur too often).
Scoring rules are defined in a programming language and will be stored as part
of the scenario description.
  Risk-based rules cannot give a pass/fail decision from a single test case.
Instead, a framework is defined to reach a decision for each functional
scenario (set of test cases with common features). This considers statistical
performance across many individual tests. Implications of this framework for
hypothesis testing and scenario selection are identified.

simulations of size segregation in bedload transport (Chassagne et al. 2020).
Through a detailed investigation of the granular forces, it is demonstrated
that the observed scaling of the advection and diffusion coefficients with the
inertial number can be explained by the granular drag force dependency on the
viscosity. The drag coefficient was shown to be linearly dependent on the small
particle concentration. The scaling relationship of the segregation force with
the friction coefficient is confirmed and additional non-trivial dependencies
including the inertial number and small particle concentration are identified.
Lastly, adding a size ratio dependency in the segregation force perfectly
reproduces the DEM results for a large range of small particle concentrations
and size-ratios.

trials (replicates). As neurologists consider localised spectra of brain
signals to be most informative, here we develop a novel wavelet-based tool
capable to formally represent process nonstationarities across both time and
replicate dimensions. Specifically, we propose the Replicate Locally Stationary

within and across trials. Estimation using wavelets gives a natural desired
time- and replicate-localisation of the process dynamics. We develop the
associated spectral estimation framework and establish its asymptotic
properties. By means of thorough simulation studies, we demonstrate the
theoretical estimator properties hold in practice. A real data investigation

study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia light-curve stretch, a purely
intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch
has been shown to be strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with
stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying stretch distribution as a
function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and old SNe
Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying
stretch distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures.
We tested our prediction against published samples that were cut to have
marginal magnitude selection effects so that any observed change is indeed
astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there are
indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a
function of redshift, and that the age drifting model is a better description
of the data than any time-constant model, including the sample-based asymmetric
distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist bias at a significance
higher than 5 $\sigma$. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal one,
composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and
a low-stretch mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of
the redshift evolution of the intrinsic properties of a SN Ia population on
cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the SN stretch
distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections and hence the
distances that are derived using SNe that are affected by observational
selection effects. This bias increases with surveys covering larger redshift
ranges.

Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection in (in most cases regular) porous media,

This study is focused on the role of porosity $\phi$ in the flow properties
during the transition process from the traditional RB convection with $\phi=1$
(so no obstacles included) to Darcy-type porous-media convection with $\phi$
approaching 0. Simulations are carried out in a cell with unity aspect ratio,
for the Rayleigh number $Ra$ from $10^5$ to $10^{10}$ and varying porosities
$\phi$, at a fixed Prandtl number $Pr=4.3$, and we restrict ourselves to the
two dimensional case. For fixed $Ra$, the Nusselt number $Nu$ is found to vary
non-monotonously as a function of $\phi$; namely, with decreasing $\phi$, it
first increases, before it decreases for $\phi$ approaching 0. The
non-monotonous behaviour of $Nu(\phi)$ originates from two competing effects of
the porous structure on the heat transfer. On the one hand, the flow coherence
is enhanced in the porous media, which is beneficial for the heat transfer. On
the other hand, the convection is slowed down by the enhanced resistance due to
the porous structure, leading to heat transfer reduction. For fixed $\phi$,
depending on $Ra$, two different heat transfer regimes are identified, with
different effective power-law behaviours of $Nu$ vs $Ra$, namely, a steep one
for low $Ra$ when viscosity dominates, and the standard classical one for large
$Ra$. The scaling crossover occurs when the thermal boundary layer thickness
and the pore scale are comparable. The influences of the porous structure on
the temperature and velocity fluctuations, convective heat flux, and energy
dissipation rates are analysed, further demonstrating the competing effects of
the porous structure to enhance or reduce the heat transfer.

are of importance in ReBCO tapes, where the large size of the superconducting
filaments gives rise to strong magnetization phenomena. In consequence,
superconducting accelerator magnets based on ReBCO tapes might experience a
relevant degradation of the magnetic field quality in the magnet aperture,
eventually leading to particle beam instabilities. Thus, persistent
magnetization phenomena need to be accurately evaluated. In this paper, the 2D
finite element model of the Feather-M2.1-2 magnet is presented. The model is
used to analyze the influence of the screening current-induced magnetic field
on the field quality in the magnet aperture. The model relies on a coupled
field formulation for eddy current problems in time-domain. The formulation is
introduced and verified against theoretical references. Then, the numerical
model of the Feather-M2.1-2 magnet is detailed, highlighting the key
assumptions and simplifications. The numerical results are discussed and
validated with available magnetic measurements. A satisfactory agreement is
found, showing the capability of the numerical tool in providing accurate
analysis of the dynamic behavior of the Feather-M2.1-2 magnet.

response of Si nanospring arrays fabricated by glancing angle deposition. The
vertical standing nanospring arrays were approximately 250 nm tall and 60 nm
apart, which allowed the droplets to rebound within a few milliseconds after
contact. Amazingly, the morphology of the nanostructures influences the impact
dynamics. The rebound time and coefficient of restitution were also found to be
higher for Si nanosprings than vertical SI columns. It has been proposed that
the restoring force of the Si nanosprings may be responsible for the water
droplet rebound and can be explained by considering the droplet/nanospring
surface as a coupled spring system. These nanospring surfaces may find
applications in self-cleaning windows, liquid-repellent exteriors, glass panels

of coherent agents (e.g., a flock of bird or a fleet of drones) through the
motion of an external robot, called shepherd. Machine learning based methods
have successfully solved this problem in an empty environment with no
obstacles. Rule-based methods, on the other hand, can handle more complex
scenarios in which environments are cluttered with obstacles and allow multiple
shepherds to work collaboratively. However, these rule-based methods are
fragile due to the difficulty in defining a comprehensive set of rules that can

known learning-based method that can herd agents amongst obstacles. By using
deep reinforcement learning techniques combined with the probabilistic
roadmaps, we train a shepherding model using noisy but controlled environmental
and behavioral parameters. Our experimental results show that the proposed
method is robust, namely, it is insensitive to the uncertainties originated
from both environmental and behavioral models. Consequently, the proposed
method has a higher success rate, shorter completion time and path length than
the rule-based behavioral methods have. These advantages are particularly
prominent in more challenging scenarios involving more difficult groups and

with previous observational data and found to be in good agreement, with a
predicted [Z/E] ratio of $\sim3$ - somewhat smaller than the previously derived
value of $6.1\pm2.4$. We find that the [Z/E] ratio in our simulations is due
mostly to ion-molecule destruction rates driven by the different permanent

We examine ideas based on the definition of quantum extremal surfaces in
quantum field theory in curved space-time. The low energy effective field
theory of our model is the large N CGHS model, which includes the one loop
effects that are taken into account in the ""island"" proposal for understanding
the Page curve. Contrary to the results of the island analysis, that solution
leads to a singular geometry for the evaporated black hole. If the singularity
obeys Cosmic Censorship then Hawking evaporation leaves behind a remnant object
with a finite fraction of the black hole entropy. If the singularity becomes
naked at some point, boundary conditions on a time-like line emanating from
that point can produce a sensible model where we expect a Page curve. We show
that the fully UV complete model gives a correct Page curve, as it must since
the model is manifestly unitary. Recent result on replicawormholes suggest that
the island formula, which appears to involve only one loop computations, in
fact encodes non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral.
The question of why Euclidean gravity computations can capture information
about microscopic states of quantum gravity remains mysterious. In a
speculative coda to the paper we suggest that the proper way of understanding
the relation between Euclidean gravity path integrals and quantum spectra is
via a statistical approach to Jacobson's interpretation of general relativistic
field equations as the hydrodynamic equations of the area law for the maximal
entropy of causal diamonds.

Probabilistic formulations have recently been proposed for several versions of
the PLS. Focusing first on the probabilistic formulation of the PLS-SVD
proposed by el Bouhaddani et al., we establish that the constraints on their

$(x,y)$, under which components with maximal covariance (solutions of PLS-SVD)
are also necessarily of respective maximal variances (solutions of principal

dimensions is described in a geometric manner by K\""ahler superspace. A
straightforward way to implement K\""ahler superspace is via $\mathrm{U}(1)$
superspace by identifying the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ pre-potential with the K\""ahler
potential, which is a function of the matter (chiral) superfields. In this
framework, the components of the supergravity multiplet are contained in the
supervielbein and torsion tensor of superspace. Furthermore, interactions with
the Yang-Mills (vector) multiplet are formulated by introducing a connection
$1$-superform of an additional gauge structure. In these notes, the Bianchi
identities in $\mathrm{U}(1)$ superspace are solved for a particular set of
torsion constraints which lead to the minimal supergravity multiplet. Moreover,
the solution of the Bianchi identities in the gauge sector is derived and
K\""ahler superspace is defined. At the superfield level, the general action of
the supergravity/matter/Yang-Mills system and supergravity transformations are
formulated, and the equations of motion are deduced. Using projection to lowest
components in superspace, the corresponding Lagrangian and supergravity
transformations at the component field level are calculated, and the equations
of motion of the auxiliary fields are determined. Compared to existing
literature, these notes provide a self-contained and consistent step by step
derivation of the general supergravity/matter/Yang-Mills Lagrangian for $N=1$

the relative entanglement entropy for the density matrix at two different

approach is model independent and only relies on the existence of a quasi de
Sitter phase. We show that there are primordial non-gaussianities, both in the
form of squeezed and equilateral shapes. The squeezed limit gives a value of
$f_{\rm NL} \sim n_s-1$. In the equilateral limit we find that $f_{\rm NL} \sim
0.03$. The equilateral non-gaussianity is due to the non-linearity of
Einstein's equation. On the other hand, the squeezed one is due to the quantum
nature of clock synchronization and thus real and cannot be gauged away as a
global curvature. We identify a new effect: {\it clock bias} which is a pure
quantum effect and introduces a bias in the spectral tilt and running of the
power spectrum of order $\sim 10^{-4}$, which could be potentially measurable

exacerbated when massive parallelism and frequent data movement are required
between processing and memory units for real-time implementation of artificial

most promising approach to address the memory wall problem is to carry out
computations inside the memory core itself that enhances the memory bandwidth

in-memory architecture based on standard six transistor (6T) static random

Our novel on-chip training and inference in-memory architecture reduces energy
cost and enhances throughput by simultaneously accessing the multiple rows of

proposed architecture realizes backpropagation which is the keystone during the
network training using newly proposed different building blocks such as weight

spectra, and thermoelectric properties of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at
different filling factors and twist angles $\theta$. Our calculations are based
on the electronic band structures obtained from a continuum model that has two
tunable parameters, $u_0$ and $u_1$, which parametrize the intra-sublattice
inter-layer and inter-sublattice inter-layer tunneling rate, respectively. In
this Article we focus on two key aspects: i) we study the dependence of our
results on the value of $u_0$, exploring the whole range $0\leq u_0\leq u_1$;
ii) we take into account effects arising from the intrinsic charge density
inhomogeneity present in TBG, by calculating the band structures within the
self-consistent Hartree approximation. At zero filling factor, i.e. at the
charge neutrality point, the optical conductivity is quite sensitive to the
value of $u_0$ and twist angle, whereas the charge inhomogeneity brings about
only modest corrections. On the other hand, away from zero filling, static
screening dominates and the optical conductivity is appreciably affected by the
charge inhomogeneity, the largest effects being seen on the intra-band
contribution to it. These findings are also reflected by the plasmonic spectra.
We compare our results with existing ones in the literature, where effects i)
and ii) above have not been studied systematically. As natural byproducts of
our calculations, we obtain the Drude weight and Seebeck coefficient. The
former displays an enhanced particle-hole asymmetry stemming from the
inhomogeneous ground-state charge distribution. The latter is shown to display
a broad sign-changing feature even at low temperatures ($\approx 5~{\rm K}$)
due to the reduced slope of the bands, as compared to those of single-layer
graphene.

constructs a spatially structured view-embedding map and uses it for subsequent
visual localization with a particle filter. Since the DMN architecture is
end-to-end differentiable, we can jointly learn the map representation and
localization using gradient descent. We apply the DMN to sparse visual
localization, where a robot needs to localize in a new environment with respect
to a small number of images from known viewpoints. We evaluate the DMN using
simulated environments and a challenging real-world Street View dataset. We
find that the DMN learns effective map representations for visual localization.

magnetic ordering along directions that are not favoured by the crystal-field
anisotropy. Using a renormalization-group (RG) analysis of single impurity
Kondo models with single-ion anisotropy, we demonstrate that strong
fluctuations above the Kondo temperature drive a moment re-orientation over a
wide range of parameters, e.g. for different spin values $S$ and number of
Kondo channels $N$. In tetragonal systems this can happen for both easy-plane
or easy axis anisotropy. The characteristic crossing of magnetic
susceptibilities is not an artefact of the weak-coupling RG treatment but can
be reproduced in brute-force perturbation theory. Employing numerical
renormalization group (NRG), we show that for an under-screened moment ($S=1$,
$N=1$) with easy-plane anisotropy, a crossing of magnetic susceptibilities can
also occur in the strong-coupling regime (below the Kondo temperature). This
suggests that collective magnetic ordering of such under-screened moments would
develop along the magnetic hard axis.

We first find that GANs learn various semantics in some linear subspaces of the

manipulate the corresponding facial attributes without retraining the model. We
then conduct a detailed study on the correlation between different semantics

more precise control of the attribute manipulation. Besides manipulating the
gender, age, expression, and presence of eyeglasses, we can even alter the face
pose and fix the artifacts accidentally made by GANs. Furthermore, we perform
an in-depth face identity analysis and a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the
editing results quantitatively. Finally, we apply our approach to real face
editing by employing GAN inversion approaches and explicitly training
feed-forward models based on the synthetic data established by InterFaceGAN.
Extensive experimental results suggest that learning to synthesize faces

examples per batch, provides better approximations (lower percentage error) of
the physical parameters than using large batches or the full batch. The
increased accuracy of the physical parameters, comes at the cost of longer
training time. Specifically, we find the size should not be too small since a
very small batch size requires a very long training time without a

  GPR Data with a Theoretical Database","10 pages",,,"10","eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is an efficient technique used for rapidly
recognizing embedded rebar in concrete structures. However, due to the
difficulty in extracting signals from GPR data and the intrinsic coupling
between the rebar depth and size showing in the data, simultaneously
determining rebar depth and size is challenging. This paper proposes an
innovative algorithm to address this issue. First, the hyperbola signal from
the GPR data is identified by direct wave removal, signal reconstruction and
separation. Subsequently, a database is developed from a series of theoretical
hyperbolas and then compared with the extracted hyperbola outlines. Finally,
the rebar depth and size are determined by searching for the closest
counterpart in the database. The obtained results are very promising and
indicate that: (1) implementing the method presented in this paper can
completely remove the direct wave noise from the GPR data, and can successfully
extract the outlines from the interlaced hyperbolas; and (2) the proposed
method can simultaneously determine the rebar depth and size with the accuracy
of 100% and 95.11%, respectively.

new algorithm, which estimates the size of the subtree below an action, and
leverages this information in the UCB formula to better direct exploration.
Subsequently, we generalize these ideas by showing that loops, i.e., the
repeated occurrence of (approximately) the same state in the same trace, are
actually a special case of subtree depth variation. Testing on a variety of

allows combining selected characteristics of nonlocal elasticity, typical of
classical integral and gradient formulations, under a single frame-invariant
framework. The resulting generalized theory is capable of capturing both
stiffening and softening effects and it is not subject to the inconsistencies
often observed under selected external loads and boundary conditions. The
governing equations of a 1D continuum are derived by continualization of the
Lagrangian of a 1D lattice subject to long-range interactions. This approach is
particularly well suited to highlight the connection between the
fractional-order operators and the microscopic properties of the medium. The
approach is also extended to derive, by means of variational principles, the
governing equations of a 3D continuum in strong form. The positive definite
potential energy, characteristic of our fractional formulation, always ensures
well-posed governing equations. This aspect, combined with the differ-integral
nature of fractional-order operators, guarantees both stability and the ability
to capture dispersion without requiring additional inertia gradient terms. The
proposed formulation is applied to the static and free vibration analyses of
either Timoshenko beams or Mindlin plates. Numerical results, obtained by a
fractional-order finite element method, show that the fractional-order
formulation is able to model both stiffening and softening response in these
slender structures. The numerical results provide the foundation to critically
analyze the physical significance of the different fractional model parameters
as well as their effect on the response of the structural elements.

planning private trips on a network map shown on a public display.The proposed

The approximate governing equation is first used to train a low-fidelity

where the low-fidelity model is updated by using the available high-fidelity
data. MF-PIDNN is able to encode useful information on the physics of the
problem from the {\it approximate} governing differential equation and hence,
provides accurate prediction even in zones with no data. Additionally, no

minimizing the rewards lost during learning by RL agent or by finding a

the early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the
rate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is
cumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large
number of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital
contact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact
tracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements
and close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact
tracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed
that higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better
controlled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the
collected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption
rate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.
In fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in
multiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for
mass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting
contact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly
effective, efficient contact tracing. As part of this study, we focus on
various cryptographic techniques that can help in addressing the Private Set
Intersection problem which lies at the heart of privacy respecting contact
tracing. We analyze the computation and communication complexities of these
techniques under the typical client-server architecture utilized by contact
tracing applications. Further we evaluate those computation and communication
complexity expressions for India scenario and thus identify cryptographic

We note that a key difficulty is obtaining the ground truth as to when people

important for accurately evaluating the accuracy with which contact events are
detected by Bluetooth LE. We approach this by adopting a scenario-based
approach. In summary, we find that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength
can vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on
absorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in
buildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal strength need
not decrease with increasing distance. This suggests that the development of
accurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal
strength is likely to be challenging. Our measurements also suggest that
combining use of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption of new social
protocols may yield benefits but this requires further investigation. For
example, placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify
proximity detection using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying
handbags with phones placed close to the outside surface. In locations where
the complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received

on an etchless lithium niobate integrated platform by using photonic bound

  Learning Rate in Regression and Neural Networks","Accepted in IJCNN 2020",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a theoretical framework for an adaptive learning rate policy for
the Mean Absolute Error loss function and Quantile loss function and evaluate
its effectiveness for regression tasks. The framework is based on the theory of
Lipschitz continuity, specifically utilizing the relationship between learning
rate and Lipschitz constant of the loss function. Based on experimentation, we
have found that the adaptive learning rate policy enables up to 20x faster
convergence compared to a constant learning rate policy.
