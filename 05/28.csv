presence of a passive eavesdropper. To maximize the system secrecy rate, the
transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflecting matrix at the IRS are jointly
optimized with transmit power and discrete phase-shift constraints. It is first
proved that the beamforming design is independent of the phase shift design
under the rank-one channel assumption. The formulated non-convex problem is
then converted into two subproblems, which are solved alternatively.
Specifically, the closed-form solution of transmit beamforming at the BS is
derived, and the semidefinite programming (SDP)-based method and element-wise
block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method are proposed to design the
reflecting matrix. The complexity of our proposed methods is analyzed
theoretically. Simulation results reveal that the proposed IRS-assisted secure
strategy can significantly boost the secrecy rate performance, regardless of
eavesdropper's locations (near or blocking the confidential beam).

at evaluating the biological and structural maturation of human bones. In the
clinical practice, Tanner and Whitehouse (TW2) method is a widely-used method
for radiologists to perform BAA. The TW2 method splits the hands into Region Of
Interests (ROI) and analyzes each of the anatomical ROI separately to estimate
the bone age. Because of considering the analysis of local information, the TW2
method shows accurate results in practice. Following the spirit of TW2, we
propose a novel model called Anatomical Local-Aware Network (ALA-Net) for
automatic bone age assessment. In ALA-Net, anatomical local extraction module
is introduced to learn the hand structure and extract local information.
Moreover, we design an anatomical patch training strategy to provide extra
regularization during the training process. Our model can detect the anatomical
ROIs and estimate bone age jointly in an end-to-end manner. The experimental
results show that our ALA-Net achieves a new state-of-the-art single model
performance of 3.91 mean absolute error (MAE) on the public available RSNA

recognized TW2 method, it is interpretable and reliable for clinical usage.

trajectories for autonomous vehicles when probabilistic predictions of other
agents' futures are generated by deep neural networks (DNNs). The presented
methods address a wide range of representations for uncertain predictions
including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian mixture models for predictions of both
agent positions and controls. We show that the problem of risk assessment when
Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) of agent positions are learned can be solved
rapidly to arbitrary levels of accuracy with existing numerical methods. To
address the problem of risk assessment for non-Gaussian mixture models of agent
position, we propose finding upper bounds on risk using Chebyshev's Inequality
and sums-of-squares (SOS) programming; they are both of interest as the former
is much faster while the latter can be arbitrarily tight. These approaches only
require statistical moments of agent positions to determine upper bounds on
risk. To perform risk assessment when models are learned for agent controls as
opposed to positions, we develop TreeRing, an algorithm analogous to tree
search over the ring of polynomials that can be used to exactly propagate
moments of control distributions into position distributions through nonlinear
dynamics. The presented methods are demonstrated on realistic predictions from
DNNs trained on the Argoverse and CARLA datasets and are shown to be effective
for rapidly assessing the probability of low probability events.

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.SI cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Online manipulation of information has become more prevalent in recent years
as state-sponsored disinformation campaigns seek to influence and polarize
political topics through massive coordinated efforts. In the process, these
efforts leave behind artifacts, which researchers have leveraged to analyze the
tactics employed by disinformation campaigns after they are taken down.
Coordination network analysis has proven helpful for learning about how
disinformation campaigns operate; however, the usefulness of these forensic
tools as a detection mechanism is still an open question. In this paper, we
explore the use of coordination network analysis to generate features for
distinguishing the activity of a disinformation campaign from legitimate
Twitter activity. Doing so would provide more evidence to human analysts as
they consider takedowns. We create a time series of daily coordination networks
for both Twitter disinformation campaigns and legitimate Twitter communities,
and train a binary classifier based on statistical features extracted from
these networks. Our results show that the classifier can predict future
coordinated activity of known disinformation campaigns with high accuracy (F1 =
0.98). On the more challenging task of out-of-distribution activity
classification, the performance drops yet is still promising (F1 = 0.71),
mainly due to an increase in the false positive rate. By doing this analysis,
we show that while coordination patterns could be useful for providing evidence
of disinformation activity, further investigation is needed to improve upon
this method before deployment at scale.

mirror symmetries. They host interesting phenomena such as the quantized
circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) and the chiral magnetic effect. In this
work, we report a comprehensive theoretical and experimental analysis of the
linear and non-linear optical responses of the chiral topological semimetal
RhSi, which is known to host multifold fermions. We show that the
characteristic features of the optical conductivity, which display two distinct
quasi-linear regimes above and below 0.4 eV, can be linked to excitations of
different kinds of multifold fermions. The characteristic features of the CPGE,
which displays a sign change at 0.4 eV and a large non-quantized response peak
of around 160 $\mu \textrm{A V}^{-2}$ at 0.7 eV, are explained by assuming that
the chemical potential crosses a flat hole band at the Brillouin zone center.
Our theory predicts that, in order to observe a quantized CPGE in RhSi, it is
necessary to increase the chemical potential as well as the quasiparticle
lifetime. More broadly our methodology, especially the development of the
broadband terahertz emission spectroscopy, could be widely applied to study
photo-galvanic effects in noncentrosymmetric materials and in topological

by allowing management and provisioning of infrastructure through the
definition of machine-readable files and automation around them, rather than
physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. On the one
hand, although IaC represents an ever-increasing widely adopted practice
nowadays, still little is known concerning how to best maintain, speedily
evolve, and continuously improve the code behind the IaC practice in a
measurable fashion. On the other hand, source code measurements are often
computed and analyzed to evaluate the different quality aspects of the software
developed. However, unlike general-purpose programming languages (GPLs), IaC
scripts use domain-specific languages, and metrics used for GPLs may not be
applicable for IaC scripts. This article proposes a catalogue consisting of 46
metrics to identify IaC properties focusing on Ansible, one of the most popular
IaC language to date, and shows how they can be used to analyze IaC scripts.

precoder is adopted at the BS. Furthermore two alternative enhanced signal

To answer this question, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy for
injecting syntactic biases into BERT pretraining, by distilling the
syntactically informative predictions of a hierarchical---albeit harder to
scale---syntactic language model. Since BERT models masked words in
bidirectional context, we propose to distill the approximate marginal
distribution over words in context from the syntactic LM. Our approach reduces
relative error by 2-21% on a diverse set of structured prediction tasks,

demonstrate the benefits of syntactic biases, even in representation learners
that exploit large amounts of data, and contribute to a better understanding of
where syntactic biases are most helpful in benchmarks of natural language
understanding.

This paper provides a holistic approach to the modelling of non-stationary
extreme events by iterating between parametric and semi-parametric approaches,
thus providing an automatic procedure to estimate a moving threshold with
respect to a periodic covariate in circular data. By exploiting advantages and
mitigating pitfalls of each approach, a unified framework is provided as the
backbone for estimating extreme quantiles, including that of the $T$-year level
and finite right endpoint, which seeks to optimize bias-variance trade-off. To
this end, two tuning parameters related to the spread of peaks over threshold
are introduced. We provide guidance for applying the methodology to the
directional modelling of hindcast storm peak significant wave heights recorded
in the North Sea. Although the theoretical underpinning for adaptation of
well-known estimators in statistics of extremes to circular data is given in
some detail, the derivation of their asymptotic properties lays beyond the
scope of this paper. A bootstrap technique is implemented for obtaining
direction-driven confidence bounds in such a way as to account for the relevant
boundary restrictions with minimal sensitivity to initial point. This provides
a template for other applications where the analysis of directional extremes is
of importance.

breaches. In a long-running system, it is, therefore, indispensable to maintain
a reconfiguration mechanism that would replace faulty replicas with correct
ones. An important challenge is to enable reconfiguration without affecting the
availability and consistency of the replicated data: the clients should be able
to get correct service even when the set of service replicas is being updated.
  In this paper, we address the problem of reconfiguration in the presence of
Byzantine failures: faulty replicas or clients may arbitrarily deviate from
their expected behavior. We describe a generic technique for building
asynchronous and Byzantine fault-tolerant reconfigurable objects: clients can
manipulate the object data and issue reconfiguration calls without reaching
consensus on the current configuration. With the help of forward-secure digital
signatures, our solution makes sure that superseded and possibly compromised
configurations are harmless, that slow clients cannot be fooled into reading
stale data, and that Byzantine clients cannot cause a denial of service by
flooding the system with reconfiguration requests. Our approach is modular and
based on dynamic Byzantine lattice agreement abstraction, and we discuss how to
extend it to enable Byzantine fault-tolerant implementations of a large class
of reconfigurable replicated services.

restricted by the continuity and Euler equations. It corresponds to the
well-known Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, the quantum Bohm potential,
which is a part of the momentum flux, has a nontrivial part with can evolve
under the quantum fluctuations. To cover this phenomenon in terms of
hydrodynamic methods we need to derive equations for the momentum flux, and the
third rank tensor. In all equations we consider the main contribution of the
short-range interaction (SRI) in the first order by the interaction radius.
Derived hydrodynamics consists of four hydrodynamic equations. The third moment
evolution equation contains interaction leading to the quantum fluctuations. It
includes new interaction constant. The Gross-Pitaevskii interaction constant is
the integral of potential, but the second interaction constant is the integral
of second derivative of potential. If we have dipolar BECs we deal with a
long-range interaction. Its contribution is proportional to the potential of
dipole-dipole interaction (DDI). The Euler equation contains the derivative of
the potential. The third rank tensor evolution equation contains the third
derivative of the potential. The quantum fluctuations lead to existence of the
second wave solution. Moreover, the quantum fluctuations introduce the
instability of BECs. If the DDI is attractive, but being smaller then the
repulsive SRI presented by the first interaction constant, there is the
long-wavelength instability. For the repulsive DDI these is more complex
picture. There is the small area with the long-wavelength instability which
transits into stability interval, where two waves exist. There is the
short-wavelength instability as well. These results are found for the DDI
strength comparable with the Gross-Pitaevskii SRI.

methods that address uncertainty quantification in Deep Neural Networks,
pushing forward the reduced-order modeling approach of Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition-Neural Networks (POD-NN) with Deep Ensembles and Variational
Inference-based Bayesian Neural Networks on two-dimensional problems in space.
These are first tested on benchmark problems, and then applied to a real-life
application: flooding predictions in the Mille \^Iles river in the Montreal,
Quebec, Canada metropolitan area. Our setup involves a set of input parameters,
with a potentially noisy distribution, and accumulates the simulation data
resulting from these parameters. The goal is to build a non-intrusive surrogate
model that is able to know when it does not know, which is still an open
research area in Neural Networks (and in AI in general). With the help of this
model, probabilistic flooding maps are generated, aware of the model
uncertainty. These insights on the unknown are also utilized for an uncertainty
propagation task, allowing for flooded area predictions that are broader and
safer than those made with a regular uncertainty-uninformed surrogate model.
Our study of the time-dependent and highly nonlinear case of a dam break is
also presented. Both the ensembles and the Bayesian approach lead to reliable
results for multiple smooth physical solutions, providing the correct warning
when going out-of-distribution. However, the former, referred to as POD-EnsNN,
proved much easier to implement and showed greater flexibility than the latter
in the case of discontinuities, where standard algorithms may oscillate or fail
to converge.

further benefit patient well-being by sustaining the development of health
informatics and medical research. Vast potential is unexploited because of the
fiercely private nature of patient-related data and regulations to protect it.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently emerged as a
groundbreaking way to learn generative models that produce realistic synthetic
data. They have revolutionized practices in multiple domains such as
self-driving cars, fraud detection, digital twin simulations in industrial
sectors, and medical imaging.
  The digital twin concept could readily apply to modelling and quantifying
disease progression. In addition, GANs posses many capabilities relevant to
common problems in healthcare: lack of data, class imbalance, rare diseases,
and preserving privacy. Unlocking open access to privacy-preserving OHD could
be transformative for scientific research. In the midst of COVID-19, the
healthcare system is facing unprecedented challenges, many of which of are data
related for the reasons stated above.
  Considering these facts, publications concerning GAN applied to OHD seemed to
be severely lacking. To uncover the reasons for this slow adoption, we broadly
reviewed the published literature on the subject. Our findings show that the
properties of OHD were initially challenging for the existing GAN algorithms
(unlike medical imaging, for which state-of-the-art model were directly
transferable) and the evaluation synthetic data lacked clear metrics.
  We find more publications on the subject than expected, starting slowly in
2017, and since then at an increasing rate. The difficulties of OHD remain, and
we discuss issues relating to evaluation, consistency, benchmarking, data
modelling, and reproducibility.

scientific collaboration patterns in the Institute for Operations Research and
the Management Sciences (INFORMS), a professional society with sixteen
peer-reviewed journals. Using their publication data from 1952 to 2016, we
constructed a large temporal bipartite network between authors and

characterized differences in several basic statistics of this network over
time, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical
events. We find a steady increase in participation by women (e.g., fraction of
authorships by women and of new women authors) starting around 1980. However,
women still comprise less than 25% of the INFORMS society and an even smaller
fraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe a methodology
for quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the
overall connectivity of the network, using it to measure subtle differences
between authorships by women and by men. Specifically, as measures of
structural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and
contraction importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network.
As a null model, we propose a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network

differences between the collaboration patterns of men and women that cannot be

large cluster states with a two-dimensional topology that are suitable for
universal quantum computing and quantum simulation can be readily generated in
a deterministic manner, and routes towards fault-tolerance via bosonic quantum
error-correction are known. In this article we propose a complete
measurement-based quantum computing architecture for the implementation of a
universal set of gates on the recently generated two-dimensional cluster states
[1,2]. We analyze the performance of the various quantum gates that are
executed in these cluster states as well as in other two-dimensional cluster
states (the bilayer-square lattice and quad-rail lattice cluster states [3,4])
by estimating and minimizing the associated stochastic noise addition as well
as the resulting gate error probability. We compare the four different states
and find that, although they all allow for universal computation, the quad-rail
lattice cluster state performs better than the other three states which all
exhibit similar performance.

fermions, making it plausible the existence of three Higgs doublets. We
introduce a Trinity Principle (TP) which, given the fact that there are no
massless quarks, requires the existence of a minimum of three Higgs doublets.
The TP states that each line of the mass matrix of a quark of a given charge
should receive the contribution from one and only one scalar doublet and
furthermore a given scalar doublet should contribute to one and only one line
of the mass matrix of a quark of a given charge. This principle is analogous to
the Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) of Glashow and Weinberg with the key
distinction that NFC required the introduction of a flavour blind symmetry,
while the TP requires a flavoured symmetry, to be implemented in a natural way.
We provide two examples which satisfy the Trinity Principle based on
$\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2'$ flavoured symmetries, and
show that they are the minimal multi-Higgs extensions of the Standard Model
where CP can be imposed as a symmetry of the full Lagrangian and broken by the
vacuum, without requiring soft-breaking terms. We show that the vacuum phases
are sufficient to generate a complex CKM matrix, in agreement with experiment.
The above mentioned flavoured symmetries lead to a strong reduction in the
number of parameters in the Yukawa interactions, enabling a control of the
Scalar Flavour Changing Neutral Couplings (SFCNC). We analyse some of the other
physical implications of the two models, including an estimate of the
enhancement of the Baryon Asymmetry of the Universe provided by the new sources

problem for deep learning from the perspective of both cognition and security.
The current most successful defense method is to train a classifier using
adversarial images created during learning. Another defense approach involves
transformation or purification of the original input to remove adversarial
signals before the image is classified. We focus on defending naturally-trained
classifiers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with an Energy-Based
Model (EBM) for adversarial purification. In contrast to adversarial training,
our approach is intended to secure pre-existing and highly vulnerable
classifiers.
  The memoryless behavior of long-run MCMC sampling will eventually remove
adversarial signals, while metastable behavior preserves consistent appearance
of MCMC samples after many steps to allow accurate long-run prediction.
Balancing these factors can lead to effective purification and robust
classification. We evaluate adversarial defense with an EBM using the strongest
known attacks against purification. Our contributions are 1) an improved method
for training EBM's with realistic long-run MCMC samples, 2) an
Expectation-Over-Transformation (EOT) defense that resolves theoretical
ambiguities for stochastic defenses and from which the EOT attack naturally
follows, and 3) state-of-the-art adversarial defense for naturally-trained

potential games (SPGs) for which the (Markov perfect) Nash equilibrium can be
computed tractably and in polynomial time. Unlike SGs for which, in general,
computing the NE is PSPACE-hard, we show that SGs with the potential property

provide algorithms that tractably compute the MP-NE for SGs with more than two

emerges. In this paper we show that the number of single-qubit rotations in
parameterized quantum circuits can be decreased without compromising the
relative expressibility or entangling capability of the circuit. We also show
that the performance of a variational quantum eigensolver is unaffected by a
similar decrease in single-qubit rotations. We compare relative expressibility
and entangling capability across different number of qubits in parameterized
quantum circuits. High-dimensional qudits as a platform for hybrid quantum
classical algorithms is a rarity in the literature. Therefore we consider
quantum frequency comb photonics as a platform for such algorithms and show
that we can obtain an relative expressibility and entangling capability
comparable to the best regular parameterized quantum circuits.

Searches by Super-Kamiokande have resulted in stringent limits on the GUT
symmetry breaking scale. The large-scale multipurpose neutrino experiments
DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande and JUNO will either discover proton decay or further
push the symmetry breaking scale above $10^{16}$ GeV. Another possible
observational consequence of GUTs is the formation of a cosmic string network
produced during the breaking of the GUT to the Standard Model gauge group. The
evolution of such a string network in the expanding Universe produces a
stochastic background of gravitational waves which will be tested by a number
of gravitational wave detectors over a wide frequency range. We demonstrate the
non-trivial complementarity between the observation of proton decay and
gravitational waves produced from cosmic strings in determining $SO(10)$ GUT
breaking chains. We show that such observations could exclude $SO(10)$ breaking
via flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ or standard $SU(5)$, while breaking via a
Pati-Salam intermediate symmetry, or standard $SU(5)\times U(1)$, may be
favoured if a large separation of energy scales associated with proton decay
and cosmic strings is indicated. We note that recent results by the NANOGrav
experiment have been interpreted as evidence for cosmic strings at a scale
$\sim 10^{14}$ GeV. This would strongly point towards the existence of GUTs,
with $SO(10)$ being the prime candidate. We show that the combination with
already available constraints from proton decay allows to identify preferred
symmetry breaking routes to the Standard Model.

study the correlations between the mass of the supermassive Black Hole (MBH)
and the properties of their active host galaxies is instrumental resolution.
Strong lensing magnification effectively increases instrumental resolution and
thus helps to address this challenge. In this work, we study eight strongly
lensed active galactic nuclei (AGN) with deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging,
using the lens modelling code Lenstronomy to reconstruct the image of the
source. Using the reconstructed brightness of the host galaxy, we infer the
host galaxy stellar mass based on stellar population models. MBH are estimated
from broad emission lines using standard methods. Our results are in good
agreement with recent work based on non-lensed AGN, demonstrating the potential
of using strongly lensed AGNs to extend the study of the correlations to higher
redshifts. At the moment, the sample size of lensed AGN is small and thus they
provide mostly a consistency check on systematic errors related to resolution
for the non-lensed AGN. However, the number of known lensed AGN is expected to
increase dramatically in the next few years, through dedicated searches in
ground and space based wide field surveys, and they may become a key diagnostic
of black hole and galaxy co-evolution.

imperative to do a detailed parameter estimation analysis to determine the

the out-of-equilibrium and the long range quantum entanglement phenomena of
open quantum system. Quantum Metrology, compared to classical parameter
estimation theory, plays a two-fold superior role, improving the precision and
accuracy of parameter estimation. Additionally, in this paper we present a new
avenue in terms of Quantum Metrology, which beats the classical parameter
estimation. We also present an interesting result of revival of
out-of-equilibrium feature at the late time scales, arising due to the long
range quantum entanglement at early time scale and provide a physical

thermal equilibrium with a surrounding spin bath, are pervasive in solid-state
systems. We explain the ubiquity of dark states in a large class of
inhomogenous central spin models using the proximity to integrable lines with
exact dark eigenstates. At numerically accessible sizes, dark states persist as
eigenstates at large deviations from integrability, and the qubit retains
memory of its initial polarization at long times. Although the eigenstates of
the system are chaotic, exhibiting exponential sensitivity to small
perturbations, they do not satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.
Rather, we predict long relaxation times that increase exponentially with
system size. We propose that this intermediate chaotic but non-ergodic regime
characterizes mesoscopic quantum dot and diamond defect systems, as we see no
numerical tendency towards conventional thermalization with a finite relaxation
time.

  transition",,,,,"cond-mat.dis-nn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An interacting quantum system can transition from an ergodic to a many-body
localized (MBL) phase under the presence of sufficiently large disorder. Both
phases are radically different in their dynamical properties, which are
characterized by highly excited eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Each eigenstate
can be characterized by the set of quantum numbers over the set of (local, in
the MBL phase) integrals of motion of the system. In this work we study the
evolution of the eigenstates of the disordered Heisenberg model as the disorder
strength, $W$, is varied adiabatically. We focus on the probability that two
`colliding' eigenstates hybridize as a function of both the range $R$ at which
they differ as well as the strength of their hybridization. We find, in the MBL
phase, that the probability of a colliding eigenstate hybridizing strongly at
range $R$ decays as $Pr(R)\propto \exp [-R/\eta]$, with a length scale $\eta(W)
= 1 / (B \log(W / W_c) )$ which diverges at the critical disorder strength
$W_c$. This leads to range-invariance at the transition, suggesting the
formation of resonating cat states at all ranges. This range invariance does
not survive to the ergodic phase, where hybridization is exponentially more
likely at large range, a fact that can be understood with simple combinatorial
arguments. In fact, compensating for these combinatorial effects allows us to
define an additional correlation length $\xi$ in the MBL phase which is in
excellent agreement with previous works and which takes the critical value $1 /
\log(2)$ at the transition, found in previous works to destabilize the MBL
phase. Finally, we show that deep in the MBL phase hybridization is dominated
by two-level collisions of eigenstates close in energy.

electron-positron collisions at the energy corresponding to the $\Upsilon(4S)$
resonance collected with the Belle II detector at the SuperKEKB collider. We
use simulation to devise optimized event selections and apply them to the full
data set collected in 2019, corresponding to 8.7\,fb$^{-1}$ of integrated
luminosity. We fit the difference between half of the collision energy and the
$B$ candidate energy (in the $\Upsilon(4S)$ frame) for events restricted to a
signal-rich range in beam-energy-constrained mass to search for charmless
signals. Signal yields of approximately 80, 15, 20, 30, 90, and 160 decays are
reconstructed for the channels $B^0 \to K^+\pi^-$, $B^0 \to \pi^+\pi^-$, $B^+
\to K^0_S(\to \pi^+\pi^-)\pi^+$, $B^+ \to K^+\pi^0(\to \gamma\gamma)$, $B^+ \to
K^+K^-K^+$, and $B^+ \to K^+\pi^-\pi^+$, respectively. Yields and background
contaminations are compatible with those expected from simulation and
comparable with those obtained by the Belle experiment. The results show a good
understanding of the detector performance and offer a reliable basis to assess
projections for future reach.

Pan-Planets transit survey was the detection of such planets and a statistical
characterization of their frequency. Here, we announce the discovery and
validation of two planets found in that survey, Wendelstein-1b and
Wendelstein-2b, which are two short-period hot Jupiters that orbit late K host
stars. We validated them both by the traditional method of radial velocity

24000$ Angstr\""om and performed a simultaneous multiband transit fit and
additionally determined their thermal emission via secondary eclipse

$1.0314_{-0.0061}^{+0.0061}$ $R_J$ and mass of $0.592_{-0.129}^{+0.165}$ $M_J$,
orbiting a K7V dwarf star at a period of $2.66$ d, and has an estimated surface

$1.75$ d, and has an estimated surface temperature of about
$1852_{-140}^{+120}$ K. With this, we demonstrate that multiband photometry is
an effective way of validating transiting exoplanets, in particular for fainter
targets since radial velocity (RV) follow-up becomes more and more costly for
those targets.

planetary surfaces. Several exoplanetary systems are known to host inner and
outer belts, analogues of the main asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt. We study
the possibility that exominor bodies and exodust deliver volatiles and
refractories to the exoplanets in the system HR8799 by performing N-body
simulations. The model consists of the host star, four giant planets (HR8799 e,
d, c, and b), 650000 test particles representing the inner belt, and 1450000
test particles representing the outer belt. Moreover we modelled dust
populations that originate from both belts. Within a million years, the two
belts evolve towards the expected dynamical structure (also derived in other
works), where mean-motion resonances with the planets carve the analogues of
Kirkwood gaps. We find that, after this point, the planets suffer impacts by
objects from the inner and outer belt at rates that are essentially constant
with time, while dust populations do not contribute significantly to the
delivery process. We convert the impact rates to volatile and refractory
delivery rates using our best estimates of the total mass contained in the
belts and their volatile and refractory content. Over their lifetime, the four
giant planets receive between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}M_\bigoplus$ of material
from both belts. The total amount of delivered volatiles and refractories,
${5\times10^{-3}\textrm{M}_\bigoplus}$, is small compared to the total mass of
the planets, $11\times10^{3}\textrm{M}_\bigoplus$. However, if the planets were
formed to be volatile-rich, their exogenous enrichment in refractory material
may well be significant and observable, for example with JWST-MIRI. If
terrestrial planets exist within the snow line of the system, volatile delivery
would be an important astrobiological mechanism and may be observable as
atmospheric trace gases.

modeling redshift-space two-point correlation functions. These correlation

carefully accounting for the redshift-space distortion, the Finger-of-God

CAMIRA clusters. The parameter constraints are shown to be unbiased according
to validation tests using a large set of mock catalogs constructed from N-body

pivotal redshift $z_{\mathrm{piv}} = 0.6$, the resulting normalization

$36\%$, $23\%$, and $21\%$, respectively. We find that the resulting
$A_{\mathrm{N}}$ is statistically consistent with those independently obtained
from weak-lensing magnification and from a joint analysis of shear and cluster
abundance, with a preference for a lower value at a level of
$\lesssim1.9\sigma$. This implies that the absolute mass scale of CAMIRA
clusters inferred from clustering is mildly higher than those from the

address this difficulty by designing microfluidic networks that exhibit a
nonlinear relation between applied pressure and flow rate, which can be
harnessed to switch the direction of internal flows solely by manipulating

The harnessed behavior is scalable and can be used to implement flow routing

family of random distance functions $\{D_h^\epsilon\}_{\epsilon >0}$ on the
plane obtained by integrating $e^{\xi h_\epsilon}$ along paths, where
$h_\epsilon$ for $\epsilon >0$ is a smooth mollification of the planar Gaussian
free field. Previous work by Ding-Dub\'edat-Dunlap-Falconet and Gwynne-Miller
has shown that there is a critical value $\xi_{\mathrm{crit}} > 0$ such that
for $\xi < \xi_{\mathrm{crit}}$, LFPP converges under appropriate re-scaling to
a random metric on the plane which induces the same topology as the Euclidean
metric (the so-called $\gamma$-\emph{Liouville quantum gravity metric} for
$\gamma = \gamma(\xi)\in (0,2)$).
  We show that for all $\xi > 0$, the LFPP metrics are tight with respect to
the topology on lower semicontinuous functions. For $\xi >
\xi_{\mathrm{crit}}$, every possible subsequential limit $D_h$ is a metric on
the plane which does \emph{not} induce the Euclidean topology: rather, there is
an uncountable, dense, Lebesgue measure-zero set of points $z\in\mathbb C $

expect that these subsequential limiting metrics are related to Liouville

string theory landscape for weak scale supersymmetry (SUSY). We work within a
predictive landscape wherein super-renormalizable terms scan while
renormalizable terms do not. We require stringy naturalness wherein the
likelihood of values for observables is proportional to their frequency within
a fertile patch of landscape including the MSSM as low energy effective theory
with a pocket-universe value for the weak scale nearby to its measured value in
our universe. In the string theory landscape, it is reasonable that the soft
terms enjoy a statistical power-law draw to large values, subject to the
existence of atoms as we know them (atomic principle). We argue that gaugino
masses, scalar masses and trilinear soft terms should each scan independently.
In addition, the various scalars should scan independently of each other unless
protected by some symmetry. The expected non-universality of scalar masses--
once regarded as an undesirable feature-- emerges as an asset within the
context of the string landscape picture. In models such as heterotic
compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds, where the tree-level gauge kinetic
function depends only on the dilaton, then gaugino masses may scale mildly,
while scalar masses and A-terms, which depend on all the moduli, may scale much
more strongly leading to a landscape solution to the SUSY flavor and CP
problems in spite of non-diagonal K\""ahler metrics. We present numerical
results for Higgs and sparticle mass predictions from the landscape within the
generalized mirage mediation SUSY model and discuss resulting consequences for
LHC SUSY and WIMP dark matter searches.

some server. The client set and the server one are connected to each other via
a fixed bipartite graph: the requests of client $v$ can only be sent to the
servers in its neighborhood $N(v)$. The goal is to assign every client request
so as to minimize the maximum load of the servers.
  In this setting, efficient parallel protocols are available only for dense
topolgies. In particular, a simple symmetric, non-adaptive protocol achieving
constant maximum load has been recently introduced by Becchetti et al
\cite{BCNPT18} for regular dense bipartite graphs. The parallel completion time
is $\bigO(\log n)$ and the overall work is $\bigO(n)$, w.h.p.
  Motivated by proximity constraints arising in some client-server systems, we
devise a simple variant of Becchetti et al's protocol \cite{BCNPT18} and we
analyse it over almost-regular bipartite graphs where nodes may have
neighborhoods of small size. In detail, we prove that, w.h.p., this new version
has a cost equivalent to that of Becchetti et al's protocol (in terms of
maximum load, completion time, and work complexity, respectively) on every
almost-regular bipartite graph with degree $\Omega(\log^2n)$.
  Our analysis significantly departs from that in \cite{BCNPT18} for the

  Brazil",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The present work delivers the results of a survey conducted in
Florian\'{o}polis, on the southern region of Brazil, using a digital
questionnaire which inquired about the interaction with demand management
systems (DMSs) in a smart house context. In particular, the survey addressed
the interviewees' thoughts on demand management and gathered data to enable the
design of Quality of Experience (QoE) based demand management policies. The
investigation of QoE-aware approaches is significant as it enables the DMS to
take decisions not only based on economic metrics, but also taking the
discomfort caused to the users into account. The number of responses guaranteed
a confidence level of 95\% and an error margin of 4.63\% and the content of
such responses showed favorable disposition of the interviewees on allowing
interventions of DMSs on their energy consumption habits as long as it reduces
their expenses with energy. The data concerning discomfort caused by demand
management actions on several home appliances was treated using clustering
techniques and different typical user profiles were leveraged, represented by
the centroid of each cluster. Those profiles can be used to deploy QoE-aware
DMSs tailored for the local reality, which seems as a promising business model
as smart houses become a reality.

is tied to fundamental aspects of quantum many-body systems. The dynamics of
entanglement has recently been studied in the context of measurement-induced
entanglement transitions, where the steady-state entanglement collapses from a
volume-law to an area-law at a critical measurement probability $p_{c}$.
Interestingly, there is a distinction in the value of $p_{c}$ depending on how
well the underlying unitary dynamics scramble quantum information. For strongly
chaotic systems, $p_{c} > 0$, whereas for weakly chaotic systems, such as
integrable models, $p_{c} = 0$. In this work, we investigate these
measurement-induced entanglement transitions in a system where the underlying
unitary dynamics are many-body localized (MBL). We demonstrate that the
emergent integrability in an MBL system implies a qualitative difference in the
nature of the measurement-induced transition depending on the measurement
basis, with $p_{c} > 0$ when the measurement basis is scrambled and $p_{c} = 0$
when it is not. This feature is not found in Haar-random circuit models, where
all local operators are scrambled in time. When the transition occurs at $p_{c}
> 0$, we use finite-size scaling to obtain the critical exponent $\nu =
1.3(2)$, close to the value for 2+0D percolation. We also find a dynamical
critical exponent of $z = 0.98(4)$ and logarithmic scaling of the R\'{e}nyi
entropies at criticality, suggesting an underlying conformal symmetry at the
critical point. This work further demonstrates how the nature of the
measurement-induced entanglement transition depends on the scrambling nature of
the underlying unitary dynamics. This leads to further questions on the control
and simulation of entangled quantum states by measurements in open quantum
systems.

with a Laser Ranging Interferometer (LRI), which provides measurements with
lower noise compared to the KBR. The biased range of KBR and LRI needs to be
converted for gravity field recovery into an instantaneous range, i.e. the
biased Euclidean distance between the satellites' center-of-mass at the same
time. One contributor to the difference between measured and instantaneous
range arises due to the non-zero travel time of electro-magnetic waves between
the spacecraft. We revisit the calculation of the light time correction (LTC)
from first principles considering general relativistic effects and
state-of-the-art models of Earth's potential field. The novel analytical
expressions for the LTC of KBR and LRI can circumvent numerical limitations of
the classical approach. The dependency of the LTC on geopotential models and on
the parameterization is studied, and afterwards the results are compared
against the LTC provided in the official datasets of GRACE and GRACE Follow-On.
It is shown that the new approach has a significantly lower noise, well below
the instrument noise of current instruments, especially relevant for the LRI,
and even if used with kinematic orbit products. This allows calculating the LTC
accurate enough even for the next generation of gravimetric missions.

the improvement in the animation of speech-related facial movements after

18% for video-driven. After introducing dropout viewer preference for
audiovisual-driven animation increases to 74%, but decreases to 8% for
video-only.

statistical or systematic. Although statistical errors are usually dealt with
in the first years of science studies, the typical approaches are based on
performing manually repetitive observations. Here, based on data recorded with
the sensors present in many mobile devices a set of laboratory experiments to
teach error and uncertainties is proposed. The main aspects addressed are the
physical meaning of the mean value and standard deviation, and the
interpretation of histograms and distributions. Other activities focus on the
intensity of the fluctuations in different situations, such as placing the
device on a table or held in the hand in different ways and the number of
measurements in an interval centered on the mean value as a function of the
width expressed in terms of the standard deviation. As applications to every
day situations we discuss the smoothness of a road or the different positions
to take photographs both of them quantified in terms of the fluctuations
registered by the accelerometer. This kind of experiments contributes to
gaining a deep insight into modern technologies and statistical errors and,
finally, to motivate and encourage engineering and science students.

electroencephalogram (fEEG) during labor began in the early 1940s. By the
1970s, clear diagnostic and prognostic benefits from intrapartum fEEG
monitoring were reported, but until today, this monitoring technology has
remained a curiosity.
  Objectives: Our goal was to review the studies reporting the use of fEEG
including the insights from interpreting fEEG patterns in response to uterine
contractions during labor. We also used the most relevant information gathered
from clinical studies to provide recommendations for enrollment in the unique
environment of a labor and delivery unit.
  Data sources: PubMed.
  Eligibility criteria: The search strategy was: (""fetus""[MeSH Terms] OR
""fetus""[All Fields] OR ""fetal""[All Fields]) AND (""electroencephalography""[MeSH
Terms] OR ""electroencephalography""[All Fields] OR ""eeg""[All Fields]) AND
(Clinical Trial[ptyp] AND ""humans""[MeSH Terms]). Because the landscape of fEEG
research has been international, we included studies in English, French,
German, and Russian.
  Results: From 256 screened studies, 40 studies were ultimately included in
the qualitative analysis. We summarize and report features of fEEG which
clearly show its potential to act as a direct biomarker of fetal brain health
during delivery, ancillary to fetal heart rate monitoring. However, clinical
prospective studies are needed to further establish the utility of fEEG
monitoring intrapartum. We identified clinical study designs likely to succeed
in bringing this intrapartum monitoring modality to the bedside.
  Limitations: Despite 80 years of studies in clinical cohorts and animal
models, the field of research on intrapartum fEEG is still nascent and shows
great promise to augment the currently practiced electronic fetal monitoring.

applications in almost any field. While various models and datasets have shown
high accuracy inthe task of binary classification, the task of fine-grained
sentiment classification is still an area with room for significant
improvement. Analyzing the SST-5 dataset,previous work by Munikar et al. (2019)
showed that the embedding tool BERT allowed a simple model to achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy. Since that paper, several BERT alternatives have
been published, with three primary ones being AlBERT (Lan et al., 2019),
DistilBERT (Sanh et al. 2019), and RoBERTa (Liu etal. 2019). While these models
report some improvement over BERT on the popular benchmarks GLUE, SQuAD, and
RACE, they have not been applied to the fine-grained classification task. In
this paper, we examine whether the improvements hold true when applied to a
novel task, by replicating the BERT model from Munikar et al., and swapping the
embedding layer to the alternative models. Over the experiments, we found that
AlBERT suffers significantly more accuracy loss than reported on other tasks,
DistilBERT has accuracy loss similar to their reported loss on other tasks
while being the fastest model to train, and RoBERTa reaches anew
state-of-the-art accuracy for prediction on the SST-5 root level (60.2%).

capture complex exogenous variable effects. In any regression problem, it is
often of interest to learn which variables are most active. Variable activity
in BART is usually measured by counting the number of times a tree splits for
each variable. Such one-way counts have the advantage of fast computations.
Despite their convenience, one-way counts have several issues. They are
statistically unjustified, cannot distinguish between main effects and
interaction effects, and become inflated when measuring interaction effects. An
alternative method well-established in the literature is Sobol' indices, a
variance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. However, these indices
often require Monte Carlo integration, which can be computationally expensive.
This paper provides analytic expressions for Sobol' indices for BART posterior
samples. These expressions are easy to interpret and are computationally
feasible. Furthermore, we will show a fascinating connection between
first-order (main-effects) Sobol' indices and one-way counts. We also introduce
a novel ranking method, and use this to demonstrate that the proposed indices
preserve the Sobol'-based rank order of variable importance. Finally, we
compare these methods using analytic test functions and the En-ROADS climate

shared parameters between all policies, is a popular baseline method for
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, since all agents share
the same policy network, they cannot learn different policies or tasks. This
issue has been circumvented experimentally by adding an agent-specific
indicator signal to observations, which we term ""agent indication."" Agent
indication is limited, however, in that without modification it does not allow
parameter sharing to be applied to environments where the action spaces and/or
observation spaces are heterogeneous. This work formalizes the notion of agent
indication and proves that it enables convergence to optimal policies for the
first time. Next, we formally introduce methods to extend parameter sharing to
learning in heterogeneous observation and action spaces, and prove that these
methods allow for convergence to optimal policies. Finally, we experimentally
confirm that the methods we introduce function empirically, and conduct a wide
array of experiments studying the empirical efficacy of many different agent
indication schemes for graphical observation spaces.

nucleus (AGN) radiative dusty feedback. The radiation pattern originating from
the accretion disc is determined by the central black hole (BH) spin. Here we
analyse how such BH spin-induced angular dependence affects the dynamics and
energetics of the radiation pressure-driven outflows, as well as AGN
obscuration and BH accretion. In addition, we explore the effect of a spatially
varying dust-to-gas ratio on the outflow propagation. We obtain two distinct
trends for high-spin and low-spin objects, providing a direct connection
between anisotropic feedback and BH spin. In the case of maximum spin, powerful
quasi-spherical outflows can propagate on large scales, at all inclination
angles with fairly uniform energetics. In contrast, in the case of zero spin,
only weaker bipolar outflows can be driven in the polar directions. As a
result, high BH spins can efficiently clear out the obscuring gas from most
directions, whereas low BH spins can only remove dusty gas from the polar
regions, hence also determining the overall AGN obscuration geometry. Due to
such anisotropic feedback, high BH spins can prevent accretion of gas from most
directions (except in the equatorial plane), while low BH spins allow inflows
to proceed from a wider range of directions. This may have important
implications for the BH growth in the early Universe. Anisotropic radiative
dusty feedback, ruled by the BH spin, may thus play a major role in shaping AGN
evolution over cosmic time.

regime of parameters where the magnons become antibunched, i.e., where there is
a large probability for occupation of the single-magnon state. This antibunched
state is very different from magnons at thermal equilibrium and
microwave-driven coherent magnons. We further obtain the steady state
analytically and describe the magnon dynamics numerically, and ascertain the
stability of such antibunched magnons over a large window of magnetic
anisotropy, damping and temperature. This means that the antibunched magnon
state is feasible in a wide class of low-damping magnetic nanoparticles. To
detect this quantum effect, we propose to transfer the quantum information of
magnons to photons by magnon-photon coupling and then measure the correlations
of photons to retrieve the magnon correlations. Our findings may provide a
promising platform to study quantum-classical transitions and for designing a

In contrast, supervised deep learning models usually lack the ability to
extract reliable predictive rules from limited data scenarios when attempting
to classify new examples. This challenging scenario is commonly known as
few-shot learning. Few-shot learning has garnered increased attention in recent
years due to its significance for many real-world problems. Recently, new
methods relying on meta-learning paradigms combined with graph-based
structures, which model the relationship between examples, have shown promising
results on a variety of few-shot classification tasks. However, existing work
on few-shot learning is only focused on the feature embeddings produced by the
last layer of the neural network. In this work, we propose the utilization of
lower-level, supporting information, namely the feature embeddings of the
hidden neural network layers, to improve classifier accuracy. Based on a
graph-based meta-learning framework, we develop a method called Looking-Back,
where such lower-level information is used to construct additional graphs for
label propagation in limited data settings. Our experiments on two popular

large-scale optimization problems with bound constraints. PNKH-B is geared
toward situations in which function and gradient evaluations are expensive, and
the (approximate) Hessian is only available through matrix-vector products.
This is commonly the case in large-scale parameter estimation, machine
learning, and image processing. In each iteration, PNKH-B uses a low-rank
approximation of the (approximate) Hessian to determine the search direction
and construct the metric used in a projected line search. The key feature of
the metric is its consistency with the low-rank approximation of the Hessian on
the Krylov subspace. This renders PNKH-B similar to a projected variable metric
method. We present an interior point method to solve the quadratic projection
problem efficiently. Since the interior point method effectively exploits the
low-rank structure, its computational cost only scales linearly with respect to
the number of variables, and it only adds negligible computational time. We
also experiment with variants of PNKH-B that incorporate estimates of the
active set into the Hessian approximation. We prove the global convergence to a
stationary point under standard assumptions. Using three numerical experiments
motivated by parameter estimation, machine learning, and image reconstruction,
we show that the consistent use of the Hessian metric in PNKH-B leads to fast
convergence, particularly in the first few iterations. We provide our MATLAB
implementation at https://github.com/EmoryMLIP/PNKH-B.

Phase Analysis or image fitting procedures. However, HR-STEM images regularly

artefacts due to drift and scanning distortion, along with extending the field
of view. The method allows flexible tuning of the spatial resolution and
decouples the choice of field of view from the need for local atomic
resolution. It consists of the acquisition of a series of independent small
subimages containing an atomic resolution image of the local lattice. All
subimages are then analysed individually for strain by fitting a nonlinear
model to the lattice images. The obtained experimental strain maps are
quantitatively benchmarked against the Bessel diffraction technique. We
demonstrate that the proposed scanning strategy approaches the performance of
the diffraction technique while having the advantage that it does not require

Chern number. The conventional calculation of this invariant in interacting
systems requires a family of many-body wave functions parameterized by twist
angles in order to calculate the Berry curvature. In this paper, we demonstrate
how to extract the Chern number given a single many-body wave function, without
knowledge of the Hamiltonian. For FQH states, our method requires one
additional integer invariant as input: the number of $2\pi$ flux quanta, $s$,
that must be inserted to obtain a topologically trivial excitation. As we
discuss, $s$ can be obtained in principle from the degenerate set of ground
state wave functions on the torus, without knowledge of the Hamiltonian. We
perform extensive numerical simulations involving IQH and FQH states to
validate these methods.

normal strain, and shear strain qualitatively representative of turbulent
combustion at the small scales are analyzed. A mixing layer is subjected to
counterflow in the transverse y- and z-directions. Both non-reactive and
reactive flows are examined. Reduction of the three-dimensional boundary-layer
equations to a one-dimensional similar form is obtained allowing for heat and
mass diffusion with variations in density and properties. In steady
configurations, a set of ODEs governs the three velocity components as well as
the scalar-field variables. A flamelet model for individual diffusion flames
with combined shear and normal strain is developed. Another model with solution
in similar form is obtained for a configuration with a dominant diffusion flame
and a weaker fuel-rich premixed flame. Results for the velocity and scalar
fields are found for ranges of Damkohler number Da, normal strain rate due to
the counterflow, streamwise-velocity ratio across the mixing layer, Prandtl
number, and Mach number. For the flamelet model, a conserved scalar is cast as
the independent variable to give an alternative description of the results. The
imposed normal strain decreases mixing-layer thickness and increases scalar
gradients and transport rates. There is indication of diffusion control for
partially premixed flames in the multi-branched flame situation. The
enhancement of the mixing and combustion rates by imposed normal strain on a
shear layer can be very substantial. Also, the imposition of shear strain and
thereby vorticity on the counterflow can be substantial indicating the need for
flamelet models with both shear strain and normal strain.

definition of Fock states. Despite the hashing function unambiguously relates
the configuration to the coefficient index of the many-particle state expansion

highly demanding computation, especially when they are embedded in a
time-dependent problem. Therefore, improvements in the conversion between
configurations after the action of creation and annihilation operators are
thoroughly inspected, highlighting the advantages and additional memory
consumption. We also exploit massive parallel processors from graphics
processor units with CUDA to improve a routine to act with the many-body
Hamiltonian matrix on the spanned multiconfigurational space, which
demonstrated quantitatively the scalability of the problem. The improvements
shown here seem promising especially for calculations involving a large number

performance gain of roughly fifty times faster than a single core processor.
The codes were consistently tested with an application to the Lieb-Liniger gas,
evaluating the ground state and comparing with the analytical solution.

qualitative features of interband optical transitions. For gapless linear
dispersion in three dimension, the imaginary part of the linear conductivity
diverges as a logarithmic function of the cutoff energy, while the real part is
linear with photon frequency $\omega$ as $\hbar\omega>2|\mu|$. The third order
conductivity exhibits features very similar to those of two dimensional Dirac
fermions, i.e., graphene, but with the amplitude for a single Dirac cone
generally two orders of magnitude smaller in three dimension than in two

induced gap parameters, and divergences associated with the intraband
transitions. The details of the third order conductivity are discussed for

SMBH mass ($M_{BH}$) and also the total mass-to-light ratio [$(M/L)_{TOT}$] and

Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) observations and also photometric data from
the Hubble Space Telescope Legacy Archive of the galaxy NGC 4546 in order to
determine its SMBH mass. To do this, we applied the Jeans Anisotropic Modelling
(JAM) method to fit the average second velocity moment in the line of sight
$(\overline{v^2_{los}})$ of the stellar structure. In addition, we also
obtained $(M/L)_{TOT}$ and the classical anisotropy parameter
$\beta_z$=1--($\sigma_z$/$\sigma_R$)$^2$ for this object within a field of view

velocity dispersion were built for this galaxy using the penalized pixel
fitting ({\sc ppxf}) technique. We applied the Multi Gaussian Expansion

best-fitting model for $\overline{v^2_{los}}$ of the stellar structure was
obtained with $(M/L)_{TOT}$ = 4.34$\pm$0.07 (Johnson's R band), $M_{BH}$ =
(2.56$\pm$0.16)$\times$10$^8$ M$_\odot$ and $\beta_z$ = --0.015$\pm$0.03

where the goal is to infer if a sample has been used in the training process.
Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision,
and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of
these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member
class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been
reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate
or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the
attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member)
ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is
particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the
majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class.
Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the
membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only
constitute a very small portion of training samples.
  We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored
for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary
and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models' responses are mostly similar
among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image
classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using
various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that
the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low
FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.

localization methods that do not rely on the perception and recognition of

lighting conditions, or other extreme environmental conditions that may hinder
exteroceptive sensors such as a camera or a laser ranger finder. These methods
depend on proprioceptive sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs)

rudimentary estimation of vehicle trajectory which is used to query a prior
known map to obtain location. Named as graph-based proprioceptive localization
(GBPL), we provide a low cost fallback solution for localization under
challenging environmental conditions. As a robot/vehicle travels, we extract a
sequence of heading-length values for straight segments from the trajectory and
match the sequence with a pre-processed heading-length graph (HLG) abstracted
from the prior known map to localize the robot under a graph-matching approach.
Using the information from HLG, our location alignment and verification module
compensates for trajectory drift, wheel slip, or tire inflation level. We have
implemented our algorithm and tested it in both simulated and physical

essential in defining the corresponding resection/irradiating regions for the
downstream workflows of surgical resection and radiotherapy of various cancers.
For patients who are treated with radiotherapy, this task is performed by
experienced radiation oncologists that involves high-level reasoning on whether
LNs are metastasized, which is subject to high inter-observer variations. In
this work, we propose a divide-and-conquer decision stratification approach
that divides OSLNs into tumor-proximal and tumor-distal categories. This is
motivated by the observation that each category has its own different
underlying distributions in appearance, size and other characteristics. Two
separate detection-by-segmentation networks are trained per category and fused.
To further reduce false positives (FP), we present a novel global-local network
(GLNet) that combines high-level lesion characteristics with features learned

achieve capacity with efficient encoding and decoding for a wide range of
channels. However, its performance at short block lengths is far from optimal.
Arikan has recently presented a new polar coding scheme, which he called
polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes. Such PAC codes provide
dramatic improvement in performance as compared to both standard
successive-cancellation decoding as well as CRC-aided list decoding. Arikan's
PAC codes are based primarily upon the following ideas: replacing CRC precoding
with convolutional precoding (under appropriate rate profiling) and replacing
list decoding by sequential decoding. His simulations show that PAC codes,
resulting from the combination of these ideas, are close to finite-length
bounds on the performance of any code under ML decoding.
  One of our main goals in this paper is to answer the following question: is
sequential decoding essential for the superior performance of PAC codes? We
show that similar performance can be achieved using list decoding when the list
size $L$ is moderately large (say, $L \ge 128$). List decoding has distinct
advantages over sequential decoding is certain scenarios, such as low-SNR
regimes or situations where the worst-case complexity/latency is the primary
constraint. Another objective is to provide some insights into the remarkable
performance of PAC codes. We first observe that both sequential decoding and
list decoding of PAC codes closely match ML decoding thereof. We then estimate
the number of low weight codewords in PAC codes, using these estimates to

  Obfuscation Techniques",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are well-known to be vulnerable to Adversarial
Examples (AEs). A large amount of efforts have been spent to launch and heat
the arms race between the attackers and defenders. Recently, advanced
gradient-based attack techniques were proposed (e.g., BPDA and EOT), which have
defeated a considerable number of existing defense methods. Up to today, there
are still no satisfactory solutions that can effectively and efficiently defend
against those attacks.
  In this paper, we make a steady step towards mitigating those advanced
gradient-based attacks with two major contributions. First, we perform an
in-depth analysis about the root causes of those attacks, and propose four
properties that can break the fundamental assumptions of those attacks. Second,
we identify a set of operations that can meet those properties. By integrating
these operations, we design two preprocessing functions that can invalidate
these powerful attacks. Extensive evaluations indicate that our solutions can
effectively mitigate all existing standard and advanced attack techniques, and
beat 11 state-of-the-art defense solutions published in top-tier conferences
over the past 2 years. The defender can employ our solutions to constrain the
attack success rate below 7% for the strongest attacks even the adversary has
spent dozens of GPU hours.

only consider this problem in the context of large-scale classifier training,
we seek a unified solution for this and the low-shot classification setting. It
is argued that the classic softmax classifier is a poor solution for open-set
recognition, since it tends to overfit on the training classes. Randomization
is then proposed as a solution to this problem. This suggests the use of
meta-learning techniques, commonly used for few-shot classification, for the
solution of open-set recognition. A new oPen sEt mEta LEaRning (PEELER)
algorithm is then introduced. This combines the random selection of a set of
novel classes per episode, a loss that maximizes the posterior entropy for
examples of those classes, and a new metric learning formulation based on the
Mahalanobis distance. Experimental results show that PEELER achieves state of

ad-hoc policy measures, such as lockdowns and mass quarantines, to slow its
transmission. However, the consequences of widespread use of these
unprecedented measures are poorly understood. To contribute to the
understanding of the economic and human consequences of such policy measures,
we therefore construct a mathematical model of an economy under the impact of a
pandemic, select parameter values to represent the global economy under the
impact of COVID-19, and perform numerical experiments by simulating a large
number of possible policy responses. By varying the starting date of the policy
intervention in the simulated scenarios, we find that the most effective policy
intervention occurs around the time when the number of active infections is
growing at its highest rate -- that is, the results suggest that the most
severe measures should only be implemented when the disease is sufficiently
spread. The intensity of the intervention, above a certain threshold, does not
appear to have a great impact on the outcomes in our simulations, due to the
strongly concave relationship that we identify between production shortfall and
infection rate reductions. Our experiments further suggest that the
intervention should last until after the peak established by the reduced
infection rate, which implies that stricter policies should last longer. The
model and its implementation, along with the general insights from our policy
experiments, may help policymakers design effective emergency policy responses
in the face of a serious pandemic, and contribute to our understanding of the
relationship between the economic growth and the spread of infectious diseases.

solutions of the multidimensional compressible Euler equations with large
initial data of positive far-field density. The central feature of the
solutions is the strengthening of waves as they move radially inward toward the
origin. Various examples have shown that the spherically symmetric solutions of
the Euler equations blow up near the origin at certain time. A fundamental
unsolved problem is whether the density of the global solution would form
concentration to become a measure near the origin for the case when the total
initial-energy is unbounded and the wave propagation is not at a finite speed
starting initially. In this paper, we establish a global existence theory for
spherically symmetric solutions of the compressible Euler equations with large
initial data of positive far-field density and relative finite-energy. This is
achieved by developing a new approach via adapting a class of degenerate
density-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the vanishing
viscosity limit of global weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with
the density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solution of
the Euler equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry and positive
far-field density can be obtained. One of our main observations is that the
adapted class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms not only includes
the viscosity terms for the Navier-Stokes equations for shallow water (Saint
Venant) flows but also, more importantly, is suitable to achieve our key
objective of this paper. These results indicate that concentration is not
formed in the vanishing viscosity limit for the Navier-Stokes approximations

bound, where lower bounds are replaced by a relaxed notion of quasi-lower
bounds, required to be lower bounds only for sub-cubes containing a minimizer.
This paper is devoted to studying the possible benefits of this approach, for
the problem of minimizing a smooth function over a cube. This is accomplished
by suggesting two quasi branch and bound algorithms, qBnB(2) and qBnB(3), that
compare favorably with alternative branch and bound algorithms.
  The first algorithm we propose, qBnB(2), achieves second order convergence
based only on a bound on second derivatives, without requiring calculation of
derivatives. As such, this algorithm is suitable for derivative free
optimization, for which typical algorithms such as Lipschitz optimization only
have first order convergence and so suffer from limited accuracy due to the
clustering problem. Additionally, qBnB(2) is provably more efficient than the
second order Lipschitz gradient algorithm which does require exact calculation
of gradients.
  The second algorithm we propose, qBnB(3), has third order convergence and
finite termination. In contrast with BnB algorithms with similar guarantees who
typically compute lower bounds via solving relatively time consuming convex
optimization problems, calculation of qBnB(3) bounds only requires solving a
small number of Newton iterations. Our experiments verify the potential of both
these methods in comparison with state of the art branch and bound algorithms.

Multi-Cycle Input Dependency (MCID) circuit model which is a novel model
representation of design to explicitly capture the dependency of primary

the proposed circuit model and several structural checking modules, the process
of verification can be independent of the underlying technology and signaling.

an integrated approach to analyze and design the cyber security system for a

The cyber system is then analyzed using network and data flow models to develop
the attack scenarios that may lead to the identified hazards. Finally, the
attack scenarios are performed on the testbed and observations are obtained on
the possible ways to prevent and mitigate the attacks. The insights gained from
the experiments result in several key findings, including the expressive power

servers, each with limited capacity on multiple resources (CPU, memory, disk,

of resources for the duration of their service. When a job arrives, the system
must decide whether to admit it or reject it, and if admitted, in which server
to schedule the job. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward
received by the system. This problem is motivated by control of cloud computing
clusters, in which, jobs are requests for Virtual Machines or Containers that
reserve resources for various services, and rewards represent service priority
of requests or price paid per time unit of service by clients. We study this
problem in an asymptotic regime where the number of servers and jobs' arrival
rates scale by a factor $L$, as $L$ becomes large. We propose a resource
reservation policy that asymptotically achieves at least $1/2$, and under
certain monotone property on jobs' rewards and resources, at least $1-1/e$ of
the optimal expected reward. The policy automatically scales the number of VM
slots for each job type as the demand changes, and decides in which servers the
slots should be created in advance, without the knowledge of traffic rates. It
effectively tracks a low-complexity greedy packing of existing jobs in the

reserved VM slots for high priority jobs that pack well.

pollution exposure and health risks, the traditional way is to utilize data

area by government agencies. Data from such sensing system is very sparse and
cannot reflect real personal exposure. In recent years, several research groups
have developed participatory air pollution sensing systems which use wearable
or portable units coupled with smartphones to crowd-source urban air pollution
data. These systems have shown remarkable improvement in spatial granularity
over government-operated fixed monitoring systems. In this paper, we extend the
paradigm to HazeDose system, which can personalize the individuals' air
pollution exposure. Specifically, we combine the pollution concentrations
obtained from an air pollution estimation system with the activity data from
the individual's on-body activity monitors to estimate the personal inhalation
dosage of air pollution. Users can visualize their personalized air pollution
exposure information via a mobile application. We show that different
activities, such as walking, cycling, or driving, impact their dosage, and
commuting patterns contribute to a significant proportion of an individual's
daily air pollution dosage. Moreover, we propose a dosage minimization
algorithm, with the trial results showing that up to 14.1% of a biker's daily
exposure can be reduced while using alternative routes the driver can inhale
25.9% less than usual. One heuristic algorithm is also introduced to balance
the execution time and dosage reduction for alternative routes scenarios. The
results show that up to 20.3% dosage reduction can be achieved when the
execution time is almost one seventieth of the original one.

proposed convex surrogates for the adversarial 0-1 loss, in an effort to make

of calibration, which is a pointwise notion of consistency. We show that no
convex surrogate loss is calibrated with respect to the adversarial 0-1 loss

manual control in a target reaching experiment for the two steering axes. The
results indicated different hysteresis curves for the left-right and up-down

measure on the group with the property that the sequence of its convolution
powers is asymptotically invariant. In the present article we extend this
characterization of amenability to measured groupoids. It implies, in
particular, that the amenability of a measure class preserving group action is
equivalent to the existence of a random environment on the group parameterized
by the action space, and such that the tail of the random walk in almost every
environment is trivial.

  Labeled Datasets",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lesion detection is an important problem within medical imaging analysis.
Most previous work focuses on detecting and segmenting a specialized category
of lesions (e.g., lung nodules). However, in clinical practice, radiologists
are responsible for finding all possible types of anomalies. The task of
universal lesion detection (ULD) was proposed to address this challenge by
detecting a large variety of lesions from the whole body. There are multiple
heterogeneously labeled datasets with varying label completeness: DeepLesion,
the largest dataset of 32,735 annotated lesions of various types, but with even
more missing annotation instances; and several fully-labeled single-type lesion
datasets, such as LUNA for lung nodules and LiTS for liver tumors. In this
work, we propose a novel framework to leverage all these datasets together to
improve the performance of ULD. First, we learn a multi-head multi-task lesion
detector using all datasets and generate lesion proposals on DeepLesion.
Second, missing annotations in DeepLesion are retrieved by a new method of
embedding matching that exploits clinical prior knowledge. Last, we discover
suspicious but unannotated lesions using knowledge transfer from single-type
lesion detectors. In this way, reliable positive and negative regions are
obtained from partially-labeled and unlabeled images, which are effectively
utilized to train ULD. To assess the clinically realistic protocol of 3D
volumetric ULD, we fully annotated 1071 CT sub-volumes in DeepLesion. Our
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach by 29% in the metric
of average sensitivity.

spreading of infectious diseases. Contact tracing is usually performed manually
by authorized personnel. Manual contact tracing is an inefficient, error-prone,
time-consuming process of limited utility to the population at large as those
in close contact with infected individuals are informed hours, if not days,
later. This paper introduces an alternative way to manual contact tracing. The
proposed Smart Contact Tracing (SCT) system utilizes the smartphone's Bluetooth
Low Energy (BLE) signals and machine learning classifier to accurately and
quickly determined the contact profile. SCT's contribution is two-fold: a)
classification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity
sensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications
protocol. SCT leverages BLE's non-connectable advertising feature to broadcast
a signature packet when the user is in the public space. Both broadcasted and
observed signatures are stored in the user's smartphone and they are only
uploaded to a secure signature database when a user is confirmed by public
health authorities to be infected. Using received signal strength (RSS) each
smartphone estimates its distance from other user's phones and issues real-time
alerts when social distancing rules are violated. The paper includes extensive
experimentation utilizing real-life smartphone positions and a comparative
evaluation of five machine learning classifiers. Reported results indicate that
a decision tree classifier outperforms other states of the art classification
methods in terms of accuracy. Lastly, to facilitate research in this area, and
to contribute to the timely development of advanced solutions the entire data

bin-picking of mechanical parts by a robot manipulator. We extend the
single-shot approach to stereo vision by application of attention architecture.
Our convolutional neural network model regresses to object locations and
rotations from either a left image or a right image without depth information.
Then, a stereo feature matching module, designated as Stereo Grid Attention,
generates stereo grid matching maps. The important point of our method is only
to calculate disparity of the objects found by the attention from stereo
images, instead of calculating a point cloud over the entire image. The
disparity value is then used to calculate the depth to the objects by the
principle of triangulation. Our method also achieves a rapid processing speed
of pose estimation by the single-shot architecture and it is possible to
process a 1024 x 1024 pixels image in 75 milliseconds on the Jetson AGX Xavier
implemented with half-float model. Weakly textured mechanical parts are used to
exemplify the method. First, we create original synthetic datasets for training
and evaluating of the proposed model. This dataset is created by capturing and
rendering numerous 3D models of several types of mechanical parts in virtual
space. Finally, we use a robotic manipulator with an electromagnetic gripper to
pick up the mechanical parts in a cluttered state to verify the validity of our
method in an actual scene. When a raw stereo image is used by the proposed
method from our stereo camera to detect black steel screws, stainless screws,

of the formation of the intra-cluster light (ICL) to study the mass
distribution of the ICL in galaxy groups and clusters, at different redshifts.
We assume the ICL to follow a NFW profile with a different concentration,
linked to that of the dark matter by the relation $c_{ICL}=\gamma c_{DM}$,
where the parameter $\gamma$ is set to reproduce the observed relation between
the stellar mass in the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and ICL in the innermost
100 kpc and the halo mass ($M^*_{100}-M_{500}$), at $z=0$. The model is then
tested against several theoretical and observational results, from the present
time to $z\sim1.5$. Our analysis shows that the fraction of stellar mass in the
BCG and ICL within the innermost 100 kpc is an increasing function of redshift,
parameter $\gamma$, and a decreasing function of the halo mass. The value of
$\gamma$ required to match the observed $M^*_{100}-M_{500}$ is $\gamma=3$ at
$z=0$, but there are hints that it might be a function of redshift and halo
mass. This result indicates that the distribution of the ICL is more
concentrated than the dark matter one, but less concentrated than previously
found by other studies. We suggest that a modified version of the NFW is a good
description of the distribution of the diffuse light in groups and clusters,
which makes the ICL a reliable tracer of the dark matter, in good agreement
with recent observational findings.

supervised end-end training of carefully tailored neural network architectures

severely challenged in terms of requiring access to expensive source level
labeled data and being specific to a given set of sources and the mixing
process, which demands complete re-training when those assumptions change. This
strongly emphasizes the need for unsupervised methods that can leverage the
recent advances in data-driven modeling, and compensate for the lack of labeled
data through meaningful priors. To this end, we propose a novel approach for
audio source separation based on generative priors trained on individual
sources. Through the use of projected gradient descent optimization, our
approach simultaneously searches in the source-specific latent spaces to
effectively recover the constituent sources. Though the generative priors can
be defined in the time domain directly, e.g. WaveGAN, we find that using
spectral domain loss functions for our optimization leads to good-quality

indistinguishable to human ears and widely are applied to produce realistic and
natural DeepFakes, exhibiting real threats to our society. However, effective
and robust detectors for synthesized fake voices are still in their infancy and
are not ready to fully tackle this emerging threat. In this paper, we devise a
novel approach, named \emph{DeepSonar}, based on monitoring neuron behaviors of
speaker recognition (SR) system, \ie, a deep neural network (DNN), to discern
AI-synthesized fake voices. Layer-wise neuron behaviors provide an important
insight to meticulously catch the differences among inputs, which are widely
employed for building safety, robust, and interpretable DNNs. In this work, we
leverage the power of layer-wise neuron activation patterns with a conjecture
that they can capture the subtle differences between real and AI-synthesized
fake voices, in providing a cleaner signal to classifiers than raw inputs.
Experiments are conducted on three datasets (including commercial products from
Google, Baidu, \etc) containing both English and Chinese languages to
corroborate the high detection rates (98.1\% average accuracy) and low false
alarm rates (about 2\% error rate) of DeepSonar in discerning fake voices.
Furthermore, extensive experimental results also demonstrate its robustness
against manipulation attacks (\eg, voice conversion and additive real-world
noises). Our work further poses a new insight into adopting neuron behaviors
for effective and robust AI aided multimedia fakes forensics as an inside-out
approach instead of being motivated and swayed by various artifacts introduced

problem, the sparsity constrained kernel SVM optimization has been considered
in this paper in order to control the number of support vectors. Based on the
established optimality conditions associated with the stationary equations, a
Newton-type method is developed to handle the sparsity constrained

if the starting point is chosen to be close to a local region of a stationary

  Since the distance computation is expensive, generic metric indexing methods

distance calls, and (iii) search using bounds for metric pruning, interval
orderings for reduction, and randomized pivoting for reporting the final

  We analyze the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods with extensive

improvement over state-of-the-art methods for exact queries, and even further

different dynamical regimes, including those of crossing trajectories and

of artificial power generation schemes based on ion gradients for portable,

inspired by the electric eel, we developed an artificial electric organ that
generated electricity from ion gradients within stacked hydrogels and, like the
eel, was optimized to deliver large voltages that exceeded 100 V. Due to its
high internal resistance, the current of this power source was, however, too
low to power standard electronics. Here we introduce an artificial electric
organ that takes inspiration from the unique morphologies of torpedo rays for
maximal current output. This power source uses a hybrid material of
hydrogel-infused paper to create, organize, and reconfigure stacks of thin,
arbitrarily large gel films both in series and in parallel. The resulting
increase in electrical power by almost two orders of magnitude compared to the

establishes that biology's mechanism of generating significant electrical power

performance of downstream tasks such as query scoping and ranking. In the
e-commerce domain, recent work in query understanding focuses on the query to
product-category mapping. But, a small yet significant percentage of queries
(in our website 1.5% or 33M queries in 2019) have non-commercial intent
associated with them. These intents are usually associated with non-commercial
information seeking needs such as discounts, store hours, installation guides,
etc. In this paper, we introduce Joint Query Intent Understanding (JointMap), a
deep learning model to simultaneously learn two different high-level user
intent tasks: 1) identifying a query's commercial vs. non-commercial intent,
and 2) associating a set of relevant product categories in taxonomy to a
product query. JointMap model works by leveraging the transfer bias that exists
between these two related tasks through a joint-learning process. As curating a
labeled data set for these tasks can be expensive and time-consuming, we
propose a distant supervision approach in conjunction with an active learning
model to generate high-quality training data sets. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of JointMap, we use search queries collected from a large
commercial website. Our results show that JointMap significantly improves both
""commercial vs. non-commercial"" intent prediction and product category mapping
by 2.3% and 10% on average over state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Our
findings suggest a promising direction to model the intent hierarchies in an
e-commerce search engine.

interactions affect an organism's phenotype and fitness. Recent theoretical and
empirical work has advanced our understanding of the role of multi-locus
interactions in speciation. However, relating different models to one another
and to empirical observations is challenging. This review focuses on
multi-locus interactions that lead to reproductive isolation (RI) through
reduced hybrid fitness. We first review theoretical approaches and show how
recent work incorporating a mechanistic understanding of multi-locus
interactions recapitulates earlier models, but also makes novel predictions
concerning the build-up of RI. These include high variance in the build-up rate
of RI among taxa, the emergence of strong incompatibilities producing localised
barriers to introgression, and an effect of population size on the build-up of
RI. We then review recent experimental approaches to detect multi-locus
interactions underlying RI using genomic data. We argue that future studies
would benefit from overlapping methods like Ancestry Disequilibrium scans,
genome scans of differentiation and analyses of hybrid gene expression.
Finally, we highlight a need for further overlap between theoretical and
empirical work, and approaches that predict what kind of patterns multi-locus

idempotents whose adjoint operators have the minimal polynomial dividing
$(x-1)x(x-\eta)$, where $\eta\not\in\{0,1\}$ is fixed, with restrictive
multiplication rules. These properties generalize the Pierce decompositions for
idempotents in Jordan algebras, where $\frac{1}{2}$ is replaced with $\eta$. In
particular, Jordan algebras generated by idempotents are axial algebras of
Jordan type $\frac{1}{2}$. If $\eta\neq\frac{1}{2}$ then it is known that axial
algebras of Jordan type $\eta$ are factors of the so-called Matsuo algebras
corresponding to 3-transposition groups.
  We call the generating idempotents {\it axes} and say that an axis is {\it
primitive} if its adjoint operator has 1-dimensional 1-eigenspace. It is known
that a subalgebra generated by two primitive axes has dimension at most three.
The 3-generated case has been opened so far. We prove that any axial algebra of
Jordan type generated by three primitive axes has dimension at most nine. If
the dimension is nine and $\eta=\frac{1}{2}$ then we either show how to find a
proper ideal in this algebra or prove that the algebra is isomorphic to certain

at the consumer side to send fine-grained power consumption readings
periodically to the system operator (SO) for load monitoring, energy
management, billing, etc. However, fraudulent consumers launch electricity
theft cyber-attacks by reporting false readings to reduce their bills
illegally. These attacks do not only cause financial losses but may also
degrade the grid performance because the readings are used for grid management.
To identify these attackers, the existing schemes employ machine-learning
models using the consumers' fine-grained readings, which violates the
consumers' privacy by revealing their lifestyle. In this paper, we propose an
efficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity theft, compute
bills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers' privacy. The idea is
that SMs encrypt their readings using functional encryption, and the SO uses
the ciphertexts to (i) compute the bills following dynamic pricing approach,
(ii) monitor the grid load, and (iii) evaluate a machine-learning model to
detect fraudulent consumers, without being able to learn the individual
readings to preserve consumers' privacy. We adapted a functional encryption
scheme so that the encrypted readings are aggregated for billing and load
monitoring and only the aggregated value is revealed to the SO. Also, we
exploited the inner-product operations on encrypted readings to evaluate a
machine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers. Real dataset is used to
evaluate our scheme, and our evaluations indicate that our scheme is secure and
can detect fraudulent consumers accurately with low communication and

Instead, we explore different methods for a personalized, contextual topic

  Application Using Deep Learning",,,,,"cs.CR eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The simultaneous charging of many electric vehicles (EVs) stresses the
distribution system and may cause grid instability in severe cases. The best
way to avoid this problem is by charging coordination. The idea is that the EVs
should report data (such as state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery) to run a
mechanism to prioritize the charging requests and select the EVs that should
charge during this time slot and defer other requests to future time slots.
However, EVs may lie and send false data to receive high charging priority
illegally. In this paper, we first study this attack to evaluate the gains of
the lying EVs and how their behavior impacts the honest EVs and the performance
of charging coordination mechanism. Our evaluations indicate that lying EVs
have a greater chance to get charged comparing to honest EVs and they degrade
the performance of the charging coordination mechanism. Then, an anomaly based
detector that is using deep neural networks (DNN) is devised to identify the
lying EVs. To do that, we first create an honest dataset for charging
coordination application using real driving traces and information revealed by
EV manufacturers, and then we also propose a number of attacks to create
malicious data. We trained and evaluated two models, which are the multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) using this dataset and the
GRU detector gives better results. Our evaluations indicate that our detector
can detect lying EVs with high accuracy and low false positive rate.

dwarf galaxies surrounding the Milky Way, under the assumption that modified
Newtonian dynamics (MOND) is the correct theory of gravity. According to their
observed shape, we model the dwarfs as axisymmetric systems, rather than
spherical systems, as usually assumed. In addition, as required by the
assumption of the MOND framework, we realistically include the external
gravitational field of the Milky Way and of the large-scale structure beyond
the Local Group. For the dwarfs where the external field dominates over the
internal gravitational field, the phantom dark matter has, from the star
distribution, an offset of ~0.1-0.2 kpc, depending on the mass-to-light ratio
adopted. This offset is a substantial fraction of the dwarf half-mass radius.
For Sculptor and Fornax, where the internal and external gravitational fields
are comparable, the phantom dark matter distribution appears disturbed with
spikes at the locations where the two fields cancel each other; these features
have little connection with the distribution of the stars within the dwarfs.
Finally, we find that the external field due to the large-scale structure
beyond the Local Group has a very minor effect. The features of the phantom
dark matter we find represent a genuine prediction of MOND, and could thus
falsify this theory of gravity in the version we adopt here if they are not
observationally confirmed.

function is not necessarily concave and the time horizon is uncertain. We
establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the optimality for general
non-concave utility function in a complete financial market. We show that the
general concavification approach of the utility function to deal with
non-concavity, while being still applicable when the time horizon is a stopping
time with respect to the financial market filtration, leads to sub-optimality
when the time horizon is independent of the financial risk, and hence can not
be directly applied. For the latter case, we suggest a recursive procedure
which is based on the dynamic programming principle. We illustrate our findings
by carrying out a multi-period numerical analysis for optimal investment
problem under a convex option compensation scheme with random time horizon. We
observe that the distribution of the non-concave portfolio in both certain and
uncertain random time horizon is right-skewed with a long right tail,
indicating that the investor expects frequent small losses and a few large
gains from the investment. While the (certain) average time horizon portfolio
at a premature stopping date is unimodal, the random time horizon portfolio is
multimodal distributed which provides the investor a certain flexibility of
switching between the local maximizers, depending on the market performance.
The multimodal structure with multiple peaks of different heights can be
explained by the concavification procedure, whereas the distribution of the
time horizon has significant impact on the amplitude between the modes.

generating QA pairs given unstructured texts as contexts, while maximizing the
mutual information between generated QA pairs to ensure their consistency. We
validate our Information Maximizing Hierarchical Conditional Variational
AutoEncoder (Info-HCVAE) on several benchmark datasets by evaluating the
performance of the QA model (BERT-base) using only the generated QA pairs
(QA-based evaluation) or by using both the generated and human-labeled pairs
(semi-supervised learning) for training, against state-of-the-art baseline
models. The results show that our model obtains impressive performance gains
over all baselines on both tasks, using only a fraction of data for training.

when users share a bounded number of cache states, and when the association

user-to-cache associations perform better than unbalanced ones, our work
provides a statistical analysis of the average performance of such networks,
identifying in closed form, the exact optimal average delivery time. To
insightfully capture this delay, we derive easy to compute closed-form
analytical bounds that prove tight in the limit of a large number $\Lambda$ of
cache states. In the scenario where delivery involves $K$ users, we conclude
that the multiplicative performance deterioration due to randomness -- as
compared to the well-known deterministic uniform case -- can be unbounded and
can scale as $\Theta\left( \frac{\log \Lambda}{\log \log \Lambda} \right)$ at
$K=\Theta\left(\Lambda\right)$, and that this scaling vanishes when
$K=\Omega\left(\Lambda\log \Lambda\right)$. To alleviate this adverse effect of
cache-load imbalance, we consider various load balancing methods, and show that
employing proximity-bounded load balancing with an ability to choose from $h$
neighboring caches, the aforementioned scaling reduces to $\Theta
\left(\frac{\log(\Lambda / h)}{ \log \log(\Lambda / h)} \right)$, while when
the proximity constraint is removed, the scaling is of a much slower order
$\Theta \left( \log \log \Lambda \right)$. The above analysis is extensively

three-dimensional topological insulator hybridized with a ferromagnet, namely,
ferromagnetic topological insulator. In order to do this, we establish the
microscopic formalism and construct the perturbation theory using a Keldysh
Green's function approach. We analyze how this electric current is generated by
an exchange interaction and an external ac magnetic field, which is the driving
force of ferromagnetic resonance as well as the spin pumping. The mechanism is
as follows. First, the ferromagnetic resonance is driven and a zero-momentum
magnon emerges. It is the fluctuation from the saturation magnetization
pointing parallel to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance. After
then, the spin pumping is generated with the zero-momentum magnon being the
carrier of spin. The zero-momentum magnon and the topological insulator surface
state couples through the exchange interaction and the spin carried by the
magnon is transferred to it. Owing to the spin-momentum locking, the
transferred spin is converted into the momentum of topological insulator
surface state leading to the generation of electric current flowing
perpendicular to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance. It is
quadratic in the amplitude of external ac magnetic field whereas it is linear
to the strength of the exchange interaction. The associated electric voltage is
described by the spectrum of zero-momentum magnon. The non-linearity of
spin-pumping-induced electric current in the ac magnetic field as well as the
linearity in the exchange-interaction strength reflects that the surface of
ferromagnetic topological insulator has a high-performing functionality of
generating the electric charge current by magnetic controlling.

Supergiant (RSG) progenitors to type II-P supernovae are significantly fainter
than RSGs in the field. This mismatch has been interpreted by several authors
as being a manifestation of the mass threshold for the production of black
holes (BHs), such that stars with initial masses above a cutoff of $M_{\rm
hi}=17$M$_\odot$ and below 25$M_\odot$ will die as RSGs, but with no visible SN
explosion as the BH is formed. However, we have previously cautioned that this
cutoff is more likely to be higher and has large uncertainties ($M_{\rm
hi}=19^{+4}_{-2}M_{\odot}$), meaning that the statistical significance of the
RSG Problem is less than $2\sigma$. Recently, Kochanek (2020) has claimed that
our work is statistically flawed, and with their analysis has argued that the
upper mass cutoff is as low as $M_{\rm hi} = 15.7 \pm 0.8M_\odot$, giving the
RSG Problem a significance of $>10\sigma$. In this letter, we show that
Kochanek's low cutoff is caused by a statistical misinterpretation, and the
associated fit to the progenitor mass spectrum can be ruled out at the 99.6\%
confidence level. Once this problem is remedied, Kochanek's best fit becomes
$M_{\rm hi} =19^{+4}_{-2}M_{\odot}$, in excellent agreement with our work.
Finally, we argue that, in the search for a RSG `vanishing' as it collapses
directly to a BH, any such survey would have to operate for decades before the
absence of any such detection became statistically significant.

unravel the microscopic degrees-of-freedom of strongly interaction matter at

region of phase coexistence and a critical endpoint. As the theory of strong
interaction is not able to make firm predictions for the structure and the
properties of matter high baryon chemical potentials, the scientific progress

experiments at FAIR and NICA, which will complement the running experimental

never have been measured before at collision energies, where the highest

classical models have been proposed, capturing long-term dependence while
responding to short-term changes remains a challenge. To this problem, we
propose a new model named Dual Recurrent Neural Networks (DuRNN). The DuRNN
consists of two parts to learn the short-term dependence and progressively
learn the long-term dependence. The first part is a recurrent neural network
with constrained full recurrent connections to deal with short-term dependence
in sequence and generate short-term memory. Another part is a recurrent neural
network with independent recurrent connections which helps to learn long-term
dependence and generate long-term memory. A selection mechanism is added
between two parts to help the needed long-term information transfer to the
independent neurons. Multiple modules can be stacked to form a multi-layer
model for better performance. Our contributions are: 1) a new recurrent model
developed based on the divide-and-conquer strategy to learn long and short-term

the formation and evolution of ultraflatbands in transition metal

twisted bilayer graphene, ultraflatbands exist in TMDCs for almost any small
twist angles and their wave function becomes more localized when the rotation
angle decreases. Lattice relaxation, pressure and local deformation can tune
the width of the flatbands, as well as their localization. Furthermore, we
investigate the effect of spin-orbit coupling on the flatbands and discover
spin/orbital/valley locking at the minimum of the conduction band at the K

from generalized impedance boundary conditions, the approach taken here first

augmentation to embed target clues from template into search area seeds and
represent them with target-specific features. Consequently, the augmented
search area seeds regress the potential target centers via Hough voting. The
centers are further strengthened with seed-wise targetness scores. Finally,
each center clusters its neighbors to leverage the ensemble power for joint 3D
target proposal and verification. We apply PointNet++ as our backbone and
experiments on KITTI tracking dataset demonstrate P2B's superiority (~10%'s
improvement over state-of-the-art). Note that P2B can run with 40FPS on a

health and socio-economic activities. Despite the recent surge of
investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know
little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in
urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19
scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns
are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the
disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita
initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course
of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to
exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in
population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per
capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that
these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health
infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in
large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to
be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in
large cities and to increase in small ones over time.

results compared to recurrent neural network systems in speech recognition. The
key factor for the outstanding performance of self-attention models is their

between two related events. However, we note that the range of the learned
context progressively increases from the lower to upper self-attention layers,
whilst acoustic events often happen within short time spans in a left-to-right

the entire sequence still important for the upper self-attention layers in the

layers with feed forward layers. In our speech recognition experiments (Wall

replacing the upper self-attention layers in the encoder with feed forward

offer insights to how self-attention layers process the speech signal, leading
to the conclusion that the lower self-attention layers of the encoder encode a

silicone oil into the 1,2-hexanediol-water binary solution. This minute
silicone oil concentration dramatically modifies the evaporation process as it
triggers an early extraction of the 1,2-hexanediol from the mixture.
Surprisingly, we observe that the segregation of 1,2-hexanediol forms plumes,
rising up from the rim of the sessile droplet towards the apex during the
droplet evaporation. By orientating the droplet upside down, i.e., by studying
a pendant droplet, the absence of the plumes indicates that the flow structure
is induced by buoyancy, which drives a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (i.e.,
driven by density differences & gravitational acceleration). From micro-PIV
measurement, we further prove that the segregation of the non-volatile
component (1,2-hexanediol) hinders the evaporation near the contact line, which
leads to a suppression of the Marangoni flow in this region. Hence, on long
time scales, gravitational effects play the dominant role in the flow
structure, rather than Marangoni flows. We compare the measurement of the
evaporation rate with the diffusion model of Popov (2005), coupled with
Raoult's law and the activity coefficient. This comparison indeed confirms that
the silicone-oil-triggered segregation of the non-volatile 1,2-hexanediol
significantly delays the evaporation. With an extended diffusion model, in
which the influence of the segregation has been implemented, the evaporation
can be well described.

martensitic phase transition between 230 K and 275 K. The low-temperature
martensite phase orders antiferromagnetically with helical modulation of
Mn-spins. At 1.5 K, the incommensurate propagation vector $\bf k$ is found to
be (0.1790(1),0,0), and it remains almost unchanged with temperature under
ambient condition. The Application of external pressure ($P$) reduces the
martensitic transition temperature and results in a significant change in the
incommensurate magnetic propagation vector. At 10 K, with 6 kbar of external
pressure, the incommensurate magnetic structure of the alloy stabilizes with
$\bf k$ = (0.1569(1),0,0). Interestingly, the strong temperature dependence of
$\bf k$ in the presence of external $P$ has also been observed.

(PCE), widely used in the Uncertainty Quantification community (UQ), has long
been employed as a robust representation for probabilistic input-to-output
mapping. It has been recently tested in a pure ML context, and shown to be as
powerful as classical ML techniques for point-wise prediction. Some advantages
are inherent to the method, such as its explicitness and adaptability to small
training sets, in addition to the associated probabilistic framework.
Simultaneously, Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques are increasingly used
for pattern recognition and data compression and have gained interest due to
improved data quality. In this study, the interest of Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD) for the construction of a statistical predictive model is
demonstrated. Both POD and PCE have amply proved their worth in their
respective frameworks. The goal of the present paper was to combine them for a
field-measurement-based forecasting. The described steps are also useful to
analyze the data. Some challenging issues encountered when using
multidimensional field measurements are addressed, for example when dealing
with few data. The POD-PCE coupling methodology is presented, with particular
focus on input data characteristics and training-set choice. A simple
methodology for evaluating the importance of each physical parameter is
proposed for the PCE model and extended to the POD-PCE coupling.

Here we study the surface anomalous Hall effect and its spectral signatures in
different magnetic topological phases using both model Hamiltonian and
first-principles calculations. We demonstrate that by tailoring the
magnetization and interlayer electron hopping, a rich three-dimensional
topological phase diagram can be established, including three types of
topologically distinct insulating phases bridged by Weyl semimetals, and can be

oscillating around e2/2h, depending on the magnetic homogeneity. We also
discuss the resultant chiral hinge modes embedded inside the side surface bands

compressible flows. It is constructed based on the direct modeling of
multi-scale flow behaviors, which is used in the Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS), the
Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme (UGKS), the Discrete Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme
(DUGKS), etc.. In KIF, the discontinuities (such as the shock wave) that can
not be well resolved by mesh cells are mainly solved by the Kinetic Flux Vector
Splitting (KFVS) method representing the free transport mechanism (or
micro-scale mechanism), while in other flow regions that are smooth, the flow
behavior is solved mainly by the central-scheme-like Totally Thermalized
Transport (TTT). The weights of KFVS and TTT in KIF is automatically determined
by those in the theory of direct modeling. Two ways of choosing the weights in
KIF are proposed, which are actually the weights adopted in the UGKS and the
DUGKS, respectively. By using the test cases of Sod shock tube, rarefaction
wave, the boundary layer of flat plate, the cavity flow and hypersonic flow
over circular cylinder, the validity and accuracy of the present method are
examined. The KIF does not suffer from the carbuncle phenomenon, and does not
introduce extra numerical viscosity in smooth regions. Especially, in the case
of hypersonic cylinder, it gives a quite sharp and clear density and
temperature contours. The KIF can be viewed as an inviscid-viscous splitting
version of the GKS. By the doing this splitting, it is easy to be used in the
traditional CFD frameworks. It can also be classified as a new type in the
numerical schemes based on the kinetic theory that are represented by the works
in Ref. \cite{SunA} and Ref. \cite{ohwada2018a}, except the weights are

mitigate the gap between the source and target domains by adversarial methods.
The category information are not sufficiently used which causes the learned
domain invariant features are not enough discriminative. We propose a new
domain adaptation method based on prototype construction which likes capturing
data cluster centers. Specifically, it consists of two parts: disentanglement
and reconstruction. First, the domain specific features and domain invariant
features are disentangled from the original features. At the same time, the
domain prototypes and class prototypes of both domains are estimated. Then, a
reconstructor is trained by reconstructing the original features from the
disentangled domain invariant features and domain specific features. By this
reconstructor, we can construct prototypes for the original features using
class prototypes and domain prototypes correspondingly. In the end, the feature
extraction network is forced to extract features close to these prototypes. Our
contribution lies in the technical use of the reconstructor to obtain the
original feature prototypes which helps to learn compact and discriminant
features. As far as we know, this idea is proposed for the first time.

which a time series is described by its similarity to each of a collection of

such as being limited to regularly-spaced fully-observed time series, and
having to choose between efficient training and interpretability. Here, we
extend the method to continuous time, and in doing so handle the general case

Furthermore, we show that a simple regularisation penalty may be used to train
efficiently without sacrificing interpretability. The continuous-time
formulation additionally allows for learning the length of each shapelet

demonstrate that the measure of similarity between time series may be
generalised to a learnt pseudometric. We validate our method by demonstrating
its performance and interpretability on several datasets; for example we
discover (purely from data) that the digits 5 and 6 may be distinguished by the

set theory, often Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF) or one of its variants. In
ZF, the domain of discourse contains only sets, and hence every mathematical
object must be a set. Consequently, in ZF, with the usual encoding of an
ordered pair ${\langle a, b\rangle}$, formulas like ${\{a\} \in \langle a, b
\rangle}$ have truth values, and operations like ${\mathcal P (\langle a,
b\rangle)}$ have results that are sets. Such 'accidental theorems' do not match
how people think about the mathematics and also cause practical difficulties
when using set theory in machine-assisted theorem proving. In contrast, in a
number of proof assistants, mathematical objects and concepts can be built of
type-theoretic stuff so that many mathematical objects can be, in essence,
terms of an extended typed ${\lambda}$-calculus. However, dilemmas and
frustration arise when formalizing mathematics in type theory.
  Motivated by problems of formalizing mathematics with (1) purely
set-theoretic and (2) type-theoretic approaches, we explore an option with much
of the flexibility of set theory and some of the useful features of type
theory. We present ZFP: a modification of ZF that has ordered pairs as
primitive, non-set objects. ZFP has a more natural and abstract axiomatic
definition of ordered pairs free of any notion of representation. This paper
presents axioms for ZFP, and a proof in ZF (machine-checked in Isabelle/ZF) of
the existence of a model for ZFP, which implies that ZFP is consistent if ZF

distribution amplitudes using large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Our
calculation is carried out using three ensembles with 2+1+1 flavors of highly
improved staggered quarks (HISQ), generated by MILC collaboration, at 310 MeV
pion mass with 0.06, 0.09 and 0.12 fm lattice spacings. We use clover fermion
action for the valence quarks and tune the quark mass to match the lightest
light and strange masses in the sea. The resulting lattice matrix elements are
nonperturbatively renormalized in regularization-independent
momentum-subtraction (RI/MOM) scheme and extrapolated to the continuum. We use
two approaches to extract the $x$-dependence of the meson distribution
amplitudes: 1) we fit the renormalized matrix elements in coordinate space to
an assumed distribution form through a one-loop matching kernel; 2) we use a
machine-learning algorithm trained on pseudo lattice-QCD data to make
predictions on the lattice data. We found the results are consistent between
these methods with the latter method giving a less smooth shape. Both
approaches suggest that as the quark mass increases, the distribution amplitude
becomes narrower. Our pion distribution amplitude has broader distribution than
predicted by light-front constituent-quark model, and the moments of our pion
distributions agree with previous lattice-QCD results using the operator
production expansion.

the setting of Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is much lower than that of
traditional Zero-Shot Leaning (ZSL). One of the reasons is that an instance is
always misclassified to the wrong domain. Here we refer to the seen and unseen
classes as two domains respectively. We propose a new approach to distinguish
whether the instances come from the seen or unseen classes. First the visual
feature of instance is projected into the semantic space. Then the absolute
norm difference between the projected semantic vector and the class semantic
embedding vector, and the minimum distance between the projected semantic
vectors and the semantic embedding vectors of the seen classes are used as
discrimination basis. This approach is termed as SD (Semantic Discriminator)
because domain judgement of instance is performed in the semantic space. Our
approach can be combined with any existing ZSL method and fully supervision
classification model to form a new GZSL method. Furthermore, our approach is
very simple and does not need any fixed parameters.

flows, we study the dynamics of an air bubble driven by the steady motion of a
suspending viscous fluid within a Hele-Shaw channel with a centred depth
perturbation. Using both experiments and numerical simulations of a
depth-averaged model, we investigate the evolution of an initially centred
bubble of prescribed volume as a function of flow rate and initial shape. The
experiments exhibit a rich variety of organised transient dynamics, involving
bubble break up as well as aggregation and coalescence of interacting
neighbouring bubbles. The long-term outcome is either a single bubble or
multiple separating bubbles, positioned along the channel in order of
increasing velocity. Up to moderate flow rates, the life and fate of the bubble
are reproducible and can be categorised by a small number of characteristic
behaviours that occur in simply-connected regions of the parameter plane.
Increasing the flow rate leads to less reproducible time evolutions with
increasing sensitivity to initial conditions and perturbations in the channel.
Time-dependent numerical simulations that allow for break up and coalescence
are found to reproduce most of the dynamical behaviour observed experimentally
including enhanced sensitivity at high flow rate. An unusual feature of this
system is that the set of steady and periodic solutions can change during
temporal evolution because both the number of bubbles and their size
distribution evolve due to break up and coalescence events. Calculation of
stable and unstable solutions in the single- and two-bubble cases reveals that
the transient dynamics are orchestrated by weakly-unstable solutions of the
system termed edge states that can appear and disappear as the number of
bubbles changes.

The superconducting instability is analyzed by solving the linearized

ferromagnetic fluctuations are dominant owing to the existence of disconnected
Fermi pockets near van Hove singularity, and hence odd-parity spin-triplet
superconductivity is favored. In the absence of the spin-orbit coupling, we
find that odd-parity $f$-wave superconducting state is stabilized in a wide

impacts of the layer-dependent staggered Rashba and Zeeman spin-orbit coupling

are obtained as a function of the spin-orbit coupling and Coulomb interaction.
Especially, a topological chiral $p$-wave pairing state is stabilized in the

mathematics, the richness in physical results is evident when one considers the

curved. This thesis will be dedicated to the study of this type of physical
systems, where thermodynamics and general relativity equally contribute to the
dynamics. The first part will be devoted to the study of classical
thermodynamic systems in curved spacetime, namely thin matter shells at finite
temperature. These objects partition spacetime into separate pieces, and their
very existence is conditioned by the so-called junctions conditions. The latter
conditions allow us to carefully study both the mechanical and thermodynamics
of the shell and, in particular, they give rise to a well-defined notion of
entropy. The shell can then be taken to its black hole limit, providing an
alternative way to study black hole thermodynamics. We will do this for
different geometries, obtaining as byproduct a plausible answer for the debated
value of the entropy of an extremal black hole. In the second part we shall
review the standard formalisms to study QFT in curved spacetimes, in order to
explore quantum properties of thermodynamic systems in the presence of gravity.
Massive quantum scalar fields at finite temperature will be the systems of
choice, whereby various instances of vacuum polarisation will be calculated in
a variety of black hole geometries. Both numerical and analytic results will be
obtained, and new addition formulas for a certain class of transcendental
functions will be derived. This part will culminate with a careful numerical
study of symmetry restoration of a self-interacting scalar field around a
charged black hole, where we verify insights present in the literature.

theories from an algebraic point of view. The main motivation is to gain
insights about the general structure of the entanglement in QFT, towards a
definition of an entropic version of QFT. In the opposite direction, we are
also interested in exploring any consequence of the entanglement in algebraic
QFT. This may help us to reveal unknown features of QFT, with the final aim of
finding a dynamical principle which allows us to construct non-trivial and
rigorous models of QFT. The algebraic approach is the natural framework to
define and study entanglement in QFT, and hence, to pose the above inquiries.
After a self-contained review of algebraic QFT and quantum information theory
in operator algebras, we focus on our results. We compute, in a mathematically
rigorous way, exact solutions of entanglement measures and modular Hamiltonians
for specific QFT models, using algebraic tools from modular theory of von
Neumann algebras. These calculations show explicitly non-local features of
modular Hamiltonians and help us to solve ambiguities that arise in other
non-rigorous computations. We also study aspects of entanglement entropy in
theories having superselection sectors coming from global symmetries. We follow
the algebraic perspective of Doplicher, Haag, and Roberts. In this way, we find
an entropic order parameter that ""measures"" the size of the symmetry group,
which is made out of a difference of two mutual informations. Moreover, we
identify the main operators that take account of such a difference, and we
obtain a new quantum information quantity, the entropic certainty relation,
involving algebras containing such operators. This certainty relation keeps an
intrinsic connection with subfactor theory of von Neumann algebras.

that share similar properties, thus revealing its large-scale structure. A
major challenge when employing such methods is that they are often degenerate,
typically yielding a complex landscape of competing answers. As an attempt to
extract understanding from a population of alternative solutions, many methods
exist to establish a consensus among them in the form of a single partition
""point estimate"" that summarizes the whole distribution. Here we show that it
is in general not possible to obtain a consistent answer from such point
estimates when the underlying distribution is too heterogeneous. As an
alternative, we provide a comprehensive set of methods designed to characterize
and summarize complex populations of partitions in a manner that captures not
only the existing consensus, but also the dissensus between elements of the
population. Our approach is able to model mixed populations of partitions where
multiple consensuses can coexist, representing different competing hypotheses
for the network structure. We also show how our methods can be used to compare
pairs of partitions, how they can be generalized to hierarchical divisions, and

non-trivial, as the latent space can be prohibitively large, and the latent

Previous works impose strong assumptions on the distribution of the latent code

recent quasar data are used as a new type of standard candles in the range
$0.036<z<5.100$, whose luminosity distances can be directly derived from the
non-linear relation between X-ray and UV luminosities. Compared with other
methods, the proposed one involving the quasar data achieves constraints with
higher precision ($\Delta \Omega_k\sim 10^{-2}$) at high redshifts ($z\sim
5.0$). We also investigate the influence of lens mass distribution in the
framework of three types of lens models extensively used in strong lensing
studies (SIS model, power-law spherical model, and extended power-law lens
model), finding the strong correlation between the cosmic curvature and the
lens model parameters. When the power-law mass density profile is assumed, the
most stringent constraint on the cosmic curvature $\Omega_k$ can be obtained.
Therefore, the issue of mass density profile in the early-type galaxies is
still a critical one that needs to be investigated further.

Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Updates (OMWU) in zero-sum as well as
coordination games. Such analyses provide new insights into these game
dynamical systems, which seem hard to achieve via the classical techniques
within Computer Science and Machine Learning.
  The first step is to examine these dynamics not in their original space
(simplex of actions) but in a dual space (aggregate payoff space of actions).
The second step is to explore how the volume of a set of initial conditions
evolves over time when it is pushed forward according to the algorithm. This is
reminiscent of approaches in Evolutionary Game Theory where replicator
dynamics, the continuous-time analogue of MWU, is known to always preserve
volume in all games. Interestingly, when we examine discrete-time dynamics,
both the choice of the game and the choice of the algorithm play a critical
role. So whereas MWU expands volume in zero-sum games and is thus Lyapunov
chaotic, we show that OMWU contracts volume, providing an alternative
understanding for its known convergent behavior. However, we also prove a
no-free-lunch type of theorem, in the sense that when examining coordination
games the roles are reversed: OMWU expands volume exponentially fast, whereas
MWU contracts.
  Using these tools, we prove two novel, rather negative properties of MWU in
zero-sum games: (1) Extremism: even in games with unique fully mixed Nash
equilibrium, the system recurrently gets stuck near pure-strategy profiles,
despite them being clearly unstable from game theoretic perspective. (2)
Unavoidability: given any set of good points (with your own interpretation of
""good""), the system cannot avoid bad points indefinitely.

demonstrate that, from the optical to the near-infrared (IR) band, the

that of the total flux, corroborating the presence of an optically thick,
locally heated accretion flow, at least in its near-IR emitting radii. Specific
signatures from the atmosphere of the accretion structure are tentatively found
at the shortest ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, before the onset of absorption
opacity. Otherwise, dust scattering appears to be the dominant contributor from
the near-UV to near-IR polarized spectrum, superimposed onto a weaker electron
component. We also identify a change in the polarization processes from the

TESS is expected to require very large amounts of expensive telescope time in

maximize the amount of information gathered about the target planetary systems.
We consider myopic and non-myopic versions of a novel uniform-in-phase
scheduler, as well as a random scheduler, and compare these scheduling
strategies with respect to the bias, accuracy and precision achieved in
recovering the mass and orbital parameters of transiting and non-transiting
planets. This comparison is carried out based on realistic simulations of
radial-velocity follow-up with ESPRESSO of a sample of 50 TESS target stars,
with simulated planetary systems containing at least one transiting planet with
a radius below $4R_{\oplus}$. Radial-velocity datasets were generated under
reasonable assumptions about their noise component, including that resulting
from stellar activity, and analysed using a fully Bayesian methodology. We find
the random scheduler leads to a more biased, less accurate, and less precise,
estimation of the mass of the transiting exoplanets. No significant differences
are found between the results of the myopic and non-myopic implementations of
the uniform-in-phase scheduler. With only about 22 radial velocity measurements
per dataset, our novel uniform-in-phase scheduler enables an unbiased (at the
level of 1\%) measurement of the masses of the transiting planets, while
keeping the average relative accuracy and precision around 16\% and 23\%
respectively. The number of non-transiting planets detected is similar for all

solve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative
learning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or
reinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box
application of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of
training time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types.
  We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a
modular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair
application. MACER uses powerful yet inexpensive discriminative learning
techniques such as multi-label classifiers and rankers to first identify the
type of repair required and then apply the suggested repair.
  Experiments indicate that the fine-grained approach adopted by MACER offers
not only superior error correction, but also much faster training and
prediction. On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual
student submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting
fixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student.
MACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types --
whether popular or rare. MACER offers a training time speedup of 2x over TRACER

singularities (blowup), explanation of intermittency in developed turbulence,
etc., are related to multi-scale structure and symmetries of underlying
equations of motion. Significantly simplified equations of motion, called
toy-models, are traditionally employed in the analysis of such complex systems.
In such models, equations are modified preserving just a part of the structure
believed to be important. Here we propose a different approach for constructing
simplified models, in which instead of simplifying equations one introduces a
simplified configuration space: velocity fields are defined on
multi-dimensional logarithmic lattices with proper algebraic operations and
calculus. Then, the equations of motion retain their exact original form and,
therefore, naturally maintain most scaling properties, symmetries and
invariants of the original systems. Classification of such models reveals a
fascinating relation with renowned mathematical constants such as the golden
mean and the plastic number. Using both rigorous and numerical analysis, we
describe various properties of solutions in these models, from the basic
concepts of existence and uniqueness to the blowup development and turbulent
dynamics. In particular, we observe strong robustness of the chaotic blowup
scenario in the three-dimensional incompressible Euler equations, as well as
the Fourier mode statistics of developed turbulence resembling the full

non-equilibrium state. We allow particles to settle through reshaping until
they reach an equilibrium state. Preliminary tests are studied to investigate
the quantitative and qualitative behavior of the granular media. The shape of

quantum system. Here, we consider how charging performances of a quantum
battery, modelled as a two level system, are influenced by the presence of an
Ohmic thermal reservoir. The latter is coupled to both longitudinal and
transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and
pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum
battery, subjected to a static driving, are obtained exploiting a proper
mapping into the so-called spin-boson model. Analytic expressions for the time
evolution of the energy stored in the weak coupling regime are presented
relying on a systematic weak damping expansion. Here, decoherence and pure
dephasing dissipative coupling are discussed in details. We argue that the
former results in better charging performances, showing also interesting
features reminiscent of the Lamb shift level splitting renormalization induced
by the presence of the reservoir. Charging stability is also addressed, by
monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched
off. This study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects,
able to include also non Markovian effects, and it reveals the importance of
controlling and, possibly, engineering system-bath coupling in the realization
of quantum batteries.

of large DNN models, the use of heterogeneous GPUs is inevitable due to the
short release cycle of new GPU architectures. In this paper, we investigate how
to enable training of large DNN models on a heterogeneous GPU cluster that
possibly includes whimpy GPUs that, as a standalone, could not be used for
training. We present a DNN training system, HetPipe (Heterogeneous Pipeline),
that integrates pipelined model parallelism (PMP) with data parallelism (DP).
In HetPipe, a group of multiple GPUs, called a virtual worker, processes
minibatches in a pipelined manner, and multiple such virtual workers employ
data parallelism for higher performance. We also propose a novel parameter
synchronization model, which we refer to as Wave Synchronous Parallel (WSP) to
accommodate both PMP and DP for virtual workers, and provide convergence proof
of WSP. Our experimental results on a given heterogeneous setting show that
with HetPipe, DNN models converge up to 49% faster compared to the
state-of-the-art DP technique.

astronomical sources featuring relativistic jets, is a widely discussed topic.
In this work, we present the results of a variability study of a sample of 20
blazars using \gama-ray (0.1--300~GeV) observations from Fermi/LAT telescope.
Using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) methods, we find that the probability
density functions that best describe the $\gamma$-ray blazar flux distributions
use the stable distribution family, which generalizes the Gaussian
distribution. The results suggest that the average behavior of the \gama-ray
flux variability over this period can be characterized by log-stable
distributions. For most of the sample sources, this estimate leads to standard
log-normal distribution ($\alpha=2$). However, a few sources clearly display
heavy tail distributions (MLE leads to $\alpha<2$), suggesting underlying
multiplicative processes of infinite variance. Furthermore, the light curves
were analyzed by employing novel non-stationarity and autocorrelation analyses.
The former analysis allowed us to quantitatively evaluate non-stationarity in
each source -- finding the forgetting rate (corresponding to decay time)
maximizing the log-likelihood for the modeled evolution of the probability
density functions. Additionally, evaluation of local variability allows us to
detect local anomalies, suggesting a transient nature of some of the
statistical properties of the light curves. With the autocorrelation analysis,
we examined the lag dependence of the statistical behavior of all the
$\{(y_t,y_{t+l})\}$ points, described by various mixed moments, allowing us to
quantitatively evaluate multiple characteristic time scales and implying
possible hidden periodic processes.

valence electronic configuration, making them the only elemental materials to
crystallize in layered van der Waals (vdW) and quasi-vdW structures throughout
the group. Light group VA elements are found in the layered orthorhombic A17
phase such as black phosphorus, and can transition to the layered rhombohedral
A7 phase at high pressure. On the other hand, bulk heavier elements are only
stable in the A7 phase. Herein, we demonstrate that these two phases not only
co-exist during the vdW growth of antimony on weakly interacting surfaces, but
also undertake a spontaneous transformation from the A17 phase to the
thermodynamically stable A7 phase. This metastability of the A17 phase is
revealed by real-time studies unraveling its thickness-driven transition to the
A7 phase and the concomitant evolution of its electronic properties. At a
critical thickness of ~4 nm, A17 antimony undergoes a diffusionless shuffle
transition from AB to AA stacked alpha-antimonene followed by a gradual
relaxation to the A7 bulk-like phase. Furthermore, the electronic structure of
this intermediate phase is found to be determined by surface self-passivation
and the associated competition between A7- and A17-like bonding in the bulk.
These results highlight the critical role of the atomic structure and
interfacial interactions in shaping the stability and electronic
characteristics of vdW layered materials, thus enabling a new degree of freedom
to engineer their properties using scalable processes.

the pulsar with a period of 194.2201 \pm 0.0016 s, and a spin-up rate of

light curves between 3--80 keV energy band with increase in intensity by up to
1.8 times its average intensity. Pulse profiles obtained between 3--80 keV
energy band of the pulsar showed strong dependence on energy. A broad peak was
observed in the power density spectrum of the source consistently during
AstroSat observations with its peak oscillation frequency of 0.090 Hz along
with its higher harmonics, which may be due to quasi-periodic oscillations, a
commonly observed phenomenon in transient X-ray pulsars, during their outburst.
AstroSat observation also detected cyclotron absorption features in its
spectrum corresponding to (9.7--14.4) keV, (19.3--23.8) keV and (37.8--43.1)
keV. The pulse phase resolved spectroscopy of the source showed phase dependent
variation in its energy and relative strength of these features. The spectrum
was well fitted with an absorbed black-body, a Fermi Dirac cut-off model and
alternatively with an absorbed CompTT model. Both these models were combined
with a Fe-line and three Gaussian absorption lines to account for observed

models for the Milky Way. We, in contrast, approach the problem via a
self-consistent, dynamic, and morphologically well-resolved model, namely a
full $N$-body simulation of the Milky Way. Our simulation comprises about 5.1
billion particles in the galactic stellar bulge, bar, disk, and dark-matter
halo and is evolved to 10 Gyr. Our model's disk component is composed of 200
million particles, and its simulation snapshots are stored every 10 Myr,
enabling us to resolve and classify resonant orbits of representative samples
of stars. After choosing the Sun's position in the simulation, we compare the
distribution of stars in its neighborhood with Gaia's astrometric data, thereby
establishing the role of identified resonantly trapped stars in the formation
of Hercules-like structures. From our orbital spectral-analysis we identify
multiple, especially higher order resonances. Our results suggest that the
Hercules stream is dominated by the 4:1 and 5:1 outer Lindblad and corotation
resonances. In total, this yields a trimodal structure of the Hercules stream.
From the relation between resonances and ridges in phase space, our model
favored a slow pattern speed of the Milky-Way bar (40--45 $\mathrm{km \; s^{-1}

perform an MCMC analysis for three representative cases and find indeed that

their cross-section radius varies along the wire length, can be tuned into a
number of different transport regimes when immersed in a homogeneous coaxial
magnetic field. This is in contrast with widely studied tubular nanowires with
constant cross-section, and is due to magnetic confinement of Dirac surface
carriers. In flat 2D systems such a confinement requires non-homogeneous
magnetic fields, while for shaped nanowires of standard size homogeneous fields
of the order of $B\sim\,1$T are sufficient. We put recent work [Kozlovsky et
al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 126804 (2020)] into broader context and extend it to
deal with axially symmetric wire geometries with arbitrary radial profile. A
dumbbell-shaped TI nanowire is used as a paradigmatic example for transport
through a constriction and shown to be tunable into five different transport
regimes: (i) conductance steps, (ii) resonant transmission, (iii) current
suppression, (iv) Coulomb blockade, and (v) transport through a triple quantum
dot. Switching between regimes is achieved by modulating the strength of a
coaxial magnetic field and does not require strict axial symmetry of the wire
cross-section. As such, it should be observable in TI nanowires fabricated with
available experimental techniques.

  Asymptotic normality and $\ell_\infty$-bounds for the maximizer","51 pages",,,,"math.PR math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For an $n\times n$ matrix $A_n$, the $r\to p$ operator norm is defined as
$$\|A_n\|_{r\to p}:= \sup_{\boldsymbol{x} \in
\mathbb{R}^n:\|\boldsymbol{x}\|_r\leq 1 }
\|A_n\boldsymbol{x}\|_p\quad\text{for}\quad r,p\geq 1.$$ For different choices
of $r$ and $p$, this norm corresponds to key quantities that arise in diverse
applications including matrix condition number estimation, clustering of data,
and finding oblivious routing schemes in transportation networks. This article
considers $r\to p$ norms of symmetric random matrices with nonnegative entries,
including adjacency matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs, matrices with
positive sub-Gaussian entries, and certain sparse matrices. For $1< p\leq r<
\infty$, the asymptotic normality, as $n\to\infty$, of the appropriately
centered and scaled norm $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is established. When $p \geq 2$,
this is shown to imply, as a corollary, asymptotic normality of the solution to
the $\ell_p$ quadratic maximization problem, also known as the $\ell_p$
Grothendieck problem. Furthermore, a sharp $\ell_\infty$-approximation bound
for the unique maximizing vector in the definition of $\|A_n\|_{r\to p}$ is
obtained. This result, which may be of independent interest, is in fact shown
to hold for a broad class of deterministic sequences of matrices having certain
asymptotic expansion properties. The results obtained can be viewed as a
generalization of the seminal results of F\""{u}redi and Koml\'{o}s (1981) on
asymptotic normality of the largest singular value of a class of symmetric
random matrices, which corresponds to the special case $r=p=2$ considered here.
In the general case with $1< p\leq r < \infty$, spectral methods are no longer
applicable, and so a new approach is developed, which involves a refined
convergence analysis of a nonlinear power method and a perturbation bound on
the maximizing vector.

around a O9.5Ve star, LS 2883, with a period of ~3.4 years. The interaction of
the pulsar wind with the LS 2883 outflow leads to unpulsed broad band emission
in the radio, X-rays, GeV and TeV domains. While the radio, X-ray and TeV light
curves show rather similar behaviour, the GeV light curve appears very
different with a huge outburst about a month after a periastron. The energy
release during this outburst seems to significantly exceed the spin down
luminosity of the pulsar and the GeV light curve and energy release varies from
one orbit to the next.
  In this paper we present for the first time the results of optical
observations of the system in 2017, and also reanalyze the available X-ray and
GeV data. We present a new model in which the GeV data are explained as a
combination of the bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton emission from the
unshocked and weakly shocked electrons of the pulsar wind. The X-ray and TeV
emission is produced by synchrotron and inverse Compton emission of energetic
electrons accelerated on a strong shock arising due to stellar/pulsar winds
collision. The brightness of the GeV flare is explained in our model as a
beaming effect of the energy released in a cone oriented, during the time of
flare, in the direction of the observer.

$\vartheta_{2}$ which need to be fixed from observations. We obtain the
constraints on these parameters using the latest 51 data points of $H(z)$
measurements, spanning the redshift range $0.07\leq z \leq 2.36$. The present
study shows that the Universe is indeed undergoing an accelerated expansion
phase following the decelerated one at the transition redshift,
$z_{t}=0.77\pm0.03$ ($1\sigma$) and is well consistent with the recent
observations. We also find that at low redshifts, $w_{eff}$ evolves only in the
quintessence regime ($-1<w_{eff}<-\frac{1}{3}$) within $1\sigma$ confidence
level. Its present value is found to be $-0.96\pm0.02$ ($1\sigma$). The fact
that the present value of $w_{eff}$ is very close to the Cosmological Constant
$\Lambda$ implies that our proposed equation of state parameter might serve as
a unification of dark matter and dark energy. Furthermore, we compare the
evolution of $H(z)$ for the model under consideration with that of the
$\Lambda$CDM model. Finally, we observe that for the best-fit case, the
differences between the two models are negligible at $z\sim 0.67$.

signaling pathways. These are usually depicted as a network, where nodes

to understand diseases and therapies at the cellular level, it is crucial to
have an accurate understanding of the signaling pathways at work. Since
signaling pathways can be modified by disease, the ability to infer signaling
pathways from condition- or patient-specific data is highly valuable. A variety
of techniques exist for inferring signaling pathways. We build on past works
that formulate signaling pathway inference as a Dynamic Bayesian Network
structure estimation problem on phosphoproteomic time course data. We take a
Bayesian approach, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate a posterior
distribution over possible Dynamic Bayesian Network structures. Our primary
contributions are (i) a novel proposal distribution that efficiently samples
sparse graphs and (ii) the relaxation of common restrictive modeling
assumptions. We implement our method, named Sparse Signaling Pathway Sampling,
in Julia using the Gen probabilistic programming language. Probabilistic
programming is a powerful methodology for building statistical models. The
resulting code is modular, extensible, and legible. The Gen language, in
particular, allows us to customize our inference procedure for biological
graphs and ensure efficient sampling. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated

performance against a variety of baseline methods. Our results demonstrate the
vast potential for probabilistic programming, and Gen specifically, for

the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking

variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose
to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which
enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic
UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are
three-fold. 1) A new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the
CA-enabled UAV mmWave network. 2) A specialized hierarchical codebook is
constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered
cylindrical conformal array (CCA), which contains both the angular beam pattern
and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA. 3) A
codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian
process machine learning enabled UAV position/attitude predication is developed
to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error
aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness
of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV
mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional

quasi-gradients exist, a large family of low-regret algorithms are guaranteed
to approximate the global minimum; this includes the commonly-used filtering
algorithm.
  For robust mean estimation of distributions under bounded covariance, we show
that any first-order stationary point of the associated optimization problem is
an {approximate global minimum} if and only if the corruption level $\epsilon <
1/3$. Consequently, any optimization algorithm that aproaches a stationary
point yields an efficient robust estimator with breakdown point $1/3$. With
careful initialization and step size, we improve this to $1/2$, which is
optimal.
  For other tasks, including linear regression and joint mean and covariance
estimation, the loss landscape is more rugged: there are stationary points
arbitrarily far from the global minimum. Nevertheless, we show that generalized
quasi-gradients exist and construct efficient algorithms. These algorithms are
simpler than previous ones in the literature, and for linear regression we
improve the estimation error from $O(\sqrt{\epsilon})$ to the optimal rate of
$O(\epsilon)$ for small $\epsilon$ assuming certified hypercontractivity. For
mean estimation with near-identity covariance, we show that a simple gradient
descent algorithm achieves breakdown point $1/3$ and iteration complexity

n-dimensional manifolds having the topology of a hollow sphere and equipped
with a warped product metric. Precisely, we aim at studying the continuous
dependence of the warping function dening the warped product with respect to
the Steklov spectrum. We first show that the knowledge of the Steklov spectrum
up to an exponential decreasing error is enough to determine uniquely the
warping function in a neighbourhood of the boundary. Second, when the warping
functions are symmetric with respect to 1/2, we prove a log-type stability
estimate in the inverse Steklov problem. As a last result, we prove a log-type
stability estimate for the corresponding Calder{\'o}n problem.

along the straight edge of a planar, semi-infinite sheet with a spatially

low-frequency regime, where the EP wave number, $q$, can be comparable to the
propagation constant, $k_0$, of the ambient medium; and the nonretarded
frequency regime in which $|q|\gg |k_0|$. Our analysis indicates two types of

that dust grains provide. However, previous works have often considered
simplified prescriptions for the dust opacity in hydrodynamical disc
simulations, e.g. by considering only a single particle size. In the present
work we perform 2D hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs where the
opacity is self-consistently calculated for the dust population, taking into
account the particle size, composition and abundance. We first compare
simulations using single grain sizes to two different multi-grain size
distributions at different levels of turbulence strengths, parameterized
through the $\alpha$-viscosity, and different gas surface densities. Assuming a
single dust size leads to inaccurate calculations of the thermal structure of
discs, because the grain size dominating the opacity increases with orbital
radius. Overall the two grain size distributions, one limited by fragmentation
only and the other determined from a more complete fragmentation-coagulation
equilibrium, give similar results for the thermal structure. We find that both
grain size distributions give less steep opacity gradients that result in less
steep aspect ratio gradients, in comparison to discs with only micrometer sized
dust. Moreover, in the discs with a grain size distribution, the innermost
outward migration region is removed and planets embedded is such discs
experience lower migration rates. We also investigate the dependency of the
water iceline position on the alpha-viscosity, the initial gas surface density
at 1 AU and the dust-to-gas ratio and find $r_{ice} \propto \alpha^{0.61}
\Sigma_{g,0}^{0.8} f_{DG}^{0.37}$ independently of the distribution used. The
inclusion of the feedback loop between grain growth, opacities and disc
thermodynamics allows for more self-consistent simulations of accretion discs

stresses played a significant role in the formation of tensile fractures on
Charon. Although presently in a circular orbit, most scenarios for the orbital
evolution of Charon include an eccentric orbit for some period of time and
possibly an internal ocean. Past work has shown that these conditions could
have generated stresses comparable in magnitude to other tidally fractured
moons, such as Europa and Enceladus. However, we find no correlation between
observed fracture orientations and those predicted to form due to
eccentricity-driven tidal stress. It thus seems more likely that the orbit of
Charon circularized before its ocean froze, and that either tidal stresses
alone were insufficient to fracture the surface or subsequent resurfacing
remove these ancient fractures.

main contribution is a class of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with rectified
linear units that are iteratively applied to each item of a Knapsack instance
and thereby compute optimal or provably good solution values. We show that an
RNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum
Knapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions. We also
prove the following tradeoff between the size of an RNN and the quality of the
computed Knapsack solution: for Knapsack instances consisting of $n$ items, an
RNN of depth five and width $w$ computes a solution of value at least
$1-\mathcal{O}(n^2/\sqrt{w})$ times the optimum solution value. Our results
build upon a classical dynamic programming formulation of the Knapsack Problem
as well as a careful rounding of profit values that are also at the core of the
well-known fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Knapsack Problem.
A carefully conducted computational study qualitatively supports our
theoretical size bounds. Finally, we point out that our results can be

classification problems. We propose the first use of unsupervised domain
adaptation for discrete multimodal registration. Based on a source domain for

the output distribution of the network to better resemble the target domain

heterogeneous surface charge and consequently changing the fluid flow in a
solid-state nanochannel with converging-diverging periodicity. It is shown that
the combination of geometry and applied gate voltage (V_{G}) would generate
heterogeneous surface charge at the channel walls which can be modulated by
V_{G}, i.e. a moderate V_{G} (0.7-0.9 V) causes charge inversion in diverging
sections of the channel while V_{G} > 0.9 enables charge inversion in the
entire channel but it is still non-uniform in each section. The results show
that zeta ({\zeta}) potential is a function of V_{G} which shows a linear to
non-linear transition due to dilution of electrolyte in agreement with density
functional theory and Monte Carlo simulations. In contrast, electrolyte
symmetry has a minor effect on the variation of {\zeta} potential. It is also
shown that the difference in {\zeta} potential across the channel
({\Delta}{\zeta}) increases by dilution of electrolyte and utilizing a more
symmetric electrolyte with lower valances. For the first time, it is shown that
{\Delta}{\zeta} presents a maximum with the V_{G}. The V_{G} corresponding to
the maximum {\Delta}{\zeta} decreases with both dilution of electrolyte and
higher anion valance. This is of practical importance to overcome leakage

velocity field can be altered by changing both electrolyte concentration and
symmetry. However, applying VG was found to be a more efficient way than
electrolyte modifications. This includes generating circulation inside the

has attracted great interests. Inspired by low-rank approximation theory,
researchers have proposed a series of effective tensor completion methods.
However, most of these methods directly consider the global low-rankness of
underlying tensors, which is not sufficient for a low sampling rate; in
addition, the single nuclear norm or its relaxation is usually adopted to
approximate the rank function, which would lead to suboptimal solution deviated
from the original one. To alleviate the above problems, in this paper, we
propose a novel low-rank approximation of tensor multi-modes (LRATM), in which
a double nonconvex $L_{\gamma}$ norm is designed to represent the underlying
joint-manifold drawn from the modal factorization factors of the underlying
tensor. A block successive upper-bound minimization method-based algorithm is
designed to efficiently solve the proposed model, and it can be demonstrated
that our numerical scheme converges to the coordinatewise minimizers. Numerical
results on three types of public multi-dimensional datasets have tested and
shown that our algorithm can recover a variety of low-rank tensors with

multi-stream regions with different number of streams. Volume elements change
the parity by turning inside out when passing through the caustic stage. Being
measure-zero structures, identification of caustics via matter density fields
is usually restricted to fine-grained simulations. Instead a generic purely
geometric algorithm can be employed to identify caustics directly by using
triangulation of Lagrangian sub-manifold x(q, t) where x and q are Eulerian and
Lagrangian coordinates obtained in N-body simulations. The caustic surfaces are
approximated by a set of triangles with vertices being the particles in the
simulation. It is demonstrated that finding a dark matter halo is quite
feasible by building its owtermost convex caustic. Neither more specific
assumptions about the geometry of the boundary nor ad hoc parameters are
needed. The halo boundary in our idealized but undoubtably generic simulation
is neither spherical nor ellipsoidal but rather remarkably asymmetrical. The
analysis of the kinetic and potential energies of individual particles and the
halo as a whole along with an examination of the two-dimensional phase space

June. We use a compartmentalized model to study the effects of testing capacity
and social distancing measures on the evolution of the pandemic in the

dramatically if it is to counterbalance even relatively small relaxations in
social distancing measures in the immediate post-Pause period. In particular,
if the City performs 20,000 tests per day and relaxes the social distancing
measures to the pre-Pause norms, then the total number of deaths by the end of
September can reach 250,000. By keeping the social distancing measures to
somewhere halfway between the pre- and in-Pause norms and performing 100,000
tests per day, the total number of deaths by the end of September can be kept
at around 27,000. Going back to the pre-Pause social distancing norms quickly
must be accompanied by an exorbitant testing capacity, if one is to suppress
excessive deaths. If the City is to go back to the ""pre-Pause"" social
distancing norms in the immediate post-Pause period and keep the total number
of deaths by the end of September at around 35,000, then it should be
performing 500,000 tests per day. Our findings have important implications on

and even by old traditions practiced in our daily lives. Eventually, it may
induce unexpected new technologies after deeply explored. In this paper,
inspired by the wearing of traditional cloth, named sarong, by the community in
the South East Asian countries and others, we investigated the behavior of
sheets folded like rolling of sarong around the stomach. Simple equipment was
designed to qualitatively collect the data and combined with simple modeling.
Rolling of the sarong around the stomach generates the joining force of two
sheets, increasing proportionally to the square of the number of rolling. This
finding is potentially applied for developing a method for strongly joining
sheets by simply rolling and releasing the join by simply unrolling. This work
can also be simply duplicated elsewhere so that it is worthy of teaching
materials at undergraduate levels. Both scientific and teaching contents can be
extracted simultaneously.

from fossil fuels to low-carbon technology. A way to achieve this is to
decarbonize the electricity grid. However, further efforts must be made in
other fields such as transport and heating for full decarbonization. This would
reduce carbon emissions due to electricity generation, and also help to
decarbonize other sources such as automotive and heating by enabling a
low-carbon alternative. Carbon taxes have been shown to be an efficient way to
aid in this transition. In this paper, we demonstrate how to to find optimal
carbon tax policies through a genetic algorithm approach, using the electricity
market agent-based model ElecSim. To achieve this, we use the NSGA-II genetic
algorithm to minimize average electricity price and relative carbon intensity
of the electricity mix. We demonstrate that it is possible to find a range of
carbon taxes to suit differing objectives. Our results show that we are able to
minimize electricity cost to below \textsterling10/MWh as well as carbon
intensity to zero in every case. In terms of the optimal carbon tax strategy,
we found that an increasing strategy between 2020 and 2035 was preferable. Each
of the Pareto-front optimal tax strategies are at least above

order model (ROM) from just input-output data of a given system. ERA creates
the ROM while keeping the number of internal states to a minimum level. This
was first implemented by Juang and Pappa (1984) to analyze the vibration of
aerospace structures from impulse response. We reviewed ERA and tested it on
single input single output (SISO) system as well as on multiple input single
output (MISO) system. ERA prediction agreed with the actual data. Unlike other
model reduction techniques (Balanced truncation, balanced proper orthogonal
decomposition), ERA works just as fine without the need of the adjoint system,
that makes ERA a promising, completely data-driven, thrifty model reduction
method. In this work, we propose a modified Eigensystem Realization Algorithm
that relies upon an optimally chosen time resolution for the output used and
also checks for good performance through frequency analysis. Four examples are
discussed: the first two confirm the model generating ability and the last two
illustrate its capability to produce a low-dimensional model (for a large scale
system) that is much more accurate than the one produced by the traditional
ERA.

an automatically generated causal loop diagram. The diagrams are generated
using tools developed by people working in graph theory and the generated

upon to generate stock and flow diagrams. Automated stock and flow diagram
generation opens the door to representing models developed using only

models can be large, the application of grouping techniques, again developed
for graph theory, can help structure the resulting diagrams in the most usable

generation and shows a number of examples of their uses in large models. The
application of these techniques to existing, but inaccessible, equation-based

the necessity of including loops that are important at different points in the

cannot be determined from static analysis of the model structure. We then
describe an algorithm that can be used to discover the most important loops in
