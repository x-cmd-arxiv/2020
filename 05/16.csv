  for Energy Efficient Mobile Processors","To appear at ISCA 2020",,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are three domains in a modern thermally-constrained mobile
system-on-chip (SoC): compute, IO, and memory. We observe that a modern SoC
typically allocates a fixed power budget, corresponding to worst-case
performance demands, to the IO and memory domains even if they are
underutilized. The resulting unfair allocation of the power budget across
domains can cause two major issues: 1) the IO and memory domains can operate at
a higher frequency and voltage than necessary, increasing power consumption and
2) the unused power budget of the IO and memory domains cannot be used to
increase the throughput of the compute domain, hampering performance. To avoid
these issues, it is crucial to dynamically orchestrate the distribution of the
SoC power budget across the three domains based on their actual performance
demands.
  We propose SysScale, a new multi-domain power management technique to improve
the energy efficiency of mobile SoCs. SysScale is based on three key ideas.
First, SysScale introduces an accurate algorithm to predict the performance
(e.g., bandwidth and latency) demands of the three SoC domains. Second,
SysScale uses a new DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) mechanism to
distribute the SoC power to each domain according to the predicted performance
demands. Third, in addition to using a global DVFS mechanism, SysScale uses
domain-specialized techniques to optimize the energy efficiency of each domain
at different operating points.
  We implement SysScale on an Intel Skylake microprocessor for mobile devices
and evaluate it using a wide variety of SPEC CPU2006, graphics (3DMark), and
battery life workloads (e.g., video playback). On a 2-core Skylake, SysScale
improves the performance of SPEC CPU2006 and 3DMark workloads by up to 16% and
8.9% (9.2% and 7.9% on average), respectively.

near-field phenomena of hexagonal patterns composed of uniform nanorings and

uncover the interaction of localized and propagating modes, artificial
rectangular patterns composed of a singlet nanoring, singlet horizontal

analyzed. It was demonstrated that the interacting C2 and C1 localized
resonances on the (approximately) horizontal nanocrescents in C orientation

(in)dependent localized resonance on the (nanorings) nanocrescents coupled with

The spectral response of the complex miniarray pattern can be precisely tuned
by varying the geometrical parameters of the moderately interacting nanoholes
and the pattern period. Enhancement of dipolar emitter's fluorescence is
demonstrated in appropriate configurations that have a potential application in

challenging, as emotions (here: anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise)

difficulties of this task, we design a transparent emotion style transfer
pipeline based on three steps: (1) select the words that are promising to be
substituted to change the emotion (with a brute-force approach and selection
based on the attention mechanism of an emotion classifier), (2) find sets of
words as candidates for substituting the words (based on lexical and
distributional semantics), and (3) select the most promising combination of
substitutions with an objective function which consists of components for
content (based on BERT sentence embeddings), emotion (based on an emotion
classifier), and fluency (based on a neural language model). This comparably
straight-forward setup enables us to explore the task and understand in what
cases lexical substitution can vary the emotional load of texts, how changes in
content and style interact and if they are at odds. We further evaluate our
pipeline quantitatively in an automated and an annotation study based on Tweets

conflicting objectives: as we show in a qualitative analysis motivated by
Scherer's emotion component model, this is particularly the case for implicit
emotion expressions based on cognitive appraisal or descriptions of bodily

cosmic star formation rate (CSFR) is essential for using LGRBs as cosmological
probes. In this work, we collect a large sample composed of 371 Swift LGRBs
with known redshifts and prompt emission properties. We first compare the
rest-frame prompt properties of these bursts in different redshift bins,
finding negligible redshift evolution of the luminosity of LGRBs with
$L_{\mathrm{iso}}\gtrsim10^{51}\,\mathrm{erg\, s^{-1}}$ between $z\sim1$ and
$z\sim4$. Then, by utilizing the CSFR obtained from the large-scale
cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, the Illustris simulation, we calculate
the cumulative redshift distribution of LGRBs under different metallicity
thresholds. After comparing with our sample, we find that the predictions with
a moderate threshold between $0.3\,Z_{\odot}\leqslant
Z_{\mathrm{th}}\leqslant1.0\,Z_{\odot}$ are consistent with the sample between
redshift $0<z<3$, while at higher redshifts between $3<z<5$, all metallicity
thresholds fit the data well. When changing to an empirical model based on
observations, the predictions show similar results as well. After comparing
with the metallicity distribution of the observed LGRB host galaxies between
$0<z<1$, we confirm that the production of LGRBs in galaxies with super-solar
metallicity is suppressed. Nevertheless, considering that a significant
fraction of stars are born in sub-solar metallicity environments at
$z\gtrsim3$, we suggest that, as a first approximation, LGRBs can be used as
direct tracers of the CSFR in this redshift range.

propose a residual echo suppression method based on the modification of fully
convolutional time-domain audio separation network (Conv-TasNet). Both the
residual signal of the linear acoustic echo cancellation system, and the output
of the adaptive filter are adopted to form multiple streams for the
Conv-TasNet, resulting in more effective echo suppression while keeping a lower
latency of the whole system. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the
proposed method in both single-talk and double-talk situations.

approaches to curtailing harmful contagions in myriad settings. As studied,
these strategies are often impractical to implement, as they typically assume
complete knowledge of the network structure, which is unusual in practice. In
this paper, we investigate how different immunization strategies perform under
realistic conditions where the strategies are informed by partially-observed
network data. Our results suggest that global immunization strategies, like
degree immunization, are optimal in most cases; the exception is at very high
levels of missing data, where stochastic strategies, like acquaintance
immunization, begin to outstrip them in minimizing outbreaks. Stochastic
strategies are more robust in some cases due to the different ways in which
they can be affected by missing data. In fact, one of our proposed variants of
acquaintance immunization leverages a logistically-realistic ongoing
survey-intervention process as a form of targeted data-recovery to improve with
increasing levels of missing data. These results support the effectiveness of
targeted immunization as a general practice. They also highlight the risks of
considering networks as idealized mathematical objects: overestimating the
accuracy of network data and foregoing the rewards of additional inquiry.

  analysis",,,,,"physics.plasm-ph","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  The design of a stellarator with acceptable confinement properties requires
optimization of the magnetic field in the non-convex, high-dimensional spaces
describing their geometry. Another major challenge facing the stellarator
program is the sensitive dependence of confinement properties on
electro-magnetic coil shapes, necessitating the construction of the coils under
tight tolerances. In this Thesis, we address these challenges with the
application of adjoint methods and shape sensitivity analysis. Adjoint methods
enable the efficient computation of the gradient of a function that depends on
the solution to a system of equations, such as linear or nonlinear PDEs. This
enables gradient-based optimization in high-dimensional spaces and efficient
sensitivity analysis. We present the first applications of adjoint methods for
stellarator shape optimization. The first example we discuss is the
optimization of coil shapes based on the generalization of a continuous current
potential model. Understanding the sensitivity of coil metrics to perturbations
of the winding surface allows us to understand features of configurations that
enable simpler coils. We next consider solutions of the drift-kinetic equation.
An adjoint drift-kinetic equation is derived based on the self-adjointness
property of the Fokker-Planck collision operator, allowing us to compute the
sensitivity of neoclassical quantities to perturbations of the magnetic field
strength. Finally, we consider functions that depend on solutions of the MHD
equilibrium equations. We generalize the self-adjointness property of the MHD
force operator to include perturbations of the rotational transform and the
currents outside the confinement region. This self-adjointness property is
applied to develop an adjoint method for computing the derivatives of such
functions with respect to perturbations of coil shapes or the plasma boundary.

largest-ever simulated sample of {\it field} ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs). At
$z=0$, we find that isolated UDGs have average star formation rates, colors,

moderately elevated HI masses, being 70\% (300\%) more HI-rich than typical
isolated dwarf galaxies at luminosities brighter (fainter) than
M$_\mathrm{B}$=-14. However, UDGs are consistent with the general isolated
dwarf galaxy population and make up $\sim$20\% of all field galaxies with
10$^7$<M$_\star$/M$_\odot$<10$^{9}$. The HI masses, effective radii, and
overall appearances of our UDGs are consistent with existing observations of
field UDGs, but we predict that many isolated UDGs have been missed by current
surveys. Despite their isolation at $z=0$, the UDGs in our sample are the
products of major mergers. Mergers are no more common in UDG than non-UDG
progenitors, but mergers that create UDGs tend to happen earlier - almost never
occurring after $z=1$, produce a temporary boost in spin, and cause star
formation to be redistributed to the outskirts of galaxies, resulting in lower
central star formation rates. The centers of the galaxies fade as their central
stellar populations age, but their global star formation rates are maintained
through bursts of star formation at larger radii, producing steeper negative
g-r color gradients. This formation channel is unique relative to other
proposals for UDG formation in isolated galaxies, demonstrating that UDGs can
potentially be formed through multiple mechanisms.

Coulomb potential at the location of a charged particle. However, these
particle-like solutions possess a globally regular metric, and their effective
stress energy tensor is free from pathologies, as well. We determine the domain
of existence for particle-like solutions in a number of
Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, considering dilatonic and power-law
coupling functions, and we analyze the physical properties of the solutions.
Interestingly, the solutions may possess pairs of lightrings, and thus
represent ultra-compact objects. We determine the location of these lightrings,
and study the effective potential for the occurrence of echoes in the
gravitational-wave spectrum. We also address the relation of these
particle-like solutions to the respective wormhole and black-hole solutions,
and clarify the limiting procedure to recover the Fisher solution (also known
as Janis-Newman-Winicourt-Wyman solution).

exact results are available only for small systems by quantum Monte Carlo. For
this reason and, due to the problems of DMRG in simulating 2D and 3D systems,
alternative methods such as Green functions combined with many-body
approximations (GFMBA), that do not have this restriction, are highly
important. However, it has remained open whether the approximate character of
GFMBA simulations prevents the computation of the Hubbard gap. Here we present
new GFMBA results that demonstrate that GFMBA simulations are capable of
producing reliable data for the gap which agrees well with the DMRG benchmarks
in 1D. An interesting observation is that the accuracy of the gap can be
significantly increased when the simulations give up certain symmetry
restriction of the exact system, such as spin symmetry and spatial homogeneity.

  Optimizing Covid-19 Pandemic Government Actions",,,,,"cs.LG physics.soc-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Whenever countries are threatened by a pandemic, as is the case with the
COVID-19 virus, governments should take the right actions to safeguard public
health as well as to mitigate the negative effects on the economy. In this
regard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a
restrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously
damage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may
put at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be
somewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is
necessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other
measures. In this paper, we use the SEIR epidemiological model (Susceptible -
Exposed - Infected - Recovered) for infectious diseases to represent the
evolution of the virus COVID-19 over time in the population. To optimize the
best sequences of actions governments can take, we propose a methodology with
two approaches, one based on Deep Q-Learning and another one based on Genetic
Algorithms. The sequences of actions (confinement, self-isolation, two-meter
distance or not taking restrictions) are evaluated according to a reward system
focused on meeting two objectives: firstly, getting few people infected so that
hospitals are not overwhelmed with critical patients, and secondly, avoiding
taking drastic measures for too long which can potentially cause serious damage
to the economy. The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid
tool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of
a pandemic in both senses. We also prove that the approach based on Deep
Q-Learning overcomes the one based on Genetic Algorithms for optimizing the
sequences of actions.

persistence characteristics of large capacity storage devices(e.g., HDDs and
SSDs), while providing the low access latency and byte-addressablity of
traditional DRAM memory. This unique combination of features open up several
new design considerations when building database management systems (DBMSs),
such as replacing DRAM (as the main working space memory) or block devices (as
the persistent storage), or complementing both at the same time for several
DBMS components (such as access methods,storage engine, buffer management,
logging/recovery, etc).
  However, interacting with NVM requires changes to application software to
best use the device (e.g. mmap and clflush of small cache lines instead of
write and fsync of large page buffers). Before introducing (potentially major)
code changes to the DBMS for NVM, developers need a clear understanding of NVM
performance in various conditions to help make better design choices.
  In this paper, we provide extensive performance evaluations conducted with a
recently released NVM device, Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory (PMem), under
different configurations with several micro-benchmark tools. Further, we
evaluate OLTP and OLAP database workloads (i.e., TPC-C and TPC-H) with
Microsoft SQL Server 2019 when using the NVM device as an in-memory buffer pool
or persistent storage. From the lessons learned we share some recommendations
for future DBMS design with PMem, e.g.simple hardware or software changes are
not enough for the best use of PMem in DBMSs.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We take into account the presence of
asymptomatic infections and the main policies that have been adopted so far to
contain the epidemic: isolation (or social distancing) of a portion of the
population, quarantine for confirmed cases and testing. We model isolation by
separating the population in two groups: one composed by key-workers that keep
working during the pandemic and have a usual contact rate, and a second group
consisting of people that are enforced/recommended to stay at home. We refer to
quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.
In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of
contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in
time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an
explicit expression for the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ in terms
of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we
can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the
epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic
scenarios. From the expression of $\mathcal{R}_0$ and the simulations we
conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic
cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, {and the stricter these
measures are and the sooner they are implemented,} the more lives can be saved.
Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce
their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to
maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.

scientific practice, often by removing aspects of pedagogical structure to
support student agency and decision-making. We explored how these changes
impact men's and women's participation in group work associated with labs
through clustering methods on the quantified behavior of students. We compared
the group roles students take on in two different types of instructional
settings; (1) highly structured traditional labs, and (2) less structured
inquiry-based labs. Students working in groups in the inquiry-based (less
structured) labs assumed different roles within their groups, however men and
women systematically took on different roles and men behaved differently when
in single- versus mixed-gender groups. We found no such systematic differences
in role division among male and female students in the traditional
(highly-structured) labs. Students in the inquiry-based labs were not overtly
assigned these roles, indicating that the inequitable division of roles was not
a result of explicit assignment. Our results highlight the importance of
structuring equitable group dynamics in educational settings, as a gendered
division of roles can emerge without active intervention. As the culture in
physics evolves to remove systematic gender biases in the field, instructors in
educational settings must not only remove explicitly biased aspects of
curricula but also take active steps to ensure that potentially discriminatory
aspects are not inadvertently reinforced.

practice to analyze data without subjective information. Formal rules usually
obtain these priors distributions, and the data provide the dominant

improper and may lead to improper posterior. Here, we show, for a general
family of distributions, that the obtained objective priors for the parameters
either follow a power-law distribution or has an asymptotic power-law behavior.
As a result, we observed that the exponents of the model are between 0.5 and 1.
Understand these behaviors allow us to easily verify if such priors lead to
proper or improper posteriors directly from the exponent of the power-law. The
general family considered in our study includes essential models such as
Exponential, Gamma, Weibull, Nakagami-m, Haf-Normal, Rayleigh, Erlang, and

misclassify the received signals as noise with high probability while
increasing the BER only slightly. On the other hand, the CJ cannot fool the
eavesdropper by simply transmitting Gaussian noise as in conventional jamming

iteratively construct a distance oracle data structure for the metric of edit

the velocity shears and, in unstable stratification, by buoyancy forces. It is
commonly believed that both mechanisms produce the same type of chaotic
motions, namely, the eddies breaking down into smaller ones and producing
direct cascade of turbulent kinetic energy and other properties from large to
small scales towards viscous dissipation. The conventional theory based on this
vision yields a plausible picture of vertical mixing and remains in use since
the middle of the 20th century in spite of increasing evidence of the fallacy
of almost all other predictions. This paper reveals that in fact buoyancy
produces chaotic vertical plumes, merging into larger ones and producing an
inverse cascade towards their conversion into the self-organized regular
motions. Herein, the velocity shears produce usual eddies spreading in all
directions and making the direct cascade. This new paradigm is demonstrated and
proved empirically; so, the paper launches a comprehensive revision of the

the emergence of traveling patterns in purely diffusive systems with
conservative dynamics. In the absence of non-reciprocity, the binary fluid
mixture undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous mixed state to a
demixed state with spatially separated regions rich in one of the two

breaks both spatial and time translational symmetry, as well as the reflection
parity of the static pattern. We elucidate the generic nature of the transition

chemically interacting colloids that are known to exhibit non-reciprocal

quantify how the SP varies across the population as well as with galactocentric

population synthesis models. This requires spectra with high signal-to-noise
which we achieve by stacking in bins of luminosity (L$_r$) and central velocity
dispersion ($\sigma_0$). We find that: 1) There is a bimodality in the S0
population: S0s more massive than $3\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ show stronger
velocity dispersion and age gradients (age and $\sigma_r$ decrease outwards)
but little or no metallicity gradient, while the less massive ones present
relatively flat age and velocity dispersion profiles, but a significant
metallicity gradient (i.e. [M/H] decreases outwards). Above
$2\times10^{11}M_\odot$ the number of S0s drops sharply. These two mass scales
are also where global scaling relations of ETGs change slope. 2) S0s have
steeper velocity dispersion profiles than fast rotating elliptical galaxies
(E-FRs) of the same luminosity and velocity dispersion. The kinematic profiles
and stellar population gradients of E-FRs are both more similar to those of
slow rotating ellipticals (E-SRs) than to S0s, suggesting that E-FRs are not
simply S0s viewed face-on. 3) At fixed $\sigma_0$, more luminous S0s and E-FRs
are younger, more metal rich and less $\alpha$-enhanced. Evidently for these
galaxies, the usual statement that 'massive galaxies are older' is not true if
$\sigma_0$ is held fixed.

perfect dynamic freezing and provide an analytic explanation for this

the system reaches a steady state with sub-thermal values of the

which are absent for dynamics starting from the $|\mathbb{Z}_2\rangle$ state,
imply a weak violation of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis in finite

oscillations reported earlier. We conjecture that in the thermodynamic limit
such states may exist as pre-thermal steady states that show anomalously slow
relaxation. We supplement our numerical results by deriving an analytic
expression for the Floquet Hamiltonian using a Floquet perturbation theory in

behaviour can be explained by decreasing dust abundance (or density) towards
high redshifts, which would cause the infrared SED at the peak to be more
optically thin, making hot dust more visible to the external observer. From the

stability of extremal black-holes or in terms of long distance Coulomb/Newton
potentials. However one can think of other physical processes to compare the
relative strength of gravity versus other forces. We argue for an alternative
formulation in terms of particle pair production at threshold or, equivalently,
pair annihilation at rest. Imposing that the production rate by any force
mediator (photon or scalar) of pairs of charged particles be larger or equal to
graviton production, we recover known conditions for the $U(1)$ WGC and its
extensions. Unlike other formulations though, threshold pair production is
sensitive to short range couplings present in scalar interactions and gives
rise to a Scalar WGC. Application to moduli scalars gives rise to specific
conditions on the trilinear and quartic couplings which involve first and
second derivatives of the WGC particle mass with respect to the moduli. Some
extremal solutions to these equations correspond to massive states behaving
like BPS, KK and winding states which feature duality invariance and are in
agreement with the Swampland distance conjecture. Conditions for $N=2$ BPS
states saturate our bounds and we discuss specific examples of BPS states which
become massless at large Kahler moduli in Type IIA N=2, D=4 CY and orbifold
compactifications. We study possible implications for potentials depending on
moduli only through WGC massive states. For some simple classes of potentials
one recovers constraints somewhat similar but not equivalent to a Swampland dS
conjecture.

Bright X-ray and radio emission north of the pulsar overlaps with an H$\alpha$
nebula RCW 89. The bright X-rays there have a highly unusual and quite puzzling
morphology, consisting of both very compact thermally emitting knots and much
more diffuse emission of nonthermal origin. We report new X-ray observations of
RCW 89 in 2017 and 2018 with Chandra that allowed us to measure the motions of
many knots and filaments on decade-long time baselines. We identify a fast
blast wave with a velocity of $(4000 \pm 500)d_{5.2}$ km/s ($d_{5.2}$ is the
distance in units of 5.2 kpc) with a purely nonthermal spectrum, and without
any radio counterpart. Many compact X-ray emission knots are moving vary fast,
with velocities as high as 5000 km/s, predominantly radially away from the
pulsar. Their spectra show that they are Ne- and Mg-rich heavy-element SN
ejecta. They have been significantly decelerated upon their recent impact with
the dense ambient medium north of the pulsar. We see fast evolution in
brightness and morphology of knots in just a few years. Ejecta knots in RCW 89
resemble those seen in Cas A at optical wavelengths in terms of their initial
velocities and densities. They might have the same origin, still not understood

\begin{eqnarray*}

Neumann-type initial-boundary value problem, posed in a smoothly bounded planar

a method that learns how to represent data in a disentangled way, with minimal

insight is to decouple the processes of disentanglement and synthesis, by
employing a leading pre-trained unconditional image generator, such as
StyleGAN. By learning to map into its latent space, we leverage both its
state-of-the-art quality, and its rich and expressive latent space, without the
burden of training it. We demonstrate our approach on the complex and high

with temporal identity coherency in image sequences. Through extensive
experimentation, we show that our method successfully disentangles identity

phase at 90\,K, and becomes a superconductor below 8\,K. The orthorhombic phase
is sometimes called a nematic phase because quantum oscillation, neutron, and
other measurements detect a significant asymmetry in $x$ and $y$. How
nematicity affects superconductivity has recently become a matter of intense
speculation. Here we employ an advanced \emph{ab-initio} Green's function
description of superconductivity and show that bulk tetragonal FeSe would, in
principle, superconduct with almost the same T$_{c}$ as the nematic phase. The
mechanism driving the observed nematicity is not yet understood. Since the
present theory underestimates nematicity, we simulate the full nematic
asymmetry by artificially enhancing the orthorhombic distortion. For
benchmarking, we compare theoretical spin susceptibilities against
experimentally observed data over all energies and relevant momenta. When the
orthorhombic distortion is adjusted to correlate with observed nematicity in
spin susceptibility, the enhanced nematicity causes spectral weight
redistribution in the Fe-3d$_{xz}$ and d$_{yz}$ orbitals, but it leads to at
most 10-15$\%$ increment in T$_{c}$. This is because the d$_{xy}$ orbital
always remains the most strongly correlated and provides most of the source of
the superconducting glue. Nematicity suppresses the density of states at Fermi
level; nevertheless T$_{c}$ increases, in contradiction to both BCS and BEC
theories. We show how the increase is connected to the structure of the
particle-particle vertex. Our results suggest while nematicity may be intrinsic
property of bulk FeSe, is not the primary force driving the superconducting
pairing.

center to nearby edge nodes. Nonetheless, one open challenge of this emerging
paradigm lies in the potential security issues on edge nodes and end devices,
e.g., sensors and controllers. This paper proposes a cooperative protocol,
namely DEAN, across edge nodes to prevent data manipulation, and to allow fair
data sharing with quick recovery under resource constraints of limited storage,
computing, and network capacity. Specifically, DEAN leverages a parallel
mechanism equipped with three independent core components, effectively
achieving low resource consumption while allowing secured parallel block
processing on edge nodes. We have implemented a system prototype based on DEAN
and experimentally verified its effectiveness with a comparison with three
popular blockchain implementations: Ethereum, Parity, and Hyperledger Fabric.
Experimental results show that the system prototype exhibits high resilience to
arbitrary failures: the percentile of trusty nodes is much higher than the
required 50\% in most cases. Performance-wise, DEAN-based blockchain
implementation outperforms the state-of-the-art blockchain systems with up to
$25\times$ higher throughput and $18\times$ lower latency on 1,000 nodes.

describing batter versus pitcher matchups in baseball. We first estimate the
distribution of balls put into play by a batter facing a pitcher, called the
empirical spray chart distribution. Many individual matchups have a sample size
that is too small to be reliable for use in predicting future outcomes.
Synthetic versions of the batter and pitcher under consideration are
constructed in order to alleviate these concerns. Weights governing how much

a Shiny web application that allows users to visualize and evaluate any
batter-pitcher matchup that has occurred or could have occurred during the
Statcast era (specifically 2017-present). This methodology and web application
could be used to determine defensive alignments, lineup construction, or
pitcher selection through estimation of spray densities based on any input
matchup. One can access this web application at
https://seam.stat.illinois.edu/. The computational speed with which the method
calculates the spray densities allows the app to display the visualizations for

performed. Tabulated data of H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_3$OH, HCOOH observed by

the literature. The observational data shows that ice column density and
spectral index ($\alpha$), used to classify the evolutionary stage, are well
correlated. A 2D continuum radiative transfer simulation containing bare and
grains covered by ices at different levels of cosmic-ray processing were used
to calculate the Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) in different angle
inclinations between face-on and edge-on configuration. The H$_2$O:CO$_2$ ice
mixture was used to address the H$_2$O and CO$_2$ column density variation
whereas the CH$_3$OH and HCOOH are a byproduct of the virgin ice after the
energetic processing. The simulated spectra were used to calculate the ice
column densities of YSOs in an evolutionary sequence. As a result, the models
show that the ice column density variation of HCOOH with $\alpha$ can be
justified by the envelope dissipation and ice energetic processing. On the
other hand, the ice column densities are mostly overestimated in the cases of
H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and CH$_3$OH, even though the physical and cosmic-ray processing

mixing assumptions. In 22 cases H-He interactions induce local nuclear energy
release in the range $ \sim 10^{9} - 10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{L}_{\odot}$. The
luminosities on the upper end of this range amount to a substantial fraction of

assumptions. We distinguish four types of H-He interactions depending on the
evolutionary phase and convective stability of the He-rich material. H-burning

simulations presented here likely cannot explain the observed Ca abundance in
the most Ca-poor CEMP-no star. We describe the evolution leading to H-He
interactions, which occur during or shortly after core-contraction phases.
Three simulations without a H-He interaction are computed to Fe-core infall and
a $140\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ simulation becomes pair-unstable. We also discuss

graphene for different doping levels. Our investigation is focused on the
emergence, stability, and manifestations of nematicity of the ordered
low-temperature electronic state. It is known that, at vanishing interactions,
the low-energy spectrum of the system studied consists of four almost-flat
almost-degenerate bands. Electron-electron repulsion lifts this degeneracy. To
account for such an interaction effect, a numerical mean-field theory is used.
Assuming that the ground state has spin-density-wave-like order, we introduce a
multicomponent order parameter describing spin magnetization. Our simulations
show that the order parameter structure depends on the doping level. In
particular, doping away from the charge neutrality point reduces the rotational
symmetry of the ordered state, indicating the appearance of an electron nematic
state. Manifestations of the nematicity can be observed in the spatial
distribution of the spin magnetization within a moir{\'e} cell, as well as in
the single-electron band structure. The nematicity is strongest at half-filling
(two extra electron or holes per supercell). We argue that nematic symmetry
breaking is a robust feature of the system ground state, stable against model
parameters variations. Specifically, it is shown that, away from the charge
neutrality point, it persists for all three parametrizations of the interlayer
hopping amplitudes discussed in the paper. Obtained theoretical results are
consistent with the available experimental data.

looking as an interference between fully distinguishable particles. The sources
of this effect are identified as to be determined by the many particle nature
of space of states of the quantum field theory. It is firstly underlined that
in order to explain the observed oscillations, the neutrino subspace of states
should not be interpreted as the direct product of the three neutrinos Fock
spaces, which is equivalent to imposing a superselection rule. Further, it is
argued that the linear completion of such a direct product space of states
permits to describe the measured oscillations. Thus, the space of states of te
Standard Model (SM) should be interpreted as the linear completion of the
direct product of all the Fock spaces (boson or fermions ones) associated to
the distinguishable particles. Then, it follows that the neutrino oscillations
are determined as interference between independent particles, which are
generated by states being outside the direct product of the neutrino Fock
spaces. This interpretation seems to imply a large amount of interference
observations between distinguishable particles in Particle as well as in
Condensed Matter Physics. For seeking clearness, the discussion is done in the
framework of a simple Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model of two relativistic free

jitter. Extending from a dimensionality of two in discrete polarization
variables, here we demonstrate a hyperentangled, mode-locked, biphoton
frequency comb with a time-frequency Hilbert space dimensionality of at least
648. Hong-Ou-Mandel revivals of the biphoton qubits are observed with 61
time-bin recurrences, biphoton joint spectral correlations over 19
frequency-bins, and an overall interference visibility of the high-dimensional
qubits up to 98.4%. We describe the Schmidt mode decomposition analysis of the
high-dimensional entanglement, in both time- and frequency-bin subspaces, not
only verifying the entanglement dimensionality but also examining the
time-frequency scaling. We observe a Bell violation of the high-dimensional
qubits up to 18.5 standard deviations, with recurrent correlation-fringe

that describes a single scalar quantity as it evolves on a circular array of
sites, undergoing forcing, dissipation, and rotation invariant advection.
Lorenz constructed the system as a test problem for numerical weather
prediction. Since then, the system has also found widespread use as a test case
in data assimilation. Mathematically, it belongs to a class of dynamical
systems with a single bifurcation parameter (rescaled forcing) that undergoes
multiple bifurcations and exhibits chaotic behavior for large forcing. In this
paper, the main characteristics of the advection term in the model are
identified and used to describe and classify a number of possible
generalizations of the system. A graphical method to study the bifurcation
behavior of constant solutions is introduced, and it is shown how to use the
rotation invariance to compute normal forms of the system analytically.
Problems with site-dependent forcing, dissipation, or advection are considered
and basic existence and stability results are proved for these extensions. We
address some related topics in the appendices, wherein the Lorenz '96 system in
Fourier space is considered, explicit solutions for some advection-only systems

The framework admits the mutual effect between the pedestrian and the vehicle.
A multi-state social force based pedestrian motion model was designed to
describe the microscopic motion of the pedestrian crossing behavior. The
pedestrian model considers major interaction factors such as the accepted gap
of the pedestrian's decision on when to start crossing, the desired speed of
the pedestrian, and the effect of the vehicle on the pedestrian while the
pedestrian is crossing the road. Vehicle driving strategies focus on the
longitudinal motion control, for which the feedback obstacle avoidance control
and the model predictive control were tested and compared in the framework. The
simulation results verified that the proposed framework can generate a variety
of VPI scenarios, consisting of either the pedestrian yielding to the vehicle
or the vehicle yielding to the pedestrian. The framework can be easily extended

based on an image. Popular methods in the past have explored image-to-sequence
architectures trained with maximum likelihood which have demonstrated
meaningful generated questions given an image and its associated ground-truth
answer. VQG becomes more challenging if the image contains rich contextual
information describing its different semantic categories. In this paper, we try
to exploit the different visual cues and concepts in an image to generate
questions using a variational autoencoder (VAE) without ground-truth answers.
Our approach solves two major shortcomings of existing VQG systems: (i)
minimize the level of supervision and (ii) replace generic questions with
category relevant generations. Most importantly, by eliminating expensive
answer annotations, the required supervision is weakened. Using different
categories enables us to exploit different concepts as the inference requires
only the image and the category. Mutual information is maximized between the
image, question, and answer category in the latent space of our VAE. A novel
category consistent cyclic loss is proposed to enable the model to generate
consistent predictions with respect to the answer category, reducing
redundancies and irregularities. Additionally, we also impose supplementary
constraints on the latent space of our generative model to provide structure
based on categories and enhance generalization by encapsulating decorrelated
features within each dimension. Through extensive experiments, the proposed
model, C3VQG outperforms state-of-the-art VQG methods with weak supervision.

Moreover, the principal drawback of theory-driven models lies in the
prohibitive computational cost of simulating source observables from {\it ab

conservation. We obtain the well-known result that for an incident angle, there
can be generally two different refraction angles for refraction into the two
spin eigenstates in the refraction medium, resulting in two different 'spin
refractive indices' and two critical angles for total internal reflection. We
derive expressions for the spin refractive indices, which are not constant for

mass of an electron in the refraction medium is larger than that in the
incidence medium, then we show that for some incident electron energies and
potential barrier at the interface, the spin refractive index of the incidence
medium can lie between the two spin refractive indices of the refraction
medium, resulting in only one critical angle. In that case, if the incident
angle exceeds that critical angle, then refraction can occur into only one spin
eigenstate in the refraction medium. If the system is engineered to make this

astrophysical plasma processes. It has been demonstrated that the omnipresent
turbulence in astrophysical media induces fast magnetic reconnection, which
consequently leads to large-scale magnetic flux diffusion at a rate independent
of the plasma microphysics. This process is called ``reconnection diffusion''
(RD) and allows for the diffusion of fields which are dynamically important.
The current theory describing RD is based on incompressible magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence. In this work, we have tested quantitatively the predictions
of the RD theory when magnetic forces are dominant in the turbulence dynamics
(Alfv\'{e}nic Mach number $M_A < 1$). We employed the \textsc{Pencil Code} to
perform numerical simulations of forced MHD turbulence, extracting the values
of the diffusion coefficient $\eta_{RD}$ using the Test-Field method. Our
results are consistent with the RD theory ($\eta_{RD} \sim M_A^{3}$ for $M_A <
1$) when turbulence approaches the incompressible limit (sonic Mach number $M_S
\lesssim 0.02$), while for larger $M_S$ the diffusion is faster ($\eta_{RD}
\sim M_A^{2}$). This work shows for the first time simulations of compressible
MHD turbulence with the suppression of the cascade in the direction parallel to
the mean magnetic field, which is consistent with incompressible weak
turbulence theory. We also verified that in our simulations the energy
cascading time does not follow the scaling with $M_A$ predicted for the weak
regime, in contradiction with the RD theory assumption. Our results generally
support and expand the RD theory predictions.

studied. More precisely, we consider the setting in which clients in a

local datasets. The information exchange between the clients and the PS takes
places over a MAC channel and must also preserve the DP of the local datasets.
Accordingly, the objective of the clients is to minimize the training loss
subject to (i) rate constraints for reliable communication over the MAC and
(ii) DP constraint over the local datasets. For this optimization scenario, we
proposed a novel consensus scheme in which digital distributed stochastic
gradient descent (D-DSGD) is performed by each client. To preserve DP, a
digital artificial noise is also added by the users to the locally quantized
gradients. The performance of the scheme is evaluated in terms of the
convergence rate and DP level for a given MAC capacity. The performance is
optimized over the choice of the quantization levels and the artificial noise
parameters. Numerical evaluations are presented to validate the performance of
the proposed scheme.

The concealment cell can provide a recurrent neural network (ConcealNet), that

extending this with an end-to-end emotion prediction neural network provides a

seamlessly without a trusted intermediary. Although Distributed Ledger
Technologies (DLTs) could provide such a platform, blockchains, such as
Bitcoin, were not designed with IoT networks in mind, hence are often
unsuitable for such applications: they offer poor transaction throughput and
confirmation times, put stress on constrained computing and storage resources,
and require high transaction fees. In this work, we consider a class of
IoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain,
and with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However,
without PoW, implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm
to manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We
model the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair,
efficient and secure. Our algorithm represents a new design paradigm for DLTs
in which concepts from networking are applied to the DLT setting for the first
time. For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting which is similar
in nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution
features novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in
which no individual agent can be trusted. Our algorithm guarantees utilisation
of resources, consistency, fairness, and resilience against attackers. All of
this is achieved efficiently and with regard for the limitations of IoT

quadrature schemes for integrating functions over planar regions bounded by

find intermediate quadrature rules for line integrals along the region's
boundary curves corresponding to Green's theorem. (2) We then use a high-order
quadrature rule to compute the numerical antiderivative of the integrand along
a coordinate axis, which is used to evaluate the Green's theorem line integral.
We present two methods to compute the intermediate quadrature rule. The first
is spectrally accurate (it converges faster than any algebraic order with
respect to number of quadrature points) and is relatively easy to implement,
but has no guarantee of polynomial exactness. The second guarantees exactness
for polynomial integrands up to a pre-specified degree k with an a priori-known

first, but is slightly more complicated. The quadrature schemes have
applications to computation of geometric moments, immersogeometric analysis,
conservative field transfer between high-order meshes, and initialization of

The Information Bottleneck (IB) theory predicts that layers maximize relevant
information and compress irrelevant information. Due to the limitations in MI
estimation from samples, there is an ongoing debate about the properties of the
IP for the supervised learning case. In this work, we derive a theoretical
convergence for the IP of autoencoders. The theory predicts that ideal
autoencoders with a large bottleneck layer size do not compress input
information, whereas a small size causes compression only in the encoder
layers. For the experiments, we use a Gram-matrix based MI estimator recently
proposed in the literature. We propose a new rule to adjust its parameters that
compensates scale and dimensionality effects. Using our proposed rule, we
obtain experimental IPs closer to the theory. Our theoretical IP for
autoencoders could be used as a benchmark to validate new methods to estimate
MI in neural networks. In this way, experimental limitations could be

Learning-Compression (LC) algorithm, that allows a user to compress a neural
network or other machine learning model using different compression schemes
with minimal effort. Currently, the supported compressions include pruning,
quantization, low-rank methods (including automatically learning the layer
ranks), and combinations of those, and the user can choose different
compression types for different parts of a neural network.
  The LC algorithm alternates two types of steps until convergence: a learning
(L) step, which trains a model on a dataset (using an algorithm such as SGD);
and a compression (C) step, which compresses the model parameters (using a
compression scheme such as low-rank or quantization). This decoupling of the
""machine learning"" aspect from the ""signal compression"" aspect means that
changing the model or the compression type amounts to calling the corresponding
subroutine in the L or C step, respectively. The library fully supports this by
design, which makes it flexible and extensible. This does not come at the
expense of performance: the runtime needed to compress a model is comparable to
that of training the model in the first place; and the compressed model is
competitive in terms of prediction accuracy and compression ratio with other
algorithms (which are often specialized for specific models or compression
schemes). The library is written in Python and PyTorch and available in Github.

can be observed as distinctive micro-structures in the electroencephalogram
(EEG), such as sleep spindles and K-complexes. These events have been
associated with biological processes and neurological disorders, making them a
research topic in sleep medicine. However, manual detection limits their study
because it is time-consuming and affected by significant inter-expert
variability, motivating automatic approaches. We propose a deep learning
approach based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks for sleep EEG
event detection called Recurrent Event Detector (RED). RED uses one of two
input representations: a) the time-domain EEG signal, or b) a complex
spectrogram of the signal obtained with the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).
Unlike previous approaches, a fixed time window is avoided and temporal context
is integrated to better emulate the visual criteria of experts. When evaluated
on the MASS dataset, our detectors outperform the state of the art in both
sleep spindle and K-complex detection with a mean F1-score of at least 80.9%
and 82.6%, respectively. Although the CWT-domain model obtained a similar
performance than its time-domain counterpart, the former allows in principle a
more interpretable input representation due to the use of a spectrogram. The
proposed approach is event-agnostic and can be used directly to detect other
types of sleep events.

parameters is important for personalized physiological models. However, these
tissue properties are spatially varying across the underlying anatomical model,
presenting a significance challenge of high-dimensional (HD) optimization at
the presence of limited measurement data. A common solution to reduce the
dimension of the parameter space is to explicitly partition the anatomical
mesh, either into a fixed small number of segments or a multi-scale hierarchy.
This anatomy-based reduction of parameter space presents a fundamental
bottleneck to parameter estimation, resulting in solutions that are either too
low in resolution to reflect tissue heterogeneity, or too high in dimension to
be reliably estimated within feasible computation. In this paper, we present a
novel concept that embeds a generative variational auto-encoder (VAE) into the
objective function of Bayesian optimization, providing an implicit
low-dimensional (LD) search space that represents the generative code of the HD
spatially-varying tissue properties. In addition, the VAE-encoded knowledge
about the generative code is further used to guide the exploration of the
search space. The presented method is applied to estimating tissue excitability
in a cardiac electrophysiological model. Synthetic and real-data experiments
demonstrate its ability to improve the accuracy of parameter estimation with
more than 10x gain in efficiency.

well understood. In this paper, we examined the relationship between academic
performance as measured by a standardized test and sleep patterns using data
from a Russian panel study (N = 4,400) that was nationally representative for
one age cohort (20-21 years old). In addition to self-reported sleep patterns,
the data set contained information about participants' online activities over a
period of up to 10 years, which allowed us to track the evolution of this
relationship over time. We found that high academic performance was associated
with shorter sleep, later bedtime, and increased online activity at night. The
relationship between high academic performance and online activity at night was
stable over a period of 5 years. Our findings suggest that the relationship
between academic performance and sleep patterns can be more complex than
previously believed and that high performance may be achieved at the expense of
individual well-being.

presence of very massive stars or blue stragglers in the center of those

Universe and shown to yield stars that may collapse at some points into an
intermediate mass black hole. Although the early evolution of star clusters
requires the explicit modeling of the gas out of which the stars form, these
calculations would be extremely time-consuming and often the effects of the gas
can be accurately treated by including a background potential to account for
the extra gravitational force. We apply this approximation to model the early
evolution of the first dense star clusters formed in the Universe by performing
$N$-body simulations, our goal is to understand how the additional
gravitational force affects the growth of a very massive star through stellar
mergers in the central parts of the star cluster. Our results show that the
background potential increases the velocities of the stars, causing an overall
delay in the evolution of the clusters and in the runaway growth of a massive
star at the center. The population of binary stars is lower due to the
increased kinetic energy of the stars, initially reducing the number of stellar
collisions, and we show that relaxation processes are also affected. Despite
these effects, the external potential enhances the mass of the merger product
by a factor $\sim$2 if the collisions are maintained for long times.

focus is on scenarios where data is generated according to an isotropic
Gaussian distribution, and the noise is additive Gaussian with an arbitrary
covariance matrix. This problem is posed within a hypothesis testing framework.
The objective is to study the linear regime in which the optimal decoder has a
polynomial complexity in the data size, and it declares the permutation by
simply computing a permutation-independent linear function of the noisy
observations. The main result of the paper is a complete characterization of
the linear regime in terms of the noise covariance matrix. Specifically, it is
shown that this matrix must have a very flat spectrum with at most three
distinct eigenvalues to induce the linear regime. Several practically relevant
implications of this result are discussed, and the error probability incurred
by the decision criterion in the linear regime is also characterized. A core
technical component consists of using linear algebraic and geometric tools,

agent can choose a region to query for the presence of the target in that
region. The measurement noise is assumed to be increasing with the size of the
query region the agent chooses. Motivated by practical applications such as
initial beam alignment in array processing, heavy hitter detection in
networking, and visual search in robotics, we consider practically important
complexity constraints/metrics: \textit{time complexity}, \textit{computational
and memory complexity}, and the complexity of possible query sets in terms of
geometry and cardinality.
  Two novel search strategy, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$, are proposed. Pertinent to
the practicality of out solutions, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$ are of a connected query
geometry (i.e. query set is always a connected set) implemented with low
computational and memory complexity. Additionally, $hiePM$ has a hierarchical
structure and, hence, a further reduction in the cardinality of possible query
sets, making $hiePM$ practically suitable for applications such as beamforming
in array processing where memory limitations favors a smaller codebook size.
  Through a unified analysis with Extrinsic Jensen Shannon (EJS) Divergence,
$dyaPM$ is shown to be asymptotically optimal in search time complexity
(asymptotic in both resolution (rate) and error (reliability)). On the other
hand, $hiePM$ is shown to be near-optimal in rate. In addition, both $hiePM$
and $dyaPM$ are shown to outperform prior work in the non-asymptotic regime.

including droplet size, viscosities of the two phases, droplet velocity and
angle of approach, as well as interfacial tension and surfactant coverage. The
dynamics and thinning of films between coalescing droplets can be particularly
complex in the presence of surfactants, due to the generation of Marangoni
stresses and reduced film mobility. In this work, a microfluidic hydrodynamic
Stokes trap is used to gently steer and trap surfactant-laden micrometer-sized
droplets at the center of a cross-slot. Incoming droplets are made to coalesce
with the trapped droplet, yielding measurements of the film drainage time.
Water droplets are formed upstream using a microfluidic T-junction, in heavy
and light mineral oils and stabilized using SPAN 80, an oil-soluble surfactant.
Film drainage times are measured as a function of continuous phase viscosity,
incoming droplet speed, trapped droplet size, and surfactant concentrations
above and below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). As expected, systems
with higher surfactant concentrations, higher continuous phase viscosity, and
slower droplet speed exhibit longer film drainage times. Perhaps more
surprisingly, larger droplets and high confinement also result in longer film
drainage times. The results are used here to determine critical conditions for
coalescence, including both an upper and a lower critical Capillary number.
Moreover, it is shown that induced surfactant concentration gradient effects
enable coalescence events after the droplets had originally flocculated, at
surfactant concentrations above the CMC. The microfluidic hydrodynamic trap
provides new insights into the role of surfactants in film drainage and opens
avenues for controlled coalescence studies at micrometer length scales and
millisecond time scales.

with attention learns features and highlights the target related frames
locally, and output a fragment based embedding. The segment-level encoder works
with a second attention layer to emphasize the fragments probably related to
target speakers. The global information is finally collected from segment-level

the proposed approach, artificial datasets based on Switchboard Cellular part1

Using Optimal Control Theory we design control pulses that achieve near perfect
population transfer between the extremes of the chain at times on the order of
$N/2$, or larger, depending on which features of the transfer process are to be
studied. Our results show that the control pulses that govern the dynamical
behaviour of chains with different lengths are closely related, that larger
control times imply more complicated control pulses than those found at times
on the order of $N/2$ and also larger driving energies. The pulses were
constructed for control schemes involving one or two actuators in chains with
exchange couplings without static disorder. Our results also show that the two
actuator scheme is considerably more robust against the presence of static

erroneous measurements onto sensors with the intent to degrade system

state-of-the-art fault detectors by remaining within detection thresholds.
However, during these hidden attacks, an attacker with the intention of
hijacking a system will leave traces of non-random behavior that contradict
with the expectation of the system model. Given these premises, in this paper
we propose a run-time monitor called Cumulative Sign (CUSIGN) detector, for
identifying stealthy falsified measurements by identifying if measurements are
no longer behaving in a random manner. Specifically, our proposed CUSIGN
monitor considers the changes in sign of the measurement residuals and their
expected occurrence in order to detect if a sensor could be compromised.
Moreover, our detector is designed to be a memoryless procedure, eliminating
the need to store large sequences of data for attack detection. We characterize
the detection capabilities of the proposed CUSIGN technique following the
well-known $\chi^2$ failure detection scheme. Additionally, we show the
advantage of augmenting CUSIGN to the model-based Cumulative Sum (CUSUM)
detector, which provides magnitude bounds on attacks, for enhanced detection of
sensor spoofing attacks. Our approach is validated with simulations on an

quality control, and fault diagnosis in the mass production of auto bodies.
Comparing with the non-contact measurement, the high-precision five-axis
measuring machine with the touch-trigger probe is a preferred choice for data
collection. It can assist manufacturers in making accurate inspection quickly.
As the increase of free-form surfaces and diverse surface orientations in auto
body design, existing inspection approaches cannot capture some new critical
features in the curvature of auto bodies in an efficient way. Therefore, we
need to develop new path planning methods for automated dimensional inspection
of free-form surfaces. This paper proposes an optimal path planning system for
automated programming of measuring point inspection by incorporating probe
rotations and effective collision detection. Specifically, the methodological
contributions include: (i) a dynamic searching volume-based algorithm is
developed to detect potential collisions in the local path between measurement
points; (ii) a local path generation method is proposed with the integration of
the probe trajectory and the stylus rotation. Then, the inspection time matrix
is proposed to quantify the measuring time of diverse local paths; (iii) an
optimization approach of the global inspection path for all critical points on
the auto body is developed to minimize the total inspection time. A case study
has been conducted on an auto body to verify the performance of the proposed
method. Results show that the collision-free path for the free-form auto body
could be generated automatically with off-line programming, and the proposed
method produces about 40% fewer dummy points and needs 32% less movement time
in the auto body inspection process.

  XSnare can protect application users before application developers release

it defends against 94.2% of these exploits. To the best of our knowledge,
XSnare is the first protection mechanism for XSS that is application-specific,

Kepler proposal was chosen for a flight opportunity, it was necessary to
optimize the design to accomplish the ambitious goals specified in the proposal
and still stay within the available resources. To maximize the science return
from the mission, a merit function (MF) was constructed that relates the
science value (as determined by the PI and the Science Team) to the chosen
mission characteristics and to models of the planetary and stellar systems.
This MF served several purposes; prediction of the science results of the
proposed mission, effects of varying the values of the mission parameters to
increase the science product or to reduce the mission costs, and assessment of
risks. The Merit Function was also valuable for the purposes of advocating the
Mission by illustrating its expected capability. Later, it was used to keep
management informed of the changing mission capability as trade-offs and
mission down-sizing occurred.

Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Serial Independence Runs test to detect
inconsistent patterns in the measurement data. For the proposed statistical
tests we provide formal guarantees and bounds for attack detection. We validate

typically rely on a distributed set of cameras, where each camera has different
capture conditions. This can translate to a considerable shift between source
(e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. operational camera) domains. Given the cost
of annotating image data captured for fine-tuning in each target domain,
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become a popular approach to adapt
CNNs. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning models that provide a high level
of accuracy often rely on architectures that are too complex for real-time
applications. Although several compression and UDA approaches have recently
been proposed to overcome these limitations, they do not allow optimizing a CNN
to simultaneously address both. In this paper, we propose an unexplored
direction -- the joint optimization of CNNs to provide a compressed model that
is adapted to perform well for a given target domain. In particular, the
proposed approach performs unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD) from a
complex teacher model to a compact student model, by leveraging both source and
target data. It also improves upon existing UDA techniques by progressively
teaching the student about domain-invariant features, instead of directly
adapting a compact model on target domain data. Our method is compared against
state-of-the-art compression and UDA techniques, using two popular
classification datasets for UDA -- Office31 and ImageClef-DA. In both datasets,
results indicate that our method can achieve the highest level of accuracy

understanding the behaviour of various algorithms in computational algebra,
e.g., root isolation algorithms. A classic result in the univariate setting is
the Davenport-Mahler-Mignotte (DMM) bound. One way to state the bound is to
consider a directed acyclic graph $(V,E)$ on a subset of roots of a degree $d$
polynomial $f(z) \in \mathbb{C}[z]$, where the edges point from a root of
smaller absolute value to one of larger absolute, and the in-degrees of all
vertices is at most one. Then the DMM bound is an amortized lower bound on the
following product: $\prod_{(\alpha,\beta) \in E}|\alpha-\beta|$. However, the
lower bound involves the discriminant of the polynomial $f$, and becomes
trivial if the polynomial is not square-free. This was resolved by Eigenwillig,
(2008), by using a suitable subdiscriminant instead of the discriminant.
Escorcielo-Perrucci, 2016, further dropped the in-degree constraint on the
graph by using the theory of finite differences. Emiris et al., 2019, have
generalized their result to handle the case where the exponent of the term
$|\alpha-\beta|$ in the product is at most the multiplicity of either of the
roots. In this paper, we generalize these results by allowing arbitrary
positive integer weights on the edges of the graph, i.e., for a weight function
$w: E \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, we derive an amortized lower bound on
$\prod_{(\alpha,\beta) \in E}|\alpha-\beta|^{w(\alpha,\beta)}$. Such a product
occurs in the complexity estimates of some recent algorithms for root
clustering (e.g., Becker et al., 2016), where the weights are usually some
function of the multiplicity of the roots. Because of its amortized nature, our
bound is arguably better than the bounds obtained by manipulating existing
results to accommodate the weights.

manifold with an admissible tangent space on the boundary of the manifold, by
Onsager's principle for an obstacle problem, we derive the associated parabolic
variational inequalities. These variational inequalities can be used to
simulate the contact line dynamics with unavoidable merging and splitting of

minimization problems of both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) systems subject to

strong duality for the UL and DL problems under coarse quantization systems.
Leveraging the duality, we propose a framework that is directed toward a
twofold aim: to discover the optimal transmit powers in UL by developing
iterative algorithm in a distributed manner and to obtain the optimal precoder
in DL as a scaled instance of UL combiner. Under homogeneous transmit power and
SINR constraints per cell, we further derive a deterministic solution for the
UL CoMP problem by analyzing the lower bound of the SINR. Lastly, we extend the

structure for various graph learning tasks. Previously it can be heavy work.
With our community-based framework, this becomes less difficult and allows the
task models to basically plug-in-and-play and perform joint training. We
currently look into two particular applications, the graph alignment and the
anomalous correlation detection, and discuss how to make use of our framework
to tackle both problems. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. We also contributed tweaks of classic techniques

adaptation methods effectively down-weigh outliers' importance, they do not
consider data structure of each domain and do not directly align the feature

Methods: The backbone-residual (BR) model is put forward and tested on the
fibre-fed High Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) at the Chinese Xinglong 2.16-m
Telescope, which is the sum of the backbone function and the residual function.
The backbone function is a bell-shaped function to describe the main component

the cubic spline function, accounts for the difference between the bell-shaped
function and the actual IP. The method of evaluating the accuracy of IP
characterisation is based on the spectral reconstruction and Monte Carlo
simulation. Results: The IP of HRS is characterised with the BR model, and the
accuracy of the characterised IP reaches 0.006 of the peak value of the
backbone function. This result demonstrates that the accurate IP

this fact, we propose a novel model, Attribute2Font, to automatically create
fonts by synthesizing visually-pleasing glyph images according to
user-specified attributes and their corresponding values. To the best of our
knowledge, our model is the first one in the literature which is capable of
generating glyph images in new font styles, instead of retrieving existing

Attribute2Font is trained to perform font style transfer between any two fonts
conditioned on their attribute values. After training, our model can generate
glyph images in accordance with an arbitrary set of font attribute values.
Furthermore, a novel unit named Attribute Attention Module is designed to make

Participants changed head orientation most frequently when a large size AV did

absence of water molecules, the pyramidal junctions exhibit continuous
transitions between integer conductance plateaus, while in the presence of
H$_{2}$O molecules, these junctions show abrupt jump to contact behavior and no

Schottky-Barrier height, and the laser intensity and one of the latter with the
laser intensity and diffusion coefficient squared. We also discuss the formula

conventional precoding methods could not yield an attractive performance with a
severe error-floor problem. Moreover, finding an optimal transmit signal is
computationally implausible because of its combinatorial nature. Thus, it is
still an open problem to construct a 1-bit transmit signal efficiently. As an
extension of our earlier work, we propose an efficient method to construct an
1-bit transmit-signal under quadrature-amplitude-modulation constellations.
Toward this, we first derive the so-called feasibility condition which ensures
that every user's noiseless observation belongs to a desired decision region,
and then transform it as linear constraints. Taking into account the robustness
to an additive noise, the proposed construction method is formulated as a
well-defined mixed-integer-linear-programming problem. Based on this, we
develop a low-complexity algorithm to solve it (equivalently, to generate a
1-bit transmit signal). Via simulations, we verify the superiority of the
proposed method in terms of a computational complexity and detection
performance.

networks rely on knowledge of the routing topology. However, the standard
approach to topology mapping--namely, active probing with traceroutes--relies
on cooperation from increasingly non-cooperative routers, leading to missing
information. Network tomography, which uses end-to-end measurements of additive
link metrics (like delays or log packet loss rates) across monitor paths, is a
possible remedy. Network tomography does not require that routers cooperate
with traceroute probes, and it has already been used to infer the structure of
multicast trees. This paper goes a step further. We provide a tomographic
method to infer the underlying routing topology of an arbitrary set of monitor
paths using the joint distribution of end-to-end measurements, without making
any assumptions on routing behavior. Our approach, called the M\""obius
Inference Algorithm (MIA), uses cumulants of this distribution to quantify
high-order interactions among monitor paths, and it applies M\""obius inversion
to ""disentangle"" these interactions. In addition to MIA, we provide a more
practical variant called Sparse M\""obius Inference, which uses various sparsity
heuristics to reduce the number and order of cumulants required to be
estimated. We show the viability of our approach using synthetic case studies
based on real-world ISP topologies.

single-speaker Mandarin speech to demonstrate advantages of our architecture in
another language which relies heavily on F0.

The temperature-dependent resistivity shows linear, step-like transitions from
insulating to metallic states as well as plateau features. As more current is
being sourced, the fiber becomes more conductive and thus the current density
goes up. The most interesting features is observed in high electric fields. As
the fiber is cooled, the resistivity first decreases linearly with the

to significantly advance our knowledge on Galactic DWDs by increasing the
sample up to 2 orders of magnitude, and will allow their multi-messenger
studies in combination with electromagnetic telescopes. We also test the
possibilities of different configurations of TianQin: (1) the same mission with
a different orientation, (2) two perpendicular constellations combined into a

distributed learning, where a network of nodes collaboratively solve a

this paper, we aim to propose a new differentially private distributed ADMM

In our proposed algorithm, we adopt the approximation of the objective function

higher utility by such multiple approximate updates, and achieve the error

ramp flow must have the minimal dissipation of kinetic energy, and can be
demonstrated using the least action principle. For a given inflow Mach number
$M_{0}$ and ramp angle $\alpha$, the separation angle $\theta_{s}$ manifesting
flow system states can be determined based on this theory. Thus, both the
shapes of shock wave configurations and pressure peak $p_{peak}$ behind
reattachment shock waves are predictable. These theoretical predictions agree
excellently with both experimental data and numerical simulations, covering a
wide range of $M_{0}$ and $\alpha$. In addition, for a large separation, the
theory indicates that $\theta_{s}$ only depends on $M_{0}$ and $\alpha$, but is
independent of the Reynolds number $Re$ and wall temperature $T_{w}$. These

COVID-19 testing with quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain
Reaction (RT-PCR) that can result in shorter testing time and conservation of
reagents and testing kits. Tapestry combines ideas from compressed sensing and
combinatorial group testing with a novel noise model for RT-PCR used for
generation of synthetic data. Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the
input is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of
viral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load.
While other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry
obtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing, at
clinically acceptable false positive or false negative rates. We also propose
designs for pooling matrices that facilitate good prediction of the infected
samples while remaining practically viable. When testing $n$ samples out of
which $k \ll n$ are infected, our method needs only $O(k \log n)$ tests when
using random binary pooling matrices, with high probability. However, we also
use deterministic binary pooling matrices based on combinatorial design ideas
of Kirkman Triple Systems to balance between good reconstruction properties and
matrix sparsity for ease of pooling. In practice, we have observed the need for
fewer tests with such matrices than with random pooling matrices. This makes
Tapestry capable of very large savings at low prevalence rates, while
simultaneously remaining viable even at prevalence rates as high as 9.5\%.
Empirically we find that single-round Tapestry pooling improves over two-round
Dorfman pooling by almost a factor of 2 in the number of tests required. We
validate Tapestry in simulations and wet lab experiments with oligomers in
quantitative RT-PCR assays. Lastly, we describe use-case scenarios for
deployment.

dedicated to the high-speed mobility scenario. However, its transmission
involves a two-dimensional convolution of the symbols of interest and the
multipath fading channel, and it complicates the equalization. In addition to
the high-complexity issue, the existing pilot pattern to estimate the unknown
channel accurately requires large overhead to avoid the pilot being
contaminated, which is spectrally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a
receiver approach by the marriage of the OTFS and a large-scale antenna array,
which allows low-complexity detection and low-overhead pilot pattern design.
First, the received signal from each path of the multipath fading channel is
identified by a high-resolution receive beamformer facilitated by a large-scale
antenna array. Then the identified signal from each angle in the delay-Doppler
domain reduces to a flat-faded signal, which can be simply equalized using the
channel information estimated by our pilot pattern. We further provide the
estimator of the channel fading and the rotations of delay and Doppler. With
these estimates, the symbols of interest can be recovered, and then, the
signals from all angles of arrival are combined as different diversity
versions. In addition, our pilot pattern with only around 25% overhead of the
existing pilot pattern ensures the same protection of pilot pollution.
Eventually, the efficiency, the reliability, and the low complexity of the
proposed receiver approach are further validated by the numerical results.

several challenges remain to be solved, including sparse noisy data, incomplete

work, a new framework, which combines neural network, genetic algorithm and
adaptive methods, is put forward to address all of these challenges
simultaneously. In the framework, a trained neural network is utilized to
calculate derivatives and generate a large amount of meta-data, which solves
the problem of sparse noisy data. Next, genetic algorithm is utilized to

this method, the structure of a parametric PDE is first discovered, and then
the general form of varying coefficients is identified. The proposed algorithm
is tested on the Burgers equation, the convection-diffusion equation, the wave

  Robots",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A swarm of anonymous oblivious mobile robots, operating in deterministic
Look-Compute-Move cycles, is confined within a circular track. All robots agree
on the clockwise direction (chirality), they are activated by an adversarial
semi-synchronous scheduler (SSYNCH), and an active robot always reaches the
destination point it computes (rigidity). Robots have limited visibility: each
robot can see only the points on the circle that have an angular distance
strictly smaller than a constant $\vartheta$ from the robot's current location,
where $0<\vartheta\leq\pi$ (angles are expressed in radians).
  We study the Gathering problem for such a swarm of robots: that is, all
robots are initially in distinct locations on the circle, and their task is to
reach the same point on the circle in a finite number of turns, regardless of
the way they are activated by the scheduler. Note that, due to the anonymity of
the robots, this task is impossible if the initial configuration is
rotationally symmetric; hence, we have to make the assumption that the initial
configuration be rotationally asymmetric.
  We prove that, if $\vartheta=\pi$ (i.e., each robot can see the entire circle
except its antipodal point), there is a distributed algorithm that solves the
Gathering problem for swarms of any size. By contrast, we also prove that, if
$\vartheta\leq \pi/2$, no distributed algorithm solves the Gathering problem,
regardless of the size of the swarm, even under the assumption that the initial
configuration is rotationally asymmetric and the visibility graph of the robots
is connected.
  The latter impossibility result relies on a probabilistic technique based on
random perturbations, which is novel in the context of anonymous mobile robots.
Such a technique is of independent interest, and immediately applies to other
Pattern-Formation problems.

velocity components with the CO intensity peaks at V_LSR ~ -4 km s$^{-1}$, 9 km
s$^{-1}$ and 16 km s$^{-1}$. The highest CO intensity is detected at V_LSR ~ 9
km s$^{-1}$, where the high-mass stars with the spectral types of O6.5-B0.5 are
embedded. We found bridging features connecting these clouds toward the
directions of the exciting sources. Comparisons of the gas distributions with
the radio continuum emission and 8 um infrared emission show spatial
coincidence/anti-coincidence, suggesting physical associations between the gas
and the exciting sources. The 12CO J=2-1 to 1-0 intensity ratio shows a high
value (> 0.8) toward the exciting sources for the -4 km s$^{-1}$ and +9 km
s$^{-1}$ clouds, possibly due to heating by the high-mass stars, whereas the
intensity ratio at the CO intensity peak (V_LSR ~ 9 km s$^{-1}$) lowers down to
~0.6, suggesting self absorption by the dense gas in the near side of the +9 km
s$^{-1}$ cloud. We found partly complementary gas distributions between the -4

found in the Galactic massive star clusters, RCW 38 and NGC 6334, where an
early stage of cloud collision to trigger the star formation is suggested.

spatial mapping of the environment. Models are often applied to make
predictions far beyond sampling locations where new geographic locations might
considerably differ from the training data in their environmental properties.
However, areas in the predictor space without support of training data are
problematic. Since the model has no knowledge about these environments,
predictions have to be considered uncertain.
  Estimating the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is
required. Here, we suggest a methodology that delineates the ""area of
applicability"" (AOA) that we define as the area, for which the cross-validation
error of the model applies. We first propose a ""dissimilarity index"" (DI) that
is based on the minimum distance to the training data in the predictor space,
with predictors being weighted by their respective importance in the model. The
AOA is then derived by applying a threshold based on the DI of the training
data where the DI is calculated with respect to the cross-validation strategy
used for model training. We test for the ideal threshold by using simulated
data and compare the prediction error within the AOA with the cross-validation
error of the model. We illustrate the approach using a simulated case study.
  Our simulation study suggests a threshold on DI to define the AOA at the .95
quantile of the DI in the training data. Using this threshold, the prediction
error within the AOA is comparable to the cross-validation RMSE of the model,
while the cross-validation error does not apply outside the AOA. This applies
to models being trained with randomly distributed training data, as well as
when training data are clustered in space and where spatial cross-validation is
applied.
  We suggest to report the AOA alongside predictions, complementary to
validation measures.

mechanisms underlying pattern selection and dynamics away from onset are much

the dynamics of which are determined by the diffusive fluxes into them. As a
result, peaks move towards a periodic steady-state configuration that minimizes
the mass of the diffusive species. We also show that the preferred number of
peaks at the final steady-state is such that this mass is minimised. Our work
presents mass minimization as a simple, generalisable, physical principle for

addressed to make it a reality. One of the fundamental mysteries in a
cache-enabled network is predicting what content to cache and where to cache so
that high caching content availability is accomplished. For simplicity, most of
the legacy systems utilize a static estimation - based on Zipf distribution,
which, in reality, may not be adequate to capture the dynamic behaviors of the
contents popularities. Forecasting user's preferences can proactively allocate
caching resources and cache the needed contents, which is especially important
in a dynamic environment with real-time service needs. Motivated by this, we
propose a long short-term memory (LSTM) based sequential model that is capable
of capturing the temporal dynamics of the users' preferences for the available
contents in the content library. Besides, for a more efficient edge caching
solution, different nodes in proximity can collaborate to help each other.
Based on the forecast, a non-convex optimization problem is formulated to
minimize content sharing costs among these nodes. Moreover, a greedy algorithm
is used to achieve a sub-optimal solution. By using mathematical analysis and
simulation results, we validate that the proposed algorithm performs better

correlations between optical polarization and orbital angular momentum. Here we
demonstrate a new, flexible experimental approach to the classification of
vortex vector beams. We first describe a platform for generating arbitrary
complex vector vortex beams inspired to photonic quantum walks. We then exploit
recent machine learning methods -- namely convolutional neural networks and
principal component analysis -- to recognize and classify specific polarization
patterns. Our study demonstrates the significant advantages resulting from the
use of machine learning-based protocols for the construction and
characterization of high-dimensional resources for quantum protocols.

the protoplanetary disk is therefore essential. In this paper, we discuss
whether or not gas flow can erode planetesimals. We estimate how much shear
stress is exerted onto the planetesimal surface by the gas as a function of
disk and planetesimal properties. To determine whether erosion can take place,
we compare this with previous measurements of the critical stress that a
pebble-pile planetesimal can withstand before erosion begins. If erosion takes
place, we estimate the erosion time of the affected planetesimals. We also
illustrate our estimates with two-dimensional numerical simulations of flows
around planetesimals using the lattice Boltzmann method. We find that the wall
shear stress can overcome the critical stress of planetesimals in an eccentric
orbit within the innermost regions of the disk. The high eccentricities needed
to reach erosive stresses could be the result of shepherding by migrating
planets. We also find that if a planetesimal erodes, it does so on short
timescales. For planetesimals residing outside of $1 \ \rm{au}$, we find that
they are mainly safe from erosion, even in the case of highly eccentric orbits.

reconnection and consequent coronal heating, driven by a pair of converging and
cancelling magnetic flux sources of opposite polarities. For this test, we
analyzed photospheric magnetic field and multi-wavelength UV/EUV observations
of a small-scale flux cancellation event in a quiet-Sun internetwork region
over a target interval of 5.2 hr. The observed cancellation event exhibits a
converging motion of two opposite-polarity magnetic patches on the photosphere
and red-shifted Doppler velocities (downflows) therein consistently over the
target interval, with a decrease in magnetic flux of both polarities at a rate
of 10$^{15}$ Mx s$^{-1}$. Several impulsive EUV brightenings, with differential
emission measure values peaked at 1.6-2.0 MK, are also observed in the shape of
arcades with their two footpoints anchored in the two patches. The rate of
magnetic energy released as heat at the flux cancellation region is estimated
to be in the range of (0.2-1)$\times$10$^{24}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the target
interval, which can satisfy the requirement of previously reported heating
rates for the quiet-Sun corona. Finally, both short-term (a few to several tens

modeling interest. Unfortunately, most relevant dynamics involve complex graphs
of interactions for which an exact computational treatment is impossible. To
circumvent this difficulty, the replica-mean-field approach focuses on randomly
interacting replicas of the networks of interest. In the limit of an infinite
number of replicas, these networks become analytically tractable under the
so-called ""Poisson Hypothesis"". However, in most applications, this hypothesis
is only conjectured. Here, we establish the Poisson Hypothesis for a general

fragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes, and which are introduced in
the present paper. These processes feature a network of nodes, each endowed
with a state governing their random activation. Each activation triggers the
fragmentation of the activated node state and the transmission of interaction
signals to downstream nodes. In turn, the signals received by nodes are
aggregated to their state. Our main contribution is a proof of the Poisson
Hypothesis for the replica-mean-field version of any network in this class. The
proof is obtained by establishing the propagation of asymptotic independence

decays by power law. In this article, we adopt the Merton model, which uses an
asset correlation as the default correlation, and find that a phase transition
occurs when the temporal correlation decays by power law. When the power index
is less than one, the PD estimator converges slowly. Thus, it is difficult to
estimate PD with limited historical data. Conversely, when the power index is
greater than one, the convergence speed is inversely proportional to the number

$\mathbf{VAl_3}$ hosts exceptional, robust topological electrons which can
tolerate extreme change of chemical composition. The Dirac electrons remain
intact even after a substantial part of V atoms have been replaced in the
$\mathbf{V_{1-x}Ti_xAl_3}$ solid solutions. This Dirac semimetal state ends at
$x=0.35$ where a Lifshitz transition to $p$-type trivial metal occurs. The V-Al
bond is completely broken in this transition as long as the bonding orbitals
are fully depopulated by the holes donated from Ti substitution. In other
words, the Dirac electrons in $\mathbf{VAl_3}$ are protected by the V-Al bond
whose molecular orbital is their bonding gravity center. Our understanding on
the interrelations among electron count, chemical bond and electronic
properties in topological semimetals suggests a rational approach to search
robust, chemical-bond-protected topological materials.

Galactic X-ray pulsar, Swift J0243.6+6124, during the 2017-2018 giant outburst
observed by the MAXI GSC. The 2-30 keV light curve and the energy spectra
confirm that the luminosity $L_\mathrm{X}$ reached $2.5\times 10^{39}$ erg
s$^{-1}$, 10 times higher than the Eddington limit. When the source was
luminous with $L_\mathrm{X}\gtrsim 0.9\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, it
exhibited a negative correlation on a hardness-intensity diagram. However, two
hardness ratios, a soft color ($=$ 4-10 keV / 2-4 keV) and a hard color ($=$
10-20 keV / 4-10 keV), showed somewhat different behavior across a
characteristic luminosity of $L_\mathrm{c}\simeq 5\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$.
The soft color changed more than the hard color when $L_\mathrm{X} <
L_\mathrm{c}$, whereas the opposite was observed above $L_\mathrm{c}$. The
spectral change above $L_\mathrm{c}$ was represented by a broad enhanced
feature at $\sim 6$ keV. The pulse profiles made a transition from a
single-peak to a double-peak one as the source brightened across
$L_\mathrm{c}$. These spectral and pulse-shape properties can be interpreted by
a scenario that the accretion columns on the neutron star surface, producing
the Comptonized X-ray emission, gradually became taller as $L_\mathrm{X}$
increased. The broad 6 keV enhancement could be a result of cyclotron-resonance
absorption at $\sim 10$ keV, corresponding to a surface magnetic field
$B_\mathrm{s}\simeq 1.1\times 10^{12}$ G. The spin-frequency derivatives
calculated with the Fermi GBM data showed a smooth correlation with
$L_\mathrm{X}$ up to the outburst peak, and its linear coefficient is
comparable to those of X-ray binary pulsars whose $B_\mathrm{s}$ are
$(1-8)\times 10^{12}$ G. These results suggest that $B_\mathrm{s}$ of Swift
J0243.6$+$6124 is a few times $10^{12}$ G.

measurements. In this paper, we present a generic recursive algorithm for
multi-particle cumulants, which enables the calculation of arbitrary order
multi-particle cumulants. Among them, the new 10-, 12-, 14-, and 16-particle
cumulants of a single harmonic, named $c_{n}\{10\}$, $c_{n}\{12\}$,
$c_{n}\{14\}$, and $c_{n}\{16\}$, and the corresponding $v_n$ coefficients,
will be discussed for the first time. These new multi-particle cumulants can be
readily used along with updates to the generic framework of multi-particle
correlations to a very high order. Finally, we propose a particular series of
mixed harmonic multi-particle cumulants, which measures the general
correlations between any moments of different flow coefficients. The
predictions of these new observables are shown based on an initial state model
MC-Glauber, a toy Monte Carlo model, and the HIJING transport model for future
comparisons between experimental data and theoretical model calculations. The
study of these new multi-particle cumulants in heavy-ion collisions will
significantly improve the understanding of the joint probability density
function which involves both different harmonics of flow and also the symmetry
planes. This will pave the way for more stringent constraints on the initial
state and help to extract more precisely how the created hot and dense matter
evolves. Meanwhile, the efforts applied to small systems could be very helpful
in the understanding of the origin of the observed collectivity at RHIC and the

ILRMA employs nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) to capture spectral

deep neural networks (DNN). However, the investigation of MVAE has been limited
to the training with very few speakers and the speech signals of test speakers
are usually included. We extend the training of MVAE using clean speech signals
of 500 speakers to evaluate its generalization to unseen speakers. To improve
the correct extraction rate, two data augmentation strategies are implemented
to train the SR module. The performance of the proposed cascaded approach is
investigated with test data constructed with real room impulse responses under

[0,n-1]$, the set of integers from 0 to $n-1$, so that each element of $I_n$ is
in $A$ with a fixed probability $p \in (0,1)$. Recently, Martin and O'Bryant
studied the case in which $p=1/2$ and found a closed form for
$\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$. Lazarev, Miller, and O'Bryant extended the result to find
a numerical estimate for $\text{Var}(|A+A|)$ and bounds on the number of
missing sums in $A+A$, $m_{n\,;\,p}(k) := \mathbb{P}(2n-1-|A+A|=k)$. Their
primary tool was a graph-theoretic framework which we now generalize to provide
a closed form for $\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$ and $\text{Var}(|A+A|)$ for all $p\in
(0,1)$ and establish good bounds for $\mathbb{E}[|A+A|]$ and $m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$.
  We continue to investigate $m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$ by studying $m_p(k) =
\lim_{n\to\infty}m_{n\,;\,p}(k)$, proven to exist by Zhao. Lazarev, Miller, and
O'Bryant proved that, for $p=1/2$, $m_{1/2}(6)>m_{1/2}(7)<m_{1/2}(8)$. This
distribution is not unimodal, and is said to have a ""divot"" at 7. We report
results investigating this divot as $p$ varies, and through both theoretical
and numerical analysis, prove that for $p\geq 0.68$ there is a divot at $1$;
that is, $m_{p}(0)>m_{p}(1)<m_{p}(2)$.
  Finally, we extend the graph-theoretic framework originally introduced by
Lazarev, Miller, and O'Bryant to correlated sumsets $A+B$ where $B$ is
correlated to $A$ by the probabilities $\mathbb{P}(i\in B \mid i\in A) = p_1$
and $\mathbb{P}(i\in B \mid i\not\in A) = p_2$. We provide some preliminary
results using the extension of this framework.

that published studies are based on different datasets, usually at a regional

the big So2Sat LCZ42 benchmark dataset dedicated to LCZ classification. Using

Generation (NLG) based in large part on statistical techniques. Despite having
many attractive features, we argue that these existing approaches nonetheless
have some important drawbacks, sometimes because the approach in question is
not fully statistical (i.e., relies on a certain amount of handcrafting),
sometimes because the approach in question lacks transparency. Focussing on
some of the key NLG tasks (namely Content Selection, Lexical Choice, and
Linguistic Realisation), we propose a novel approach, called the Text
Reassembling approach to NLG (TRG), which approaches the ideal of a purely
statistical approach very closely, and which is at the same time highly
transparent. We evaluate the TRG approach and discuss how TRG may be extended
to deal with other NLG tasks, such as Document Structuring, and Aggregation. We
discuss the strengths and limitations of TRG, concluding that the method may
hold particular promise for domain experts who want to build an NLG system
despite having little expertise in linguistics and NLG.

motivated constraints, the algorithm assumes a highly uncertain system dynamics
model. The tracking problem is solved in a uniform way, without dividing it
into subtasks considered in 2D spaces, thanks to the introduction of an
auxiliary tracking error.
  The proposed controller is based on the sliding mode approach. Its stability
is investigated using Lyapunov theorem. Numerical simulations are conducted in
order to verify properties of a closed-loop system for a generic model of the
airship.
  Performance of the control system is examined via experiments in various
scenarios using a prototype airship. The obtained results indicate that the
control objectives are satisfied in practice with a reasonable accuracy.
Moreover, it is shown that the controller is robust to some bounded additive
measurement perturbations and delays in the control loop.

expression lives very short in nature and demands feature modeling with the

CNN networks to spot the significant features of minor muscle movements and
subtle changes. However, existing networks fail to establish a relationship
between spatial features of facial appearance and temporal variations of facial

variations and subtle changes in expressive regions. To address these issues,
we introduce an active imaging concept to segregate active changes in
expressive regions of a video into a single frame while preserving facial
appearance information. Moreover, we propose a shallow CNN network: hybrid
local receptive field based augmented learning network (OrigiNet) that
efficiently learns significant features of the micro-expressions in a video. In
this paper, we propose a new refined rectified linear unit (RReLU), which
overcome the problem of vanishing gradient and dying ReLU. RReLU extends the
range of derivatives as compared to existing activation functions. The RReLU
not only injects a nonlinearity but also captures the true edges by imposing
additive and multiplicative property. Furthermore, we present an augmented
feature learning block to improve the learning capabilities of the network by
embedding two parallel fully connected layers. The performance of proposed
OrigiNet is evaluated by conducting leave one subject out experiments on four
comprehensive ME datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrigiNet

isolation state, we modelled the effects of self-isolation consequent on
tracking and tracing. Specifically, we included a quarantine or isolation state
occupied by people who believe they might be infected but are asymptomatic, and
only leave if they test negative. We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of
the model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests
for the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the
outbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions
emerged from these simulations. For example, under plausible (graded)
relaxations of social distancing, a rebound of infections within weeks is
unlikely. The emergence of a later second wave depends almost exclusively on
the rate at which we lose immunity, inherited from the first wave. There exists
no testing strategy that can attenuate mortality rates, other than by deferring
or delaying a second wave. A sufficiently powerful tracking and tracing
policy--implemented at the time of writing (10th May 2020)--will defer any
second wave beyond a time horizon of 18 months. Crucially, this deferment is
within current testing capabilities (requiring an efficacy of tracing and
tracking of about 20% of asymptomatic infected cases, with less than 50,000
tests per day). These conclusions are based upon a dynamic causal model for
which we provide some construct and face validation, using a comparative
analysis of the United Kingdom and Germany, supplemented with recent

measuring the cohesion of the parties and the congress in the votes,
quantifying the agreement between the votes of congressmen and observe that
there is a stronger polarization among congressmen during legislative periods

Using clustering algorithms, we are able to associate these polarized groups

evolved over time and identified, using cluster algorithms, that all the

pair of graphs to facilitate downstream applications, such as finding the most
similar chemical compounds similar to a query compound or Fewshot 3D Action
Recognition. Recently, some graph similarity computation models based on neural
networks have been proposed, which are either based on graph-level interaction
or node-level comparison. However, when the number of nodes in the graph
increases, it will inevitably bring about reduced representation ability or
high computation cost. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graph
partitioning and graph neural network-based model, called PSimGNN, to
effectively resolve this issue. Specifically, each of the input graphs is
partitioned into a set of subgraphs to extract the local structural features
directly. Next, a novel graph neural network with an attention mechanism is
designed to map each subgraph into an embedding vector. Some of these subgraph
pairs are automatically selected for node-level comparison to supplement the
subgraph-level embedding with fine-grained information. Finally, coarse-grained
interaction information among subgraphs and fine-grained comparison information
among nodes in different subgraphs are integrated to predict the final
similarity score. Experimental results on graph datasets with different graph
sizes demonstrate that PSimGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in graph
similarity computation tasks using approximate Graph Edit Distance (GED) as the
graph similarity metric.

Africa. A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP
model, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global
COVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the
SEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South
Korea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their
peaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number
of COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by
when. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then
used to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the
initial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability
of the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently
recalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.
The resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be
reasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the
number of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October
2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to
90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are
heavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence
to these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly
sensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The
future aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South
African SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying
lockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.

which inevitably results in a porous initial microstructure. These pores are
nuclei for ductile damage and need to be closed during rolling in regard of the
strict performance requirements of todays advanced high strength steels. Due to
the beneficial shape factor of the roll gap, recrystallization and high
diffusion rates pore closure and elimination occurs primarily during hot
rolling. In this paper, relevant influencing factors on pore closure are
investigated based on representative volume elements (RVE). First, the load
regime of typical multi-pass hot rolling schedules is calculated via macro
scale FEM and then applied to micro scale RVEs. Within the RVE, shape changes
of a given pore are tracked and the closure ratio is calculated. This paper
elucidates the effect of different roll diameters, absolute reductions per
pass, pore shape and pore orientation on the closure rate. The results show
that the majority of pores can be closed during the initial hot rolling stages.
However, pore closure can be accelerated through suitable process parameters.
Furthermore, shape and orientation of pores should be taken into account, if a
precise knowledge of the total height reduction, leading to complete pore
closure, is desired.

for a ubiquitous central-spin system, corresponding to a `central' spin-1/2
coherently coupled to ancilla spins and undergoing dissipative spin relaxation.
The ancilla system can describe $N$ spins-1/2 or, equivalently, a single large

demonstrating that the system size can be grown substantially with only a

network coupled smart grid and focus on its vulnerability. That is, how much
can the smart grid be damaged when misinformation related to it diffuses in
SNs? To analytically study the problem, we propose the Misinformation Attack
Problem in Social-Smart Grid (MAPSS) that identifies the top critical nodes in
the SN, such that the smart grid can be greatly damaged when misinformation
propagates from those nodes. This problem is challenging as we have to
incorporate the complexity of the two networks concurrently. Nevertheless, we
propose a technique that can explicitly take into account information diffusion
in SN, power flow balance and cascading failure in smart grid integratedly when
evaluating node criticality, based on which we propose various strategies in
selecting the most critical nodes. Also, we introduce controlled load shedding
as a protection strategy to reduce the impact of cascading failure. The
effectiveness of our algorithms are demonstrated by experiments on IEEE bus
test cases as well as the Pegase data set.

exploring the low frequency GW spectrum inaccessible from the ground. Satellite
GW observatory DECIGO in its original configuration and the currently proposed
smaller scale B-DECIGO are aimed to cover deci-Hertz part of the GW spectrum,
which fills the gap between LISA mili-Hertz and deca- to kilo-Hertz range
probed by ground-based detectors. In this paper we forecast the detection rates
of inspiraling double compact objects (DCOs) and the unresolved confusion noise
from these sources in DECIGO and B-DECIGO. In the context of DECIGO we use, for
the first time, the population synthesis intrinsic inspiral rates of NS-NS,
BH-NS and BH-BH systems. We also estimate the expected gravitational lensing
rates of such sources for DECIGO and B-DECIGO. The result is that yearly
detection of DCOs inspirals for the DECIGO is of order of $10^4 - 10^5$, while
for a much smaller scale B-DECIGO they are about $10^2 - 10^4$ depending on the
DCO population considered. Taking into account that considerable part of these
events would be detectable by ground-based GW observatories the added value of
DECIGO/B-DECIGO could be substantial. DECIGO will also be able to register
$5-50$ lensed NS-NS inspirals and up to O(100) BH-BH inspirals. On the
contrary, predictions for the B-DECIGO are pessimistic: only the optimistic
common envelope scenario of DCO formation could yield a few lensed BH-BH
inspirals per year. We also address the question of the magnification bias in
the GW event catalogs of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.

its data to an Earth-based receiver. The present work estimates the raw data

conventional losses (-476 dB), relativistic effects (-3.5 dB), and link margin
(-3.0 dB). For this photon-starved Poisson channel with 0.1 nm equivalent noise
bandwidth, 90% detector quantum efficiency, 1024-ary PPM modulation, and 10^-3
raw bit error rate, the raw data rate is 260 bit/s (hard-decision) to 1.5
kbit/s (ideal) raw data rate, which is 8-50 Gbit/year. This rate is slowed by
noise, especially starlight from Alpha Centauri A scattered into the detector
by the atmosphere and receiver optics as sailcraft nears the star. Because this
is a flyby mission (the sailcraft does not stop in the Centauri system), the
proper motion of Alpha Centauri relative to Earth carries it away from the
sailcraft after transit, and the noise subsides over days to weeks. The
downlink can resume as soon as a day after transit, starting at 7-22 bit/s and
reaching nearly full speed after 4 months. By using a coronagraph on the

In his classic ""First Draft"" von Neumann warned that using a ""too fast
processor"" vitiates his simple ""procedure"" (but not his computing model!);
furthermore, that using the classic computing paradigm for imitating neuronal
operations, is unsound. Amdahl added that large machines, comprising many
processors, have an inherent disadvantage. Given that ANN's components are
heavily communicating with each other, they are built from a large number of
components designed/fabricated for use in conventional computing, furthermore
they attempt to mimic biological operation using improper technological
solutions, their achievable payload computing performance is conceptually
modest. The type of workload that AI-based systems generate leads to an
exceptionally low payload computational performance, and their
design/technology limits their size to just above the ""toy"" level systems: the
scaling of processor-based ANN systems is strongly nonlinear. Given the
proliferation and growing size of ANN systems, we suggest ideas to estimate in
advance the efficiency of the device or application. Through analyzing
published measurements we provide evidence that the role of data transfer time
drastically influences both ANNs performance and feasibility. It is discussed
how some major theoretical limiting factors, ANN's layer structure and their
methods of technical implementation of communication affect their efficiency.
The paper starts from von Neumann's original model, without neglecting the
transfer time apart from processing time; derives an appropriate interpretation
and handling for Amdahl's law. It shows that, in that interpretation, Amdahl's
Law correctly describes ANNs.

by electric field-induced resistive switching. Friction forces are high in the
insulating state and clearly change to lower values when the probed local
region is switched to the conducting state. Upon switching back to an
insulating state, the friction forces increase again. Thus, we demonstrate
active control of friction without having to change the contact temperature or
pressure. By comparing with measurements of friction at the metal-to-insulator
transition and with the effect of applied voltage on adhesion, we rule out
electronic excitations, electrostatic forces and changes in contact area as the
reasons for the effect of resistive switching on friction. Instead, we argue
that friction is limited by phonon relaxation times which are strongly coupled
to the electronic degrees of freedom through distortions of the MnO6 octahedra.
The concept of controlling friction forces by electric fields should be

informations (such as, molecule density and cluster-size) that are key to
understand disease progression and the underlying mechanism. Traditional
single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of
variable sizes (as determined by its localization precisions (LPs)) to
reconstruct super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and
superimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single molecules) that
degrade image resolution. Ideally it should be possible to identify the
brightest molecules (also termed as, fortunate molecules) to reconstruct
ultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the
recorded data. POSSIBLE microscopy explores this possibility by introducing
narrow probability size-distribution of single molecules (narrow size-spectrum
about a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean
and variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function).
Subsequently, the dataset is processed and single molecule filtering is carried
out by the Gaussian distribution function to filter out unfortunate molecules.
The fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct
ultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is
capable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single
molecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected.
In short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key. Here, we
demonstrate the POSSIBLE microscopy technique and reconstruct single molecule

of the eccentricities of its vertices. The Wiener index of $G$ is the sum of
the distances between all unordered pairs of vertices of $G$. The unique trees
that minimise the Wiener index among all trees with a given eccentric sequence
were recently determined by the present authors. In this paper we show that
these results hold not only for the Wiener index, but for a large class of
distance-based topological indices which we term Wiener-type indices.
Particular cases of this class include the hyper-Wiener index, the Harary
index, the generalised Wiener index $W^{\lambda}$ for $\lambda>0$ and $\lambda
<0$, and the reciprocal complementary Wiener index. Our results imply and unify
known bounds on these Wiener-type indices for trees of given order and
diameter.
  We also present similar results for the $k$-Steiner Wiener index of trees
with a given eccentric sequence. The Steiner distance of a set $A\subseteq
V(G)$ is theminimum number of edges in a subtree of $G$ whose vertex set
contains $A$, and the $k$-Steiner Wiener index is the sum of distances of all
$k$-element subsets of $V(G)$. As a corollary, we obtain a sharp lower bound on
the $k$-Steiner Wiener index of trees with given order and diameter, and

performance measures were estimated and tested to examine the comparability
among them. Evaluation of profitability revealed a decreasing trend and
evaluation of stock performance suggests that investors are incurring losses on

that productivity regress was recorded initially but at the end of the studied

perform well on image classification tasks. Object detection methods, however,
are still in need of significant improvements. In this paper, we propose a new
framework called Ventral-Dorsal Networks (VDNets) which is inspired by the
structure of the human visual system. Roughly, the visual input signal is
analyzed along two separate neural streams, one in the temporal lobe and the
other in the parietal lobe. The coarse functional distinction between these
streams is between object recognition -- the ""what"" of the signal -- and
extracting location related information -- the ""where"" of the signal. The
ventral pathway from primary visual cortex, entering the temporal lobe, is
dominated by ""what"" information, while the dorsal pathway, into the parietal
lobe, is dominated by ""where"" information. Inspired by this structure, we
propose the integration of a ""Ventral Network"" and a ""Dorsal Network"", which
are complementary. Information about object identity can guide localization,
and location information can guide attention to relevant image regions,
improving object recognition. This new dual network framework sharpens the
focus of object detection. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed
method outperforms state-of-the-art object detection approaches on PASCAL VOC
2007 by 8% (mAP) and PASCAL VOC 2012 by 3% (mAP). Moreover, a comparison of
techniques on Yearbook images displays substantial qualitative and quantitative
benefits of VDNet.

by tuning the geometry of the central nanoring and quadrumer of slightly
rotated satellite nanocrescents and by selecting those azimuthal orientations
that promote localized plasmon resonances. The spectral and near-field effects
of hexagonal patterns made of uniform gold nanorings and nanocrescents, that
can be prepared by transferring masks fabricated by a perpendicularly and
obliquely incident single homogeneous circularly polarized beam, were studied
to uncover the supported localized plasmonic modes. Artificial rectangular
patterns made of a singlet nanoring and singlet nanocrescent as well as
quadrumer of four nanocrescents were investigated to analyze the role of
nano-object interactions and lattice type. It was proven that all
nanophotonical phenomena are governed by the azimuthal orientation independent
localized resonance on the nanorings and by the C2, C1 and U resonances on the
nanocrescents in case of $\bar{E}$-field oscillation direction perpendicular
and parallel to their symmetry axes. The interaction between localized surface
plasmon resonances on individual nano-objects is weak, whereas scattered
photonic modes have a perturbative role at the Rayleigh anomaly only on the
larger periodic rectangular pattern of miniarrays. Considerable fluorescence
enhancement of dipolar emitters is achievable at spectral locations promoting
the C and U resonances on the composing nano-objects.

for solving problems involving parametric differential equations (DEs) called
the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections, or X-TFC. The proposed method is
a synergy of two recently developed frameworks for solving problems involving
parametric DEs, 1) the Theory of Functional Connections, TFC, and the
Physics-Informed Neural Networks, PINN. Although this paper focuses on the
solution of exact problems involving parametric DEs (i.e. problems where the
modeling error is negligible) with known parameters, X-TFC can also be used for
data-driven solutions and data-driven discovery of parametric DEs. In the
proposed method, the latent solution of the parametric DEs is approximated by a
TFC constrained expression that uses a Neural Network (NN) as the
free-function. This approximate solution form always analytically satisfies the
constraints of the DE, while maintaining a NN with unconstrained parameters,
like the Deep-TFC method. X-TFC differs from PINN and Deep-TFC; whereas PINN
and Deep-TFC use a deep-NN, X-TFC uses a single-layer NN, or more precisely, an
Extreme Learning Machine, ELM. This choice is based on the properties of the
ELM algorithm. In order to numerically validate the method, it was tested over
a range of problems including the approximation of solutions to linear and
non-linear ordinary DEs (ODEs), systems of ODEs (SODEs), and partial DEs
(PDEs). Furthermore, a few of these problems are of interest in physics and
engineering such as the Classic Emden-Fowler equation, the Radiative Transfer
(RT) equation, and the Heat-Transfer (HT) equation. The results show that X-TFC
achieves high accuracy with low computational time and thus it is comparable
with the other state-of-the-art methods.

performance as well as good interpretability. Traditional machine learning
methods are easy to interpret but have low accuracies. The development of deep

models are typically hard to interpret. In this work, we propose interpretable

model semantic meanings and explore novel methods to increase interpretability.
The design of iCapsNets is consistent with human intuition and enables it to
produce human-understandable interpretation results. Notably, iCapsNets can be
interpreted both locally and globally. In terms of local interpretability,
iCapsNets offer a simple yet effective method to explain the predictions for
each data sample. On the other hand, iCapsNets explore a novel way to explain
the model's general behavior, achieving global interpretability. Experimental
studies show that our iCapsNets yield meaningful local and global
interpretation results, without suffering from significant performance loss
