retrograde-prograde orbits in combination with a mechanical black hole feedback
model can form galaxies with weak enough ongoing star formation, and therefore
absent H$\alpha$ emission, to be selected by traditional PSB selection methods.
We find strong fluctuations in nebular emission line strengths, even within the
PSB phase, suggesting that H$\alpha$ selected PSBs are only a subsample of the
underlying population. The global PSB population can be more robustly
identified using stellar continuum-based approaches. The difficulty in
reproducing the very young PSBs in simulations potentially indicates that new
sub-resolution star formation recipes are required to properly model the
process of star formation quenching. In our simulations, we find that the
starburst peaks at the same time at all radii, but is stronger and more
prolonged in the inner regions. This results in a strong time evolution in the
radial gradients of the spectral indices which can be used to estimate the age
of the starburst without reliance on detailed star formation histories from

online social platforms. In many of these cases, users regret posting such
content. To retrospectively rectify these errors in users' sharing decisions,
most platforms offer (deletion) mechanisms to withdraw the content, and social
media users often utilize them. Ironically and perhaps unfortunately, these
deletions make users more susceptible to privacy violations by malicious actors
who specifically hunt post deletions at large scale. The reason for such
hunting is simple: deleting a post acts as a powerful signal that the post
might be damaging to its owner. Today, multiple archival services are already
scanning social media for these deleted posts. Moreover, as we demonstrate in
this work, powerful machine learning models can detect damaging deletions at
scale.
  Towards restraining such a global adversary against users' right to be
forgotten, we introduce Deceptive Deletion, a decoy mechanism that minimizes
the adversarial advantage. Our mechanism injects decoy deletions, hence
creating a two-player minmax game between an adversary that seeks to classify
damaging content among the deleted posts and a challenger that employs decoy
deletions to masquerade real damaging deletions. We formalize the Deceptive
Game between the two players, determine conditions under which either the
adversary or the challenger provably wins the game, and discuss the scenarios
in-between these two extremes. We apply the Deceptive Deletion mechanism to a
real-world task on Twitter: hiding damaging tweet deletions. We show that a
powerful global adversary can be beaten by a powerful challenger, raising the
bar significantly and giving a glimmer of hope in the ability to be really
forgotten on social platforms.

demonstrate that acoustic spacetimes may be formed through higher order

rather more general than what was thought before. We consider spherically
accreting astrophysical systems as a natural classical analogue gravity model,

set of equations for the mass accretion rate and the density of the fluid. In
particular, we demonstrate that the wave equation for the mass accretion rate
involves an acoustic metric which can be perturbatively constructed to all

Bondi flow solution. This analysis uses boundary conditions set to the original
unperturbed values, with the time dependence of the mass accretion rate
perturbation taken to be exponentially damped. The perturbed solutions indicate
that second order and higher perturbations of the metric generically cause the

that the diversity of the bulk composition of cosmic spherules, chondrules and
chondrites can be explained by their formation close to rocklines, suggesting
that solid matter is concentrated in the vicinity of these
sublimation/condensation fronts. Although our model relies a lot on the number
of considered species and the availability of thermodynamic data governing

compelling notions of fairness such as envy-freeness, which states that no

must be deterministic, achieving exact fairness is impossible but approximate
notions such as envy-freeness up to one good can be guaranteed. Our goal in
this work is to achieve both simultaneously, by constructing a randomized
allocation that is exactly fair ex-ante and approximately fair ex-post. The key
question we address is whether ex-ante envy-freeness can be achieved in
combination with ex-post envy-freeness up to one good. We settle this
positively by designing an efficient algorithm that achieves both properties
simultaneously. If we additionally require economic efficiency, we obtain an
impossibility result. However, we show that economic efficiency and ex-ante
envy-freeness can be simultaneously achieved if we slightly relax our ex-post

experiments performed thus far, however, have been unable to discern whether
the antinodal states are rendered unobservable due to their damping, or whether
they vanish due to their gapping. Here we distinguish between these two
scenarios by using quantum oscillations to examine whether the small Fermi
surface pocket, found to occupy only 2% of the Brillouin zone in the underdoped
cuprates, exists in isolation against a majority of completely gapped density
of states spanning the antinodes, or whether it is thermodynamically coupled to
a background of ungapped antinodal states. We find that quantum oscillations
associated with the small Fermi surface pocket exhibit a signature sawtooth
waveform characteristic of an isolated two-dimensional Fermi surface pocket.
This finding reveals that the antinodal states are destroyed by a hard gap that
extends over the majority of the Brillouin zone, placing strong constraints on
a drastic underlying origin of quasiparticle disappearance over almost the
entire Brillouin zone in the pseudogap regime.

fuzzing, an automatic approach for finding test suites of packet-level CPS

Our approach learns regression models for predicting sensor values that will
result from sampled network packets, and uses these predictions to guide a

into an unsafe state. Key to our solution is the use of online active learning,
which iteratively updates the models by sampling payloads that are estimated to
maximally improve them. We evaluate the efficacy of active fuzzing by
implementing it for a water purification plant testbed, finding it can
automatically discover a test suite of flow, pressure, and over/underflow
attacks, all with substantially less time, data, and network access than the
most comparable approach. Finally, we demonstrate that our prediction models
can also be utilised as countermeasures themselves, implementing them as

of interest in these functions. Ridge functions appear in various fields and

in neural networks.
  We are interested in ridge functions from the point of view of approximation
theory. The basic goal in approximation theory is to approximate complicated
objects by simpler objects. Among many classes of multivariate functions,
linear combinations of ridge functions are a class of simpler functions. These
notes study some problems of approximation of multivariate functions by linear
combinations of ridge functions. We present here various properties of these
functions. The questions we ask are as follows. When can a multivariate
function be expressed as a linear combination of ridge functions from a certain
class? When do such linear combinations represent each multivariate function?
If a precise representation is not possible, can one approximate arbitrarily
well? If well approximation fails, how can one compute/estimate the error of
approximation, know that a best approximation exists? How can one characterize
and construct best approximations? If a smooth function is a sum of arbitrarily
behaved ridge functions, can it be expressed as a sum of smooth ridge
functions? We also study properties of generalized ridge functions, which are
very much related to linear superpositions and Kolmogorov's famous
superposition theorem. These notes end with a few applications of ridge
functions to the problem of approximation by single and two hidden layer neural
networks with a restricted set of weights.

high harmonics of the fundamental oscillation. We perform a numerical study

analytical model to describe the coupled cavity-quantum dot system, which
allows us to describe the light field dynamics in terms of a Newton-like
dynamics in an effective anharmonic potential. From the shape of this potential
combined with the initial conditions the transition can be well understood. The
model is then extended to a broadened ensemble of quantum dots. For weak
excitation the polariton spectrum broadens and the lines slightly shift,
however, the sharp transition to the Rabi oscillation regime is still present.
Furthermore, we find a second, lower threshold with additional lines in the

approaches employing mostly normal data due to the inaccessibility of anomalies
on a large scale combined with the ambiguous nature of anomaly appearance.
  We follow an alternative approach and demonstrate that deep feature
representations learned by discriminative models on large natural image
datasets are well suited to describe normality and detect even subtle anomalies
in a transfer learning setting. Our model of normality is established by
fitting a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) to deep feature representations of
classification networks trained on ImageNet using normal data only. By
subsequently applying the Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score we
outperform the current state of the art on the public MVTec AD dataset,
achieving an AUROC value of $95.8 \pm 1.2$ (mean $\pm$ SEM) over all 15
classes. We further investigate why the learned representations are
discriminative to the AD task using Principal Component Analysis. We find that
the principal components containing little variance in normal data are the ones
crucial for discriminating between normal and anomalous instances. This gives a
possible explanation to the often sub-par performance of AD approaches trained
from scratch using normal data only. By selectively fitting a MVG to these most
relevant components only, we are able to further reduce model complexity while
retaining AD performance. We also investigate setting the working point by
selecting acceptable False Positive Rate thresholds based on the MVG
assumption.

correspondence between the correlations in the ground state and the excitation

Dirac-like dispersions signal the emergence of gapless fractionalized spin-1/2
Dirac-type spinons in the distinctive QSL phase. Unexplored critical behavior
with coexisting and dual power-law decays of N\'{e}el antiferromagnetic and

friction map obtained on an isolated Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ nano-sheet deposited on a
silicon dioxide substrate via friction force microscopy. Our experiments reveal
that few-layer Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_x$ nano-sheets indeed act as solid lubricants on
the nanoscale, reducing friction on the silicon dioxide substrates, although
not as effectively as few-layer graphene. The results reported here pave the
way for further studies focusing on nanoscale solid lubrication achieved by
Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ (MXene) nano-sheets.

magnetic transition takes place inside superconducting state and the exchange
interaction between superconducting and magnetic subsystems is weak so that
superconductivity is not destroyed at the magnetic transition. An example of
such material is RbEuFe$_{4}$As$_{4}$. We investigate the suppression of the
superconducting gap and superfluid density by correlated magnetic fluctuations
in the vicinity of the magnetic transition. The influence of nonuniform
exchange field on superconducting parameters is sensitive to the relation
between the magnetic correlation length, $\xi_{h}$, and superconducting
coherence length $\xi_{s}$ defining the 'scattering' ($\xi_{h}<\xi_{s}$) and
'smooth' ($\xi_{h}>\xi_{s}$) regimes. As a small uniform exchange field does
not affect the superconducting gap and superfluid density at zero temperature,
smoothening of the spatial variations of the exchange field reduces its effects
on these parameters. We develop a quantitative description of this
'scattering-to-smooth' crossover for the case of quasi-two-dimensional magnetic
fluctuations. Since the magnetic-scattering probability varies at the energy
scale comparable with the gap, the quasiclassical approximation is not
applicable in the crossover region and microscopic treatment is required. We
find that the corrections to both the gap and superfluid density grow
proportionally to $\xi_{h}$ until it remains much smaller than $\xi_{s}$. When
$\xi_{h}$ exceeds $\xi_{s}$, both parameters have much weaker dependence on
$\xi_{h}$. Moreover, the gap correction may decrease with increasing of
$\xi_{h}$ in the vicinity of the magnetic transition. We also find that the
crossover is unexpectedly broad: the standard scattering approximation becomes
sufficient only when $\xi_{h}$ is substantially smaller than $\xi_{s}$.

the binaries being formed in the field, as such systems are expected to have

Our constraint is a factor of two smaller that an estimate based on GW170817

important to perform full parameter estimation with accurate waveform

components, but with the sum of latter being zero, which act as the

and high-stabilty thermal control. ASTERIA demonstrated 0.5 arcsecond RMS
pointing stability and $\pm$10 milliKelvin thermal control of its camera
payload during its primary mission, a significant improvement in pointing and
thermal performance compared to other spacecraft in ASTERIA's size and mass
class. ASTERIA launched in August 2017 and deployed from the International
Space Station (ISS) November 2017. During the prime mission (November 2017 --
February 2018) and the first extended mission that followed (March 2018 - May
2018), ASTERIA conducted opportunistic science observations which included
collection of photometric data on 55 Cancri, a nearby exoplanetary system with
a super-Earth transiting planet. The 55 Cancri data were reduced using a custom
pipeline to correct CMOS detector column-dependent gain variations. A Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach was used to simultaneously detrend the
photometry using a simple baseline model and fit a transit model. ASTERIA made
a marginal detection of the known transiting exoplanet 55 Cancri e

first detection of an exoplanet transit by a CubeSat. The successful detection
of super-Earth 55 Cancri e demonstrates that small, inexpensive spacecraft can

to find suitable methods by a focus on Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and SAT
to solve this puzzle quickly and accurately. An optimization has been applied
to the proposed MCTS algorithm to obtain a promising result. Also, since the
prefabricated test cases of this puzzle are not large enough to assay the
proposed method, we have proposed and employed a technique to generate solvable
test cases to evaluate the approaches. Eventually, the MCTS-based method has
been assessed by the auto-generated test cases and compared with our
implemented SAT approach that is considered a good rival. Our comparison
indicates that the MCTS-based approach is an up-and-coming method that could
cope with the test cases with small and medium sizes with faster run-time
compared to SAT. However, for certain discussed reasons, including the features
of the problem, tree search organization, and also the approach of MCTS in the
Simulation step, MCTS takes more time to execute in Large size scenarios.
Consequently, we have found the bottleneck for the MCTS-based method in
significant test cases that could be improved in two real-world problems.

quantum antiferromagnets with easy-axis anisotropy, using a semi-classical
non-linear sigma model. The saddle point approximation leads to a sine Gordon
equation which supports soliton solutions. These correspond to the movement of
spatially extended domain walls. Long-range magnetic order is a consequence of
a weak inter-chain coupling. Below the ordering temperature, the coupling to
nearby chains leads to an energy cost associated with the separation of two
domain walls. From the kink-antikink two-soliton solution, we compute the
effective confinement potential. At distances large compared to the size of the
solitons the potential is linear, as expected for point-like domain walls. At
small distances the gradual annihilation of the solitons weakens the effective
attraction and renders the potential quadratic. From numerically solving the
effective one dimensional Schr\""oedinger equation with this non-linear
confinement potential we compute the soliton bound state spectrum. We apply the
theory to CaFe$_{2}$O$_{4}$, an anisotropic $S=5/2$ magnet based upon
antiferromagnetic zig-zag chains. Using inelastic neutron scattering, we are
able to resolve seven discrete energy levels for spectra recorded slightly
below the N\'eel temperature $T_\textrm{N}\approx 200$~K. These modes are well
described by our non-linear confinement model in the regime of large spatially
extended solitons.

175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model,
and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is
applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot
demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3
achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation,
question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require
on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a
novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time,

shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes

also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 25

propose two types of constraints: cross-modal invariance constraint and
cross-view invariant constraint. Cross-modal invariance constraint forces the
network to maximum the agreement of features from different modalities for same
objects, while the cross-view invariance constraint forces the network to
maximum agreement of features from different views of images for same objects.
The quality of learned features has been tested on different downstream tasks
with three modalities of data including point cloud, multi-view images, and

evaluated with the cross-modal retrieval task. Extensive evaluation results
demonstrate that the learned features are robust and have strong

personalization services. In practice, it is necessary to capture user's
drifting interests by modeling sequential user behaviors to build an accurate
CTR prediction model. However, as the users accumulate more and more behavioral
data on the platforms, it becomes non-trivial for the sequential models to make
use of the whole behavior history of each user. First, directly feeding the
long behavior sequence will make online inference time and system load
infeasible. Second, there is much noise in such long histories to fail the
sequential model learning. The current industrial solutions mainly truncate the
sequences and just feed recent behaviors to the prediction model, which leads
to a problem that sequential patterns such as periodicity or long-term
dependency are not embedded in the recent several behaviors but in far back
history. To tackle these issues, in this paper we consider it from the data
perspective instead of just designing more sophisticated yet complicated models
and propose User Behavior Retrieval for CTR prediction (UBR4CTR) framework. In
UBR4CTR, the most relevant and appropriate user behaviors will be firstly
retrieved from the entire user history sequence using a learnable search
method. These retrieved behaviors are then fed into a deep model to make the
final prediction instead of simply using the most recent ones. It is highly
feasible to deploy UBR4CTR into industrial model pipeline with low cost.
Experiments on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate the
superiority and efficacy of our proposed framework and models.

fusion RFP plasmas. MST's poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields ($B_\text{p}$
and $B_\text{t}$) can be sourced by programmable power supplies (PPSs) based on
integrated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). In order to provide real-time
simultaneous control of both $B_\text{p}$ and $B_\text{t}$ circuits, a
time-independent integrated model is developed. The actuators considered for
the control are the $B_\text{p}$ and $B_\text{t}$ primary currents produced by
the PPSs. The control system goal will be tracking two particular demand
quantities that can be measured at the plasma surface ($r=a$): the plasma
current, $I_\text{p} \sim B_\text{p}(a)$, and the RFP reversal parameter,
$F\sim B_\text{t}(a)/\Phi$, where $\Phi$ is the toroidal flux in the plasma.
The edge safety factor, $q(a)\propto B_t(a)$, tends to track $F$ but not
identically. To understand the responses of $I_\text{p}$ and $F$ to the
actuators and to enable systematic design of control algorithms, dedicated
experiments are run in which the actuators are modulated, and a linearized
dynamic data-driven model is generated using a system identification method. We
perform a series of initial real-time experiments to test the designed feedback
controllers and validate the derived model predictions. The feedback
controllers show systematic improvements over simpler feedforward controllers.

higher symmetry and is beyond higher group. We show that an algebraic higher
symmetry in a bosonic system in $n$-dimensional space is characterized and
classified by a local fusion $n$-category. We find another way to describe
algebraic higher symmetry by restricting to symmetric sub Hilbert space where
symmetry transformations all become trivial. In this case, algebraic higher
symmetry can be fully characterized by a non-invertible gravitational anomaly
(i.e. an topological order in one higher dimension). Thus we also refer to
non-invertible gravitational anomaly as categorical symmetry to stress its
connection to symmetry. This provides a holographic and entanglement view of
symmetries. For a system with a categorical symmetry, its gapped state must
spontaneously break part (not all) of the symmetry, and the state with the full
symmetry must be gapless. Using such a holographic point of view, we obtain (1)
the gauging of the algebraic higher symmetry; (2) the classification of
anomalies for an algebraic higher symmetry; (3) the equivalence between classes
of systems, with different (potentially anomalous) algebraic higher symmetries
or different sets of low energy excitations, as long as they have the same
categorical symmetry; (4) the classification of gapped liquid phases for
bosonic/fermionic systems with a categorical symmetry, as gapped boundaries of
a topological order in one higher dimension (that corresponds to the
categorical symmetry). This classification includes symmetry protected trivial
(SPT) orders and symmetry enriched topological (SET) orders with an algebraic
higher symmetry.

a semilocalized phase near the edges of the spectrum, where the eigenvectors
are essentially localized on a small number of vertices. In the semilocalized

balls centred around resonant vertices, in each of which it is a radial
exponentially decaying function. The transition between the phases is sharp and
is manifested in a discontinuity in the localization exponent $\gamma(\mathbf

has been widely investigated in recent work, typically with a non-dynamic ocean
and without continents. On Earth, ocean dynamics are a primary means of heat
and nutrient distribution. Continents are a critical source of nutrients,
strongly influence ocean dynamics, and participate in climate regulation. In
this work, we investigate how the size of a substellar land mass affects the
oceans ability to transport heat and upwell nutrients on the tidally locked
planet Proxima Centauri b using the ROCKE-3D coupled ocean-atmosphere General
Circulation Model (GCM). We find that dayside ice-free ocean and nutrient
delivery to the mixed layer via upwelling are maintained across all continent
sizes. We also find that Proxima Centauri bs climate is more sensitive to
differences among atmospheric GCMs than to the inclusion of ocean dynamics in
ROCKE-3D. Finally, we find that Proxima Centauri b transitions from a lobster
state where ocean heat transport distributes heat away from the substellar
point to an eyeball state where heat transport is restricted and surface
temperature decreases symmetrically from the substellar point when the
continent size exceeds about 20 percent of the surface area. Our work suggests
that both a dynamic ocean and continents are unlikely to decrease the
habitability prospects of nearby tidally locked targets like Proxima Centauri b

Fomalhaut and HD 202628 are narrower than expected in the standard eccentric
planet perturbation scenario (sometimes referred to as ""pericenter glow""). The
standard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals
at semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas
disc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting
in a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower
belts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could
result from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary
disc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by
instabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any
planets. Whether these scenarios produce detectable eccentric rings within
protoplanetary discs is unclear, but they nevertheless predict that narrow
eccentric planetesimal rings should exist before the gas in protoplanetary
discs is dispersed. PDS 70 is noted as a system hosting an asymmetric

phenomenon inform us of conditions in the planet-forming zones close to these
stars. Although many dipper stars have been identified with space missions such

(ASAS-SN), and further characterized these using observations by the Las
Cumbres Global Observatory Telescope (LCOGT) and the Transiting Exoplanet
Survey Satellite $TESS$, as well as archival data from other missions. Dipper
stars were identified from a catalog of nearby young stars and selected based
on the statistical significance, asymmetry, and quasi-periodicity or
aperiodicity of variability in their ASAS-SN light curves. All 11 stars lie
above or red-ward of the zero-age main sequence and have infrared excesses
indicating the presence of full circumstellar disks. We obtain
reddening-extinction relations for the variability of 7 stars using our
combined ASAS-SN-$TESS$ and LCOGT photometry. In all cases the slopes are below
the ISM value, suggesting larger grains, and we find a tentative relation
between the slope (grain size) and the $\text{K}_\text{s}-[22\:\mu\text{m}]$

its evolution during the dark ages and cosmic dawn in light of EDGES 21-cm
signal. Our analysis has been carried out on a `colder IGM' background which is
one of the promising avenues to interpret the EDGES signal. We consider the
dark matter-baryon interactions for the excess cooling. We find that the colder
IGM suppresses both the residual free electron fraction and the coupling
coefficient between the ionised and neutral components. The Compton heating
also gets affected in colder IGM background. Consequently, the IGM heating rate
due to the PMF enhances compared to the standard scenario. Thus, a significant
fraction of the magnetic energy, for $B_0 \lesssim 0.5 \, {\rm nG}$, gets
transferred to the IGM and the magnetic field decays at a much faster rate
compared to the simple $(1+z)^2$ scaling during the dark ages and cosmic dawn.
This low PMF is an unlikely candidate for explaining the rise of the EDGES
absorption signal at lower redshift. We also see that the PMF and DM-baryon
interaction together introduces a plateau-like feature in the redshift
evolution of the IGM temperature. We find that the upper limit on the PMF
depends on the underlying DM-baryon interaction. Higher PMF can be allowed when
the interaction cross-section is higher and/or the DM particle mass is lower.
Our study shows that the PMF with $B_0$ up to $\sim 0.4 \, {\rm nG}$, which is
ruled out in the standard model, can be allowed if DM-baryon interaction with
suitable cross-section and DM mass is considered.

holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs). The third observing run of the LIGO/Virgo
interferometers provided BH-NS candidate events that yielded no electromagnetic
(EM) counterparts. The broad range of disk configurations expected from BH-NS
mergers motivates a thorough exploration of parameter space to improve EM
signal predictions. Here we conduct 27 high-resolution, axisymmetric, long-term
hydrodynamic simulations of the viscous evolution of BH accretion disks that
include neutrino emission/absorption effects and post-processing with a nuclear
reaction network. In the absence of magnetic fields, these simulations provide
a lower-limit to the fraction of the initial disk mass ejected. We find a
nearly linear inverse dependence of this fraction on disk compactness (BH mass
over initial disk radius). The dependence is related to the fraction of the
disk mass accreted before the outflow is launched, which depends on the disk
position relative to the innermost stable circular orbit. We also characterize
a trend of decreasing ejected fraction and decreasing lanthanide/actinide
content with increasing disk mass at fixed BH mass. This trend results from a
longer time to reach weak freezout and an increasingly dominant role of
neutrino absorption at higher disk masses. We estimate the radioactive
luminosity from the disk outflow alone available to power kilonovae over the
range of configurations studied, finding a spread of two orders of magnitude.
For most of the BH-NS parameter space, the disk outflow contribution is well

non-standard physical processes affecting the star. Mechanisms that could
produce this signature include contamination from an external source, such as
planets, or internal production and subsequent mixing to the stellar surface.
However, distinguishing between different families of solutions has proven
challenging, and there is no current consensus model that explains all the
data. The lithium-6 ($\mathrm{^6Li}$) abundance may be a potentially important
discriminant, as the relative $\mathrm{^6Li}$ and $\mathrm{^7Li}$ abundances
are expected to be different if the enrichment were to come from internal
production or from engulfment. In this work, we model the $\mathrm{^6Li}$ and
$\mathrm{^7Li}$ abundances of different giants after the engulfment of a
substellar mass companion. Given that $\mathrm{^6Li}$ is more strongly affected
by Galactic chemical evolution than $\mathrm{^7Li}$, $\mathrm{^6Li}$ is not a
good discriminant at low metallicities, where it is expected to be low in both
star and planet. For modeled metallicities ([Fe/H]$>-0.5$), we use a ""best
case"" initial $\mathrm{^6Li/^7Li}$ ratio equal to the solar value.
$\mathrm{^6Li}$ increases significantly after the engulfment of a companion.
However, at metallicities close to solar and higher, the $\mathrm{^6Li}$ signal
does not last long in the stellar surface. As such, detection of surface
$\mathrm{^6Li}$ in metal-rich red giants would most likely indicate the action
of a mechanism for $\mathrm{^6Li}$-enrichment other than planet engulfment. At
the same time, $\mathrm{^6Li}$ should not be used to reject the hypothesis of
engulfment in a $\mathrm{^7Li}$-enriched giant or to support a particular
$\mathrm{^7Li}$-enhancement mechanism.

  Communications",,,,"cs.IT eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to recent advances in laser satellite communications technology,
free-space optical (FSO) links are presented as an ideal alternative to the
conventional radio frequency (RF) feeder links of the geostationary satellite
for next generation very high throughput satellite (VHTS) systems. In this
paper, we investigate the performance of multibeam VHTS systems that account
for nonlinear high power amplifiers at the transparent fixed gain satellite
transponder. Specifically, we consider the forward link of such systems, where
the RF user link is assumed to follow the shadowed Rician model and the FSO
feeder link is modeled by the Gamma-Gamma distribution in the presence of beam
wander and pointing errors where it operates under either the intensity
modulation with direct detection or the heterodyne detection. Moreover,
zero-forcing precoder is employed to mitigate the effect of inter-beam
interference caused by the aggressive frequency reuse in the user link. The
performance of the system under study is evaluated in terms of the outage
probability, the average bit-error rate (BER), and the ergodic capacity that
are derived in exact closed-forms in terms of the bivariate Meijer's G
function. Simple asymptotic results for the outage probability and the average
BER are also obtained at high signal-to-noise ratio.

Whether it is for autonomous driving vehicles or the internet of everything,
machines are more connected than ever to improve their performance in
fulfilling a given task. While in traditional communications the goal has often
been to reconstruct the underlying message, under the emerging task-oriented
paradigm, the goal of communication is to enable the receiving end to make more
informed decisions or more precise estimates/computations. Motivated by these
recent developments, in this paper, we perform an indirect design of the
communications in a multi-agent system (MAS) in which agents cooperate to
maximize the averaged sum of discounted one-stage rewards of a collaborative
task. Due to the bit-budgeted communications between the agents, each agent
should efficiently represent its local observation and communicate an
abstracted version of the observations to improve the collaborative task
performance. We first show that this problem can be approximated as a form of
data-quantization problem which we call task-oriented data compression (TODC).
We then introduce the state-aggregation for information compression algorithm
(SAIC) to solve the formulated TODC problem. It is shown that SAIC is able to
achieve near-optimal performance in terms of the achieved sum of discounted
rewards. The proposed algorithm is applied to a geometric consensus problem and
its performance is compared with several benchmarks. Numerical experiments
confirm the promise of this indirect design approach for task-oriented
multi-agent communications.

calculate dynamical correlation functions of many-body systems. Time-dependent
correlation functions and their associated frequency spectral densities are the
quantities of interest, for they play a central role in both the theoretical
and experimental understanding of dynamic properties. The calculation of the
relaxation function is rather difficult in most cases of interest, except for a
few examples where exact analytic expressions are allowed. For most of systems
of interest approximation schemes must be used. The method of recurrence
relation has, at its foundation, the solution of Heisenberg equation of motion
of an operator in a many-body interacting system. Insights have been gained
from theorems that were discovered with that method. For instance, the absence
of pure exponential behavior for the relaxation functions of any Hamiltonian
system. The method of recurrence relations was used in quantum systems such as
dense electron gas, transverse Ising model, Heisenberg model, XY model,
Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as classical
harmonic oscillator chains. Effects of disorder were considered in some of
those systems. In the cases where analytical solutions were not feasible,
approximation schemes were used, but are highly model-dependent. Another
important approach is the numerically exact diagonalization method. It is used
in finite-sized systems, which sometimes provides very reliable information of
the dynamics at the infinite-size limit. In this work, we discuss the most
relevant applications of the method of recurrence relations and numerical
calculations based on exact diagonalizations.

demonstrate that the technique outputs a clean signature with higher fidelity

longitudinal magnetoresistance arising from the chiral anomaly. However,
negative longitudinal magnetoresistance is not unique to chiral anomaly and can
arise due to completely different mechanisms such as current jetting or in
ferromagnetic systems due to the suppression of scattering with magnons.
Therefore, a macroscopic effect that can be uniquely attributed to the presence
of Weyl nodes is desirable. Here we show that the planar Hall effect could be a
hallmark for Weyl nodes. We investigated the anisotropic magnetoresistance and
planar Hall effect in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, which has a kagome lattice and has been
predicted to be a type II Weyl metal. We discover that the planar Hall effect
contains a field antisymmetric contribution in addition to the ordinary field
symmetric contribution. The field antisymmetric planar Hall effect has a 3-fold
rotational symmetry, distinctively different from the symmetric planar Hall
effect, but consistent with the 3-fold rotational degeneracy of the
magnetization in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$. The temperature and field dependence of the
antisymmetric planar Hall effect rules out an interpretation based on
contribution from the anomalous Hall effect and is different from the symmetric
planar Hall effect, pointing to a different origin. We attribute the
antisymmetric planar Hall effect to the topological nature of Fe$_3$Sn$_2$ due
to the presence of Weyl II nodes. Our finding offers a promising route for
macroscopically probing Weyl systems.

its effectiveness, we curate 600 3D CT images of 280 patients from multiple

potential landscape, the charge carrier dynamics is treated nonperturbatively,
preserving their coherence beyond single collision events. We show the coherent

perturbation theory. Furthermore, it goes beyond by revealing aspects that the
conventional theory could not explain: transient localization even at high

of states due to the self-generated disorder (deformation) potential in a pure

attention in 2014. The almost moribund project was a key security component in
public web servers and over a billion mobile devices. This vulnerability led to
new investments in OpenSSL.
  Objective: The goal of this study is to determine how the Heartbleed
vulnerability changed the software evolution of OpenSSL. We study changes in
vulnerabilities, code quality, project activity, and software engineering
practices.
  Method: We use a mixed methods approach, collecting multiple types of
quantitative data and qualitative data from web sites and an interview with a
developer who worked on post-Heartbleed changes. We use regression
discontinuity analysis to determine changes in levels and slopes of code and
project activity metrics resulting from Heartbleed.
  Results: The OpenSSL project made tremendous improvements to code quality and
security after Heartbleed. By the end of 2016, the number of commits per month
had tripled, 91 vulnerabilities were found and fixed, code complexity decreased
significantly, and OpenSSL obtained a CII best practices badge, certifying its
use of good open source development practices.
  Conclusions: The OpenSSL project provides a model of how an open source
project can adapt and improve after a security event. The evolution of OpenSSL
shows that the number of known vulnerabilities is not a useful indicator of
project security. A small number of vulnerabilities may simply indicate that a
project does not expend much effort to finding vulnerabilities. This study
suggests that project activity and CII badge best practices may be better
indicators of code quality and security than vulnerability counts.

Galerkin projection (GROMs) suffer from imperfection and solution instabilities
due to the modal truncation, especially for advection-dominated flows with slow
decay in the Kolmogorov width. In the presented LSTM-Nudge approach, we fuse
forecasts from a combination of imperfect GROM and uncertain state estimates,
with sparse Eulerian sensor measurements to provide more reliable predictions
in a dynamical data assimilation framework. We illustrate the idea with the
viscous Burgers problem, as a benchmark test bed with quadratic nonlinearity
and Laplacian dissipation. We investigate the effects of measurements noise and
state estimate uncertainty on the performance of the LSTM-Nudge behavior. We
also demonstrate that it can sufficiently handle different levels of temporal

assessment structure is mainly based on previous research, which recommends a
readiness assessment prior to to an EHR system implementation. To collect data,
participant observation, document analysis and an in-depth interview were used.
This study has revealed new insights into the current situation on EHR in
Vietnam. The Ministry of Health is currently working on improving the
conditions for future implementation of a Vietnamese EHR system. There are
issues with the current way of handling health records. These issues are
encouraging the Ministry of Health to work on identifying the next steps for an
EHR system implementation. The integration of an EHR system with current
systems seems to be challenging as most systems are commercial, closed source
and very likely have no standardised interface. In conclusion, this study
identifies points which need to be further investigated prior to an
implementation. Generally, health care workers show good awareness of new
technologies. As the Vietnam's health care system is centrally organised, there
is the possibility for a nation-wide implementation. This could have a positive
impact on the health care system, however, besides rigours planning also
standards need to be followed and common interfaces implemented. Finally, this
assessment has focused on only one level of readiness assessment. Further
research is needed to complete the assessment.

spatially resolved the locations of three flares and showed that a bright

the observed motion of the bright regions observed by the GRAVITY experiment

users to express their preferences over descriptive item features. The model is
first trained offline by a novel matrix factorization algorithm, and then
iteratively updates the user and item latent factors online by a closed-form

electrodes is currently used to probe the epileptic brain as part of
pre-surgical evaluation, and it is also being considered for therapeutic
treatments through neuromodulation. It is still unknown, however, how
consistent intracranial direct electrical stimulation responses are across
sessions, to allow effective neuromodulation design.
  Objective: To investigate the cross-session consistency of the
electrophysiological effect of electrical stimulation delivered through
intracranial EEG.
  Methods: We analysed data from 79 epilepsy patients implanted with
intracranial EEG who underwent brain stimulation as part of a memory
experiment. We quantified the effect of stimulation in terms of band power
modulation and compared this effect from session to session. As a reference, we
applied the same measures during baseline periods.
  Results: In most sessions, the effect of stimulation on band power could not
be distinguished from baseline fluctuations of band power. Stimulation effect
was also not consistent across sessions; only a third of the session pairs had
a higher consistency than the baseline standards. Cross-session consistency is
mainly associated with the strength of positive stimulation effects, and it
also tends to be higher when the baseline conditions are more similar between
sessions.
  Conclusion: These findings can inform our practices for designing
neuromodulation with greater efficacy when using direct electrical brain
stimulation as a therapeutic treatment.

calls for intelligent home energy management (HEM) systems that can reduce
energy usage. This involves scheduling of loads from peak hours of the day when
energy consumption is at its highest to leaner off-peak periods of the day when
energy consumption is relatively lower thereby reducing the system's peak load
demand, which would consequently result in lesser energy bills, and improved
load demand profile. This work introduces a novel way to develop a learning
system that can learn from experience to shift loads from one time instance to
another and achieve the goal of minimizing the aggregate peak load. This paper
proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) model for demand response where
the virtual agent learns the task like humans do. The agent gets feedback for
every action it takes in the environment; these feedbacks will drive the agent
to learn about the environment and take much smarter steps later in its
learning stages. Our method outperformed the state of the art mixed integer
linear programming (MILP) for load peak reduction. The authors have also
designed an agent to learn to minimize both consumers' electricity bills and
utilities' system peak load demand simultaneously. The proposed model was
analyzed with loads from five different residential consumers; the proposed
method increases the monthly savings of each consumer by reducing their
electricity bill drastically along with minimizing the peak load on the system
when time shiftable loads are handled by the proposed method.

purpose-built method for doing so. However, recent advances in data science,
including computer vision (CV) and machine learning (ML) offer new approaches
to extracting information from microstructural images. This overview surveys CV
approaches to numerically encode the visual information contained in a
microstructural image, which then provides input to supervised or unsupervised
ML algorithms that find associations and trends in the high-dimensional image
representation. CV/ML systems for microstructural characterization and analysis
span the taxonomy of image analysis tasks, including image classification,
semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. These tools
enable new approaches to microstructural analysis, including the development of
new, rich visual metrics and the discovery of

evaluating model performance. However, this rarely holds in practise.
Geographic information data sets are an example where the data points have
stronger dependencies among each other the closer they are geographically. This
phenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC) causes the standard cross
validation (CV) methods to produce optimistically biased prediction performance
estimates for spatial models, which can result in increased costs and accidents
in practical applications. To overcome this problem we propose a modified
version of the CV method called spatial k-fold cross validation (SKCV), which
provides a useful estimate for model prediction performance without optimistic
bias due to SAC. We test SKCV with three real world cases involving open
natural data showing that the estimates produced by the ordinary CV are up to
40% more optimistic than those of SKCV. Both regression and classification
cases are considered in our experiments. In addition, we will show how the SKCV
method can be applied as a criterion for selecting data sampling density for
new research area.

or YOLO have difficulties detecting dense, small targets with arbitrary
orientation in large aerial images. The main reason is that using interpolation
to align RoI features can result in a lack of accuracy or even loss of location
information. We present the Local-aware Region Convolutional Neural Network
(LR-CNN), a novel two-stage approach for vehicle detection in aerial imagery.
We enhance translation invariance to detect dense vehicles and address the
boundary quantization issue amongst dense vehicles by aggregating the
high-precision RoIs' features. Moreover, we resample high-level semantic pooled
features, making them regain location information from the features of a
shallower convolutional block. This strengthens the local feature invariance
for the resampled features and enables detecting vehicles in an arbitrary
orientation. The local feature invariance enhances the learning ability of the
focal loss function, and the focal loss further helps to focus on the hard
examples. Taken together, our method better addresses the challenges of aerial
imagery. We evaluate our approach on several challenging datasets (VEDAI,
DOTA), demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.
We demonstrate the good generalization ability of our approach on the DLR 3K
dataset.

the $L^2$-critical and supercritical cases with an additive or multiplicative
perturbation driven by space-time white noise. Unlike the deterministic case,
the Hamiltonian (or energy) is not conserved in the stochastic setting, nor is
the mass (or the $L^2$-norm) conserved in the additive case. Therefore, we
investigate the time evolution of these quantities. After that we study the
influence of noise on the global behavior of solutions. In particular, we show
that the noise may induce blow-up, thus, ceasing the global existence of the
solution, which otherwise would be global in the deterministic setting.
Furthermore, we study the effect of the noise on the blow-up dynamics in both
multiplicative and additive noise settings and obtain profiles and rates of the
blow-up solutions. Our findings conclude that the blow-up parameters (rate and
profile) are insensitive to the type or strength of the noise: if blow-up
happens, it has the same dynamics as in the deterministic setting, however,
there is a (random) shift of the blow-up center, which can be described as a
random variable normally distributed.

the mirror symmetry of the metasurface is broken by horizontally shifting the
lattice of holes of the top layer of the two freestanding graphene layers in
opposite directions. In this configuration, light propagation along the
domain-wall interface of the bilayer graphene metasurface shows unidirectional

topological properties of this metasurface using the fact that the Fermi energy
of graphene varies upon chemical doping. This effect induces strong variation
of the transmission of the topological guided modes, which can be employed as
the underlying working principle of gas sensing devices. Our work opens up new
ways of developing robust integrated plasmonic devices for molecular sensing.

and $p$$+$$p$ collisions, for direct photon $p_T$ from 5--12 GeV/$c$, collected
by the PHENIX Collaboration in the years from 2006 to 2011. We observe no
significant modification of jet fragmentation in $d$$+$Au collisions,
indicating that cold nuclear matter effects are small or absent. Hadrons
carrying a large fraction of the quark's momentum are suppressed in Au$+$Au
compared to $p$$+$$p$ and $d$$+$Au. As the momentum fraction decreases, the
yield of hadrons in Au$+$Au increases to an excess over the yield in $p$$+$$p$
collisions. The excess is at large angles and at low hadron $p_T$ and is most
pronounced for hadrons associated with lower momentum direct photons.
Comparison to theoretical calculations suggests that the hadron excess arises
from medium response to energy deposited by jets.

alleviate the impact of irrelevant sentences in a bag by learning importance
weights for the sentences. Efforts thus far have focused on improving
extraction accuracy but little is known about their explainability. In this
work we annotate a test set with ground-truth sentence-level explanations to
evaluate the quality of explanations afforded by the relation extraction
models. We demonstrate that replacing the entity mentions in the sentences with
their fine-grained entity types not only enhances extraction accuracy but also
improves explanation. We also propose to automatically generate ""distractor""
sentences to augment the bags and train the model to ignore the distractors.
Evaluations on the widely used FB-NYT dataset show that our methods achieve new
state-of-the-art accuracy while improving model explainability.

photoproduction reactions with a 9-GeV linearly polarized photon beam. The
energy and arrival time of beam photons are tagged using a scintillator
hodoscope and a scintillating fiber array. The photon flux is determined using
a pair spectrometer, while the linear polarization of the photon beam is
determined using a polarimeter based on triplet photoproduction.
Charged-particle tracks from interactions in the central target are analyzed in
a solenoidal field using a central straw-tube drift chamber and six packages of
planar chambers with cathode strips and drift wires. Electromagnetic showers
are reconstructed in a cylindrical scintillating fiber calorimeter inside the
magnet and a lead-glass array downstream. Charged particle identification is
achieved by measuring energy loss in the wire chambers and using the flight
time of particles between the target and detectors outside the magnet. The
signals from all detectors are recorded with flash ADCs and/or pipeline TDCs
into memories allowing trigger decisions with a latency of 3.3 $\mu$s. The
detector operates routinely at trigger rates of 40 kHz and data rates of 600
megabytes per second. We describe the photon beam, the GlueX detector
components, electronics, data-acquisition and monitoring systems, and the
performance of the experiment during the first three years of operation.

$J/\psi\rightarrow e^{+}e^{-}$ decays in $p$+$p$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=510$
GeV at midrapidity. The angular distributions have been measured in three
different polarization frames, and the three decay angular coefficients have
been extracted in a full two-dimensional analysis. Previously, PHENIX saw large
longitudinal net polarization at forward rapidity at the same collision energy.
This analysis at midrapidity, complementary to the previous PHENIX results,
sees no sizable polarization in the measured transverse momentum range of
$0.0<p_T<10.0$ GeV/$c$. The results are consistent with a previous
one-dimensional analysis at midrapidity at $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. The
transverse-momentum-dependent cross section for midrapidity $J/\psi$ production
has additionally been measured, and after comparison to world data we find a
simple logarithmic dependence of the cross section on $\sqrt{s}$.

nb for like-sign muons in the rapidity and $p_T$ ranges $1.2<|y|<2.2$ and
$p_T>1$ GeV/$c$, and dimuon mass of 5--10 GeV/$c^2$. The extrapolated total
cross section at this energy for $b\bar{b}$ production is $13.1 \pm
0.6~(\mbox{stat}) \pm 1.5~(\mbox{syst}) \pm 2.7~(\mbox{global})~\mu$b. The
total cross section is compared to a perturbative quantum chromodynamics
calculation and is consistent within uncertainties. The azimuthal opening angle
between muon pairs from $b\bar{b}$ decays and their $p_T$ distributions are
compared to distributions generated using {\sc ps pythia 6}, which includes
next-to-leading order processes. The azimuthal correlations and pair $p_T$
distribution are not very well described by {\sc pythia} calculations, but are
still consistent within uncertainties. Flavor creation and flavor excitation
subprocesses are favored over gluon splitting.

across categories, providing a holistic overview of blockchain

fundus image for glaucoma detection, this paper proposes a two-stage framework
that first detects and localizes optic disc and then classifies it into healthy

localizing and extracting optic disc from a retinal fundus image while the
second stage uses Deep CNN to classify the extracted disc into healthy or
glaucomatous. In addition to the proposed solution, we also developed a
rule-based semi-automatic ground truth generation method that provides
necessary annotations for training RCNN based model for automated disc
localization. The proposed method is evaluated on seven publicly available
datasets for disc localization and on ORIGA dataset, which is the largest
publicly available dataset for glaucoma classification. The results of
automatic localization mark new state-of-the-art on six datasets with accuracy
reaching 100% on four of them. For glaucoma classification we achieved AUC
equal to 0.874 which is 2.7% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art
results previously obtained for classification on ORIGA. Once trained on
carefully annotated data, Deep Learning based methods for optic disc detection
and localization are not only robust, accurate and fully automated but also
eliminates the need for dataset-dependent heuristic algorithms. Our empirical
evaluation of glaucoma classification on ORIGA reveals that reporting only AUC,
for datasets with class imbalance and without pre-defined train and test
splits, does not portray true picture of the classifier's performance and calls
for additional performance metrics to substantiate the results.

of the cell membrane, namely lipid rafts, is an experimentally observed
phenomenon. Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the
role of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving
the active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding
has not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on
G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes
through chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between
the cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the
intracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance
Proteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based
on the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass
balance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and
kinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon
both the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and
of linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell
membrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering
of the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active
receptors -in agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the
latter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current
scientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often
serve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for
strong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in
better understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell

  Reaction-Diffusion Medium",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main challenges in diffusion-based molecular communication is
dealing with the non-linearity of reaction-diffusion chemical equations. While
numerical methods can be used to solve these equations, a change in the input
signals or the parameters of the medium requires one to redo the simulations.
This makes it difficult to design modulation schemes and practically impossible
to prove the optimality of a given transmission strategy. In this paper, we
provide an analytical technique for modeling the non-linearity of chemical
reaction equations based on the perturbation method. The perturbation method
expresses the solution in terms of an infinite power series. An approximate
solution can be found by keeping the leading terms of the power series. The
approximate solution is shown to track the true solution if either the
simulation time interval or the reaction rate is sufficiently small.
Approximate solutions for long time intervals are also discussed. An
illustrative example is given. For this example, it is shown that when the
reaction rate (or the total time interval) is low, instead of using a
continuous release waveform, it is optimal for the transmitters to release
molecules at two time instances.

monocular depth estimation has a wide variety of safety-critical applications

abiotic variables that shape species' ranges, habitat use, and co-occurrence

theories. Recently, species distribution models were developed for and applied
to data from ecological communities. Model development and selection for
ecological community data is difficult because a high level of complexity is
desired and achieved by including numerous parameters, which can degrade
predictive accuracy and be challenging to interpret and communicate. Like other
statistical models, multi-species distribution models can be overparameterized.
Regularization is a technique that optimizes predictive accuracy by shrinking
or eliminating model parameters. For Bayesian models, the prior distribution
automatically regularizes parameters. We propose a tree shrinkage prior for
Bayesian multi-species distributions models that performs regularization and
reduces the number of regression coefficients associated with predictor
variables. Using this prior, the number of regression coefficients in
multi-species distributions models is reduced by estimation of unique
regression coefficients for a smaller number of guilds rather than a larger
number of species. We demonstrated our tree shrinkage prior using examples of
presence-absence data for six species of aquatic vegetation and relative
abundance data for 15 species of fish. Our results show that the tree shrinkage

usually attributed to fast jets, while narrow (NLVC) and broad (BLVC)
low-velocity components are believed to trace slower disc winds. Under the
assumption that the line-broadening is dominated by Keplerian rotation, several
studies have found that the BLVCs should trace gas launched between 0.05 and
0.5 au and correlations between the properties of BLVCs and NLVCs have been
interpreted as evidence for the emission tracing an extended MHD wind and not a
photoevaporative wind. We calculated synthetic line profiles obtained from
detailed photoionisation calculations of an X-ray photoevaporation model and a
simple MHD wind model and analyzed the emission regions of different diagnostic
lines and the resulting spectral profiles. The photoevaporation model
reproduces most of the observed NLVCs but not the BLVCs or HVCs. The MHD model
is able to reproduce all components but produces Keplerian double peaks at
average inclinations that are rarely observed. The combination of MHD and
photoevaporative winds could solve this problem. Our results suggest that the
Gaussian decomposition does not allow for a clear distinction of flux from
different wind regions and that the line broadening is often dominated by the
velocity gradient in the outflow rather than by Keplerian rotation. We show
that observed correlations between BLVC and NLVC do not necessarily imply a
common origin in an extended MHD wind.

conversation around a movie, the task is to generate the next response based on
background knowledge about the movie such as the plot, review, Reddit comments
etc. This requires capturing structural, sequential and semantic information
from the conversation context and the background resources. This is a new task
and has not received much attention from the community. We propose a new
architecture that uses the ability of BERT to capture deep contextualized
representations in conjunction with explicit structure and sequence
information. More specifically, we use (i) Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
to capture structural information, (ii) LSTMs to capture sequential information
and (iii) BERT for the deep contextualized representations that capture
semantic information. We analyze the proposed architecture extensively. To this
end, we propose a plug-and-play Semantics-Sequences-Structures (SSS) framework
which allows us to effectively combine such linguistic information. Through a
series of experiments we make some interesting observations. First, we observe
that the popular adaptation of the GCN model for NLP tasks where structural
information (GCNs) was added on top of sequential information (LSTMs) performs
poorly on our task. This leads us to explore interesting ways of combining
semantic and structural information to improve the performance. Second, we
observe that while BERT already outperforms other deep contextualized
representations such as ELMo, it still benefits from the additional structural
information explicitly added using GCNs. This is a bit surprising given the

animals while correcting for undetected individuals. By design, data collection
is simplified by requiring only the distances from a transect to the detected
individuals be recorded. Compared to traditional design-based methods that
require restrictive assumption and limit the use of distance sampling data,
model-based approaches enable broader applications such as spatial prediction,
inferring species-habitat relationships, unbiased estimation from
preferentially sampled transects, and integration into multi-type data models.
Unfortunately, model-based approaches require the exact location of each
detected individual in order to incorporate environmental and habitat
characteristics as predictor variables. We modified model-based methods for
distance sampling data by including a probability distribution that accounts
for location uncertainty generated when only the distances are recorded. We
tested and demonstrated our method using a simulation experiment and by
modeling the habitat use of Dickcissels (Spiza americana) using distance
sampling data collected from the Konza Prairie in Kansas, USA. Our results
showed that ignoring location uncertainty can result in biased coefficient
estimates and predictions. However, accounting for location uncertainty
remedies the issue and results in reliable inference and prediction. Like other
types of measurement error, hierarchical models can accommodate the data
collection process thereby enabling reliable inference. Our approach is a
significant advancement for the analysis of distance sampling data because it
remedies the deleterious effects of location uncertainty and requires only
distances be recorded. In turn, this enables historical distance sampling data
sets to be compatible with modern data collection and modeling practices.

affect the ER effectiveness, or (b) too permissive, potentially harming ER
efficiency. In this paper, we propose a new methodology of progressive blocking
(pBlocking) to enable both efficient and effective ER, which works seamlessly
across different entity cluster size distributions. pBlocking is based on the
insight that the effectiveness-efficiency trade-off is revealed only when the
output of ER starts to be available. Hence, pBlocking leverages partial ER
output in a feedback loop to refine the blocking result in a data-driven
fashion. Specifically, we bootstrap pBlocking with traditional blocking methods
and progressively improve the building and scoring of blocks until we get the
desired trade-off, leveraging a limited amount of ER results as a guidance at
every round. We formally prove that pBlocking converges efficiently ($O(n log^2
n)$ time complexity, where n is the total number of records). Our experiments
show that incorporating partial ER output in a feedback loop can improve the
efficiency and effectiveness of blocking by 5x and 60% respectively, improving
the overall F-score of the entire ER process up to 60%.

more data hungry, it is better to compare their effectiveness with large amount

in the solar photosphere. Higher layers like the chromosphere and corona can be
modeled by extrapolating the photospheric magnetic field upward. In the solar
corona, plasma forces can be neglected and the Lorentz force vanishes. This is
not the case in the upper photosphere and chromosphere where magnetic and
non-magnetic forces are equally important. One way to deal with this problem is
to compute the plasma and magnetic field self-consistently with a
magnetohydrostatic (MHS) model.
  Aims. We aim to derive the magnetic field, plasma pressure and density of
AR11768 by applying the newly developed extrapolation technique to the
SUNRISE/IMaX data.
  Methods. An optimization method is used for the MHS modeling. The initial
conditions consist of a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and a
gravity-stratified atmosphere.
  Results. In the non-force-free layer, which is spatially resolved by the new
code, Lorentz forces are effectively balanced by the gas pressure gradient
force and the gravity force. The pressure and density are depleted in strong
field regions, which is consistent with observations. Denser plasma, however,
is also observed at some parts of the active region edges. In the chromosphere,
the fibril-like plasma structures trace the magnetic field nicely. Bright
points in SUNRISE/SuFI 3000 {$\AA$} images are often accompanied by the plasma
pressure and electric current concentrations. In addition, the average of angle
between MHS field lines and the selected chromospheric fibrils is $11.8^\circ$,
which is smaller than those computed from the NLFFF model ($15.7^\circ$) and
linear MHS model ($20.9^\circ$). This indicates that the MHS solution provides
a better representation of the magnetic field in the chromosphere.

is constructing a string $t$ of length $n$ from strings $s^1,\dots, s^m$ with
possible intersections. We provide a classical algorithm with running time
$O\left(n+L +m(\log n)^2\right)=\tilde{O}(n+L)$ where $L$ is the sum of lengths
of $s^1,\dots,s^m$. We provide a quantum algorithm with running time $O\left(n
+\log n\cdot(\log m+\log\log n)\cdot \sqrt{m\cdot L}\right)=\tilde{O}\left(n
+\sqrt{m\cdot L}\right)$. Additionally, we show that the lower bound for the
classical algorithm is $\Omega(n+L)$. Thus, our classical algorithm is optimal
up to a log factor, and our quantum algorithm shows speed-up comparing to any
classical algorithm in a case of non-constant length of strings in the
dictionary.

  Purpose: Motivated by the recent interaction cross section measurement which
indicates the 48Ca core swelling in the neutron-rich Ca isotopes, we explore
the mechanism of the enhancement of the neutron and proton radii for spherical
nuclei.
  Methods: Microscopic Hartree-Fock calculations with three sets of Skyrme-type
effective interactions are performed for the neutron-rich Ca, Ni and Sn
isotopes. The total reaction cross sections for the Ca isotopes are evaluated
with the Glauber model to compare them with the recent cross section data.
  Results: We obtain good agreement with the measured cross sections and charge
radii. The neutron and proton radii of the various ""core"" configurations are

  Conclusions: The core swelling phenomena occur depending on the properties of

assumptions, the main relationships among key factors are kept without the
uncertain impact of subordinate factors in this model. Three vital issues
related to optimal freeway control during an emergency evacuation are
addressed. How to properly realize some predetermined priorities assigned to
some on-ramps during an emergency evacuation is analyzed through sensitivity
analysis of objective function coefficients. The time-varying throughput
capacity of freeway mainline and the storage capacities of on-ramps are also
addressed by using sensitivity analysis of the right-hand side (RHS) of
corresponding constraints. The last key issue we focused on is how to deal with
the uncertain demand in a crude form by applying robust optimization. The
methodology presented in this paper can help evacuation managers realize a
coordinated ramp metering with predetermined priorities put on some on-ramps
during an emergency evacuation. The result obtained by analyzing the impact of
time-varying mainline capacity provides the evacuation manager a chance of
using the extra capacity in some segments of mainline to buffer the traffic so
as to reduce the congestion related to upstream on-ramps. To reduce the risk
due to the possible infeasibility of deterministic control approaches in an
uncertain situation, we apply an affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC)

the most essential concepts in modern network theory. Most prominent centrality
measures can be expressed as an aggregation of influence flows between pairs of

centrality measures are in use. Parametrized centralities allow further
flexibility and utility by tuning the centrality calculation to the regime most
appropriate for a given network. Here, we identify two categories of centrality
parameters. Reach parameters control the attenuation of influence flows between
distant nodes. Grasp parameters control the centrality's potential to send
influence flows along multiple, often nongeodesic paths. Combining these
categories with Borgatti's centrality types [S. P. Borgatti, Social Networks

conservative flows of influence. We therefore introduce the ground-current
centrality, which is a measure of precisely this type. Because of its unique
position in the taxonomy, the ground-current centrality has significant
advantages over similar centralities. We demonstrate that, compared to other

ordering across a wide range of network architectures. We also show that it
produces a consistent distribution of centrality values among the nodes,
neither trivially equally spread (delocalization), nor overly focused on a few
nodes (localization). Other reach centralities exhibit both of these behaviors

  Probability",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature selection is a widely used dimension reduction technique to select
feature subsets because of its interpretability. Many methods have been
proposed and achieved good results, in which the relationships between adjacent
data points are mainly concerned. But the possible associations between data
pairs that are may not adjacent are always neglected. Different from previous
methods, we propose a novel and very simple approach for unsupervised feature
selection, named MMFS (Multi-step Markov transition probability for Feature
Selection). The idea is using multi-step Markov transition probability to
describe the relation between any data pair. Two ways from the positive and
negative viewpoints are employed respectively to keep the data structure after
feature selection. From the positive viewpoint, the maximum transition
probability that can be reached in a certain number of steps is used to
describe the relation between two points. Then, the features which can keep the
compact data structure are selected. From the viewpoint of negative, the
minimum transition probability that can be reached in a certain number of steps
is used to describe the relation between two points. On the contrary, the
features that least maintain the loose data structure are selected. And the two
ways can also be combined. Thus three algorithms are proposed. Our main
contributions are a novel feature section approach which uses multi-step
transition probability to characterize the data structure, and three algorithms
proposed from the positive and negative aspects for keeping data structure. The
performance of our approach is compared with the state-of-the-art methods on
eight real-world data sets, and the experimental results show that the proposed
MMFS is effective in unsupervised feature selection.

ingenious concept that helps on organizing different areas of expertise aiming
at supporting engineering decisions related to a specific asset; it articulates
computational models, sensors, learning, real time analysis, diagnosis,
prognosis, and so on. In this framework, and to leverage its capacity, we
explore the integration of physics-based models with machine learning. A
digital twin is constructed for a damaged structure, where a discrete
physics-based computational model is employed to investigate several damage
scenarios. A machine learning classifier, that serves as the digital twin, is
trained with data taken from a stochastic computational model. This strategy
allows the use of an interpretable model (physics-based) to build a fast
digital twin (machine learning) that will be connected to the physical twin to
support real time engineering decisions. Different classifiers (quadratic
discriminant, support vector machines, etc) are tested, and different model
parameters (number of sensors, level of noise, damage intensity, uncertainty,
operational parameters, etc) are considered to construct datasets for the
training. The accuracy of the digital twin depends on the scenario analyzed.
Through the chosen application, we are able to emphasize each step of a digital
twin construction, including the possibility of integrating physics-based

conclusions that might be helpful for a large range of applications.

ratio of class numbers associated to $R$, up to some small computable factors.
This class of rings includes the maximal order of the CM field $K$ associated
to the isogeny class (for which the result was already known), as well as the
order $R$ generated over $\mathbf{Z}$ by Frobenius and Verschiebung.
  For this latter order, we can use results of Louboutin to estimate the
appropriate ratio of class numbers in terms of the size of the base field and
the Frobenius angles of the isogeny class. The error terms in our estimates are
quite large, but the trigonometric terms in the estimate are suggestive:
Combined with a result of Vladut on the distribution of Frobenius angles of

Katz and Sarnak on the limiting distribution of the multiset of Frobenius

pulsar J0737-3039A, pulse profiles from 34 millisecond pulsars from a single
2.5h observation of the Globular cluster Terzan 5, the rotation measure of
Ter5O, a 420-sigma giant pulse from the Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR
J0540-6919, and nulling identified in the slow pulsar PSR J0633-2015. One of
the key design specifications for MeerKAT was absolute timing errors of less
than 5 ns using their novel precise time system. Our timing of two bright
millisecond pulsars confirm that MeerKAT delivers exceptional timing. PSR
J2241-5236 exhibits a jitter limit of <4 ns per hour whilst timing of PSR
J1909-3744 over almost 11 months yields an rms residual of 66 ns with only 4

early successful deep learning based model DeepCS solved this issue by learning
the relationship between pairs of code methods and corresponding natural

understanding irrelevant/noisy keywords and capturing sequential relationships
between words in query and code. In this paper, we proposed an IR-based model
CodeMatcher that inherits the advantages of DeepCS, while it can leverage the
indexing technique in the IR-based model to accelerate the search response time
substantially. CodeMatcher first collects metadata for query words to identify
irrelevant/noisy ones, then iteratively performs fuzzy search with important
query words on the codebase that is indexed by the Elasticsearch tool, and
finally reranks a set of returned candidate code according to how the tokens in
the candidate code snippet sequentially matched the important words in a query.
We verified its effectiveness on a large-scale codebase with ~41k repositories.
Experimental results showed that CodeMatcher achieves an MRR of 0.60,

components in nanoscale devices. Many interesting properties of 2D materials
stem from the reduced and highly non-local electronic screening in two
dimensions. While electronic screening within 2D materials has been studied
extensively, the question still remains of how 2D substrates screen charge
perturbations or electronic excitations adjacent to them. Thickness-dependent
dielectric screening properties have recently been studied using electrostatic
force microscopy (EFM) experiments. However, it was suggested that some of the
thickness-dependent trends were due to extrinsic effects. Similarly, Kelvin
probe measurements (KPM) indicate that charge fluctuations are reduced when BN
slabs are placed on SiO$_2$, but it is unclear if this effect is due to
intrinsic screening from BN. In this work, we use first principles calculations
to study the fully non-local dielectric screening properties of 2D material
substrates. Our simulations give results in good qualitative agreement with
those from EFM experiments, for hexagonal boron nitride (BN), graphene and
MoS$_2$, indicating that the experimentally observed thickness-dependent
screening effects are intrinsic to the 2D materials. We further investigate
explicitly the role of BN in lowering charge potential fluctuations arising
from charge impurities on an underlying SiO$_2$ substrate, as observed in the
KPM experiments. 2D material substrates can also dramatically change the
HOMO-LUMO gaps of adsorbates, especially for small molecules, such as benzene.
We propose a reliable and very quick method to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap of
small physisorbed molecules on 2D and 3D substrates, using only the band gap of
the substrate and the gas phase gap of the molecule.

have limited shareability properties and can sometimes even be nonmonogamous.
In contrast to the two setting measurement scenario, three setting scenario
turns out to be more useful to develop deeper understanding of shareability of

(iii) the utilisation of an aperture diffraction grating with red filters of

  The use of the grating and filter (by measuring fringe spacing) proved
unsatisfactory for the broad-band filters, and the use of a narrow band
H{\alpha} filter with the grating, resulted in image scales that differed from
those obtained using {\alpha} Cen AB reference pair calibration and the video

quantum classification (VQC) is one of such methods with possible quantum
advantage in using quantum-enhanced features that are hard to compute by

numerical simulations, we present a range of encoding strategies and
demonstrate their limitations and capabilities. We experimentally show that

saving on the number of qubits for the mapping. We confirm the effectiveness of
the QRAC in VQC by experimenting on classification of real-world datasets with

broadcast channels. In our model, at any time instant, each receiver broadcasts
its CSI, and at any other node, this information either becomes available with
unit delay or gets erased. For this setting, we develop a new set of outer
bounds to capture the intermittent nature of the feedback links. These outer
bounds depend on the probability that the CSI from both receivers are erased at
the transmitter. In particular, if at any time, the CSI from at least one of
the two receivers is available at the other two nodes, then the outer-bounds
match the capacity with global delayed CSI. We also provide capacity-achieving
transmission strategies under certain scenarios, and we establish a connection

at variants of sequence reconstruction over a single and over multiple deletion
channels, a notoriously difficult problem due to its highly combinatorial
nature. Although works in theoretical computer science have provided algorithms
which guarantee perfect reconstruction with multiple independent observations
from the deletion channel, they are only applicable in the large blocklength
regime and more restrictively, when the number of observations is also large.
Indeed, with only a few observations, perfect reconstruction of the input
sequence may not even be possible in most cases. In such situations, maximum
likelihood (ML) and maximum aposteriori (MAP) estimates for the deletion
channels are natural questions that arise and these have remained open to the
best of our knowledge. In this work, we take steps to answer the two
aforementioned questions. Specifically: 1. We show that solving for the ML
estimate over the single deletion channel (which can be cast as a discrete
optimization problem) is equivalent to solving its relaxation, a continuous
optimization problem; 2. We exactly compute the symbolwise posterior
distributions (under some assumptions on the priors) for both the single as

useful way to minimize the risk of publication bias in meta-analysis, and
several clinical trial registries are available nowadays. However, they are

publication bias in meta-analyses, sensitivity analysis with the Copas

simple and efficient architecture for deep convolutional neural networks to
fuse a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution
multispectral image (HR-MSI), yielding a high-resolution hyperspectral image
(HR-HSI). The network is designed to preserve both spatial and spectral

HR-HSI at a different scale to get an output with a satisfied spectral
preservation; another one is to apply concepts of multi-resolution analysis to
extract high-frequency information, aiming to output high quality spatial
details. Finally, a plain mean squared error loss function is used to measure
the performance during the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed network architecture achieves best performance (both qualitatively and
quantitatively) compared with recent state-of-the-art hyperspectral image

Despite substantial advances over the past decade, the problem remains
difficult for systems with complex dynamics. Most state-of-the-art methods
perform search that relies on a large number of forward simulations. For
systems with complex dynamics, this generally require costly numerical
integrations which significantly slows down the planning process.
Linearization-based methods have been proposed that can alleviate the above
problem. However, it is not clear how linearization affects the quality of the
generated motion strategy, and when such simplifications are admissible. We
propose a non-linearity measure, called Statistical-distance-based
Non-linearity Measure (SNM), that can identify where linearization is
beneficial and where it should be avoided. We show that when the problem is
framed as the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, the value
difference between the optimal strategy for the original model and the
linearized model can be upper bounded by a function linear in SNM. Comparisons
with an existing measure on various scenarios indicate that SNM is more
suitable in estimating the effectiveness of linearization-based solvers. To
test the applicability of SNM in motion planning, we propose a simple on-line
planner that uses SNM as a heuristic to switch between a general and a
linearization-based solver. Results on a car-like robot with second order
dynamics and 4-DOFs and 7-DOFs torque-controlled manipulators indicate that SNM
can appropriately decide if and when a linearization-based solver should be
used.

to the patients who will presumably benefit most. Despite taking advantage of
recent advances in supervised machine learning, these algorithms remain, in a
sense, blunt instruments--often being developed and deployed without a full
accounting of the causal aspects of the prediction problems they are intended
to solve. Indeed, in many settings, including among patients at risk of
readmission, the riskiest patients may derive less benefit from a preventative
intervention compared to those at lower risk. Moreover, targeting an
intervention to a population, rather than limiting it to a small group of
high-risk patients, may lead to far greater overall utility if the patients
with the most modifiable (or preventable) outcomes across the population could
be identified. Based on these insights, we introduce a causal machine learning
framework that decouples this prediction problem into causal and predictive
parts, which clearly delineates the complementary roles of causal inference and
prediction in this problem. We estimate treatment effects using causal forests,
and characterize treatment effect heterogeneity across levels of predicted risk
using these estimates. Furthermore, we show how these effect estimates could be
used in concert with the modeled ""payoffs"" associated with successful
prevention of individual readmissions to maximize overall utility. Based on

computing models in recent years. It promises the user services at large scale
and low cost while eliminating the need for infrastructure management. On cloud
provider side, flexible resource management is required to meet fluctuating
demand. It can be enabled through automated provisioning and deprovisioning of
resources. A common approach among both commercial and open source serverless
computing platforms is workload-based auto-scaling, where a designated
algorithm scales instances according to the number of incoming requests. In the
recently evolving serverless framework Knative a request-based policy is
proposed, where the algorithm scales resources by a configured maximum number
of requests that can be processed in parallel per instance, the so-called
concurrency. As we show in a baseline experiment, this predefined concurrency
level can strongly influence the performance of a serverless application.
However, identifying the concurrency configuration that yields the highest
possible quality of service is a challenging task due to various factors, e.g.
varying workload and complex infrastructure characteristics, influencing
throughput and latency. While there has been considerable research into
intelligent techniques for optimizing auto-scaling for virtual machine
provisioning, this topic has not yet been discussed in the area of serverless
computing. For this reason, we investigate the applicability of a reinforcement
learning approach, which has been proven on dynamic virtual machine
provisioning, to request-based auto-scaling in a serverless framework. Our
results show that within a limited number of iterations our proposed model
learns an effective scaling policy per workload, improving the performance

hardware impairment (HWI). For analysing the achievable rate (ACR) and
optimizing the phase shifts in the IRS-aided wireless communication system with
HWI, we consider that the HWI appears at both the IRS and the signal
transceivers. On this foundation, first, we derive the closed-form expression
of the average ACR and the IRS utility. Then, we formulate optimization
problems to optimize the IRS phase shifts by maximizing the signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) at the receiver side, and obtain the solution by transforming
non-convex problems into semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. Subsequently,
we compare the IRS with the conventional decode-and-forward (DF) relay in terms
of the ACR and the utility. Finally, we carry out simulations to verify the
theoretical analysis, and evaluate the impact of the channel estimation errors
and residual phase noises on the optimization performance. Our results reveal
that the HWI reduces the ACR and the IRS utility, and begets more serious
performance degradation with more reflecting elements. Although the HWI has an
impact on the IRS, it still leaves opportunities for the IRS to surpass the
conventional DF relay, when the number of reflecting elements is large enough

construct the discriminative model for recognizing the new categories with the

identify the new categories. However, the relationship of samples between the
separated tasks is difficultly considered because of the different metric
criterion in the respective tasks. In contrast, the proposed high-order
structure preserving graph neural network(HOSP-GNN) can further explore the
rich structure of the samples to predict the label of the queried data on graph
that enables the structure evolution to explicitly discriminate the categories
by iteratively updating the high-order structure relationship (the relative
metric in multi-samples,instead of pairwise sample metric) with the manifold
structure constraints. HOSP-GNN can not only mine the high-order structure for
complementing the relevance between samples that may be divided into the
different task in meta-learning, and but also generate the rule of the
structure updating by manifold constraint. Furthermore, HOSP-GNN doesn't need
retrain the learning model for recognizing the new classes, and HOSP-GNN has
the well-generalizable high-order structure for model adaptability. Experiments
show that HOSP-GNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on supervised and

which has proven to be efficient in many domains, e.g., board games, video
games or autonomous vehicles. In such problems, an agent faces a sequential
decision-making problem where, at every time step, it observes its state,
performs an action, receives a reward and moves to a new state. An RL agent
learns by trial and error a good policy (or controller) based on observations
and numeric reward feedback on the previously performed action. In this
chapter, we present the basic framework of RL and recall the two main families
of approaches that have been developed to learn a good policy. The first one,
which is value-based, consists in estimating the value of an optimal policy,
value from which a policy can be recovered, while the other, called policy
search, directly works in a policy space. Actor-critic methods can be seen as a
policy search technique where the policy value that is learned guides the
policy improvement. Besides, we give an overview of some extensions of the
standard RL framework, notably when risk-averse behavior needs to be taken into

generalized linear model setting. In the agnostic PAC learning setting, where
no assumption on the relationship between the labels $y$ and the input $x$ is

using assay measurements collected from densely spaced, geo-registered blast

by an apriori spatial structure which embeds geological domain knowledge and
determines the likelihood of a displacement estimate. The results demonstrate

shedding. Our analysis shows that the wake drag appropriately captures a
gradual shift in the timing of vortex shedding in its phase variation as a
function of $U^*$ while the magnitude of the wake drag displays a resonant
amplification within the excitation region. We use the theory to illustrate why
peak amplitudes, which occur when the vibration frequency is equal to the
structural frequency in still fluid, do not depend on $m^*$, in agreement with
our simulations as well as previous experiments at Reynolds numbers higher than
considered here. This new theory provides physical insight which could not be
attained heretofore by employing semi-empirical approaches in the literature.

features have been widely studied. However, only a few methods pay attention to
non-full-band spectral features. In this paper, we explore a knowledge
distillation framework based on sub-band spectral mapping for single-channel
speech enhancement. Specifically, we divide the full frequency band into
multiple sub-bands and pre-train an elite-level sub-band enhancement model
(teacher model) for each sub-band. These teacher models are dedicated to
processing their own sub-bands. Next, under the teacher models' guidance, we
train a general sub-band enhancement model (student model) that works for all
sub-bands. Without increasing the number of model parameters and computational
complexity, the student model's performance is further improved. To evaluate
our proposed method, we conducted a large number of experiments on an
open-source data set. The final experimental results show that the guidance
from the elite-level teacher models dramatically improves the student model's
performance, which exceeds the full-band model by employing fewer parameters.

adjusting the weights of existing links via suitable optimization protocols. We
here propose a radically new approach which anchors the learning process to
reciprocal space. Specifically, the training acts on the spectral domain and
seeks to modify the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of transfer operators in
direct space. The proposed method is ductile and can be tailored to return
either linear or non-linear classifiers. Adjusting the eigenvalues, when
freezing the eigenvectors entries, yields performances which are superior to
those attained with standard methods {\it restricted} to a operate with an
identical number of free parameters. Tuning the eigenvalues correspond in fact
to performing a global training of the neural network, a procedure which
promotes (resp. inhibits) collective modes on which an effective information
processing relies. This is at variance with the usual approach to learning
which implements instead a local modulation of the weights associated to
pairwise links. Interestingly, spectral learning limited to the eigenvalues
returns a distribution of the predicted weights which is close to that obtained
when training the neural network in direct space, with no restrictions on the
parameters to be tuned. Based on the above, it is surmised that spectral
learning bound to the eigenvalues could be also employed for pre-training of
deep neural networks, in conjunction with conventional machine-learning
schemes. Changing the eigenvectors to a different non-orthogonal basis alters
the topology of the network in direct space and thus allows to export the
spectral learning strategy to other frameworks, as e.g. reservoir computing.

distribution grid to disturbed days of high geomagnetic activity. Such
disturbed days are described either by the cumulative storm-time $Dst$ or
$d(\textit{SYM-H})/dt$ low-latitude indices mainly influenced by ring current
variations, by the cumulative $AE$ high-latitude index measuring
substorm-related auroral current variations, or by the cumulative $ap$
mid-latitude index measuring both ring and auroral current variations. We use
superposed epoch analysis to identify possible increases of anomaly rates
during and after such disturbed days. We show that in the case of abundant
series of anomalies on power lines, the anomaly rate increases significantly
immediately (within 1 day) after the onset of geomagnetic storms. In the case
of transformers, the increase of the anomaly rate is generally delayed by 2--3
days. We also find that transformers and some electric substations seem to be
sensitive to a prolonged exposure to substorms, with a delayed increase of
anomalies. Overall, we show that in the 5-day period following the commencement
of geomagnetic activity there is an approximately 5--10\% increase in the
recorded anomalies in the Czech power grid and thus this fraction of anomalies
is probably related to an exposure to GICs.

State-of-the-art methods perform IA isolation by encoding neurosurgeon's
intuition about former non-dilated vessel anatomy through principled approaches
like fitting a cutting plane to vasculature surface, using Gaussian curvature
and vessel centerline distance constraints, by deformable contours or graph
cuts guided by the curvature or restricted by Voronoi surface decomposition and
similar. However, the large variability of IAs and their parent vasculature
configurations often leads to failure or non-intuitive isolation. Manual
corrections are thus required, but suffer from poor reproducibility. In this
paper, we aim to increase the accuracy, robustness and reproducibility of IA
isolation through two stage deep learning based segmentation of vascular
surface. The surface was represented by local patches in form of point clouds,
which were fed into first stage multilayer neural network (MNN) to obtain

validation was based on 57 DSA, 28 CTA and 5 MRA images, where cross-validation

0.830 obtained for the state-of-the-art method on the same datasets. Visual

while in the pond sediments and the permafrost itself Acidobacteria,
Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Patescibacteria, Proteobacteria, and

acidophilic iron-oxidizers and iron-reducing species. In spite of the extreme

focus on a structural reduction of the number of kernels, i.e. we define rules
to decide which terms need to be implemented and which can be neglected before
the kernels are calculated. This static complexity reduction is to be
distinguished from other approaches like pruning or L1 regularization, that are
applied after the adaptation of the full Volterra equalizer e.g. by
thresholding. We investigate the impact of the complexity reduction on 90 GBd
PAM6 IM/DD experimental data acquired in a back-to-back setup as well as in
case of transmission over 1 km SSMF. First, we show, that the third-order VNLE
terms have a significant impact on the overall performance of the system and
that a high number of coefficients is necessary for optimal performance.
Afterwards, we show that restrictions, for example on the tap spacing among
samples participating in the same kernel, can lead to an improved tradeoff
between performance and complexity compared to a full third-order VNLE. We show
an example, in which the number of third-order kernels is halved without any
appreciable performance degradation.

channel vectors through pilot transmission and attempts to perform joint
multi-user Downlink (DL) precoding. It is widely accepted that an efficient
implementation of this task hinges upon an appropriate design of a set of
common ""virtual beams"", that captures the common eigenstructure among the user
channel covariances. In this paper, we propose a novel method for obtaining
this common eigenstructure by casting it as an ML estimation problem. We prove
that in the special case where the covariances are jointly diagonalizable, the
global optimal solution of the proposed ML problem coincides with the common
eigenstructure. Then we propose a projected gradient descent (PGD) method to
solve the ML optimization problem over the manifold of unitary matrices and
prove its convergence to a stationary point. Through exhaustive simulations, we
illustrate that in the case of jointly diagonalizable covariances, our proposed
method converges to the exact CES. Also, in the general case where the
covariances are not jointly diagonalizable, it yields a solution that
approximately diagonalizes all covariances. Besides, the empirical results show
that our proposed method outperforms the well-known joint approximate
diagonalization of eigenmatrices (JADE) method in the literature.

likelihood to be split into likelihoods of two-state models having fewer

tools. {Nevertheless, in certain cases the sojourn time based approach is

described by the mean field order parameter, whose values is the solution of a
self-consistent equation, and affects the space-time evolution of the system
through the force term in the Vlasov equation. The Vlasov equation and the gap
equation are solved concurrently and continuously for a longitudinal
boost-invariant and transversely rotation-invariant system. This numerical
framework enables us to carefully investigate how the phase transition and
collision affect the evolution of the system. It is observed that the chiral
phase transition gives rise to a kink in the flow velocity, which is caused by
the force term in the Vlasov equation. The kink is enhanced by larger
susceptibility and tends to be smoothed out by non-equilibrium effect. The

invariant classifier based on deep neural network (DNN) was trained. Test stage

many areas like scientific computing and machine learning. However, existing
works under-look the performance optimization of SpDM on modern many-core
architectures like GPUs. The storage data structures help sparse matrices store
in a memory-saving format, but they bring difficulties in optimizing the
performance of SpDM on modern GPUs due to irregular data access of the sparse
structure, which results in lower resource utilization and poorer performance.
In this paper, we refer to the roofline performance model of GPUs to design an
efficient SpDM algorithm called GCOOSpDM, in which we exploit coalescent global
memory access, fast shared memory reuse and more operations per byte of global
memory traffic. Experiments are evaluated on three Nvidia GPUs (i.e., GTX 980,
GTX Titan X Pascal and Tesla P100) with CUDA-8.0 using a large number of
matrices including a public dataset and randomly generated matrices.
Experimental results show that GCOOSpDM achieves 1.5-8$\times$ speedup over
Nvidia's library cuSPARSE in many matrices. We also analyze instruction-level
operations on a particular GPU to understand the performance gap between
GCOOSpDM and cuSPARSE. The profiled instructions confirm that cuSPARSE spends a
lot of time on slow memory access (including DRAM access and L2 cache access),
while GCOOSpDM transfers such slow memory access to faster shared memory, which
mainly contributes to the performance gain. Results also show that GCOOSpDM
would outperform the dense algorithm (cuBLAS) with lower sparsity than cuSPARSE
on GPUs.

decay pions and the squared $4$-momentum transfer $t$ at the proton vertex. The
measurements are presented in various bins of the photon-proton collision
energy $W_{\gamma p}$. The phase space restrictions are $0.5 < m_{\pi\pi} <
2.2$ GeV, ${\vert t\vert < 1.5}$ GeV${}^2$, and ${20 < W_{\gamma p} < 80}$ GeV.
Cross section measurements are presented for both elastic and
proton-dissociative scattering. The observed cross section dependencies are
described by analytic functions. Parametrising the $m_{\pi\pi}$ dependence with
resonant and non-resonant contributions added at the amplitude level leads to a
measurement of the $\rho^{0}(770)$ meson mass and width at $m_\rho = 770.8\
{}^{+2.6}_{-2.7}$ (tot) MeV and $\Gamma_\rho = 151.3\ {}^{+2.7}_{-3.6}$ (tot)
MeV, respectively. The model is used to extract the $\rho^0(770)$ contribution
to the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ cross sections and measure it as a function of $t$ and
$W_{\gamma p}$. In a Regge asymptotic limit in which one Regge trajectory
$\alpha(t)$ dominates, the intercept $\alpha(t{=}0) = 1.0654\
{}^{+0.0098}_{-0.0067}$ (tot) and the slope $\alpha^\prime(t{=}0) = 0.233\
{}^{+0.067 }_{-0.074 }$ (tot) GeV${}^{-2}$ of the $t$ dependence are extracted
for the case $m_Y{=}m_p$.

  Subtyping","20 pages, 8 figures",,,,"q-bio.QM cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many diseases display heterogeneity in clinical features and their
progression, indicative of the existence of disease subtypes. Extracting
patterns of disease variable progression for subtypes has tremendous
application in medicine, for example, in early prognosis and personalized
medical therapy. This work present a novel, data-driven, network-based
Trajectory Clustering (TC) algorithm for identifying Parkinson's subtypes based
on disease trajectory. Modeling patient-variable interactions as a bipartite
network, TC first extracts communities of co-expressing disease variables at
different stages of progression. Then, it identifies Parkinson's subtypes by
clustering similar patient trajectories that are characterized by severity of
disease variables through a multi-layer network. Determination of trajectory
similarity accounts for direct overlaps between trajectories as well as
second-order similarities, i.e., common overlap with a third set of
trajectories. This work clusters trajectories across two types of layers: (a)
temporal, and (b) ranges of independent outcome variable (representative of
disease severity), both of which yield four distinct subtypes. The former
subtypes exhibit differences in progression of disease domains (Cognitive,
Mental Health etc.), whereas the latter subtypes exhibit different degrees of
progression, i.e., some remain mild, whereas others show significant
deterioration after 5 years. The TC approach is validated through statistical
analyses and consistency of the identified subtypes with medical literature.
This generalizable and robust method can easily be extended to other
progressive multi-variate disease datasets, and can effectively assist in
targeted subtype-specific treatment in the field of personalized medicine.

in flaring loops assume an isolated 1D atmosphere. A more realistic environment
for modelling accelerated particles can be provided by 3D radiative
magnetohydrodynamics codes. Here, we present a simple model for particle
acceleration and propagation in the context of a 3D simulation of the quiet
solar atmosphere, spanning from the convection zone to the corona. We then
examine the additional transport of energy introduced by the particle beams.
The locations of particle acceleration associated with magnetic reconnection
were identified by detecting changes in magnetic topology. At each location,
the parameters of the accelerated particle distribution were estimated from
local conditions. The particle distributions were then propagated along the
magnetic field, and the energy deposition due to Coulomb collisions with the
ambient plasma was computed. We find that particle beams originate in extended
acceleration regions that are distributed across the corona. Upon reaching the
transition region, they converge and produce strands of intense heating that
penetrate the chromosphere. Within these strands, beam heating consistently
dominates conductive heating below the bottom of the transition region. This
indicates that particle beams qualitatively alter the energy transport even
outside of active regions.

regarding embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or other manifolds, and tight upper
bounds on their number for a given number of vertices. Our premise is to relate
the number of embeddings to that of solutions of a well-constrained algebraic
system and exploit progress in the latter domain. In particular, the system's
complex solutions naturally extend the notion of real embeddings, thus allowing
us to employ bounds on complex roots.
  We focus on multihomogeneous B{\'e}zout (m-B{\'e}zout) bounds of algebraic
systems since they are fast to compute and rather tight for systems exhibiting
structure as in our case. We introduce two methods to relate such bounds to
combinatorial properties of minimally rigid graphs in $\mathbb{C}^d$ and $S^d$.
The first relates the number of graph orientations to the m-B\'ezout bound,
while the second leverages a matrix permanent formulation. Using these
approaches we improve the best known asymptotic upper bounds for planar graphs
in dimension~3, and all minimally rigid graphs in dimension $d\geq 5$, both in
the Euclidean and spherical case.
  Our computations indicate that m-B\'ezout bounds are tight for embeddings of
planar graphs in $S^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^3$. We exploit Bernstein's second
theorem on the exactness of mixed volume, and relate it to the m-B{\'e}zout
bound by analyzing the associated Newton polytopes. We reduce the number of
checks required to verify exactness by an exponential factor, and conjecture
further that it suffices to check a linear instead of an exponential number of
cases overall.

emitting in the 244-335 nm range at room temperature, with a relative linewidth
in the 6-11% range, mainly due to the QD diameter dispersion inherent in
self-assembled growth. Under electron pumping, the emission efficiency remains
constant for acceleration voltages below 9 kV. The correlation of this
threshold with the total thickness of the superlattice and the penetration
depth of the electron beam confirms the homogeneity of the nanostructures along
the growth axis. Below the threshold, the emission intensity scales linearly
with the injected current. The internal quantum efficiency is characterized at
low injection, which reveals the material properties in terms of non-radiative
processes, and high injection, which emulates carrier injection in operation
conditions. In quantum dots synthesized with III/V ratio < 0.75, the internal

dynamically decide on ending a source chunk, and another that translates the
consumed chunk. We train the components jointly and in a manner consistent with

this study, the visualization of each row of Pascal's triangle has been
presented by extending the concept of the power of 11 to the power of 101,

$\left(1\Theta1\right)^{n}$, where $\Theta$ represents the number of zeros. We
have proposed a formula for obtaining the value of $\Theta$. The proposed
concept has been verified with Pascal's triangle and matched successfully.
Finally, Pascal's triangle for a large n has been presented considering the

in many applications such as multi-criteria decision making, web search, and

proposed for representative tuple discovery. Specifically, for a large database
$P$ of tuples with multiple numerical attributes, the $k$-RMS problem returns a
size-$r$ subset $Q$ of $P$ such that, for any possible ranking function, the
score of the top-ranked tuple in $Q$ is not much worse than the score of the
$k$\textsuperscript{th}-ranked tuple in $P$. Although the $k$-RMS problem has
been extensively studied in the literature, existing methods are designed for
the static setting and cannot maintain the result efficiently when the database
is updated. To address this issue, we propose the first fully-dynamic algorithm
for the $k$-RMS problem that can efficiently provide the up-to-date result
w.r.t.~any insertion and deletion in the database with a provable guarantee.
Experimental results on several real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate
that our algorithm runs up to four orders of magnitude faster than existing

We generally formulate a spin conductance at an interface between a normal

that SMR is composed of static and dynamic parts. The static part, which is
almost independent of the temperature, originates from spin flip caused by an
interfacial exchange coupling. However, the dynamic part, which is induced by
the creation or annihilation of magnons, has an opposite sign from the static
part. By the spin-wave approximation, we predict that the latter results in a
nontrivial sign change of the SMR signal at a finite temperature. In addition,
we derive the Onsager relation between spin conductance and thermal
spin-current noise.

the resolution of the dark matter calculation independently of that of the gas,
the simulation resolves dark matter haloes and subhaloes of mass 5x10^6 Msun .
It is therefore useful for studying the abundance and properties of the haloes
and subhaloes targeted in strong lensing tests of the cold dark matter model.
We estimate the halo and subhalo mass functions and discuss how they are
affected both by the inclusion of baryons in the simulation and by the
environment. We find that the halo and subhalo mass functions have lower
amplitude in the hydrodynamical simulation than in its dark matter only
counterpart. This reflects the reduced growth of haloes in the hydrodynamical
simulation due to the early loss of gas by reionisation and galactic winds and,
additionally, in the case of subhaloes, disruption by enhanced tidal effects
within the host halo due to the presence of a massive central galaxy. The
distribution of haloes is highly anisotropic reflecting the filamentary
character of mass accretion onto the cluster. As a result, there is significant
variation in the number of structures with viewing direction. The median number
of structures near the centre of the halo, when viewed in projection, is
reduced by a factor of two when baryons are included.

essentially ask the question: how hard the evolution towards the desired herd
immunity could be on the life of the vulnerables? We employ mathematical
modelling (chemical network theory) and cellular automata based computer
simulations to study the human cost of an epidemic spread and an effective
strategy to introduce HI. Implementation of different strategies to counter the
spread of the disease requires a certain degree of quantitative understanding
of the time dependence of the outcome. In this paper, our main objective is to
gather understanding of the dependence of outcome on the rate of progress of
HI. We generalize the celebrated SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) by
compartmentalizing the susceptible population into two categories- (i)
vulnerables and (ii) resilients, and study dynamical evolution of the disease
progression. We achieve such a classification by employing different rates of
recovery of vulnerables vis-a-vis resilients. We obtain the relative fatality
of these two sub-categories as a function of the percentages of the vulnerable
and resilient population, and the complex dependence on the rate of attainment
of herd immunity. Our results quantify the adverse effects on the recovery
rates of vulnerables in the course of attaining the herd immunity. We find the
important result that a slower attainment of the HI is relatively less fatal.
However, a slower progress towards HI could be complicated by many intervening
factors.

censorship). Our approach uses the effective theory of black holes at
$D\to\infty$, but we expect our main conclusions to hold at finite $D$. Black
hole fusion is highly irreversible, while fission, which follows the pattern of
the decay of black strings, generates comparatively less entropy. In $2\to 1\to
2$ black hole collisions an intermediate, quasi-thermalized state forms that
then fissions. This intermediate state erases much of the memory of the initial
states and acts as an attractor funneling the evolution of the collision
towards a small subset of outgoing parameters, which is narrower the closer the
total angular momentum is to the critical value for fission. Entropy
maximization provides a very good guide for predicting the final outgoing
states. Along our study, we clarify how entropy production and irreversibility
appear in the large $D$ effective theory. We also extend the study of the
stability of new black hole phases (black bars and dumbbells). Finally, we

Fermi arcs located on different hinges, and they are separated by a critical
Dirac semimetal state with surface helical Fermi arcs. In addition, we show
that rich symmetry/topology can be explored in our model by simply varying the

  Synchronization Based on Triple Graph Grammars","33 pages, 20 figures, 3 tables",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Model synchronization, i.e., the task of restoring consistency between two
interrelated models after a model change, is a challenging task. Triple Graph
Grammars (TGGs) specify model consistency by means of rules that describe how
to create consistent pairs of models. These rules can be used to automatically
derive further rules, which describe how to propagate changes from one model to
the other or how to change one model in such a way that propagation is
guaranteed to be possible. Restricting model synchronization to these derived
rules, however, may lead to unnecessary deletion and recreation of model
elements during change propagation. This is inefficient and may cause
unnecessary information loss, i.e., when deleted elements contain information
that is not represented in the second model, this information cannot be
recovered easily. Short-cut rules have recently been developed to avoid
unnecessary information loss by reusing existing model elements. In this paper,
we show how to automatically derive (short-cut) repair rules from short-cut
rules to propagate changes such that information loss is avoided and model
synchronization is accelerated. The key ingredients of our rule-based model
synchronization process are these repair rules and an incremental pattern
matcher informing about suitable applications of them. We prove the termination
and the correctness of this synchronization process and discuss its
completeness. As a proof of concept, we have implemented this synchronization
process in eMoflon, a state-of-the-art model transformation tool with inherent
support of bidirectionality. Our evaluation shows that repair processes based
on (short-cut) repair rules have considerably decreased information loss and
improved performance compared to former model synchronization processes based
on TGGs.

expensive because it often requires expert knowledge, particularly in medical
imaging domain where labels are the result of a time-consuming analysis made by
one or more human experts. As nuclei, cells and glands are fundamental objects
for downstream analysis in computational pathology/cytology, in this paper we
propose a simple CNN-based approach to speed up collecting annotations for
these objects which requires minimum interaction from the annotator. We show
that for nuclei and cells in histology and cytology images, one click inside
each object is enough for NuClick to yield a precise annotation. For
multicellular structures such as glands, we propose a novel approach to provide
the NuClick with a squiggle as a guiding signal, enabling it to segment the
glandular boundaries. These supervisory signals are fed to the network as
auxiliary inputs along with RGB channels. With detailed experiments, we show
that NuClick is adaptable to the object scale, robust against variations in the
user input, adaptable to new domains, and delivers reliable annotations. An
instance segmentation model trained on masks generated by NuClick achieved the

traditional ray-tracing-based localization. However, the environment's

rely on the extreme sensitivity of the chaotic wave field to geometrical
details, it is not clear how viable WFP techniques may be in a realistic
dynamically evolving environment. Here, we reveal that environmental
perturbations reduce both the diversity of the WFP dictionary and the effective
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), such that the amount of information that can be
obtained per measurement is reduced. This unfavorable effect can, however, be
fully compensated by taking more measurements. We show in simulations and
experiments with a low-cost software-defined radio that WFP localization of
non-cooperative objects is possible even when the scattering strength of the
environmental perturbation significantly exceeds that of the object to be
localized. Our results underline that diversity is only one important
ingredient to achieve high sensing accuracy in compressed sensing, the other
two being SNR and the choice of decoding method. We find that sacrificing
diversity for SNR may be worthwhile and observe that artificial neural networks
outperform traditional decoding methods in terms of the achieved sensing

dielectron rate from hadron decays, called hadronic cocktail, utilizes a
parametrization of the measured $\eta/\pi^0$ ratio in pp and proton-nucleus

collision energy at low transverse momentum. Comparison of the measured
dielectron yield to the hadronic cocktail at $0.15<m_{\rm ee}<0.6$ GeV/$c^2$

modern technologies such as solvent-exchange micro-reactors, nanotechnology or
the manufacturing of foamy materials. However, under Earth's gravity
conditions, these dynamics can only be observed for a very limited time if the
cloud is not attached to a surface, due to the action of buoyancy, i.e. of
gravity effects. Here, we present experimental observations of the time
evolution of dense bubble clouds growing in CO$_2$-supersaturated water in
microgravity conditions. We report the existence of three regimes where the
bubble cloud exhibits different growth rates. At short times, each bubble grows
independently following the Epstein--Plesset equation. Later on, bubbles start
to interact with each other and their growth rate diminishes as they compete
for the available CO$_2$. When this happens, the growth rate slows down. This
occurs earlier the deeper the bubble is in the cloud. Finally, at long times,
only those bubbles on the husk continue growing. These regimes may be
qualitatively described by a mathematical model where each individual bubble
grows in the presence of a constellation of point mass sinks. Despite the model
being only valid for dilute bubble clouds, its predictions are consistent with
the experimental observations, even though the bubble clouds we observe are
rather dense.

capturing individuals and releasing them with delay. We obtain a simple rule
defining the reproduction number $\mathcal{R}$ in terms of quarantine
parameters, ratio of diagnosed cases and transmission parameters. The model is
applied to the epidemic in Poland in March - April 2020, when social distancing
measures were in place. We investigate 3 scenarios corresponding to different
ratios of diagnosed cases. Our results show that depending on the scenario
contact tracing could have prevented from 50\% to over 90\% of cases. The
effects of quarantine are limited by fraction of undiagnosed cases. Taking into
account the transmission intensity in Poland prior to introduction of social
restrictions it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved
without any social distancing measures.

  It was found that the effect of annealing on timing resolution and collected
charge is not very large and mainly occurs within the first few tens of
minutes. It is a consequence of active initial acceptor concentration decrease
in the
  gain layer with time, where changes of around 10\% were observed. For any
relevant annealing times for detector operation the changes of effective doping
concentration in the bulk negligibly influences the performance of the device,
due to their small thickness and required high bias voltage operation. At very
long annealing times the increase of the effective doping concentration in the
bulk leads to a significant increase of the electric field in the gain layer
and, by that, to the increase of gain at given voltage. The leakage current
decreases in accordance with generation current annealing.

(ESR) study on single crystals of the van der Waals magnet CrCl$_3$. This
material, although being known for quite a while, has received recent
significant attention in a context of the use of van der Waals magnets in novel
spintronic devices. Temperature-dependent measurements of the resonance fields
were performed between 4 and 175 K and with the external magnetic field applied
parallel and perpendicular to the honeycomb planes of the crystal structure.
These investigations reveal that the resonance line shifts from the
paramagnetic resonance position already at temperatures well above the
transition into a magnetically ordered state. Thereby the existence of
ferromagnetic short-range correlations above the transition is established and
the intrinsically two-dimensional nature of the magnetism in the title compound
is proven. To study details of the magnetic anisotropies in the field-induced
effectively ferromagnetic state at low temperatures, frequency-dependent
ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements were conducted at 4 K. The observed
anisotropy between the two magnetic-field orientations is analyzed by means of
numerical simulations based on a phenomenological theory of FMR. These
simulations are in excellent agreement with measured data if the shape
anisotropy of the studied crystal is taken into account, while the
magnetocrystalline anisotropy is found to be negligible in CrCl$_3$. The
absence of a significant intrinsic anisotropy thus renders this material as a
practically ideal isotropic Heisenberg magnet.

in the multi MeV energy range at moderate relativistic laser intensities and
their applications. In our experiment, an intense sub-picosecond laser pulse
propagates through a plasma of a near critical electron density (NCD) and
direct laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons takes place. The breakthrough
toward high current relativistic electron beams became possible due to
application of low density polymer foams of sub-mm thickness. In foams, the
NCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of super-sonic ionization. Compared to
NCD-plasmas generated by laser irradiation of conventional foils, the DLA
acceleration path in foams was strongly enhanced. Measurements resulted into
11{\div}13 MeV of the effective electron temperature and up to 100 MeV maximum
of the electron energy measured in the laser pulse propagation direction. The
growth of the electron energy was accompanied by a strong increase of the
number of super-ponderomotive electrons and a well-defined directionality of
the electron beam that propagates in a divergence cone with a half angle of
12{\deg}. For the energy range above 7.5 MeV that is relevant for gamma-driven
nuclear reactions, we estimate a charge carried by these well-directed electron
beams as high as 50 nC and a corresponding efficiency of the laser energy
conversion into electrons of 6%. The electron spectra generated by the
DLA-mechanism in NCD-plasma at 1019 Wcm-2 laser intensity were compared with
those measured in shots onto conventional metallic foils at ultra-relativistic
laser intensities of 1021 Wcm-2 . In the last case, the twice lower effective
electron temperature and the twice lower maximum of the electron energy were
registered. The substantial difference in the electron spectra for these two
cases presented itself in the isotope production yield.

various communication types and energy constraints) which are assumed to belong
to an IoT service provider (ISP). To power backscattering-based and
wireless-powered devices, the ISP has to contract with an energy service
provider (ESP). This article studies the strategic interactions between the ISP
and its ESP and their implications on the joint optimal time scheduling and
energy trading for heterogeneous devices. To that end, we propose an economic
framework using the Stackelberg game to maximize the network throughput and
energy efficiency of both the ISP and ESP. Specifically, the ISP leads the game
by sending its optimal service time and energy price request (that maximizes
its profit) to the ESP. The ESP then optimizes and supplies the transmission
power which satisfies the ISP's request (while maximizing ESP's utility). To
obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply a backward induction
technique which first derives a closed-form solution for the ESP. Then, to
tackle the non-convex optimization problem for the ISP, we leverage the block
coordinate descent and convex-concave procedure techniques to design two
partitioning schemes (i.e., partial adjustment (PA) and joint adjustment (JA))
to find the optimal energy price and service time that constitute local SEs.
Numerical results reveal that by jointly optimizing the energy trading and the
time allocation for heterogeneous IoT devices, one can achieve significant
improvements in terms of the ISP's profit compared with those of conventional
transmission methods. Different tradeoffs between the ESP's and ISP's profits
and complexities of the PA/JA schemes can also be numerically tuned.
Simulations also show that the obtained local SEs approach the socially optimal
welfare when the ISP's benefit per transmitted bit is higher than a given
threshold.

light into heat at the nanoscale. However, despite the possibility to generate
deep sub-wavelength electromagnetic hot spots, the formation of extremely
localized thermal hot spots is an open challenge of research, simply because of
the diffusive spread of heat along the whole metallic nanostructure. Here we
tackle this challenge by exploiting single gold nanocones. We theoretically
show how these structures can indeed realize extremely high temperature
gradients within the metal, leading to deep sub-wavelength thermal hot spots,
owing to their capability of concentrating light at the apex under resonant
conditions even under continuous wave illumination. A three-dimensional Finite
Element Method model is employed to study the electromagnetic field in the
structure and subsequent thermoplasmonic behaviour, in terms of the
three-dimensional temperature distribution. We show how the latter is affected
by nanocone size, shape, and composition of the surrounding environment.
Finally, we anticipate the use of photoinduced temperature gradients in
nanocones for applications in optofluidics and thermoelectrics or for thermally
induced nanofabrication.

of the project is to apply distributional semantic models to terminological
entries, that is, complex lexical data comprising of at least one or several
terms, term phrases and a definition. This application is needed to solve a
more complex problem: the harmonization of terminologies of standards and
standards bodies (i.e. resolution of doublettes and inconsistencies). Due to a
lack of evaluation data sets for terminological entries, the creation of
Harbsafe-162 was a necessary step towards harmonization assistance.
Harbsafe-162 covers data from nine electrotechnical standards in the domain of
functional safety, IT security, and dependability. An intrinsic evaluation
method in the form of a similarity rating task has been applied in which two
linguists and three domain experts from standardization participated. The data
set is used to evaluate a specific implementation of an established sentence
embedding model. This implementation proves to be satisfactory for the
domain-specific data so that further implementations for harmonization
assistance may be brought forward by the project. Considering recent criticism
on intrinsic evaluation methods, the article concludes with an evaluation of
Harbsafe-162 and joins a more general discussion about the nature of similarity
rating tasks. Harbsafe-162 has been made available for the community.

studies that reveal which types of structured light are best in turbulence, the
behaviour of vector versus scalar light in turbulence, the trade-off of

self-organized field enhancement at their tips that can appear in gases at (or
close to) atmospheric pressure. They are the precursors of other discharges
like sparks and lightning, but they also occur in for example corona reactors
or plasma jets which are used for a variety of plasma chemical purposes. When
enough space is available, streamers can also form at much lower pressures,
like in the case of sprite discharges high up in the atmosphere.
  We explain the structure and basic underlying physics of streamer discharges,
and how they scale with gas density. We discuss the chemistry and applications
of streamers, and describe their two main stages in detail: inception and
propagation. We also look at some other topics, like interaction with flow and
heat, related pulsed discharges, and electron runaway and high energy
radiation. Finally, we discuss streamer simulations and diagnostics in quite

seeds form throughout the atmosphere of WASP-43b. This is in stark contrast to
the ultra-hot Jupiters, like WASP-18b and HAT-P-7b. The dayside is loaded with
few but large mineral cloud particles in addition to hydrocarbon haze particles
of comparable abundance. Photochemically driven hydrocarbon haze appears on the
dayside, but does not contribute to the cloud formation on the nightside. The
geometrical cloud extension differs across the globe due to the changing
thermodynamic conditions. Day and night differ by 6000km in pressure scale
height. As reported for other planets, the C/O is not constant throughout the
atmosphere. The mean molecular weight is approximately constant in a
H2-dominated WASP-43b. WASP-43b is expected to be fully covered in clouds which
are not homogeneously distributed throughout the atmosphere. The dayside and
the terminator clouds will be a combination of mineral particles of locally
varying size and composition, and of hydrocarbon hazes. The optical depth of
hydrocarbon hazes is considerably lower than that of mineral cloud particles

well be the electromagnetic or any other field). We then point out that, in

improve performance of visual relationship detection tasks. Comparing with
previous methods, FOE-VRD has an important feature, i.e., it uses one
fixed-size vector to encoding all objects in each input image to assist the
process of relationship detection. Firstly, we use a regular convolution neural
network as a feature extractor to generate high-level features of input images.
Then, for each relationship triplet in input images, i.e.,
$<$subject-predicate-object$>$, we apply ROI-pooling to get feature vectors of
two regions on the feature maps that corresponding to bounding boxes of the
subject and object. Besides the subject and object, our analysis implies that
the results of predicate classification may also related to the rest objects in
input images (we call them background objects). Due to the variable number of
background objects in different images and computational costs, we cannot
generate feature vectors for them one-by-one by using ROI pooling technique.
Instead, we propose a novel method to encode all background objects in each
image by using one fixed-size vector (i.e., FBE vector). By concatenating the 3
vectors we generate above, we successfully encode the objects using one
fixed-size vector. The generated feature vector is then feed into a fully
connected neural network to get predicate classification results. Experimental
results on VRD database (entire set and zero-shot tests) show that the proposed
method works well on both predicate classification and relationship detection.

it usually can be exactly solved and at the same time is useful in modeling
various physical systems. Here we study a system of delta-potential trapped
spinorbit coupled cold atoms. The spin-orbit coupled atomic matter wave has two
kinds of evanescent modes, one of which has pure imaginary wavevector and is an
ordinary evanescent wave; while the other with a complex number wave vector is
recognized as oscillating evanescent wave. We identified the eigenenergy
spectra and the existence of bound states in this system. The bound states can
be constructed analytically using the two kinds of evanescent modes and we
found that they exhibit typical features of stripe phase, separated phase or
zero-momentum phase. In addition to that, the properties of semi-bound states
are also discussed, which is a localized wave packet on a plane wave
background.

Understanding the statistics of the galaxy cluster mass observable obtained

cluster mass observable for a Planck-like experiment with mock observations
obtained from an N-body simulation. We quantify the bias and intrinsic scatter
associated with this observable following two different approaches, one in
which the signal due to the cluster and nearby correlated large-scale structure
is isolated, and another one in which the variation due to uncorrelated
large-scale structure is also taken into account. For our first approach we
also quantify deviations from log-normality in the scatter, finding them to
have a negligible impact on mass calibration for our Planck-like experiment. We
briefly discuss how some of our results change for experiments with higher
angular resolution and lower noise levels, such as the current generation of

structures spontaneously appear from both stationary and flowing suspensions of
gyrotactic microswimmers in a vertical pipe. Recently, it has been shown that
there exist multiple numbers of steady axisymmetric axially uniform solutions
to such a system (Bees, M. A. & Croze, O. A., Proc. R. Soc. A., vol. 466, 2010,
pp. 2057-2077). In the present study, we generalise this finding by reporting
that a countably infinite number of such solutions emerge as Richardson number
increases. Linear stability, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear analyses are
performed, revealing that each of the solutions arises from the destabilisation
of uniform suspension. The discrete number of the solutions is due to the
finite flow domain, while the transcritical nature of the bifurcation is
because of the cylindrical geometry which breaks the horizontal symmetry of the
system. It is further shown that there exists a maximum threshold of achievable
downward flow rate for each solution if the flow is to remain steady, as
varying the pressure gradient can no longer increase the flow rate from the
solution. Except the one arising at the lowest Richardson number, all of the
solutions found are unstable, implying that they would play a role in the
transient dynamics in the route from a uniform suspension to the
fully-developed gyrotactic pattern.

far, only the subcritical measures where the parameter $\gamma$ is less than 2
were studied. This article considers the critical case where $\gamma =2$, using
three different approximation procedures which all lead to the same universal
measure. On the one hand, we exponentiate the square root of the local times of
small circles and show convergence in the Seneta--Heyde normalisation as well
as in the derivative martingale normalisation. On the other hand, we construct
the critical measure as a limit of subcritical measures. This is the first
example of a non-Gaussian critical multiplicative chaos.
  We are inspired by methods coming from critical Gaussian multiplicative
chaos, but there are essential differences, the main one being the lack of
Gaussianity which prevents the use of Kahane's inequality and hence a priori
controls. Instead, a continuity lemma is proved which makes it possible to use

incorporates the equations of motion originating from the Lagrange Mechanics

real-world physical system with large uncertainties. The resulting model is
accurate and data-efficient while ensuring physical plausibility. With this, we

business and political reasons and has become frequent in the online world.
People can get contaminated easily by these fake news for its fabricated words
which have enormous effects on the offline community. Thus, interest in
research in this area has risen. Significant research has been conducted on the
detection of fake news from English texts and other languages but a few in
Bangla Language. Our work reflects the experimental analysis on the detection
of Bangla fake news from social media as this field still requires much focus.
In this research work, we have used two supervised machine learning algorithms,
Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to
detect Bangla fake news with CountVectorizer and Term Frequency - Inverse
Document Frequency Vectorizer as feature extraction. Our proposed framework
detects fake news depending on the polarity of the corresponding article.
Finally, our analysis shows SVM with the linear kernel with an accuracy of
96.64% outperform MNB with an accuracy of 93.32%.

homotopy category of a pretriangulated dg-category, a category enriched in
chain complexes with a natural notion of shifts and cones that is accessible
with all the machinery of homological algebra. Dg-categories are algebraic
models of $\infty$-categories and thus fit into a wide ecosystem of
higher-categorical models and translations between them. In this paper we
describe an equivalence between two methods to turn a pretriangulated
dg-category into a quasicategory.
  The dg-nerve of a dg-category is a quasicategory whose simplices are coherent
families of maps in the mapping complexes. In contrast, the cycle category of a
pretriangulated category forgets all higher-degree elements of the mapping
complexes but becomes a cofibration category that encodes the homotopical
structure indirectly. This cofibration category then has an associated
quasicategory of frames in which simplices are Reedy-cofibrant resolutions.
  For every simplex in the dg-nerve of a pretriangulated dg-category we
construct such a Reedy-cofibrant resolution and then prove that this
construction defines an equivalence of quasicategories which is natural up to
simplicial homotopy. Our construction is explicit enough for calculations and
provides an intuitive explanation of the resolutions in the quasicategory of
frames as a generalisation of the mapping cylinder.

``rich get richer'' phenomena. Here, we explore the possibility of an
alternative digital currency that is egalitarian in control and just in the
distribution of created wealth. Such currencies can form and grow in grassroots

justice by egalitarian coin minting, whereby each member mints one coin at
every time step. Egalitarian minting results, in the limit, in the dilution of
any inherited assets and in each member having an equal share of the minted
currency, adjusted by the relative productivity of the members. Our main
theorem shows that a currency network, where agents can be members of more than
one currency community, can achieve distributive justice globally across the
network by joint egalitarian minting, whereby each agent mints one coin in only
one community at each timestep. Specifically, we show that a sufficiently large
intersection between two communities -- relative to the gap in their
productivity -- will cause the exchange rates between their currencies to
converge to 1:1, resulting in global distributive justice.

proof relies on the theory of asymptotic mixed Hodge structures. An interesting

grids where renewable energy sources are becoming a significant component in
the energy generation mix. Here, we focus on some of the basic properties of
flywheel energy storage systems, a technology that becomes competitive due to
recent progress in material and electrical design. While the description of the
rotation of rigid bodies about a fixed axis is classical mechanics textbook
material, all its basic aspects pertinent to flywheels, like, e.g., the
evaluation of stress caused by centripetal forces at high rotation speeds, are
either not covered or scattered over different sources of information; so it is
worthwhile to look closer at the specific mechanical problems for flywheels,
and to derive and clearly analyse the equations and their solutions. The
connection of flywheels to electrical systems impose particular boundary
conditions due to the coupling of mechanical and electrical characteristics of
the system. Our report thus deal with the mechanical design in terms of
stresses in flywheels, particularly during acceleration and deceleration,
considering both solid and hollow disks geometries, in light of which we give a
detailed electrical design of the flywheel system considering the
discharge-stage dynamics of the flywheel. We include a discussion on the
applicability of this mathematical model of the electrical properties of the
flywheel for actual settings. Finally, we briefly discuss the relative
advantages of flywheels in electrical grids over other energy storage

vector lattice from a Hausdorff (o)-Lebesgue topology on an order dense ideal,
and what the properties of the topologies thus obtained are. When the vector
lattice has an order dense ideal with a separating order continuous dual, it is
always possible to supply it with such a topology in this fashion, and the
restriction of this topology to a regular sublattice is then also a Hausdorff
uo-Lebesgue topology. A regular vector sublattice of
$\mathrm{L}_0(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ for a semi-finite measure $\mu$ falls into this
category, and the convergence of nets in its Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology is
then the convergence in measure on subsets of finite measure. When a vector
lattice not only has an order dense ideal with a separating order continuous
dual, but also has the countable sup property, we show that every net in a
regular vector sublattice that converges in its Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology
always contains a sequence that is uo-convergent to the same limit. This
enables us to give satisfactory answers to various topological questions about
uo-convergence in this context.

face recognition pipeline. A face presentation attack detection model with good
generalization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from
different input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,
training data (both real face images and spoof images) are not directly shared
between data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this paper, with the
motivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose Federated Face
Presentation Attack Detection (FedPAD) framework. FedPAD simultaneously takes
advantage of rich fPAD information available at different data owners while
preserving data privacy. In the proposed framework, each data owner (referred
to as \textit{data centers}) locally trains its own fPAD model. A server learns
a global fPAD model by iteratively aggregating model updates from all data
centers without accessing private data in each of them. Once the learned global
model converges, it is used for fPAD inference. We introduce the experimental
setting to evaluate the proposed FedPAD framework and carry out extensive
experiments to provide various insights about federated learning for fPAD.

constitutes the first systematic application of the WRF - Chem based protocol
to a specific Etna volcanic eruption, with possible effects involving the whole

eruption event, recorded on December 2015 from 3$^rd$ to 7$^th$, which led to
the closure of the Catania International Airport. Quantitative meteorological
forecasts, analyses of the Etna volcanic ash transport and estimates of the ash

that, as far as the selected eruption event is concerned, the WRF-Chem model
correctly reproduces the distribution of SO$_2$ and of volcanic ash. Therefore,
this model may provide a valuable support both to airport managements and to

competition level and identifying the dominant attributes that distinguish
among these levels, and then studying the impact of task diversity on task
success and worker performance in crowdsourcing platform. The empirical study
is conducted on more than one year's real-world data from TopCoder, the leading
software crowdsourcing platform. Results: We identified that monetary prize and
task complexity are the dominant attributes that differentiate among different
competition levels. Based on these dominant attributes, we found three task
diversity patterns (configurations) from workers behavior perspective:
responsive to prize, responsive to prize and complexity and over responsive to
prize. This study supports that1) responsive to prize configuration provides
highest level of task density and workers' reliability in a platform; 2)
responsive to prize and complexity configuration leads to attracting high level
of trustworthy workers; 3) over responsive to prize configuration results in
highest task stability and the lowest failure ratio in the platform for not
high similar tasks.

  Information",,"37th IEEE International Conference on Data Engineering (ICDE 2021)",,,"cs.DB cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Building natural language (NL) interfaces for databases has been a
long-standing challenge for several decades. The major advantage of these
so-called NL-to-SQL systems is that end-users can query complex databases
without the need to know SQL or the underlying database schema. Due to
significant advancements in machine learning, the recent focus of research has
been on neural networks to tackle this challenge on complex datasets like
Spider. Several recent NL-to-SQL systems achieve promising results on this
dataset. However, none of the published systems, that provide either the source
code or executable binaries, extract and incorporate values from the user
questions for generating SQL statements. Thus, the practical use of these
systems in a real-world scenario has not been sufficiently demonstrated yet.
  In this paper we propose ValueNet light and ValueNet -- two end-to-end
NL-to-SQL systems that incorporate values using the challenging Spider dataset.
The main idea of our approach is to use not only metadata information from the
underlying database but also information on the base data as input for our
neural network architecture. In particular, we propose a novel architecture
sketch to extract values from a user question and come up with possible value
candidates which are not explicitly mentioned in the question. We then use a
neural model based on an encoder-decoder architecture to synthesize the SQL
query. Finally, we evaluate our model on the Spider challenge using the
Execution Accuracy metric, a more difficult metric than used by most
participants of the challenge. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that
ValueNet light and ValueNet reach state-of-the-art results of 67% and 62%
accuracy, respectively, for translating from NL to SQL whilst incorporating
values.

Kuramoto networks with adaptive coupling. Sufficient conditions for the local
asymptotic stability of the corresponding synchronization invariant toroidal

interconnection topology and plasticity parameters of the adaptive couplings.
The proposed sufficient stability conditions qualitatively mimic certain
counterpart results for Kuramoto networks with static coupling which require
sufficiently strong and dense intra-cluster connections and sufficiently weak
and sparse inter-cluster ones. Remarkably, the existence of cluster formations
depends on the interconnection structure between nodes belonging to different
clusters and does not require any coupling links between nodes that form a
cluster. On the other hand, the stability properties of clusters depend on the
interconnection structure inside the clusters. This dependence constitutes the
main contribution of the paper. Also, two numerical examples are provided to
validate the proposed theoretical findings.

industry, due to their impressive performance in tasks that are essential for
autonomous driving. Object segmentation is one such task: its aim is to
precisely locate boundaries of objects and classify the identified objects,
helping autonomous cars to recognise the road environment and the traffic
situation. Not only is this task safety critical, but developing a DNN based
object segmentation module presents a set of challenges that are significantly
different from traditional development of safety critical software. The
development process in use consists of multiple iterations of data collection,
labelling, training, and evaluation. Among these stages, training and
evaluation are computation intensive while data collection and labelling are
manual labour intensive. This paper shows how development of DNN based object
segmentation can be improved by exploiting the correlation between Surprise
Adequacy (SA) and model performance. The correlation allows us to predict model
performance for inputs without manually labelling them. This, in turn, enables
understanding of model performance, more guided data collection, and informed
decisions about further training. In our industrial case study the technique
allows cost savings of up to 50% with negligible evaluation inaccuracy.
Furthermore, engineers can trade off cost savings versus the tolerable level of
inaccuracy depending on different development phases and scenarios.

result when a monotonically increasing link travel time function of flow volume
is adopted in traffic assignment. The fixed link flow results of a static
traffic assignment model (TAM) make it nearly impossible to investigate and
make use of the actual evolution of congested zones over the network during the
predetermined observation time period. Many methods, such as TAMs with
side-constraints on link flow capacity and the pseudo dynamic traffic
assignment based on day-by-day traffic, have been proposed to improve the
reliability of the results of TAM, but cannot eliminate the problem. To resolve
the above problems, we first uncover the origin of problem by analyzing the
connection between the link travel time function and the fundamental diagram of
traffic flow theory. According to the above connection a mapping is formulated
to reflect the two branches of the fundamental diagram. Then with the
assumption that the link flow states are given, new traffic assignment models
are presented. To resolve the obtained non-convex user equilibrium model, a
branch-and-bound algorithm is designed based on linearizing the nonlinear part
of the objective function. At last, by repeatedly resolving the corresponding
traffic assignment model with the renewed initial flow states of links, the
evolution of congested zones during the observation time period can be
reproduced and investigated. The numerical examples demonstrate the
effectiveness of the new approach.

studied so far by our newly developed convexification method that consists in a
new derivation of a boundary value problem for a coupled quasilinear elliptic
system. However, in our previous work only the unknown dielectric constants of
objects and shapes of their front surfaces were calculated. Unlike this, in the
current work performance of our numerical convexification algorithm is verified
for the case when the dielectric constants, the electric conductivities and
those shapes of objects are unknown. By running several tests with
experimentally collected backscattering data, we find that we can accurately
image both the dielectric constants and shapes of targets of interests

conductivity serves for reliably distinguishing conductive and non-conductive
objects. The global convergence of our numerical procedure is shortly

important policy goal to address climate change. However, such an integration
faces economic and technological challenges. As power generation by renewable
sources increases, power transmission patterns over the electric grid change.
Due to physical laws, these new transmission patterns lead to non-intuitive
grid congestion externalities. We derive the conditions under which negative
network externalities due to power trades occur. Calibration using a stylized
framework and data from Europe shows that each additional unit of power traded
between northern and western Europe reduces transmission capacity for the
southern and eastern regions by 27% per unit traded. Such externalities suggest
that new investments in the electric grid infrastructure cannot be made
piecemeal. In our example, power infrastructure investment in northern and
western Europe needs an accompanying investment in southern and eastern Europe
as well. An economic challenge is regions facing externalities do not always
have the financial ability to invest in infrastructure. Power transit fares can
help finance power infrastructure investment in regions facing network
congestion externalities. The resulting investment in the overall electricity
grid facilitates integration of renewable energy production.

Mapping (SLAM) methods is of necessity for mobile autonomous robots with
limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient
FPGA implementation for accelerating scan matching computations, which
typically cause a major bottleneck in 2D LiDAR SLAM methods. Scan matching is a
process of correcting a robot pose by aligning the latest LiDAR measurements
with an occupancy grid map, which encodes the information about the surrounding
environment. We exploit an inherent parallelism in the Rao-Blackwellized
Particle Filter (RBPF) based algorithms to perform scan matching computations
for multiple particles in parallel. In the proposed design, several techniques
are employed to reduce the resource utilization and to achieve the maximum
throughput. Experimental results using the benchmark datasets show that the
scan matching is accelerated by 5.31-8.75x and the overall throughput is
improved by 3.72-5.10x without seriously degrading the quality of the final
outputs. Furthermore, our proposed IP core requires only 44% of the total
resources available in the TUL Pynq-Z2 FPGA board, thus facilitating the
realization of SLAM applications on indoor mobile robots.

partial differential equations with uncertain coefficients, based on the
so-called MG/OPT framework. The levels in this MG/OPT hierarchy correspond to
discretization levels of the PDE, as usual. For stochastic problems, the
relevant quantities (such as the gradient) contain expected value operators on
each of these levels. They are estimated using a multilevel Monte Carlo method,
the specifics of which depend on the MG/OPT level. Each of the optimization
levels then contains multiple underlying multilevel Monte Carlo levels. The
MG/OPT hierarchy allows the algorithm to exploit the structure inherent in the
PDE, speeding up the convergence to the optimum. In contrast, the multilevel
Monte Carlo hierarchy exists to exploit structure present in the stochastic
dimensions of the problem. A statement about the rate of convergence of the
algorithm is proven, and some additional properties are discussed. The
performance of the algorithm is numerically investigated for three test cases.
A reduction in the number of samples required on expensive levels and therefore
in computational time can be observed.

that: i) ARIMA models are reliable enough when new daily cases begin to
stabilize; ii) Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19

those that include a first-order hadron-to-quark phase transition. We find that
a lower bound on $M_{\rm max}$ with an upper bound on the radius of massive
pulsars serves to rule out too soft quark matter, and an upper bound on $M_{\rm

transition into too-stiff quark matter appearing at low densities. The
complementary role played by radius inferences from future gravitational wave
events of inspiraling binary neutron stars is also briefly discussed.

in our Galaxy in the near future. A fraction of them may be triple systems
comprising an inner binary, instead of a single black hole, which might be
progenitors of binary black holes (BBHs) routinely discovered now from the
gravitational wave. We extend our previous proposal to locate inner BBHs from
the short-term radial-velocity (RV) variation of a tertiary star in coplanar
triples, and we consider noncoplanar triples and their long-term RV variations
as well. Specifically, we assume coplanar and noncoplanar triples with an inner
BBH of the total mass $20~M_\odot$, whose outer and inner orbital periods are
80 days and 10 days, respectively. We perform a series of N-body simulations
and compare the results with analytic approximate solutions based on quadrupole
perturbation theory. For coplanar triples, the pericenter shift of the outer
star can be used to detect the hidden inner BBH. For noncoplanar triples, the
total RV semi-amplitude of the outer star is modulated periodically on the
order of $100$km/s due to its precession over roughly the Kozai-Lidov
oscillation timescale. Such long-term modulations would be detectable within a
decade, independent of the short-term RV variations on the order of of $100$
m/s at roughly twice the orbital frequency of the inner binary. Thus the RV
monitoring of future star-black hole binary candidates offers a promising
method for searching for their inner hidden BBHs in optical bands.

weakly enforced in the global problem of HDG. The unknowns of the global HDG

constitutive law by means of classical finite elements. For mixtures that
varied from totally rigid to totally deformable particles, we characterize the
evolution of the packing fraction, the elastic modulus, and the connectivity as
a function of the applied stresses when varying inter-particle coefficient of
friction. We show first that the packing fraction increases and tends
asymptotically to a maximum value $\phi_{max}$, which depends on both the
mixture ratio and the inter-particle friction. The bulk modulus is also shown
to increase with the packing fraction and to diverges as it approaches
$\phi_{max}$. From the micro-mechanical expression of the granular stress
tensor, we develop a model to describe the compaction behavior as a function of
the applied pressure, the Young modulus of the deformable particles, and the
mixture ratio. A bulk equation is also derived from the compaction equation.
This model lays on the characterization of a single deformable particle under
compression together with a power-law relation between connectivity and packing
fraction. This compaction model, set by well-defined physical quantities,
results in outstanding predictions from the jamming point up to very high
densities and allows us to give a direct prediction of $\phi_{max}$ as a

contradiction has encouraged scholars and policy makers to explore the true
effects of RTAs, including both regional and global trade relationships. This
paper defines synthesized trade resistance and decomposes it into natural and
artificial factors. Here, we separate the influence of geographical distance,
economic volume, overall increases in transportation and labor costs and use
the expectation maximization algorithm to optimize the parameters and quantify
the trade purity indicator, which describes the true global trade environment
and relationships among countries. This indicates that although global and most
regional trade relations gradually deteriorated during the period 2007-2017,
RTAs generate trade relations among members, especially contributing to the
relative prosperity of EU and NAFTA countries. In addition, we apply the
network to reflect the purity of the trade relations among countries. The
effects of RTAs can be analyzed by comparing typical trade unions and trade
communities, which are presented using an empirical network structure. This
analysis shows that the community structure is quite consistent with some trade
unions, and the representative RTAs constitute the core structure of
international trade network. However, the role of trade unions has weakened,
and multilateral trade liberalization has accelerated in the past decade. This
means that more countries have recently tended to expand their trading partners
outside of these unions rather than limit their trading activities to RTAs.

Neptune. I discuss a range of lessons learned from Voyager, broadly grouped
into process, planning, and people. In terms of process, we must be open to new
concepts: reliance on existing instrument technologies, propulsion systems, and
operational modes is inherently limiting. I cite examples during recent decades
that could open new vistas in exploration of the deep outer Solar System.
Planning is crucial: mission gaps that last over three decades leave much scope
for evolution both in mission development and in the targets themselves. I
touch only briefly on planetary science, as that is covered in other papers in
this issue, but the role of the decadal surveys will be examined in this
section. I also sketch out how coordination of distinct and divergent
international planning timelines yields both challenges and opportunity.
Finally, I turn to people: with generational-length gaps between missions,
continuity in knowledge and skills requires careful attention to people. The
youngest participants in the Voyager missions (myself included) now approach
retirement. We share here ideas for preparing the next generation of voyagers.

  Fluorophores for Single Ion Barium Tagging","11 pages, 9 figures (1 scheme)",,,,"physics.ins-det hep-ex nucl-ex physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single molecule fluorescence detection of barium is investigated for
enhancing the sensitivity and robustness of a neutrinoless double beta decay
($0\nu\beta\beta$) search in $^{136}$Xe, the discovery of which would alter our
understanding of the nature of neutrinos and the early history of the Universe.
A key developmental step is the synthesis of barium-selective chemosensors
capable of incorporation into ongoing experiments in high-pressure $^{136}$Xe
gas. Here we report turn-on fluorescent naphthalimide chemosensors containing
monoaza- and diaza-crown ethers as agents for single Ba$^{2+}$ detection.
Monoaza-18-crown-6 ether naphthalimide sensors showed sensitivity primarily to
Ba$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$, whereas two diaza-18-crown-6 ether naphthalimides
revealed a desirable selectivity toward Ba$^{2+}$. Solution-phase fluorescence
and NMR experiments support a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism enabling
turn-on fluorescence sensing in the presence of barium ions. Changes in
ion-receptor interactions enable effective selectivity between competitive
barium, mercury, and potassium ions, with detailed calculations correctly
predicting fluorescence responses. With these molecules, dry-phase single
Ba$^{2+}$ ion imaging with turn-on fluorescence is realized using oil-free
microscopy techniques. This represents a significant advance toward a practical
method of single Ba$^{2+}$ detection within large volumes of $^{136}$Xe,
plausibly enabling a background-free technique to search for the hypothetical
process of $0\nu\beta\beta$.

determination of an attack origin, targeted advertisement, and Content Delivery
Networks. Although IP Geolocation is an ongoing field of research for over one
decade, it is still a challenging task, whereas good results are only achieved
by the use of active latency measurements. Nevertheless, an increased accuracy
is needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to
find optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a
reasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization
service, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the
infrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an
adaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical
location estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about
solving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models. We
demonstrate the usability of our approach in a real-world environment and
analyse Geolocation for the first time in Europe. The combination of an
optimized Landmark selection and advanced modulation results in an improved
accuracy of IP Geolocation.
