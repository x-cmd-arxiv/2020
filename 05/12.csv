  Stochastic Systems",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers the simultaneous state and unknown input estimation for
continuous-discrete stochastic systems. Two types of approaches (with and
without modeling of unknown inputs) which can address this issue are
investigated. A novel continuous recursive four-step Kalman filter is proposed
and its asymptotic stability condition is established. A novel one-step unknown
input Kalman filter is proposed and has guaranteed stability when the number of
unknown inputs is equal to that of the measurements. The design of unknown
input Kalman filters and observers is unified. Furthermore, an adaptive
augmented Kalman filter which requires the modeling of unknown inputs is
introduced. The estimation error covariance of the recursive four-step Kalman
filter and the adaptive augmented Kalman filter is analyzed and compared.
Finally, simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approaches.

the stellar atmosphere. Detailed monitoring of such events may prove useful for

polarimetric observations of Betelgeuse at 2.5-m telescope of Caucasian
Mountain Observatory of SAI MSU covering the period of 2019-2020 minimum. The
observations were secured on 17 dates at wavelengths 465, 550, 625 and 880 nm.
The circumstellar reflection nebula with the angular size of

observational period. Net polarized brightness of the envelope remained
constant until February 2020, while the stellar $V$ band flux decreased 2.5

lone pair of Weyl nodes generated by A-type antiferromagnetism and protected by
a rotational symmetry. However, it was soon discovered that the actual magnetic
structure broke the rotational symmetry and internal pressure was later
suggested as a route to stabilize the desired magnetic state. In this work we
test this prediction by synthesizing a series of Eu$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Cd$_2$As$_2$
single crystals and studying their structural, magnetic and transport
properties via both experimental techniques and first-principles calculations.
We find that small concentrations of Ba ($\sim 3-10\% $) lead to a small
out-of-plane canting of the Eu moment. However, for higher concentrations this
effect is suppressed and a nearly in-plane model is recovered. Studying the
transport properties we find that all compositions show evidence of an
Anomalous Hall Effect dominated by the intrinsic mechanism as well as large
negative magnetoresistances in the longitudinal channel. A non-monotonic
evolution of the transport properties is seen across the series which
correlates to the proposed canting suggesting canting may enhance the
topological effects. Careful density functional theory calculations using an
all-electron approach revise prior predictions finding a purely ferromagnetic
ground state with in-plane moments for both the EuCd$_2$As$_2$ and
Eu$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$Cd$_2$As$_2$ compounds - corroborating our experimental
findings. This work suggests that Ba substitution can tune the magnetic
properties in unexpected ways which correlate to changes in measures of
topological properties, encouraging future work to locate the ideal Ba

so-called Maunder minimum phase. It consists of the lowest sunspot's counting
ever registered for the Sun, and never so far confirmed for other stars. Since
the spectroscopic observations of stellar activity at the Mount Wilson
Observatory, the solar analog HD43587 has shown a very low and apparently
invariant activity level, which makes it a Maunder minimum candidate. We
analyze the chromospheric activity evolution of HD43587 and its evolutive
status, intending to unravel the reasons for this low and flat activity. We use
an activity measurements dataset available in the literature, and compute the
activity S-index from HARPS and NARVAL spectra, to infer a cycle period.
Besides, we analyze the CoRoT light-curve of HD43587, and apply gyrochronology
and activity calibrations, to determine its rotation period. Finally, based on
an evolutionary model and the inferred rotation period, we use the EULAG-MHD
code to perform global MHD simulations of HD43587 with the aim of getting some
insights about its dynamo process. We confirm the almost flat activity profile,
with a cycle period $P_{\mathrm{cyc}} = 10.44\pm3.03$ yrs deduced from the
S-index time series, and a long-term trend that might be a period larger than
50 yrs. It was impossible to define a rotation period from the light-curve,
however gyrochronology and activity calibrations allow to infer an indirect
estimate of $\overline{P}_{\mathrm{rot}} = 22.6 \pm 1.9$ d. Furthermore, the
MHD simulations confirm an oscillatory dynamo with a cycle period in good
agreement with the observations and a low level of surface magnetic activity.
We conclude that this object might be experiencing a ""natural"" decrease in
magnetic activity as a consequence of its age. Nevertheless, the possibility
that HD43587 is in a Maunder minimum phase cannot be ruled out.

their characteristic red noise nature in some of those observations. We find a
linear relationship between the root-mean-squared amplitude of variability at
shorter timescales and the mean flux level at longer timescales for light
curves of Mrk 421 across epochs separated by decades as well as light curves
spanning 5 days and $\sim$10 yr. The presence of flux-rms relation over very
different timescales may imply that, similar to the X-ray binaries and Seyfert
galaxies, longer and shorter timescale variability are connected in blazars.

aims to extract factual evidence (automatically aligned text-triples) from a

contextual commonsense and serve as the additional inputs to the model.

achieved, a widespread assumption is that economic growth at current rates can
be sustained beyond the 21st century. However, even if we achieve these goals,
this article shows that the overall size of Earth's global economy is facing an
upper limit purely due to energy and thermodynamic factors. For that, we break
down global warming into two components: the greenhouse gas effect and heat
dissipation from energy consumption related to economic activities. For the
temperature increase due to greenhouse gas emissions, we take 2 {\deg}C and 5
{\deg}C as our lower and upper bounds. For the warming effect of heat
dissipation related to energy consumption, we use a simplified model for global
warming and an extrapolation of the historical correlation between global gross
domestic product (GDP) and primary energy production. Combining the two
effects, we set the acceptable global warming temperature limit to 7 {\deg}C
above pre-industrial levels. We develop four scenarios, based on the viability
of large-scale deployment of carbon-neutral energy sources. Our results
indicate that for a 2% annual GDP growth, the upper limit will be reached at
best within a few centuries, even in favorable scenarios where new energy
sources such as fusion power are deployed on a massive scale. We conclude that
unless GDP can be largely decoupled from energy consumption, thermodynamics
will put a hard cap on the size of Earth's economy. Further economic growth
would necessarily require expanding economic activities into space.

that the closed-loop average performance is no worse than a locally optimal

the proposed scheme is a modified version of recent publications using
periodicity constraints, with the important difference that the resulting
closed loop has more degrees of freedom which are vital to ensure convergence

several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.
Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,
these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in
the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that
epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that
assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19
pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other

taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the

aims to measure the extent to which a graphon $w$ exhibits the Robinson
property: for all $x<y<z$, $w(x,z)\leq \min\{ w(x,y),w(y,z)\}$. Robinson
graphons form a model for graphs with a natural line embedding so that most
edges are local. Function $\Gamma$ is compatible with the cut-norm $\|\cdot

approximated by a Robinson graphon $R_w$ so that $\|w-R_w\|_\Box$ is bounded in
terms of $\Gamma (w)$. We then use classical techniques from functional
analysis to show that a converging graph sequence $\{G_n\}$ converges to a
Robinson graphon if and only if $\Gamma (G_n)\rightarrow 0$. Finally, using
probabilistic techniques we show that the rate of convergence of $\Gamma$ for
graph sequences sampled from a Robinson graphon can differ substantially
depending on how strongly $w$ exhibits the Robinson property.

hitting all NBER recessions. While $I(1)$ unobserved components models yield an
upward-biased signal-to-noise ratio whenever the integration order of the
data-generating mechanism is greater than one, the fractionally integrated
model attributes less variation to the long-run shocks due to the fractional

result, NC process has universal property which means NC can be applied to any
AI tasks involving convolution neural layer . Since NC don't need other

algorithm (QAOA), an approach to solve combinatorial optimization problems on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. Gaining computational power
from QAOA critically relies on the mitigation of errors during the execution of
the algorithm, which for coherence-limited operations is achievable by reducing
the gate count. Here, we demonstrate an improvement of up to a factor of 3 in
algorithmic performance as measured by the success probability, by implementing
a continuous hardware-efficient gate set using superconducting quantum
circuits. This gate set allows us to perform the phase separation step in QAOA
with a single physical gate for each pair of qubits instead of decomposing it
into two C$Z$-gates and single-qubit gates. With this reduced number of
physical gates, which scales with the number of layers employed in the
algorithm, we experimentally investigate the circuit-depth-dependent
performance of QAOA applied to exact-cover problem instances mapped onto three
and seven qubits, using up to a total of 399 operations and up to 9 layers. Our
results demonstrate that the use of continuous gate sets may be a key component

confined by an adjustable orthosis in five different degrees. Eleven gait
parameters are extracted from radar micro-Doppler signatures. Here, new methods
for obtaining the velocities of individual lower limb joints are proposed.
Further, a new method to extract individual leg flight times from radar data is
introduced. Based on radar data, five spatiotemporal parameters related to
rhythm and pace could reliably be extracted. Further, for most of the
considered conditions, three kinematic parameters could accurately be measured.
The radar-based stance and flight time measurements rely on the correct
detection of the time instant of maximal knee velocity during the gait cycle.
This time instant is reliably detected when the radar has a back view, but is
underestimated when the radar is positioned in front of the subject. The
results validate the applicability of Doppler radar to accurately measure a
variety of medically relevant gait parameters. Radar has the potential to
unobtrusively diagnose changes in gait, e.g., to design training in prevention

presents a viable technology to supplement existing gait analysis tools for

frequency structure consistent with cosmological fast radio bursts (FRB) and a
fluence within a factor of $\lesssim 10$ of the least energetic extragalactic
FRB previously detected. Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB
sources, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the
radio emission which make different predictions for the accompanying higher
frequency radiation. We show that the properties of the coincident radio and
X-ray flares from SGR 1935+2154, including their approximate simultaneity and
relative fluence $E_{\rm radio}/E_{\rm X} \sim 10^{-5}$, as well as the
duration and spectrum of the X-ray emission, are consistent with extant
predictions for the synchrotron maser shock model. Rather than arising from the
inner magnetosphere, the X-rays are generated by (incoherent) synchrotron
radiation from thermal electrons heated at the same shocks which produce the
coherent maser emission. Although the rate of SGR 1935+2154-like bursts in the
local universe is not sufficient to contribute appreciably to the extragalactic
FRB rate, the inclusion of an additional population of more active magnetars
with stronger magnetic fields than the Galactic population can explain both the
FRB rate as well as the repeating fraction, however only if the population of
active magnetars are born at a rate that is at least two-orders of magnitude
lower than that of SGR 1935+2154-like magnetars. This may imply that the more
active magnetar sources are not younger magnetars formed in a similar way to
the Milky Way population (e.g. via ordinary supernovae), but instead through
more exotic channels such as superluminous supernovae, accretion-induced
collapse or neutron star mergers.

an important research direction that has not received much attention. Since
natural definitions using classical cryptography are impossible to achieve (as

techniques from quantum computing. The seminal work of Aaronson [CCC'09]
introduced the notion of quantum copy-protection precisely to address the
problem of software anti-piracy. However, despite being one of the most
important problems in quantum cryptography, there are no provably secure
solutions of quantum copy-protection known for any class of functions.
  We formulate an alternative definition for tackling software piracy, called
secure software leasing (SSL). While weaker than quantum copy-protection, SSL
is still meaningful and has interesting applications in software anti-piracy.
  We present a construction of SSL for a subclass of evasive circuits (that
includes natural implementations of point functions, conjunctions with wild

construction is the first provably secure solution, based on concrete
cryptographic assumptions, for software anti-piracy. To complement our positive
result, we show, based on cryptographic assumptions, that there is a class of

require timely online monitoring at a remote device. There, the received
information is used to estimate current and future process values. When
transmitting the process data over a communication channel, source-channel
coding is used in order to reduce data errors. During transmission, a high data
resolution is helpful to capture the value of the process variables precisely.
However, this typically comes with long transmission delays reducing the
utilizability of the data, since the estimation quality gets reduced over time.
In this paper, the trade-off between having recent data and precise
measurements is captured for a Gauss-Markov process. An Age-of-Information
(AoI) metric is used to assess data timeliness, while mean square error (MSE)
is used to assess the precision of the predicted process values. AoI appears
inherently within the MSE expressions, yet it can be relatively easier to
optimize. Our goal is to minimize a time-averaged version of both metrics. We
follow a short blocklength source-channel coding approach, and optimize the
parameters of the codes being used in order to describe an achievability region
between MSE and AoI.

the function phi which counts, for each n, the number phi(n) of orbits of G
acting on the n-subsets of E. Counting functions arising this way, and their
associated generating series, form a rich yet apparently strongly constrained
class. In particular, Cameron conjectured in the late seventies that, whenever
the profile phi(n) is bounded by a polynomial -- we say that G is
P-oligomorphic --, it is asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. In 1985,
Macpherson further asked whether the orbit algebra of G -- a graded commutative
algebra invented by Cameron and whose Hilbert function is phi -- is finitely
generated.
  In this paper we establish a classification of (closed) P-oligomorphic
permutation groups in terms of finite permutation groups with decorated blocks.
  It follows from the classification that the orbit algebra of any
P-oligomorphic group is isomorphic to (a straightforward quotient of) the
invariant ring of some finite permutation group. This answers positively both
Cameron's conjecture and Macpherson's question. The orbit algebra is in fact
Cohen-Macaulay; therefore the generating series of phi is a rational fraction
whose numerator has positive coefficients, while the denominator admits a
combinatorial description.
  In addition, the classification provides a finite data structure for encoding
closed P-oligomorphic groups. This paves the way for computing with them and
enumerating them as well as for proofs by structural induction. Finally, the
relative simplicity of the classification gives hopes to extend the study to,
e.g., the class of (closed) permutations groups with sub-exponential profile.
  The proof exploits classical notions from group theory -- notably block
systems and their lattice properties --, commutative algebra, and invariant
theory.

that one or more of them might in the near future fall within reach of the

used to cluster data that exhibit features such as skewness and heavy tails.
However, for cluster analysis, using a traditional finite mixture model
framework, either the number of components needs to be known $a$-$priori$ or
needs to be estimated $a$-$posteriori$ using some model selection criterion
after deriving results for a range of possible number of components. However,
different model selection criteria can sometimes result in different number of
components yielding uncertainty. Here, an infinite mixture model framework,
also known as Dirichlet process mixture model, is proposed for the mixtures of
MNIG distributions. This Dirichlet process mixture model approach allows the
number of components to grow or decay freely from 1 to $\infty$ (in practice
from 1 to $N$) and the number of components is inferred along with the
parameter estimates in a Bayesian framework thus alleviating the need for model
selection criteria. We provide real data applications with benchmark datasets

the simulation is dynamically decreased outside the lightcone surface, reducing
the computational work load, while simultaneously preserving the accuracy
inside the lightcone and the large-scale gravitational field. We show that our
approach can achieve virtually identical results to traditional simulations at
half of the computational cost for our largest box. We also forecast this
speedup to increase up to a factor of 5 for larger and/or higher-resolution

scale below which distances cannot be reliably resolved. One method of
constructing a quantum field with a finite minimum length scale is to use
bandlimited quantum field theory, where the spacetime is mathematically both
continuous and discrete. This is a modification to the field, which has been
shown to have many consequences at the level of the field. We consider an
operational approach and use a pair of particle detectors (two-level qubits) as
a local probe of the field, which are coupled to the vacuum of the bandlimited
massless scalar field in a time dependent way through a switching function. We
show that, mathematically, the bandlimit modifies the spatial profile of the
detectors so that they are only quasi-local. We explore two different types of
switching functions, Gaussian and Dirac delta. We find that with Gaussian
switching, the bandlimit exponentially suppresses the de-excitation of the
detectors when the energy gap between the two levels is larger than the
bandlimit. If the detectors are prepared in ground state, in certain regions of
the parameter space they are able to extract more entanglement from the field
than if there was no bandlimit. When the detectors couple with Dirac-delta
switching, we show that a particle detector is most sensitive to the bandlimit
when it couples to a small but finite region of spacetime. We find that the
effects of a bandlimit are detectable using local probes. This work is
important because it illustrates the possible observable consequences of a
fundamental bandlimit in a quantum field.

relate the $n$-point correlation functions in real and redshift space. Our
result generalises the so-called `streaming model' to higher-order statistics:
the full $n$-point correlation in redshift-space is obtained as an integral of
its real-space counterpart times the joint probability density of $n-1$
relative line-of-sight peculiar velocities. Equations for the connected
$n$-point correlation functions are obtained by recursively applying the
generalised streaming model for decreasing $n$. Our results are exact within
the distant-observer approximation and completely independent of the nature of
the tracers for which the correlations are evaluated. Focusing on 3-point
statistics, we use an $N$-body simulation to study the joint probability
density function of the relative line-of-sight velocities of pairs of particles
in a triplet. On large scales, we find that this distribution is approximately
Gaussian and that its moments can be accurately computed with standard
perturbation theory. We use this information to formulate a phenomenological
3-point Gaussian streaming model. A practical implementation is obtained by
using perturbation theory at leading order to approximate several statistics in
real space. In spite of this simplification, the resulting predictions for the
matter 3-point correlation function in redshift space are in rather good
agreement with measurements performed in the simulation. We discuss the
limitations of the simplified model and suggest a number of possible
improvements. Our results find direct applications in the analysis of galaxy
clustering but also set the basis for studying 3-point statistics with future
peculiar-velocity surveys and experiments based on the kinetic
Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect.

red horizontal branch stars) is discussed as it relates to RRab and classical
Cepheids, and invariably establishing an improved distance scale. An analysis
of OGLE Magellanic Cloud variables reaffirms that blending with RCGs may
advantageously thrust remote extragalactic stars into the range of
detectability. Specifically, simulations of Magellanic Cloud RRab and RCG
blends partly reproduce bright non-canonical trends readily observed in
amplitude-magnitude space ($I_c$ vs.~$A_{I_c}$). Conversely, the larger
magnitude offset between classical Cepheids and RCGs causes the latter's
influence to be challenging to address. The relative invariance of a Wesenheit
function's slope to metallicity (e.g., $W_{VI_c}$) implies that a deviation
from the trend could reveal blending and photometric inaccuracies (e.g.,
standardization), as blending by RCGs (a proxy of an evolved red stellar
demographic) can flatten period-Wesenehit relations owing to the increased
impact on less-luminous shorter-period Cepheids. That could partly explain both
a shallower inferred Wesenheit function and over-estimated $H_0$ values. A
consensus framework to identify and exploit blending is desirable, as presently
$H_0$ estimates from diverse teams are unwittingly leveraged without
homogenizing the disparate approaches (e.g., no blending correction to a
sizable $\simeq 0.^{\rm m}3$).

fields remains uncertain. Recent 3D magnetohydrodynamical simulations have
shown that strong magnetic fields can be generated in the merger of two massive
stars. Here, we follow the long-term evolution of such a 3D merger product in a
1D stellar evolution code. During a thermal relaxation phase after the
coalescence, the merger product reaches critical surface rotation, sheds mass
and then spins down primarily because of internal mass readjustments. The spin
of the merger product after thermal relaxation is mainly set by the
co-evolution of the star-torus structure left after coalescence. This evolution
is still uncertain, so we also consider magnetic braking and other
angular-momentum-gain and -loss mechanisms that may influence the final spin of
the merged star. Because of core compression and mixing of carbon and nitrogen
in the merger, enhanced nuclear burning drives a transient convective core that
greatly contributes to the rejuvenation of the star. Once the merger product
relaxed back to the main sequence, it continues its evolution similar to that
of a genuine single star of comparable mass. It is a slow rotator that matches
the magnetic blue straggler $\tau$ Sco. Our results show that merging is a
promising mechanism to explain some magnetic massive stars and it may also be
key to understand the origin of the strong magnetic fields of highly-magnetic

massless scalar field $\phi$ and a cosmological constant term $\Lambda$. We
investigate the dynamics in terms of WKB scenario for which the isotropic
Misner variables (the volume) and one of the two anisotropic ones (and $\phi$
when present) are treated on a semi-classical level, while the remaining
anisotropy degree of freedom, the one trapped in the corner, is described on a
pure quantum level. The quantum dynamics always reduces to the one of a
time-dependent Schr\""{o}edinger equation for a harmonic potential with a time
dependent frequency. The vacuum case is treated in the limits of a collpasing
and an expanding Universe, while the dynamics in presence of $\phi$ and
$\Lambda$ is studied for $t \rightarrow \infty $. In both analysis the quantum
dynamics of the anisotropy variable is associated to a decaying standard
deviation of its probability density, corresponding to a suppression of the
quantum anisotropy associated. In the vacuum case, the corner configuration
becomes an attractor for the dynamics and the evolution resembles that one of a
Taub cosmology in the limit of a non-singular initial Universe. This suggests
that if the Bianchi dynamics enters enough the potential corner then the
initial singularity is removed and a Taub picture emerges. The case when $\phi$
is present well mimics the De-Sitter phase of an inflationary Universe. Here we
show that both the classical and quantum anisotropies are exponentially
suppressed, so that the resulting dynamics corresponds to an isotropic closed
Robertson-Walker geometry.

$\chi_{\perp,\text{max}}$, to measure the strength of precession and hint that
the mismatch between the above approximants shows an exponential dependence on

the relativistic jet of an active galaxy pointed towards the Earth. However a
combined analysis of many similar active galaxies revealed no excess from the
broader population, leaving the vast majority of the cosmic neutrino flux
unexplained. Here we present the likely association of a radio-emitting tidal
disruption event, AT2019dsg, with a second high-energy neutrino. AT2019dsg was
identified as part of our systematic search for optical counterparts to
high-energy neutrinos with the Zwicky Transient Facility. The probability of
finding any coincident radio-emitting tidal disruption event by chance is 0.5%,
while the probability of finding one as bright in bolometric energy flux as
AT2019dsg is 0.2%. Our electromagnetic observations can be explained through a
multi-zone model, with radio analysis revealing a central engine, embedded in a
UV photosphere, that powers an extended synchrotron-emitting outflow. This
provides an ideal site for PeV neutrino production. Assuming that the
association is genuine, our observations suggest that tidal disruption events
with mildly-relativistic outflows contribute to the cosmic neutrino flux.

spectral line from all sources that trace the matter density field. Spectral
lines from different redshifts can fall in the same observed frequency and be
confused, however, which is a major challenge in LIM. In this work, we develop
a line de-confusion technique in map space capable of reconstructing the
three-dimensional spatial distribution of line-emitting sources. If multiple
spectral lines of a source population are observable in multiple frequencies,
using the sparse approximation, our technique iteratively extracts sources
along a given line of sight by fitting the LIM data to a set of spectral
templates. We demonstrate that the technique successfully extracts sources with
emission lines present at a few $\sigma$ above the noise level, taking into
account uncertainties in the source modeling and presence of continuum
foreground contamination and noise fluctuations. As an example, we consider a
TIME/CONCERTO-like survey targeting [C II] at the epoch of reionization, and
reliably reconstruct the 3D spatial distribution of the CO interlopers at
$0.5\lesssim z\lesssim 1.5$. We also demonstrate a successful de-confusion for
the SPHEREx mission in the near-infrared wavelengths. Potentially, the
reconstructed maps can be further cross-correlated with a (galaxy) tracer
population to estimate the total interloper power in the linear clustering
regime. This technique is a general framework to extract the phase-space

turbulent, high-pressure discs fed by gas that was accreted without ever being
strongly heated through a virial shock or feedback. A minority of GCs form
during mergers (12.6 +/- 0.6 per cent in major mergers, and 7.2 +/- 0.5 per

the GCs seen today by ejecting them from their natal, high density interstellar
medium (ISM), where proto-GCs are rapidly destroyed due to tidal shocks from
ISM substructure. This chaotic history of hierarchical galaxy assembly acts to
mix the spatial and kinematic distribution of GCs formed through different
channels, making it difficult to use observable GC properties to distinguish
GCs formed in mergers from ones formed by smooth accretion, and similarly GCs
formed in-situ from those formed ex-situ. These results suggest a simple
picture of GC formation, in which GCs are a natural outcome of normal star
formation in the typical, gas-rich galaxies that are the progenitors of

field as a medium, one naturally defines constitutive relations as in
relativistic non-linear electrodynamics. Requiring these constitutive relations
to be invariant under the $SO(2)$ electromagnetic duality rotations of
Maxwell's theory, defines 1-parameter, closed $\textit{duality orbits}$ in the

illustrate this technique by considering the duality orbits seeded by specific
EMS models wherein solitonic and black hole solutions are known. For dilatonic

graphs is analyzed in this work. For a system with intrinsic frequencies
sampled from a bimodal distribution we identify a variety of two cluster
patterns and study their stability. To this end, we decompose the description
of the cluster dynamics into two systems: one governing the (macro) dynamics of
the centers of mass of the two clusters and the second governing the (micro)
dynamics of individual oscillators inside each cluster. The former is a
low-dimensional ODE whereas the latter is a system of two coupled Vlasov PDEs.
Stability of the cluster dynamics depends on the stability of the
low-dimensional group motion and on coherence of the oscillators in each group.
We show that the loss of coherence in one of the clusters leads to the loss of
stability of a two-cluster state and to formation of chimera states. The
analysis of this paper can be generalized to cover states with more than two
clusters and to coupled systems on W-random graphs. Our results apply to a

Using the body as a communication medium (similar to a 'wire') allows for the

available process knowledge. This work proposes a unified framework for
process-driven multi-variate change point detection (PD-CPD) by combining
change point detection models with machine learning and process-driven
simulation modeling. The PD-CPD, after initializing with DD-CPD's change
point(s), uses simulation models to generate system level outputs as
time-series data streams which are then used to train neural network models to
predict system characteristics and change points. The accuracy of the
predictive models measures the likelihood that the actual process data conforms
to the simulated change points in system characteristics. PD-CPD iteratively
optimizes change points by repeating simulation and predictive model building
steps until the set of change point(s) with the maximum likelihood is
identified. Using an emergency department case study, we show that PD-CPD
significantly improves change point detection accuracy over DD-CPD estimates
and is able to detect actual change points.

  Ordered and parenthesized summations fall into equivalence classes. We
describe these classes, and the parenthetic forms summations in these classes

As a byproduct, our EFT also allows one to construct the exact solution,
including oscillatory behavior, which is often difficult to achieve from the
exact equations. (ii) An effective (imperfect) fluid description, with which we
demonstrate that, for a perturbed Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker

a free theory with no tree-level self-interactions. (b) The sound speed of
small fluctuations is also nonzero (and positive), reproducing already known
leading-order results, correcting a subdominant term, and identifying a new
contribution that had been omitted in previous analyses. (c) The fluctuations
experience a negative effective bulk viscosity. The positive sound speed and
the negative bulk viscosity act in favor of and against the growth of
overdensities, respectively. The net effect may be considered a smoking gun for

asymptotic giant branch (AGB) companion, which is now a white dwarf (WD). Ba
and CH stars can be found in the main-sequence (MS), the sub-giant, and the
giant phase, while extrinsic S-type stars populate the giant branches only. As
these polluted stars evolve, they might be involved in a second phase of
interaction with their now white dwarf companion. In this paper, we consider
systems composed of a main-sequence Ba star and a WD companion when the former
evolves along the Red Giant Branch (RGB). We want to determine if the orbital
properties of the known population of Ba, CH, and S giants can be inferred from
the evolution of their suspected dwarf progenitors. For this purpose, we use
the BINSTAR binary evolution code and model MS+WD binary systems, considering
different binary interaction mechanisms, such as a tidally-enhanced wind
mass-loss and a reduced circularisation efficiency. To explore their impact on
the second RGB ascent, we compare the modelled orbits with the observed period
and eccentricity distributions of Ba and related giants. We show that,
independently of the considered mechanism, there is a strong period cut off
below which core-He burning stars should not be found in binary systems with a
WD companion. This limit is shorter for more massive RGB stars and for more
metal-poor systems. However, we still find a few low-mass short-period giant
systems that are difficult to explain with our models as well as two systems

from giant stars. The mechanism behind flaring is supposed to be the magnetic
reconnection, which is closely related to magnetic activity including
starspots. However, it is poorly understood, how the underlying magnetic dynamo
works and how the flare activity is related to the stellar properties which
eventually control the dynamo action. We analyse the flaring activity of KIC
2852961, a late-type giant star, in order to understand how the flare
statistics are related to that of other stars with flares and superflares and
what the role of the observed stellar properties in generating flares is. We
search for flares in the full Kepler dataset of the star by an automated
technique together with visual inspection. We set a final list of 59 verified
flares during the observing term. We calculate flare energies for the sample
and perform a statistical analysis. The stellar properties of KIC 2852961 are
revised and a more consistent set of parameters are proposed. The cumulative
flare energy distribution can be characterized by a broken power-law, i.e. on
the log-log representation the distribution function is fitted by two linear
functions with different slopes, depending on the energy range fitted. We find
that the total flare energy integrated over a few rotation periods correlates
with the average amplitude of the rotational modulation due to starspots.
Flares and superflares seem to be the result of the same physical mechanism at
different energetic levels, also implying that late-type stars in the main
sequence and flaring giant stars have the same underlying physical process for
emitting flares. There might be a scaling effect behind generating flares and
superflares in the sense that the higher the magnetic activity the higher the
overall magnetic energy released by flares and/or superflares.

high CIII] equivalent widths that can only be reproduced by starburst ages as

strength $B_\lambda$ ranging from $0.05$ to $0.50\,\textrm{nG}$ and magnetic
energy spectrum slopes $n_B$ from $-2.9$ to $-2.1$. Strong magnetic fields

deal with this, we also provide some flags and parameters that can be used by

339,601 of our sources with Simbad and AAVSO databases, which provide us with

a unique resource to study the corresponding near-IR variability of known

generative model for partial label learning (MGPLL), which tackles the problem
by learning both a label level adversarial generator and a feature level
adversarial generator under a bi-directional mapping framework between the
label vectors and the data samples. Specifically, MGPLL uses a conditional
noise label generation network to model the non-random noise labels and perform
label denoising, and uses a multi-class predictor to map the training instances
to the denoised label vectors, while a conditional data feature generator is
used to form an inverse mapping from the denoised label vectors to data
samples. Both the noise label generator and the data feature generator are
learned in an adversarial manner to match the observed candidate labels and
data features respectively. Extensive experiments are conducted on synthesized
and real-world partial label datasets. The proposed approach demonstrates the
state-of-the-art performance for partial label learning.

quantum-dot-based qubits, increasing the resonator impedance is desirable as it
enhances the coupling to the typically small charge dipole moment of these

vicinity of a resonator inadvertently lead to a parasitic port through which
microwave photons can leak, thereby reducing the quality factor of the
resonator. This is particularly the case for high-impedance resonators, as the
ratio of their total capacitance over the parasitic port capacitance is
smaller, leading to larger microwave leakage than for 50-$\Omega$ resonators.
Here, we introduce an implementation of on-chip filters to suppress the
microwave leakage. The filters comprise a high-kinetic-inductance nanowire
inductor and a thin-film capacitor. The filter has a small footprint and can be
placed close to the resonator, confining microwaves to a small area of the
chip. The inductance and capacitance of the filter elements can be varied over
a wider range of values than their typical spiral inductor and interdigitated
capacitor counterparts. We demonstrate that the total linewidth of a 6.4 GHz

the Dirac mass term of the neutrinos. In the case that neutrinos are Dirac
particles, the lowest-order prediction of this construction is then one
massless neutrino and two degenerate massive neutrinos. Higher-dimensional
operators suppressed by the Planck scale perturb this spectrum, allowing a good
fit to the observed neutrino mass matrix. A firm prediction of this
construction is an inverted neutrino mass spectrum with the lightest neutrino
hierarchically lighter than the other two, so that the sum of neutrino masses
lies close to the lower bound for an inverted hierarchy. In the alternate case
that neutrinos are Majorana particles, the mass spectrum can be either normal
or inverted. However, the lightest neutrino is once again hierarchically
lighter than the other two, so that the sum of neutrino masses is predicted to
lie close to the corresponding lower bound for the normal or inverted

exchanged across stakeholders. Concerns about data security and tampering using
traditional data exchange approaches obstruct the construction of a reliable
marketplace for digital assets. The emerging Distributed Ledger Technology
(DLT), represented by blockchain, provides a novel solution for this purpose
owing to its unique advantages such as tamper-resistant and decentralization.
In this paper, we integrate MBSE approaches with DLT aiming to create a
decentralized marketplace to facilitate the exchange of digital engineering
assets (DEAs). We first define DEAs from perspectives of digital engineering
objects, development processes and system architectures. Based on this
definition, the Graph-Object-Property-Point-Role-Relationship (GOPPRR) approach
is used to formalize the DEAs. Then we propose a framework of a decentralized
DEAs marketplace and specify the requirements, based on which we select a
Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) structured DLT solution. As a proof-of-concept, a
prototype of the proposed DEAs marketplace is developed and a case study is
conducted to verify its feasibility. The experiment results demonstrate that
the proposed marketplace facilitates free DEAs exchange with a high level of
security, efficiency and decentralization.

graphs, that play a prominent role in the characterization of the tetravalent
graphs admitting an arc-transitive group of automorphisms with a normal

half-arc-transitive group of automorphisms. Quite recently, Poto\v cnik and
Wilson introduced the family of CPM graphs, which are generalizations of the
Gardiner-Praeger graphs. Most of these graphs are arc-transitive, but some of
them are half-arc-transitive. In fact, at least up to order $1000$, each
tetravalent half-arc-transitive loosely-attached graph of odd radius having
vertex-stabilizers of order greater than $2$ is isomorphic to a CPM graph.

property multiplicity. The stack implementation is wait-free, while the queue
implementation is non-blocking. Interval-linearizability is used to describe a
queue with multiplicity, with the additional relaxation that a dequeue
operation can return weak-empty, which means that the queue might be empty. We
present a read/write wait-free interval-linearizable algorithm of a concurrent
queue. As far as we know, this work is the first that provides formalizations
of the notions of multiplicity and weak-emptiness, which can be implemented on
top of read/write registers only.

Networks suffer from the problem of domain shift - severe performance
degradation when they are tested on data (target) obtained in a setting
different from that of the training (source). The change in the target data
might be caused by factors such as differences in camera/microscope types,
lenses, lighting-conditions etc. This problem can potentially be solved using
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques albeit standard algorithms
presuppose the existence of a sufficient amount of unlabelled target data which
is not always the case with medical images. In this paper, we propose a method
for UDA that is devoid of the need for target data. Given a test image from the
target data, we obtain its 'closest-clone' from the source data that is used as
a proxy in the classifier. We prove the existence of such a clone given that
infinite number of data points can be sampled from the source distribution. We
propose a method in which a latent-variable generative model based on
variational inference is used to simultaneously sample and find the
'closest-clone' from the source distribution through an optimization procedure
in the latent space. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method over
several SOTA UDA methods for WBC classification on datasets captured using
different imaging modalities under multiple settings.

possible non-linear inequality relating entropy and the Dirichlet form (i.e.,
$p$-NLSI, $p\ge1$). As an example, we show $\alpha_1 = 1+\frac{1+o(1)}{\log

  By integrating the $1$-NLSI we obtain the new strong data processing
inequality (SDPI), which in turn allows us to improve results of Mossel and
Peres on reconstruction thresholds for Potts models on trees. A special case is
the problem of reconstructing color of the root of a $k$-colored tree given
knowledge of colors of all the leaves. We show that to have a non-trivial
reconstruction probability the branching number of the tree should be at least
$$\frac{\log k}{\log k - \log(k-1)} = (1-o(1))k\log k.$$ This recovers previous
results (of Sly and Bhatnagar et al.) in (slightly) more generality, but more
importantly avoids the need for any coloring-specialized arguments. Similarly,
we improve the state-of-the-art on the weak recovery threshold for the
stochastic block model with $k$ balanced groups, for all $k\ge 3$. To further
show the power of our method, we prove optimal non-reconstruction results for a

spectroscopic observations of >400 Galactic O-type stars gathered by the IACOB

diagrams. We evaluated the completeness of our sample of stars, observational
biases using information from the Galactic O star catalog (GOSC), systematics
of our methodology, and compare with other recent studies using smaller samples
of Galactic O-type stars. We base our discussion on the spectroscopic HR
diagram to avoid the use of uncertain distances. We performed a detailed study
of the young cluster Trumpler-14 as an example of how Gaia cluster distances
can help to construct the associated classical HR diagram. The apparent lack of
massive O-type stars near the ZAMS with masses between 30 and 70 Msol persist
even when spectroscopic results from a large, non-biased sample of stars are
used. We do not find correlation between the dearth of stars and observational
biases, limitations of our methodology, or the use of spectroscopic HR diagram
instead of the classical one. Investigating the efficiency of mass accretion
during the formation process we conclude that an adjustment of the accretion
rate towards lower values could reconcile the hotter boundary of detected
O-type stars and the theoretical birthline. Last, we discuss that the presence
of a small sample of O2-O3.5 stars found closer to the ZAMS might be explained

10^12 and Prandtl number from 10 to 50. Under the idealized condition of
spherically-shaped particles with small Reynolds number, two limiting
behaviours exist for the settling velocity. On the one hand, Stokes' law
applies to particles with small but finite response time, leading to a constant
settling rate. On the other hand, particles with a vanishing response time are
expected to settle at an exponential rate. Based on our simulations, we present
a new physical model that bridges the gap between the above limiting behaviours
by describing the sedimentation of inertial particles as a random process with
two key components: i) the transport of particles from vigorously convecting
regions into sluggish, low-velocity ""piles"" that naturally develop at the
horizontal boundaries of the system, and ii) the probability that particles
escape such low-velocity regions without settling at their base. In addition,
we identify four distinct settling regimes and analyze the horizontal
distribution of sedimented particles. For two of these regimes settling is
particularly slow and the distribution is strongly non-uniform, with dense
particles being deposited preferentially below major clusters of upwellings.

that various robust PCA variants were proposed in the literature. A recent
model, called REAPER, aims to find the principal components by solving a convex
optimization problem. Usually the number of principal components must be
determined in advance and the minimization is performed over symmetric positive
semi-definite matrices having the size of the data, although the number of
principal components is substantially smaller. This prohibits its use if the
dimension of the data is large which is often the case in image processing.
  In this paper, we propose a regularized version of REAPER which enforces the
sparsity of the number of principal components by penalizing the nuclear norm
of the corresponding orthogonal projector. This has the advantage that only an
upper bound on the number of principal components is required. Our second
contribution is a matrix-free algorithm to find a minimizer of the regularized
REAPER which is also suited for high dimensional data. The algorithm couples a
primal-dual minimization approach with a thick-restarted Lanczos process. As a
side result, we discuss the topic of the bias in robust PCA. Numerical examples
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm.

spin-orbit interaction and THz radiation can lead to inversion of the spin

beating patterns in the autocorrelation function due to interference of the
photo-modulated quantum states. We also calculate the transverse photo-assisted
conductivity in the linear response regime using Kubo formalism and analyze the
impact of the radiation field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction. In the static

the impact of cooperative communication on the performance of cache-enabled D2D

realistic description of the network performance. In this regard, this paper
develops a novel mathematical model, based on stochastic geometry and an
optimization framework for cache-assisted coordinated multi-point (CoMP)
transmissions with clustered devices. Devices are spatially distributed into
disjoint clusters and are assumed to have a surplus memory to cache files from
a known library, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Desired

from neighboring devices or, as a last resort, from the network. For this

is then defined as the content placement scheme that maximizes the offloading
gain. For a tractable optimization framework, we pursue two separate approaches
to obtain a lower bound and a provably accurate approximation of the offloading
gain, which allows us to obtain optimized caching strategies.

We describe two approaches. One is generalization of the method of heat

one-dimensional integral. We demonstrate that computationally our method is
more efficient than both the backward and forward finite difference methods
while providing better accuracy and stability. Also, it is shown that both

accurate results at small maturities, and the other one - at high maturities.

star-sampled nearest neighbor technique to probe the star-gas surface density
correlations at the scale of a few parsecs, we find that the stellar mass
surface density varies as a power-law of the gas mass surface density, with a
power-law index of $\sim$2 in all the clouds. The consistent power-law index
implies that star formation efficiency is directly correlated with gas column
density, and no gas column density threshold for star formation is observed. We
compare the observed correlations with the predictions from an analytical model

boundary conditions at the vertices most of which define non-self-adjoint

367(4):2921--2957, 2015] a notion of regularity of boundary conditions by means
of the Cayley transform of the parametrizing matrices has been proposed. The
main point presented here is that not only the existence of this Cayley
transform is essential for basic spectral properties, but also its poles and
its asymptotic behaviour. It is shown that these poles and asymptotics can be
characterized using the quasi-Weierstrass normal form which exposes some
""hidden"" symmetries of the system. Thereby, one can analyse not only the
spectral theory of these mostly non-self-adjoint Laplacians, but also the
well-posedness of the time-dependent heat-, wave- and Schr\""odinger equations
on finite metric graphs as initial-boundary value problems. In particular, the
generators of $C_0$- and analytic semigroups and $C_0$-cosine operator
functions can be characterized. On star-shaped graphs a characterization of
generators of bounded $C_0$-groups and thus of operators similar to
self-adjoint ones is obtained.

work well for English and and other widely-used languages are ""language

common approach is to treat morphologically-distinct variants of a common root

morphological inflections per root, and that the majority will appear in a
large enough corpus, so that the model can adequately learn statistics about
each form. Approaches like stemming, lemmatization, or subword segmentation are
often used when either of those assumptions do not hold, particularly in the
case of synthetic languages like Spanish or Russian that have more inflection
than English.
  In the literature, languages like Finnish or Turkish are held up as extreme
examples of complexity that challenge common modelling assumptions. Yet, when
considering all of the world's languages, Finnish and Turkish are closer to the
average case. When we consider polysynthetic languages (those at the extreme of
morphological complexity), approaches like stemming, lemmatization, or subword
modelling may not suffice. These languages have very high numbers of hapax
legomena, showing the need for appropriate morphological handling of words,
without which it is not possible for a model to capture enough word statistics.

researchers created large datasets of paired utterances and their meaning
representations. However, the creation of such datasets is an arduous task and
they mostly consist of simple meaning representations composed of slot and

we present the novel task of Schema-Guided Natural Language Generation

this range, a more modest (<2X) improvement over the previous
microcalorimeters. Beyond this energy range NETS can operate with various

learn the AoD statistics and the CS matrix. Numerical results show that the CS

$\beta$-equilibrium, i. e. matter in neutron stars. It has been also
demonstrated that pion condensation is inevitable phenomenon in dense quark
matter with chiral imbalance if there is non-zero chiral imbalance in two
forms, chiral and chiral isospin one. It seems that in this case pion
condensation phase can be hardly avoided by any physical constraint on isopin
imbalance and that this conclusion can be probably generalized from neutron
star matter to the matter produced in heavy ion collisions or in neutron star
mergers. The chiral limit and the physical piont (physical pion mass) has been
considered and it was shown that the appearance of pion condensation is not
much affected by the consideration of non-zero current quark mass.

associated with key synoptic-scale features--including southerly Great Plains

analyzes spatiotemporal distributions of both the environmental parameters and
synoptic-scale features in ERA5 reanalysis and in Community Atmosphere Model
version 6 (CAM6) during 1980--2014 over North America. Compared to radiosondes,
ERA5 successfully reproduces SLS environments, with strong spatiotemporal
correlations and low biases, especially over the Great Plains. Both ERA5 and
CAM6 reproduce the climatology of SLS environments over the central United
States as well as its strong seasonal and diurnal cycles. ERA5 and CAM6 also
reproduce the climatological occurrence of the synoptic-scale features, with
the distribution pattern similar to that of SLS environments. Compared to ERA5,
CAM6 exhibits a high bias in Convective Available Potential Energy over the
eastern United States primarily due to a high bias in surface moisture, and to
a lesser extent, storm-relative helicity due to enhanced low-level winds.
Composite analysis indicates consistent synoptic anomaly patterns favorable for
significant SLS environments over much of the eastern half of the United States
in both ERA5 and CAM6, though the pattern differs for the southeastern United
States. Overall, results indicate that both ERA5 and CAM6 are capable of
reproducing SLS environments as well as the synoptic-scale features and
transient events that generate them.

possibly white noise, symmetric pulse generates small error for small energy

generate less diverse (i.e. biased towards dominant features) samples. To
address this, we propose a regularization scheme for VAEs, which we show
substantially addresses the feature imbalance problem. We also introduce a

proposed as a novel 3D motion representation. With 3D space voxelization, the
key idea of 3DV is to encode 3D motion information within depth video into a
regular voxel set (i.e., 3DV) compactly, via temporal rank pooling. Each
available 3DV voxel intrinsically involves 3D spatial and motion feature
jointly. 3DV is then abstracted as a point set and input into PointNet++ for 3D
action recognition, in the end-to-end learning way. The intuition for
transferring 3DV into the point set form is that, PointNet++ is lightweight and
effective for deep feature learning towards point set. Since 3DV may lose
appearance clue, a multi-stream 3D action recognition manner is also proposed
to learn motion and appearance feature jointly. To extract richer temporal
order information of actions, we also divide the depth video into temporal
splits and encode this procedure in 3DV integrally. The extensive experiments
on 4 well-established benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
proposition. Impressively, we acquire the accuracy of 82.4% and 93.5% on NTU

given covariates Z, the recently introduced model-X (MX) framework has been the
subject of active methodological research, especially in the context of MX
knockoffs and their successful application to genome-wide association studies.
In this paper, we study the power of MX CI tests, yielding quantitative
insights into the role of machine learning and providing evidence in favor of
using likelihood-based statistics in practice. Focusing on the conditional
randomization test (CRT), we find that its conditional mode of inference allows
us to reformulate it as testing a point null hypothesis involving the
conditional distribution of X. The Neyman-Pearson lemma then implies that a
likelihood-based statistic yields the most powerful CRT against a point
alternative. We also obtain a related optimality result for MX knockoffs.
Switching to an asymptotic framework with arbitrarily growing covariate
dimension, we derive an expression for the limiting power of the CRT against
local semiparametric alternatives in terms of the prediction error of the
machine learning algorithm on which its test statistic is based. Finally, we
exhibit a resampling-free test with uniform asymptotic Type-I error control
under the assumption that only the first two moments of X given Z are known, a
significant relaxation of the MX assumption.

method for human emotion recognition from a single RGB image. We construct a
large-scale dataset of facial videos (\textbf{FaceVid}), rich in facial
dynamics, identities, expressions, appearance and 3D pose variations. We use
this dataset to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network for estimating
expression parameters of a 3D Morphable Model and combine it with an effective
back-end emotion classifier. Our proposed framework runs at 50 frames per
second and is capable of robustly estimating parameters of 3D expression
variation and accurately recognizing facial expressions from in-the-wild
images. We present extensive experimental evaluation that shows that the
proposed method outperforms the compared techniques in estimating the 3D
expression parameters and achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognising
the basic emotions from facial images, as well as recognising stress from
facial videos. %compared to the current state of the art in emotion recognition

non-research purposes, such as electronic health records data (EHR). EHR data
and other large databases can be prone to measurement error in key exposures,
and unadjusted analyses of error-prone data can bias study results. Validating
a subset of records is a cost-effective way of gaining information on the error
structure, which in turn can be used to adjust analyses for this error and
improve inference. We extend the mean score method for the two-phase analysis
of discrete-time survival models, which uses the unvalidated covariates as
auxiliary variables that act as surrogates for the unobserved true exposures.
This method relies on a two-phase sampling design and an estimation approach
that preserves the consistency of complete case regression parameter estimates
in the validated subset, with increased precision leveraged from the auxiliary
data. Furthermore, we develop optimal sampling strategies which minimize the
variance of the mean score estimator for a target exposure under a fixed cost
constraint. We consider the setting where an internal pilot is necessary for
the optimal design so that the phase two sample is split into a pilot and an
adaptive optimal sample. Through simulations and data example, we evaluate
efficiency gains of the mean score estimator using the derived optimal
validation design compared to balanced and simple random sampling for the phase
two sample. We also empirically explore efficiency gains that the proposed
discrete optimal design can provide for the Cox proportional hazards model in
the setting of a continuous-time survival outcome.

the quasi-periodic optical outbursts observed in OJ287 is investigated. The
optical light-curves of the December/2015 outburst are also simulated in terms
of the precessing jet nozzle model previously proposed. The polarization
behavior of three primary quasi-periodic optical outbursts peaking in 1983.0,
2007.8 and 2015.8 are analyzed in order to understand the nature of their
optical radiation. A two-component model has been applied,showing that the
variations in flux density, polarization degree and polarization position angle
can be consistently interpreted with two polarized components: one
steady-component with constant polarization and one burst-component with
varying polarization (e.g., relativistic shock propagating along the jet-beam
axis). The flux light curves of the December/2015 outburst (including its first
flare and second flare) are well model-simulated in terms of 14 elementary
synchrotron sub-flares, each having a symmetric profile. The model simulations
of polarization behavior for the three major outbursts (in 1983.0, 2007.8 and
2015.8) demonstrate that they all exhibit rapid and large rotations in
polarization position angle, implying that they are synchrotron flares produced
in the jet. Combining with the results previously obtained for interpreting the
optical light curves in terms of lighthouse effect for both quasi-periodic and
non-periodic outbursts, we suggest that relativistic jet models may be the most
appropriate models for understanding the nature of the optical flaring
radiation in blazar OJ287: its optical outbursts may comprise a number of
blended ""elementary synchrotron flares"" , each produced by the helical motion
of individual superluminal optical knots via lighhouse effect.

novel bi-clustering method by involving here the theory of Granular Computing.
In the proposed scheme, the gene data matrix, considered as a group of time
series, is transformed into a series of ordered information granules. With the
information granules we build a characteristic matrix of the gene data to
capture the fluctuation trend of the expression value between consecutive
conditions to mine the ideal bi-clusters. The experimental results are in
agreement with the theoretical analysis, and show the excellent performance of

obtained at high spatial resolution from the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph
(FISS) grating spectrograph at the Big Bear Solar Observatory and from the
Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer (IBIS) instrument at the Dunn Solar
Telescope. The method robustly deconvolves wide spectral transmission profiles
for fields of view sampling a variety of solar structures (granulation, plage
and pores) with a photometrical precision of less than 1%. The results and
fidelity of the method are tested on data from IBIS obtained using several
different spectral resolution modes.
  The method, based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is extremely fast,
performing about $10^5$ deconvolutions per second on a CPU and $10^6$
deconvolutions per second on NVIDIA TITAN RTX GPU for a spectrum with 40
wavelength samples. This approach is applicable for deconvolving large amounts
of data from instruments with wide spectral transmission profiles, such as the
Visible Tunable Filter (VTF) on the DKI Solar Telescope (DKIST). We also
investigate its application to future instruments by recovering spectral line
profiles obtained with a theoretical multi-peaked spectral transmission
profile.
  We further discuss the limitations of this deconvolutional approach through
the analysis of the dimensionality of the original and multiplexed data.

stochastic drift and/or stochastic local volatility. First, we handle a case in
which the drift is given as difference of two stochastic short rates. Such a
setting is natural in foreign exchange context where the short rates correspond
to the short rates of the two currencies, equity single-currency context with
stochastic dividend yield, or commodity context with stochastic convenience
yield. We present the formula both in a call surface formulation as well as
total implied variance formulation where the latter avoids calendar spread
arbitrage by construction. We provide derivations for the case where both short
rates are given as single factor processes and present the limits for a single
stochastic rate or all deterministic short rates. The limits agree with
published results. Then we derive a formulation that allows a more general
stochastic drift and diffusion including one or more stochastic local
volatility terms. In the general setting, our derivation allows the computation
and calibration of the leverage function for stochastic local volatility
models. Despite being implicit, the generalized Dupire formulae can be used
numerically in a fixed-point iterative scheme.

well-studied, but it is largely under-explored for the rising decentralized

DSN as a usable service in a truly decentralized manner, the blockchain comes
in handy -- to record and verify audit trails in forms of proof of storage, and
based on that, to handle fair payments with necessary dispute resolution.
  Leaving the audit trails on the blockchain offers transparency and fairness,
yet it 1) sacrifices privacy, as they may leak information about the data under
audit, and 2) overwhelms on-chain resources, as they may be practically large
in size and expensive to verify. Prior auditing designs in centralized settings
are not directly applicable here. A handful of proposals targeting DSN cannot
satisfactorily address these issues either.
  We present an auditing solution that addresses on-chain privacy and
efficiency, from a synergy of homomorphic linear authenticators with polynomial

local graphs for structured entities and a global graph to capture the
interactions between structured entities. We observe that existing works on
structured entity interaction prediction cannot properly exploit the unique
graph of graphs model. In this paper, we propose a Graph of Graphs Neural
Network, namely GoGNN, which extracts the features in both structured entity
graphs and the entity interaction graph in a hierarchical way. We also propose
the dual-attention mechanism that enables the model to preserve the neighbor
importance in both levels of graphs. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets show that GoGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two
representative structured entity interaction prediction tasks:
chemical-chemical interaction prediction and drug-drug interaction prediction.

in the Orthogonality Thesis. Perhaps this difficulty comes from the way we are
addressing the problem of expressing objectives, values, and ends, using
representational cognitive methods. A solution to this problem would be the
dynamic cognitive approach proposed by Dreyfus, whose phenomenological
philosophy defends that the human experience of being-in-the-world cannot be
represented by the symbolic or connectionist cognitive methods. A possible
approach to this problem would be to use theoretical models such as SED

hence yield a value of the Hubble constant. Cool N-type carbon stars exhibit
redder near-infrared colours than oxygen-rich stars. Using Two Micron All Sky
Survey near-infrared photometry and the Gaia Data Release 2, we identify carbon
stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MC) and the Milky Way (MW). Carbon stars in the
MC appear as a distinct horizontal feature in the near-infrared ($(J-K_s)_0$,
$M_J$) colour-magnitude diagram. We build a colour selection ($1.4 < (J-K_s)_0
< 2$) and derive the luminosity function of the colour-selected carbon stars.
We find the median absolute magnitude and the dispersion, in the J band, for
the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud to be, respectively,
($\bar{M_J} = -6.284 \pm 0.004$, $\sigma = 0.352 \pm 0.005$) and ($\bar{M_J} =
-6.160 \pm 0.015$, $\sigma = 0.365 \pm 0.014$). The difference between the MC
may be explained by the lower metallicity of the Small Magellanic Cloud, but in
any case it provides limits on the type of galaxy whose distance can be
determined with this technique. To account for metallicity effects, we
developed a composite magnitude, named C, for which the error-weighted mean C
magnitude of both the MC are equal. Thanks to the next generation of telescopes
(JWST, ELT, TMT), carbon stars could be detected in MC-type galaxies at
distances out to $50$-$60$ Mpc. The final goal is to eventually try and improve
the measurement of the Hubble constant while exploring the current tensions

nonlinear embeddings in discriminant analysis with polynomial kernels and
Gaussian kernel by identifying the population-level discriminant function that

discriminant function, we solve a generalized eigenvalue problem with
between-class and within-class covariance operators. The polynomial
discriminants are shown to capture the class difference through the population
moments explicitly. For approximation of the Gaussian discriminant, we use a
particular representation of the Gaussian kernel by utilizing the exponential
generating function for Hermite polynomials. We also show that the Gaussian

In particular, we study the list homomorphism problem seeking a homomorphism of
an input signed graph $(G,\sigma)$, equipped with lists $L(v) \subseteq V(H), v
\in V(G)$, of allowed images, to a fixed target signed graph $(H,\pi)$. The
complexity of the similar homomorphism problem without lists (corresponding to
all lists being $L(v)=V(H)$) has been previously classified by Brewster and
Siggers, but the list version remains open and appears difficult. We illustrate
this difficulty by classifying the complexity of the problem when $H$ is a tree
(with possible loops). The tools we develop will be useful for classifications
of other classes of signed graphs, and in a future companion paper we will
illustrate this by using them to classify the complexity for certain
irreflexive signed graphs. The structure of the signed trees in the polynomial
cases is interesting, suggesting that the class of general signed graphs for
which the problems are polynomial may have nice structure, analogous to the
so-called bi-arc graphs (which characterized the polynomial cases of list
homomorphisms to unsigned graphs).

COVID-19 outbreak thus far, and the next question is when and how to relax
these restrictions. A sequential timing of relaxing restrictions across groups
is explored in order to identify policies that simultaneously reduce health
risks and economic stagnation relative to current policies. The goal will be to
mitigate health risks, particularly among the most fragile sub-populations,
while also managing the deleterious effect of restrictions on economic
activity. The results of this paper show that a properly constructed sequential
release of age-defined subgroups from strict social distancing protocols can
lead to lower overall fatality rates than the simultaneous release of all
individuals after a lockdown. The optimal release policy, in terms of
minimizing overall death rate, must be sequential in nature, and it is
important to properly time each step of the staggered release. This model
allows for testing of various timing choices for staggered release policies,
which can provide insights that may be helpful in the design, testing, and
planning of disease management policies for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and

to generate several speech samples in parallel at one step. Therefore, it can
significantly improve the efficiency of speech synthesis. The proposed model
with 4 sub-bands needs less than 1.6 GFLOPS for speech generation. In our

networks (DNNs). In this work, we study the detection of adversarial examples,
based on the assumption that the output and internal responses of one DNN model
for both adversarial and benign examples follow the generalized Gaussian
distribution (GGD), but with different parameters (i.e., shape factor, mean,
and variance). GGD is a general distribution family to cover many popular
distributions (e.g., Laplacian, Gaussian, or uniform). It is more likely to
approximate the intrinsic distributions of internal responses than any specific
distribution. Besides, since the shape factor is more robust to different
databases rather than the other two parameters, we propose to construct
discriminative features via the shape factor for adversarial detection,
employing the magnitude of Benford-Fourier coefficients (MBF), which can be
easily estimated using responses. Finally, a support vector machine is trained
as the adversarial detector through leveraging the MBF features. Extensive
experiments in terms of image classification demonstrate that the proposed
detector is much more effective and robust on detecting adversarial examples of
different crafting methods and different sources, compared to state-of-the-art
adversarial detection methods.

Zelevinsky introduced a new family of Hopf algebras which he called {\em

theory of the symmetric groups and of classical groups over finite fields. The
gist of this construction is to translate representation-theoretic operations
such as induction and restriction and their parabolic variants to algebra and
coalgebra operations such as multiplication and comultiplication. The Mackey
formula, for example, is then reincarnated as the Hopf axiom on the algebra
side. In this paper we take substantial steps to adapt these ideas for general
linear groups over compact discrete valuation rings. We construct an analogous
bi-algebra that contains a large PSH-algebra that extends Zelevinsky's algebra
for the case of general linear groups over finite fields. We prove several base

parameters, the aspect ratio and the distance between two disks, enhances the Q
factor by several times compared to the case of the former case of
one-parametric avoided crossing in the isolated disk. Therefore successive
two-parametric avoided crossing gives multiplicative gain in the Q-factor as it
was expected. However if for the single disk its orthogonal resonant modes do
not undergo avoided crossing, a presence of the second disk gives removes this
restriction and gives rise to the avoided crossing of these modes that enhances
the $Q$ factor by two orders in magnitude compared to the case of single disk.

demonstrates conversion from lower to higher orders of the multipole modes
similar to that as shown by Chen {\it et al} [Laser&PhotonicsReviews 13,

sleep-wake cycling in neonates in intensive care. Trace alternant (TA)-a
characteristic pattern of EEG activity during quiet sleep in term neonates-is
defined by alternating periods of short-duration, high-voltage activity
(bursts) separated by lower-voltage activity (inter-bursts). This study
presents a novel approach for detecting TA activity by first detecting the
inter-bursts and then processing the temporal map of the bursts and
inter-bursts. EEG recordings from 72 healthy term neonates were used to develop
and evaluate performance of 1) an inter-burst detection method which is then
used for 2) detection of TA activity. First, multiple amplitude and spectral
features were combined using a support vector machine (SVM) to classify bursts
from inter-bursts within TA activity, resulting in a median area under the
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.93
to 0.98). Second, post-processing of the continuous SVM output, the confidence
score, was used to produce a TA envelope. This envelope was used to detect TA
activity within the continuous EEG with a median AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80 to
0.88). These results validate how an inter-burst detection approach combined
with post processing can be used to classify TA activity. Detecting the
presence or absence of TA will help quantify disruption of the clinically
important sleep-wake cycle.

tuning of $\sigma_{SH}$ and $\sigma_{c}$ by thermal means can enhance the spin

merit of charge-to-spin current interconversion of spin-orbit torque devices.

obtain analogous results for phases that are spontaneously chiral, and present
evidence for an extension of our results that applies to both chiral and
non-chiral topological matter.

$\rho_B$ is found to be maximum and is given by $\rho_B^{max} = 0.65/\beta$

inflation, is found to be $B (= B_{max}) \simeq \sqrt{\frac{0.4

to misleading and imprecise results. We introduce a technique, called
spike-triggered descent (STD), which can be used alone or in conjunction with
STA to increase precision and yield success in scenarios where STA fails. STD
works by simulating a model neuron that learns to reproduce the observed spike
train. Learning is achieved via parameter optimization that relies on a metric

This technique can precisely learn higher order kernels using limited data.

and it is affecting the whole society. The current gold standard test for
screening COVID-19 patients is the polymerase chain reaction test. However, the
COVID-19 test kits are not widely available and time-consuming. Thus, as an
alternative, chest X-rays are being considered for quick screening. Since the
presentation of COVID-19 in chest X-rays is varied in features and
specialization in reading COVID-19 chest X-rays are required thus limiting its
use for diagnosis. To address this challenge of reading chest X-rays by
radiologists quickly, we present a multi-channel transfer learning model based
on ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19 chest X-ray.
Three ResNet-based models (Models a, b, and c) were retrained using Dataset_A
(1579 normal and 4429 diseased), Dataset_B (4245 pneumonia and 1763
non-pneumonia), and Dataset_C (184 COVID-19 and 5824 Non-COVID19),
respectively, to classify (a) normal or diseased, (b) pneumonia or
non-pneumonia, and (c) COVID-19 or non-COVID19. Finally, these three models
were ensembled and fine-tuned using Dataset_D (1579 normal, 4245 pneumonia, and
184 COVID-19) to classify normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases. Our results
show that the ensemble model is more accurate than the single ResNet model,
which is also re-trained using Dataset_D as it extracts more relevant semantic
features for each class. Our approach provides a precision of 94 % and a recall
of 100%. Thus, our method could potentially help clinicians in screening
patients for COVID-19, thus facilitating immediate triaging and treatment for
better outcomes.

potential low-cost energy storage alternatives to Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)
due to the intrinsic safety and great abundance of sodium on Earth. For
developing competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large
capacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a
two-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is borophosphene, is proposed to be
a promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density
functional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and
diffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability
and electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It
is found that the borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb Na atom with binding
energy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid
ion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mAh/g
can be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported
in 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated,
implying a suitable voltage of the anode material. Metallic properties, tiny
surface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give
rise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability. These
advantages above suggest the borophosphene can be used as a Dirac anode
material for SIBs with excellent performances of large specific capacity,
high-rate capability, and favorable cyclability.

practical implementation is the large amount of resources required for
fault-tolerant quantum information processing. An important aspect is
implementing arbitrary unitary operators built from logical gates within the
quantum error correction code. A synthesis algorithm can be used to approximate
any unitary gate up to arbitrary precision by assembling sequences of logical
gates chosen from a small set of universal gates that are fault-tolerantly
performable while encoded in a quantum error-correction code. However, current
procedures do not yet support individual assignment of base gate costs and many
do not support extended sets of universal base gates. We analysed cost-optimal
sequences using an exhaustive search based on Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm
for the canonical Clifford+$T$ set of base gates and compared them to when
additionally including $Z$-rotations from higher orders of the Clifford
hierarchy. Two approaches of assigning base gate costs were used. First, costs
were reduced to $T$-counts by recursively applying a $Z$-rotation catalyst
circuit. Second, costs were assigned as the average numbers of raw (i.e.
physical level) magic states required to directly distil and implement the
gates fault-tolerantly. We found that the average sequence cost decreases by up
to $54\pm 3\%$ when using the $Z$-rotation catalyst circuit approach and by up
to $33\pm 2 \%$ when using the magic state distillation approach. In addition,
we investigated observed limitations of certain assignments of base gate costs
by developing an analytic model to estimate the proportion of sets of
$Z$-rotation gates from higher orders of the Clifford hierarchy that are found
within sequences approximating random target gates.

Investigating infinitely repeated games is crucial since finitely repeated

concept of general repeated quantum games and show the Quantum Folk Theorem,
which claims that by iterating a game one can find an equilibrium strategy of
the game and receive reward that is not obtained by a Nash equilibrium of the

repeated quantum prisoner's dilemma and repeated classical prisoner's dilemma
is that the classical Pareto optimal solution is not always an equilibrium of

cannot be an equilibrium of the repeated quantum game. In addition we present

weighted (unbounded) function. We establish sharp criteria for compactness and
non-compactness of the associated Markovian semigroup $(P_t)_{t\ge0}$ on
$L^2(\R^d;\d x)$. In particular, we prove that if $J(x,\d
y)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}\,\d y$ with $\alpha\in (0,2)$, and $$W(x,y)= \begin{cases}

second stage, the audio modality combines visual modality again to better
understand the speech by a MSR sub-network, further improving the recognition

convolution (P3D)-based visual front-end to extract more discriminative

temporal convolutional network (TCN), which is more suitable for the temporal

fundus images increase uncertainty in clinical observation and lead to the risk

structure of the retina, natural image enhancement methods cannot be utilized
directly to address this. In this paper, we first analyze the ophthalmoscope
imaging system and simulate a reliable degradation of major inferior-quality
factors, including uneven illumination, image blurring, and artifacts. Then,
based on the degradation model, a clinically oriented fundus enhancement
network (cofe-Net) is proposed to suppress global degradation factors, while
simultaneously preserving anatomical retinal structures and pathological
characteristics for clinical observation and analysis. Experiments on both
synthetic and real images demonstrate that our algorithm effectively corrects
low-quality fundus images without losing retinal details. Moreover, we also
show that the fundus correction method can benefit medical image analysis
applications, e.g., retinal vessel segmentation and optic disc/cup detection.

either continuous or periodic impulsive releases. We show that a combination of
open-loop control with constant large releases and closed-loop nonlinear
control, i.e. when releases are adjusted according to the wild population size
estimates, leads to the best strategy in terms both of number of releases and
total quantity of sterile males to be released.Last but not least, we show that
SIT can be successful only if the residual fertility is less than a threshold
value that depends on the wild population biological parameters. However, even
for small values, the residual fertility induces the use of such large releases
that SIT alone is not always reasonable from a practical point of view and thus
requires to be combined with other control tools. We provide applications
against a mosquito species, \textit{Aedes albopictus}, and a fruit fly,
\textit{Bactrocera dorsalis}, and discuss the possibility of using SIT when
residual fertility, among the sterile males, can occur.

deoxy-myoglobin (deoxyMb) haem occurs in ca. 800 fs, and that it proceeds via
an intermediate (S = 1) spin state. The XES observables also show that upon NO
recombination to deoxyMb, the return to the planar MbNO ground state is an
electronic relaxation from HS to LS taking place in ca. 30 ps. Thus, the entire

nuclear breakup, interference between nuclear and Coulomb amplitudes, and
multistep breakup processes mainly due to strong continuum-continuum couplings
in the breakup of two-body projectiles on a heavy target at both intermediate

employed eikonal version of three-body continuum-discretized coupled-channels
(CDCC) reaction model. Our results for the breakup of $^{11}$Be and $^{17}$F on
$^{208}$Pb target at 100, 250, and 520 MeV/A, show the importance of nuclear
breakup contribution, and its significant role in the multistep processes. The
multistep effect on Coulomb breakup for core-neutron projectile was found to be
negligible, whereas it was important for core-proton projectile.
Coulomb-nuclear interference (CNI) effect was also found to be non-negligible.
Quantitatively, the multistep effects due to the nuclear breakup was found to
depend on the incident energy through the energy dependence of the core-target
and nucleon-target nuclear potentials. The nuclear breakup component, the CNI
effect, and the multistep breakup processes are all found to be non-negligible;
hence, the assumptions adopted in the VPT for the accurate description of
breakup cross sections are not valid.

eager to elaborate a correct proof and it turns out that this goal is highly
nontrivial, especially when considering final constraints. This paper is the
result of our reflections on this subject. Precisely we consider here a

a Caputo fractional derivative of order 0 < $\alpha$ $\le$ 1 and on a
Riemann-Liouville fractional integral of order $\beta$ > 0, the constraint set

of information (AoI) and total energy consumption is studied in this paper. It
is assumed that the status update information is obtained and transmitted at
fixed rate over a Rayleigh fading channel in a packet-based wireless
communication system. A maximum transmission round on each packet is enforced
to guarantee certain reliability of the update packets. Given fixed average
transmission power, the age-energy tradeoff can be formulated as a constrained
Markov decision process (CMDP) problem considering the sensing power
consumption as well. Employing the Lagrangian relaxation, the CMDP problem is
transformed into a Markov decision process (MDP) problem. An algorithm is
proposed to obtain the optimal power allocation policy. Through simulation
results, it is shown that both age and energy efficiency can be improved by the
proposed optimal policy compared with two benchmark schemes. Also, age can be
effectively reduced at the expense of higher energy cost, and more emphasis on
energy consumption leads to higher average age at the same energy efficiency.
Overall, the tradeoff between average age and energy efficiency is identified.

bipartitoned with the entanglement cut that covers the entire volume of

but can be determined from the entanglement von Neumann entropy ${\cal S}_{A}$

derived by minimizing the relative entropy for the reduced density matrix
operator of subsystem $A$ and the Gibbs state (i.e., thermodynamic density
matrix operator) of subsystem $A$ with respect to the coupling strength between
subsystems $A$ and $B$. Temperature ${\cal T}_{A}$ is essentially identical to
the thermodynamic temperature, for which the entropy and the internal energy
evaluated using the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics for the

thermal fluctuation in a subsystem. We also provide two simple but nontrivial

confined by surface is encountered in many engineering applications. For
example, in the shale gas production process, methane is extracted from
ultra-tight pores under high pressure so the gas is inhomogeneous and dense.
Currently, the complex non-equilibrium transport of inhomogeneous and dense
gases where gas surface interactions play a key role is commonly investigated
by molecular dynamics or on a continuum-assumption basis. Here, a tractable
kinetic model based on the generalized Enskog equation and the mean-field
theory is employed to couple the effects of the volume exclusion and the
long-range intermolecular attraction forces. The interactions between gas
molecules and confined surface are modelled by a 10-4-3 Lennard-Jones
potential, which can capture gas surface adsorption. The cross-sectional
density profiles of methane under different confinements are in good agreement
with the molecular dynamics results reported in the literature, and the
transport behaviors are validated by the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics.
The velocity of methane flow in shale matrix is plug-like due to its dense
characteristics in nanopores. The influence of pressure, temperature, pore size
and shale composition on density and velocity profiles is analyzed
quantitatively. Our results show that the Klinkenberg correction is not
applicable to model shale gas flow in the production process; the Navier-Stokes
model using the second-order slip boundary condition cannot produce the proper
velocity profiles, and consequently fails to predict the accurate flow rate in
nanopores. This study sheds new light on understanding the physics of
non-equilibrium dense gas flows in shale strata.

Brownian motions. In many instances, it is well known that the empirical

  This is a technical question related to how two smartphones reliably register
their mutual proximity. Here, we examine in detail the technical prerequisites
required for effective smartphone-based contact tracing. The underlying
mechanism that any contact tracing app relies on is called Neighbor Discovery
(ND), which involves smartphones transmitting and scanning for Bluetooth
signals to record their mutual presence whenever they are in close proximity.
The hardware support and the software protocols used for ND in smartphones,
however, were not designed for reliable contact tracing. In this paper, we
quantitatively evaluate how reliably can smartphones do contact tracing. Our
results point towards the design of a wearable solution for contact tracing
that can overcome the shortcomings of a smartphone-based solution to provide
more reliable and accurate contact tracing. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first study that quantifies, both, the suitability and also the
drawbacks of smartphone-based contact tracing. Further, our results can be used
to parameterize a ND protocol to maximize the reliability of any contact
tracing app that uses it.

for two immiscible fluid layers, in order to identify the effects of buoyancy
on interface breakup. We explore the parameter space spanned by the Weber

Rayleigh number $Ra=10^8$ and Prandtl number $Pr=1$. At low $We$, the interface
undulates due to plumes. When $We$ is larger than a critical value, the
interface eventually breaks up. Depending on $\Lambda$, two breakup types are
observed: The first type occurs at small $\Lambda \ll 1$ (e.g. air-water
systems) when local filament thicknesses exceed the Hinze length scale. The
second, strikingly different, type occurs at large $\Lambda$ with roughly $0.5

we use combination of analytical theory, based on path integration method, and
molecular dynamics simulations to study structural properties of complex
Gaussian polymers containing $f^c$ linear branches and $f^r$ closed loops
grafted to the central core. Using theory we determine the size measures such

estimates for the size ratio $R_g /R_H$ with its dependence on the

quantitative estimate of compactification (decrease of size measure) of such

merger rates, the stochastic background of unresolved coalescences, and
confront them with current data from the first two observational runs, also
including the recently discovered GW190412. We compute the best-fit values for
the parameters of the PBH mass distribution at formation that are compatible
with current GW data. In all cases, the maximum fraction of PBHs in dark matter
is constrained by these observations to be $f_{\text{PBH}}\approx {\rm
few}\times 10^{-3}$. We discuss the predictions of the PBH scenario that can be
directly tested as new data become available. In the most likely formation
scenarios where PBHs are born with negligible spin, the fact that at least one
of the components of GW190412 is moderately spinning is incompatible with a
primordial origin for this event, unless accretion or hierarchical mergers are
significant. In the absence of accretion, current non-GW constraints already
exclude that LIGO/Virgo events are all of primordial origin, whereas in the
presence of accretion the GW bounds on the PBH abundance are the most stringent
ones in the relevant mass range. A strong phase of accretion during the cosmic
history would favour mass ratios close to unity, and a redshift-dependent
correlation between high masses, high spins and nearly-equal mass binaries,

by the observer and the pulsar magnetic and rotation axes, the observed
bi-drifting in B1839-04 can be reproduced assuming a non-dipolar configuration
of the surface magnetic field. Acceptable solutions are found to either have
relatively weak $(\sim 10^{12} \,{\rm G})$ or strong $(\sim 10^{14} \,{\rm G})$
surface magnetic fields. Our single pulse modeling shows that a global electric
potential variation at the polar cap that leads to a solid-body-like rotation
of spark forming regions is favorable in reproducing the observed drift
characteristics. This variation of the potential additionally ensures that the
variability is identical in all pulse components resulting in the observed
phase locking of subpulses. Thorough and more general studies of pulsar
geometry show that a low ratio of impact factor to opening angle $(\beta /

that bi-drifting is visible when our line of sight crosses close to the

the loss of high-frequency information, which leads to the ill-posed problem of
the inverse upscaling procedure and poses great challenges for recovering
details from the downscaled low-resolution images. Simply upscaling with image
super-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance. In
this work, we propose to solve this problem by modeling the downscaling and
upscaling processes from a new perspective, i.e. an invertible bijective

upscaling. We develop an Invertible Rescaling Net (IRN) with deliberately
designed framework and objectives to produce visually-pleasing low-resolution

In this way, upscaling is made tractable by inversely passing a randomly-drawn

results demonstrate the significant improvement of our model over existing
methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of image
upscaling reconstruction from downscaled images.

organ? A growing leaf is an example of such a system: it increases its area by
orders of magnitude, maintaining a proper (usually flat) shape. How can this be
achieved without a central control unit? One would think that a combination of
uniform growth with viscoelastic rheology would allow that. Here we show that
that the exact opposite process is in action: the natural growth of the leaf
surface strongly fluctuates in time and position. By combining high resolution
measurements and multi-scale statistical analysis, we suggest a paradigm-change
in the way leaf growth is viewed. We measure the in-plane tissue growth of
Tobacco leaves in Lagrangian coordinates in 3D and study the statistics of
three scalar fields associated with the tensorial growth field: The growth
rate, its isotropy and directionality. We identify the governing time and
length scales of the fluctuations in the growth rate, and capture abundant
switching between local area swelling and shrinking, when measured in high
resolution. At lower spatio-temporal resolution the growth rate field becomes
smooth. In contrast, the anisotropy field increases over time. Finally, we find
significant differences between growth measured during day and night. The
growth at night is found to be more intermittent, with shorter correlation
lengths and no global directionality. Despite its fluctuative nature, growth
fields are not random, thus carry information about growth regulation. Indeed,
mechanical analysis shows that a growing leaf can stay flat only if the
measured fluctuations are regulated/correlated. Our measurements suggest that
the entire statistics of growth fields, and not just their means, should be
studied. In particular, the regulation of such fields and the link between
their characteristics and the global geometry of a leaf should be studied.

The model is based on two ordinary differential equations (ODE), for woody and
grass biomass. It is parameterized from literature and retains mathematical
tractability, since we restricted it to the main processes, notably tree-grass
asym-metric interactions (either facilitative or competitive) and the
grass-fire feedback. We used a fully qualitative analysis to derive all
possible long term dynamics and express them in a bifur-cation diagram in
relation to mean annual rainfall and fire frequency. We delineated domains of
monostability (forest, grassland, savanna), of bistability (e.g.
forest-grassland or forest-savanna) and even tristability. Notably, we
highlighted regions in which two savanna equilibria may be jointly stable
(possibly in addition to forest or grassland). We verified that common
knowledge about decreasing woody biomass with increasing fire frequency is
recovered for all levels of rainfall, contrary to previous attempts using
analogous ODE frameworks. Thus, this framework appears able to render more
realistic and diversified outcomes than often thought of. Our model can help
figure out the ongoing dynamics of savanna vegetation in large territories for

that biological molecules such as ratcheting/rotating enzymes (motor proteins),

two-dimensional (2D) tensor empirical wavelet transform (EWT) (Gilles 2013).
The idea is to decompose the instantaneous flow data, or its visualisation,
adaptively according to the averaged Fourier supports for the identification of
spatially localised structures. The resulting EWT modes stand for the
decomposed flows, and each accounts for part of the spectrum, illustrating
fluid physics with different scales superimposed in the original flow. With the
proposed method, decomposition of an instantaneous 3D flow becomes feasible
without resorting to its time series. Examples first focus on the interaction
between a jet plume and 2D wake, where only experimental visualisations are
available. The proposed method is capable of separating the jet/wake flows and
their instabilities. Then the decomposition is applied to an early stage
boundary layer transition, where direct numerical simulations provided a full
data-set. The tested inputs are the 3D flow data and its visualisation using
streamwise velocity & {\lambda}2 vortex identification criterion. With both
types of inputs, EWT modes robustly extract the streamwise-elongated streaks,
multiple secondary instabilities and helical vortex filaments. Results from
bi-global stability analysis justify the EWT modes that represent the streak
instabilities. In contrast to Proper Orthogonal Decomposition or Dynamic Modal
Decomposition that extract spatial modes according to energy or frequency, EWT

is difficult to find a group of significant landmarks for current fast
feature-based place recognition algorithms. This paper proposes a novel
approach where local observations are matched to a general tree map using the
Delaunay triangularization as the representation format. Instead of point cloud
based matching methods, we utilize a topology-based method. First, tree trunk
positions are registered at a prior run done by a forest harvester. Second, the
resulting map is Delaunay triangularized. Third, a local submap of the
autonomous robot is registered, triangularized and matched using triangular
similarity maximization to estimate the position of the robot. We test our
method on a dataset accumulated from a forestry site at Lieksa, Finland. A
total length of 2100\,m of harvester path was recorded by an industrial
harvester with a 3D laser scanner and a geolocation unit fixed to the frame.
Our experiments show a 12\,cm s.t.d. in the location accuracy and with
real-time data processing for speeds not exceeding 0.5\,m/s. The accuracy and

main classes: atmospheric, catchment and river system drivers. In this work, we
propose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best
relates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are
assumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in
time as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following
alternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different
durations, an agricultural land-use intensification index, and reservoir
construction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this
attribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one
of these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is
taken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to
spurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the
attribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates,
representing the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the
hydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The
Watanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving
alternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper
Austria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50
years. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme
precipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood
frequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales. Agricultural land-use
intensification rarely is the best covariate, and the reservoir index never is,
suggesting that catchment and river drivers are less important than atmospheric
ones.

comparison of the in- and out-of-transit GIANO-B observations we compute
high-resolution transmission spectra, on which we perform equivalent width
measurements and light-curves analyses to gauge the excess in-transit
absorption in the HeI triplet. We detect an absorption signal during all five
transits. The mean in-transit absorption depth amounts to 0.75+/-0.03%. We
detect night-to-night variations in the HeI absorption signal likely due to the
transit events occurring in presence of stellar surface inhomogeneities. We

relies on balanced gain and loss is introduced, comprising of magnetically
coupled split-ring resonators (SRRs). A particular topology that combines a
non-trivial (topological) dimer configuration with a trivial (non-topological)
dimer configuration which are separated by a central SRR with neither gain or
loss, is investigated. By focusing on the dynamical aspects of such a
topological ${\cal PT}$ metamaterial (PTMM), the existence of {\em
topologically protected interface states} which are localized at the central
SRR is demonstrated numerically. The solution of the corresponding {\em
quadratic eigenvalue problem} reveals that the protected state is actually a
robust eigenmode of the topological PTMM, whose eigenvalue is isolated in the
middle of the gap (mid-gap state) of the two-band frequency spectrum. Direct
numerical simulations have been further used to determine the robustness and
dynamic stability of these states in the parameter space of the {\em
dimerization strength} and the {\em gain-loss coefficient}.

thoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers

flight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning
Systems. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural
network model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air
traffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources,
including Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, Meteorological Aerodrome
Reports, and airline records. In this model, a spatial weighted layer is
designed to extract spatial dependences among network delay states. Then, a new
training procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced to
extract OD-specific spatial weights. Long short-term memory networks are used
to extract the temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally,
features from delays, weather, and flight schedules are fed into a fully
connected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular flight. The
proposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an
airline's real operations. Results show that our model can provide more
accurate flight time predictions than baseline methods, especially for flights

essential to be able to manipulate the amplitude as well as the phase of spin
waves. Several theoretical and recently also experimental works have shown that
the spin-wave phase can be manipulated by the transmission through a domain
wall (DW). Here, we study propagation of spin waves through a DW by means of
micro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy ($\mu$BLS). The acquired 2D
spin-wave intensity maps reveal that spin-wave transmission through a N\'eel DW
is influenced by a topologically enforced circular Bloch line in the DW center
and that the propagation regime depends on the spin-wave frequency. In the
first regime, two spin-wave beams propagating around the circular Bloch line
are formed, whereas in the second regime, spin waves propagate in a single
central beam through the circular Bloch line. Phase-resolved $\mu$BLS
measurements reveal a phase shift upon transmission through the domain wall for
both regimes. Micromagnetic modelling of the transmitted spin waves unveils a
distortion of their phase fronts which needs to be taken into account when
interpreting the measurements and designing potential devices. Moreover, we
show, by means of micromagnetic simulations, that an external magnetic field
can be used to move the circular Bloch line within the DW and to manipulate
spin-wave propagation.

subatomic Schwarzschild radii, produced in the early Universe, are expected to
have evaporated by the current cosmic age due to Hawking radiation. Based on
this assumption, a number of constraints on the abundance of ultralight PBHs
have been made. However, Hawking radiation has thus far not been verified
experimentally. It would, therefore, be of interest if constraints on
ultralight PBHs could be placed independent of the assumption of
Hawking-radiation. In this paper, we explore the possibility of probing these
PBHs, within a narrow mass range, using gravitational-wave (GW) data from the
two LIGO detectors. The idea is that large primordial curvature perturbations
that result in the formation of PBHs, would also generate GWs through
non-linear mode couplings. These induced GWs would produce a stochastic
background. Specifically, we focus our attention on PBHs of mass range $\sim
10^{13} - 10^{15}$g for which the induced stochastic GW background peak falls
in the sensitivity band of LIGO. We find that, for both narrow and broad
Gaussian PBH mass distributions, the corresponding GW background would be
detectable using presently available LIGO data, provided we neglect the
existing constraints on the abundance of PBHs, which are based on Hawking
radiation. Furthermore, we find that these stochastic backgrounds would be
detectable in LIGO's third observing run, even after considering the existing
constraints on PBH abundance. A non-detection should enable us to constrain the
amplitude of primordial curvature perturbations as well as the abundance of
ultralight PBHs. We estimate that by the end of the third observing run,
assuming non-detection, we should be able to place constraints that are orders
of magnitude better than currently existing ones.

been widely discussed using two-dimensional (2D) potential energy surfaces
(PES), the role of the heat-bath, in particular, for a realistic form of the
system-bath interaction has not been well explored. Previous studies are
largely based on one-dimensional model and linear-linear (LL) system-bath
interaction. In the present study, we introduce an exponential-linear (EL)
system-bath interaction, which is derived from the analysis of a PTR-PRV system
in a realistic situation. This interaction mainly causes vibrational dephasing
in the PTR mode and population relaxation in the RPV mode. Numerical
simulations were carried out using hierarchy equations of motion approach. We
analyze the role of the heat-bath interaction on the chemical reaction rate as
a function of the system-bath coupling strength at different temperature and
for different values of the bath correlation time. A prominent feature of the
present result is that while the reaction rate predicted from classical and
quantum Kramers theory increases as the temperature increases, the present EL
interaction model exhibits opposite temperature dependence. Kramers turn-over
profile of the reaction rate as a function of the system-bath coupling is also
suppressed in the present EL model turning into a plateau-like curve for larger
system-bath interaction strength. Such features arise from the interplay of the
vibrational dephasing process in the PTR mode and the population relaxation
process in the RPV mode.

of nanotips, pose a major challenge since numerical modeling requires enormous
computational resources. We propose a hybrid approach where the local
electrostatic field enhancement parameters of an individual emitter is
determined numerically while electrostatic shielding and anode-proximity
effects are incorporated using recent analytical advances. The hybrid model is
tested numerically on an ordered arrangement of emitters and then applied to
recent experimental results on randomly distributed gold nanocones. Using the
current-voltage data of two samples with vastly different emitter densities but
having similar nanocone sizes, we show that an appropriate modeling of the
emitter-apex together with the analytical results on shielding and
anode-proximity effects, leads to consistent results for the apex radius of
curvature. In both cases, the $\text{I-V}$ data is approximately reproduced for
$R_a \simeq 9$nm. Importantly, it is found that anode-proximity plays a
significant role in counter-balancing electrostatic shielding and ignoring this
effect results in the requirement of a much smaller value of $R_a$.

advancements in Computer Vision research in recent years. This progress has
spawned many practical applications and we see an increased need to efficiently
move CNNs to embedded systems today. However traditional CNNs lack the property
of scale and rotation invariance: two of the most frequently encountered
transformations in natural images. As a consequence CNNs have to learn
different features for same objects at different scales. This redundancy is the
main reason why CNNs need to be very deep in order to achieve the desired
accuracy. In this paper we develop an efficient solution by reproducing how
nature has solved the problem in the human brain. To this end we let our CNN
operate on small patches extracted using the log-polar transform, which is
known to be scale and rotation equivariant. Patches extracted in this way have
the nice property of magnifying the central field and compressing the
periphery. Hence we obtain local descriptors with global context information.
However the processing of a single patch is usually not sufficient to achieve
high accuracies in e.g. classification tasks. We therefore successively jump to
several different locations, called saccades, thus building an understanding of
the whole image. Since log-polar patches contain global context information, we
can efficiently calculate following saccades using only the small patches.
Saccades efficiently compensate for the lack of translation equivariance of the
log-polar transform.

be more driven by concerns of potential harm to others. Our results enable us

introduce the problem of goal recognition over imperfect domain models, and
develop solution approaches that explicitly deal with two distinct types of

approximated from past observations and not well-defined. We develop novel goal

in Deep RL -- often very successful in simulation -- leads to jerky motion
patterns on real robots. Consequences of the resulting shaky behavior are poor
exploration, or even damage to the robot. We address these issues by adapting
state-dependent exploration (SDE) to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this
adaptation, we propose two extensions to the original SDE, using more general
features and re-sampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new
exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate
gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on
three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an
RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE permits to have a compromise
between performance and smoothness, which allows training directly on the real
robots without loss of performance. The code is available at

simple, single-phase kinematics, with statistically indistinguishable b-value
distributions for the low-, intermediate-, and high-ion components, all
dominated by narrow (b<25 km/s) components that are well aligned in velocity.
In contrast, we find tentative evidence that the Leading Arm shows complex,
multi-phase kinematics, with broader high ions than low ions. These results
suggest that the Stream is photoionized up to C IV by a hard ionizing radiation
field. This can be naturally explained by the Seyfert-flare model of
Bland-Hawthorn et al. (2013, 2019), in which a burst of ionizing radiation from
the Galactic Center photoionized the Stream as it passed below the south
Galactic pole. The Seyfert flare is the only known source of radiation that is
both powerful enough to explain the H-alpha intensity of the Stream and hard
enough to photoionize Si IV and C IV to the observed levels. The flare's
timescale of a few Myr suggests it is the same event that created the giant

orifice, minimizing Coulomb damping effects while permitting adjustable
resistance. Experimental results show that the leg-mounted, hydraulic damper
exhibits the most effective viscous damping. Adjusting the orifice setting did
not result in substantial changes of dissipated energy per drop, unlike

that multi-body interactions are enhanced by the emergence of a soft mode

realised volatility), plus a rank-one ""Zumbach"" contribution (that captures the
effect of past trends). We find that the Zumbach kernel is a power-law of time,

reduced to a common primal skeleton by a sequence of edge merging operations,
which we refer to as skeletal pooling. Thus, our main technical contribution is
the introduction of novel differentiable convolution, pooling, and unpooling
operators. These operators are skeleton-aware, meaning that they explicitly
account for the skeleton's hierarchical structure and joint adjacency, and
together they serve to transform the original motion into a collection of deep
temporal features associated with the joints of the primal skeleton. In other
words, our operators form the building blocks of a new deep motion processing
framework that embeds the motion into a common latent space, shared by a
collection of homeomorphic skeletons. Thus, retargeting can be achieved simply
by encoding to, and decoding from this latent space. Our experiments show the
effectiveness of our framework for motion retargeting, as well as motion
processing in general, compared to existing approaches. Our approach is also
quantitatively evaluated on a synthetic dataset that contains pairs of motions

the news shared task of WMT 2019 for three translation directions:
English-to-German, English-to-Russian and German-to-English. First we identify
three potential issues in the human evaluation of that shared task: (i) the
limited amount of intersentential context available, (ii) the limited
translation proficiency of the evaluators and (iii) the use of a reference
translation. We then conduct a modified evaluation taking these issues into
account. Our results indicate that all the claims of human parity and
super-human performance made at WMT 2019 should be refuted, except the claim of
human parity for English-to-German. Based on our findings, we put forward a set
of recommendations and open questions for future assessments of human parity in
machine translation.

a wide variety of nonclassical states require their characterization beyond
negativity. We establish a framework of nonclassicality in phase space that
addresses nonclassical states comprehensively with a direct experimental
evidence. This includes the negativity of phase-space distribution as a special
case and further analyzes quantum states with positive distributions
effectively. We prove that it detects all nonclassical Gaussian states and all
non-Gaussian states of arbitrary dimension remarkably by examining three
phase-space points only. Our formalism also provides an experimentally
accessible lower bound for a nonclassicality measure based on trace distance.
Importantly, this foundational approach can be further adapted to constitute
practical tests in two directions looking into particle and wave nature of
bosonic systems, via an array of nonideal on-off detectors and coarse-grained
homodyne measurement, respectively. All these tests are practically powerful in
characterizing nonclasssical states reliably against noise, making a versatile
tool for a broad range of quantum systems in quantum technologies.

to identify pedestrians. Many complex network structures are proposed recently

performance. However, they are too heavy-weight to deploy in realworld
applications. Additionally, pedestrian images are often captured by different
surveillance cameras, so the varied lights, perspectives and resolutions result
in inevitable multi-camera domain gaps for ReID. To address these issues, this
paper proposes ATCN, a simple but effective angular triplet loss-based camera
network, which is able to achieve compelling performance with only global
features. In ATCN, a novel angular distance is introduced to learn a more
discriminative feature representation in the embedding space. Meanwhile, a
lightweight camera network is designed to transfer global features to more
discriminative features. ATCN is designed to be simple and flexible so it can
be easily deployed in practice. The experiment results on various benchmark
datasets show that ATCN outperforms many SOTA approaches.

preserving the motion content of the latter, has been a long-standing problem
in character animation. Most existing data-driven approaches are supervised and
rely on paired data, where motions with the same content are performed in
different styles. In addition, these approaches are limited to transfer of
styles that were seen during training. In this paper, we present a novel
data-driven framework for motion style transfer, which learns from an unpaired
collection of motions with style labels, and enables transferring motion styles
not observed during training. Furthermore, our framework is able to extract
motion styles directly from videos, bypassing 3D reconstruction, and apply them
to the 3D input motion. Our style transfer network encodes motions into two
latent codes, for content and for style, each of which plays a different role
in the decoding (synthesis) process. While the content code is decoded into the
output motion by several temporal convolutional layers, the style code modifies
deep features via temporally invariant adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN).
Moreover, while the content code is encoded from 3D joint rotations, we learn a
common embedding for style from either 3D or 2D joint positions, enabling style
extraction from videos. Our results are comparable to the state-of-the-art,
despite not requiring paired training data, and outperform other methods when
transferring previously unseen styles. To our knowledge, we are the first to
demonstrate style transfer directly from videos to 3D animations - an ability
which enables one to extend the set of style examples far beyond motions

accumulates local updates uploaded by participants to update a global model.
However, there are two critical security threats: poisoning and membership
inference attacks. These attacks may be carried out by malicious or unreliable
participants, resulting in the construction failure of global models or privacy
leakage of FL models. Therefore, it is crucial for FL to develop security means
of defense. In this article, we propose a blockchain-based secure FL framework
to create smart contracts and prevent malicious or unreliable participants from
involving in FL. In doing so, the central aggregator recognizes malicious and
unreliable participants by automatically executing smart contracts to defend
against poisoning attacks. Further, we use local differential privacy
techniques to prevent membership inference attacks. Numerical results suggest
that the proposed framework can effectively deter poisoning and membership

a considerable potential to provide energy flexibility by controlling the
charging of Electric Vehicles (EVs) and injecting part of the stored energy
into the building, using Building-to-Vehicle (B2V) and Vehicle-to-Building
(V2B) systems. However, EVs and buildings do not often belong to the same
entity and in Portugal the existing regulation does not allow financial
transactions between buildings and EVs as separate entities. Addressing this
regulation hurdle requires innovative optimization methods for the
implementation of B2V/V2B systems. Moreover, the new legislation regarding the
self-consumption of renewable generation in Portugal enables the trade of
renewable generation surplus between buildings and the establishment of
renewable energy communities. This paper intends to address this issue and
proposes a formulation to aggregate and manage the sharing of generation
surplus between buildings, using EVs as a flexibility resource. The simulation
results showcase the achieved increase in renewable self-consumption at

existing methods) and shed some light on the commonsense knowledge that we need
to acquire in the future for better commonsense reasoning. Moreover, to
investigate whether current WSC models can understand the commonsense or they
simply solve the WSC questions based on the statistical bias of the dataset, we
leverage the collected reasons to develop a new task called WinoWhy, which
requires models to distinguish plausible reasons from very similar but wrong
reasons for all WSC questions. Experimental results prove that even though
pre-trained language representation models have achieved promising progress on
the original WSC dataset, they are still struggling at WinoWhy. Further
experiments show that even though supervised models can achieve better
performance, the performance of these models can be sensitive to the dataset
distribution. WinoWhy and all codes are available at:

arises, from which an ion-acoustic solitary wave and a chain of oscillations
form over time. The amplitude of the ion-acoustic solitary wave after passage
through the boundary changes in such a way that its value in the electron-ion

the case of a compressive ion-acoustic solitary wave propagating through the
negative ion plasma and having an amplitude exceeding the critical amplitude in

""seasonal viruses"" as they tend to subside in warmer months. In other words,
meteorological conditions tend to impact the activity of viruses, and this
information can be exploited for the operational management of hospitals. In
this study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals
in Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from
patients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We
propose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of
positive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds
of positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these
distributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations
to be dealt with via a robust estimation approach. Because meteorological
conditions may vary over time, we use meteorological and not calendar
variations to explain hospital charge extremes, and our empirical findings
highlight their significance. We propose a measure of hospital congestion and a
related tool to estimate the resulting CaRe (Charge-at-Risk-estimation) under
different meteorological conditions. The relevant numerical computations can be
easily carried out using the freely available GJRM R package. The introduced
approach could be applied to several types of seasonal disease data such as
those derived from the new virus SARS-CoV-2 and its COVID-19 disease which is
at the moment wreaking havoc worldwide. The empirical effectiveness of the
proposed method is assessed through a simulation study.

boiling point, especially at or above the Leidenfrost regime. The Leidenfrost
point (LFP) was found to decrease with increase in the impact Weber number
(based on velocity just before the impact) for fixed polymer (Polyacrylamide,
PAAM) concentrations. Water droplets fragmented at very low Weber numbers
(~22), whereas the polymer droplets resisted fragmentation at much higher Weber
numbers (~155). We also varied the polymer concentration and observed that till
1000 ppm, the LFP was higher compared to water. This signifies that the effect
can be delayed by the use of elastic fluids. We have showed the possible role
of elastic effects (manifested by the formation of long lasting filaments)
during retraction in the improvement of the LFP. However for 1500 ppm, LFP was
lower than water, but with similar residence time during initial impact. In
addition, we studied the role of Weber number and viscoelastic effects on the
rebound behaviour at 405o C. We observed that the critical Weber number till
which the droplet resisted fragmentation at 405o C increased with the polymer
concentration. In addition, for a fixed Weber number, the droplet rebound
height and the hovering time period increased up to 500 ppm, and then
decreased. Similarly, for fixed polymer concentrations like 1000 and 1500 ppm,
the rebound height showed an increasing trend up to certain a certain Weber
number and then decreased. This non-monotonic behaviour of rebound heights was
attributed to the observed diversion of rebound kinetic energy to rotational
energy during the hovering phase.

result determine the so-called $\delta$-linear terms and $\delta$-quadratic
terms. As a first consequence, a powerful theory linking Golay complementary
sets of $p$-ary ($p$ prime) sequences and the generalized Reed-Muller codes by
Kasami et al. is developed. These codes enjoy good error-correcting capability,
tightly controlled PMEPR, and significantly extend the range of coding options
for applications of OFDM using $p^n$ subcarriers. As another consequence, we
make a previously unrecognized connection between the sequences in CSSs and
CCCs and the sequence with 2-level autocorrelation, trace function and
permutation polynomial (PP) over the finite fields.

with predicted high likelihoods of secondary CO detection using ALMA in band 6.
We looked for continuum emission of mm-dust as well as gas emission (CO and CN
transitions). The continuum emission was detected in 9/10 systems for which we
derived the discs' dust masses and geometrical properties, providing the first
mm-wave detection of the disc around HD 106906, the first mm-wave radius for HD

A crucial finding of our paper is that we detect CO for the first time around
the young 10-16 Myr old G1V star HD 129590, similar to our early Sun. The gas
seems colocated with its planetesimal belt and its total mass is likely between
$2-10 \times 10^{-5}$ M$_\oplus$. This first gas detection around a G-type
main-sequence star raises questions as to whether gas may have been released in
the Solar System as well in its youth, which could potentially have affected
planet formation. We also detected CO gas around HD 121191 at a higher S/N than
previously and find that the CO lies much closer-in than the planetesimals in
the system, which could be evidence for the previously suspected CO viscous
spreading owing to shielding preventing its photodissociation. Finally, we make
estimates for the CO content in planetesimals and the HCN/CO outgassing rate

capability of a machine learning model for problem reduction on the classic
travelling salesman problems (TSP). We demonstrate that our method can greedily
remove decision variables from an optimization problem that are predicted not
to be part of an optimal solution. More specifically, we investigate our
model's capability to generalize on test instances that have not been seen
during the training phase. We consider three scenarios where training and test
instances are different in terms of: 1) problem characteristics; 2) problem
sizes; and 3) problem types. Our experiments show that this machine learning
based technique can generalize reasonably well over a wide range of TSP test
instances with different characteristics or sizes. While the accuracy of
predicting unused variables naturally deteriorates as a test instance is
further away from the training set, we observe that even when tested on a
different TSP problem variant, the machine learning model still makes useful
predictions about which variables can be eliminated without significantly
impacting solution quality.

spectroscopy, the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme has become a vital tool.
This approach allows to target such states with high specificity, albeit
introducing an error. We report the implementation of a post-processing step
for CVS excitations obtained within the algebraic-diagrammatic construction
scheme for the polarisation propagator (ADC), which removes this error. Based
on this we provide a detailed analysis of the CVS scheme, identifying its
accuracy to be dominated by an error balance between two neglected couplings,
one between core and valence single excitations and one between single and
double core excitations. The selection of the basis set is shown to be vital
for a proper description of both couplings, with tight polarising functions
being necessary for a good balance of errors. The CVS error is confirmed to be
stable across multiple systems, with an element-specific spread for $K$-edge
spectrum calculations of about $\pm$0.02 eV. A systematic lowering of the CVS
error by 0.02-0.03 eV is noted when considering excitations to extremely
diffuse states, emulating ionisation.

factor of this QPO is 20, and its period is 3550 $\pm$ 80 s, which is 250 $\pm$
100 s shorter than in 2007. While the QPO's period has no significant energy
dependence, its fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability increases from 4%
in 0.3-1 keV to 12% in 1-4 keV bands. An interesting phenomenon is that the QPO
in 0.3-1 keV leads that in the 1-4 keV bands by 430 $\pm$ 50 s with a high
coherence, opposite to the soft X-ray lag reported for the observation in 2007.
We speculate that the QPO has an intrinsic hard lag, while the previous
reported soft lag is caused by the interference of stochastic variability. This
soft X-ray lead in the new data supports the idea that the QPO of RE J1034+396
is a possible AGN counterpart of the 67 Hz high-frequency QPO seen in the black
hole binary (BHB) GRS 1915+105. We also search for QPO harmonics, but do not
find any significant signals. Our new data reinforce previous results that the
QPO is seen in a specific spectral state, as the only 2 observations showing no
significant QPO signal exhibit an even stronger soft X-ray excess than the
other 6 observations which display the QPO. Therefore, our results imply that
the QPO in RE J1034+396 is physically linked to a soft X-ray component.

automatically designing task-specific neural networks. Existing NAS approaches
require one complete search for each deployment specification of hardware or
objective. This is a computationally impractical endeavor given the potentially
large number of application scenarios. In this paper, we propose Neural
Architecture Transfer (NAT) to overcome this limitation. NAT is designed to
efficiently generate task-specific custom models that are competitive under
multiple conflicting objectives. To realize this goal we learn task-specific
supernets from which specialized subnets can be sampled without any additional
training. The key to our approach is an integrated online transfer learning and
many-objective evolutionary search procedure. A pre-trained supernet is
iteratively adapted while simultaneously searching for task-specific subnets.
We demonstrate the efficacy of NAT on 11 benchmark image classification tasks
ranging from large-scale multi-class to small-scale fine-grained datasets. In
all cases, including ImageNet, NATNets improve upon the state-of-the-art under
mobile settings ($\leq$ 600M Multiply-Adds). Surprisingly, small-scale
fine-grained datasets benefit the most from NAT. At the same time, the
architecture search and transfer is orders of magnitude more efficient than
existing NAS methods. Overall, the experimental evaluation indicates that,
across diverse image classification tasks and computational objectives, NAT is
an appreciably more effective alternative to conventional transfer learning of
fine-tuning weights of an existing network architecture learned on standard

for including nuclear quantum effects into the calculation of electron-transfer
rates and for interpreting experimental data. It divides the molecular problem
into a subsystem treated quantum-mechanically by Fermi's golden rule and a
solvent bath treated by classical Marcus theory. As an extension of this idea,
we here present a ""reduced"" semiclassical instanton theory, which is a
multiscale method for simulating quantum tunnelling of the subsystem in
molecular detail in the presence of a harmonic bath. We demonstrate that
instanton theory is typically significantly more accurate than the cumulant
expansion or the semiclassical Franck-Condon sum, which can give
orders-of-magnitude errors and in general do not obey detailed balance. As
opposed to MLJ theory, which is based on wavefunctions, instanton theory is
based on path integrals and thus does not require solutions of the
Schr\""odinger equation, nor even global knowledge of the ground- and
excited-state potentials within the subsystem. It can thus be efficiently
applied to complex, anharmonic multidimensional subsystems without making
further approximations. In addition to predicting accurate rates, instanton
theory gives a high level of insight into the reaction mechanism by locating
the dominant tunnelling pathway as well as providing information on the
reactant and product vibrational states involved in the reaction and the
activation energy in the bath similarly to what would be found with MLJ theory.

full-duplex (FD) simultaneous transmitting and sensing is analysed and dynamic
thresholds for determining the channel status before and during transmissions
are mathematically formulated. Then a novel FD MAC protocol, named
priority-based multiple access (PBMA), based on prioritised messaging between
different vehicles is proposed. Average collision probability, collision
duration, waiting time as well as successful delivery rate of the system are
formulated too. The delivery performance of emergency messages is also
mathematically derived. In addition, comparisons have been made among three
different mechanisms. Benchmark is the DSRC standard which uses half-duplex

also compare our proposed protocol with FD EDCA. Simulations have verified the

different industrial sectors such as infrastructure, aerospace, and automotive.
However, practical adoptions of this technology have been slower, mainly due to
a lack of application-specific details. Here we focus on a digital twin
framework for linear single-degree-of-freedom structural dynamic systems
evolving in two different operational time scales in addition to its intrinsic
dynamic time-scale. Our approach strategically separates into two components --
(a) a physics-based nominal model for data processing and response predictions,
and (b) a data-driven machine learning model for the time-evolution of the
system parameters. The physics-based nominal model is system-specific and
selected based on the problem under consideration. On the other hand, the
data-driven machine learning model is generic. For tracking the multi-scale
evolution of the system parameters, we propose to exploit a mixture of experts
as the data-driven model. Within the mixture of experts model, Gaussian Process
(GP) is used as the expert model. The primary idea is to let each expert track
the evolution of the system parameters at a single time-scale. For learning the
hyperparameters of the `mixture of experts using GP', an efficient framework
the exploits expectation-maximization and sequential Monte Carlo sampler is
used. Performance of the digital twin is illustrated on a multi-timescale
dynamical system with stiffness and/or mass variations. The digital twin is
found to be robust and yields reasonably accurate results. One exciting feature

spreading pandemic. The disease is thought to spread mainly from
person-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person
coughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding
to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by
cells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the
majority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper
respiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral
airways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction
of COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.
While huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as
well as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid
how SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells.
The aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of
SARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this
purpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size
distribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing
normal breathing through the nose. We found that the probability of direct
infection of the peripheral airways due to inhalation of aerosol generated by a
bystander cough is very low. As the number of pathogens deposited in the
extrathoracic airways is ~10 times higher than in the peripheral airways, we
concluded that in most cases COVID-19 pneumonia must be preceded by SARS-CoV-2
infection of the upper airways. Our results suggest that without the
enhancement of viral load in the upper airways, COVID-19 would be much less
dangerous...

by spectrum sensors distributed across space. Since radio maps are complicated
functions of the spatial coordinates due to the nature of electromagnetic wave
propagation, model-free approaches are strongly motivated. Nevertheless, all
existing schemes for radio occupancy map estimation rely on interpolation
algorithms unable to learn from experience. In contrast, this paper proposes a
novel approach in which the spatial structure of propagation phenomena such as
shadowing is learned beforehand from a data set with measurements in other
environments. Relative to existing schemes, a significantly smaller number of
measurements is therefore required to estimate a map with a prescribed
accuracy. As an additional novelty, this is also the first work to estimate
radio occupancy maps using deep neural networks. Specifically, a fully
convolutional deep completion autoencoder architecture is developed to
effectively exploit the manifold structure of this class of maps.

Contrary to the recent methods, which consider only a small number of machine
modes, the temperature in the furnace can be changed continuously, and so an
infinite number of the power-saving modes must be considered to achieve the
highest possible savings. To model the machine modes efficiently, we use the
concept of the energy function, which was originally introduced in the domain
of embedded systems but has yet to take roots in the domain of production
research. The energy function is illustrated with several application examples

release times, deadlines, and processing times. Numerical experiments show that
the proposed model outperforms a reference model adapted from the literature.

errors for the numerical solutions may be estimated via the Pearson correlation
coefficient that may be geometrically expressed by the angle between errors.
Due to this reason, the angles between the approximation errors are computed
and related with the corresponding angles between the truncation errors. The
angles between the approximation errors are found to be far from zero that
enables a posteriori estimation of the error norm. The analysis of the
distances between these solutions provides another approach to the estimation
of the error. The comparison of the error norms, obtained by these two

vectors. We derive uniform exponential inequalities and multidimensional
probabilistic inequalities for random vectors, which are substantially tighter
as compared to existing ones. The probabilistic inequalities are applied to
investigate the performance of control systems with real parametric
uncertainty. It is demonstrated much more useful insights of control systems
can be obtained. Moreover, the probabilistic inequalities offer performance
analysis in a significantly less conservative way as compared to the classical
deterministic worst-case method.

In this case study, FMR covers the analysis of SIS inputs while HiP-HOPS/CFT

proposed, which incorporates a specific epistemic restriction parameterized by
a global random variable on the order of Planck constant, transparently
manifesting quantum uncertainty in phase space. Here we show that the
epistemically restricted phase space (ERPS) distribution can be determined via
weak measurement of momentum followed by post-selection on position. In the
ERPS representation, the phase and amplitude of the wave function are neatly
captured respectively by the position-dependent (conditional) average and
variance of the epistemically restricted momentum fluctuation. They are in turn
respectively determined by the real and imaginary parts of the weak momentum
value, permitting a reconstruction of wave function using weak momentum value
measurement, and an interpretation of momentum weak value in term of
epistemically restricted momentum fluctuations. The ERPS representation thus
provides a transparent and rich framework to study the deep conceptual links
between quantum uncertainty embodied in epistemic restriction, quantum wave
function, and weak momentum measurement with position post-selection, which may
offer useful insight to better understand their meaning.

many counterintuitive nonclassical phenomena. Recent studies remarkably showed
that it also fundamentally limits nonclassical correlation, and crucially, a
deviation from its exact form may lead to a violation of the second law of
thermodynamics. Are there deep and natural principles which uniquely determines
its form? Here we work within a general epistemic framework for a class of
nonclassical theories, introducing an epistemic restriction to an otherwise
classical theory, so that the distributions of positions are irreducibly
parameterized by the underlying momentum fields. It was recently shown that the
mathematics of quantum mechanics formally arises within an operational scheme,
wherein an agent makes a specific estimation of the momentum given information
on the positions and the experimental settings. Moreover, quantum uncertainty
can be traced back to the `specific' choice of estimator and the associated
estimation error. In the present work, we show that a plausible principle of
estimation independence, which requires that the estimation of momentum of one

complementary views of the same task. In this preprint, the problem of jointly

is highly beneficial for studying brain function because these modalities have
complementary spatiotemporal resolution: EEG offers good temporal resolution
while fMRI is better in its spatial resolution. The fusion methods reported so
far ignore the underlying multi-way nature of the data in at least one of the
modalities and/or rely on very strong assumptions about the relation of the two
datasets. In this preprint, these two points are addressed by adopting for the
first time tensor models in the two modalities while also exploring double
coupled tensor decompositions and by following soft and flexible coupling
approaches to implement the multi-modal analysis. To cope with the Event
Related Potential (ERP) variability in EEG, the PARAFAC2 model is adopted. The
results obtained are compared against those of parallel Independent Component
Analysis (ICA) and hard coupling alternatives in both simulated and real data.
Our results confirm the superiority of tensorial methods over methods based on
ICA. In scenarios that do not meet the assumptions underlying hard coupling,
the advantage of soft and flexible coupled decompositions is clearly
demonstrated.

tremendous social costs. Climate data is often limited in duration and spatial
coverage, and climate forecasting has often turned to simulations of climate
models to make better predictions of rare weather events. However very long
simulations of complex models, in order to obtain accurate probability
estimates, may be prohibitively slow. It is an important scientific problem to
develop probabilistic and dynamical techniques to estimate the probabilities of
rare events accurately from limited data. In this paper we compare four modern
methods of estimating the probability of rare events: the generalized extreme
value (GEV) method from classical extreme value theory; two importance sampling
techniques, genealogical particle analysis (GPA) and the
Giardina-Kurchan-Lecomte-Tailleur (GKLT) algorithm; as well as brute force
Monte Carlo (MC). With these techniques we estimate the probabilities of rare
events in three dynamical models: the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, the Lorenz
'96 system and PlaSim (a climate model). We keep the computational effort
constant and see how well the rare event probability estimation of each
technique compares to a gold standard afforded by a very long run control.
Somewhat surprisingly we find that classical extreme value theory methods
outperform GPA, GKLT and MC at estimating rare events.

them in batch to achieve Markov decision process sequences and synchronously
update the network parameters instead of experience replay. This training
framework proves to optimize the unbiased approximation of loss function whose
estimation exactly matches the real probability distribution data inputs

convergence rate over existing deep reinforcement learning after evaluating it
on both discrete action spaces and continuous control problems. Besides, we
propose several algorithms embedded with our new framework to deal with typical

Davies's point and quasi-normal modes. Finally, we investigate the effects of
thermal fluctuations on the uncorrected thermodynamic quantities. It is
concluded that the logarithmic corrections originated from thermal fluctuations
make the system more unstable for small BHs.

large domain D where a given function takes large, small or specific values via
an iterative optimization algorithm based on the gradient. We show that the
objective function used is not directly optimizable, however, we use a trick to
approximate this objective by another one at each iteration to optimize it.
Then we explore a use case of this algorithm in machine learning to find
domains where the models output large and small values with respect of some
constraints. Experiments demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm on five
cases with models trained on the titanic dataset.

no matter how the parameters of the SM-AP algorithm has been adopted. Finally,
the simulation results substantiate the validity of the proposed analysis.

  Interactions with Noncovalent Graph Neural Network and Layer-Wise Relevance
  Propagation",,,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Expanding the scope of graph-based, deep-learning models to noncovalent
protein-ligand interactions has earned increasing attention in structure-based
drug design. Modeling the protein-ligand interactions with graph neural
networks (GNNs) has experienced difficulties in the conversion of
protein-ligand complex structures into the graph representation and left
questions regarding whether the trained models properly learn the appropriate
noncovalent interactions. Here, we proposed a GNN architecture, denoted as
InteractionNet, which learns two separated molecular graphs, being covalent and
noncovalent, through distinct convolution layers. We also analyzed the
InteractionNet model with an explainability technique, i.e., layer-wise
relevance propagation, for examination of the chemical relevance of the model's
predictions. Separation of the covalent and noncovalent convolutional steps
made it possible to evaluate the contribution of each step independently and
analyze the graph-building strategy for noncovalent interactions. We applied
InteractionNet to the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity and showed
that our model successfully predicted the noncovalent interactions in both
performance and relevance in chemical interpretation.

superconductivity can explain the dependence of the isotope coefficient in
high-temperature superconductors on the critical temperature of a
superconducting transition: in the case of strong electron-phonon interaction,
the isotope coefficient is low when doping is optimal and high when it is weak.
It is demonstrated that in the case of London penetration depth, the absolute
value of the isotope coefficient behaves in the opposite way. A conclusion of
the great role of non-adiabaticity in the case of weak doping is made. The
criteria for d-wave phonon input into the isotope effect is established.
