to aid in the balance of supply and demand in the power grid. Consequently, it
is of interest for a BA to know how much flexibility a collection of loads has,
so to successfully incorporate flexible loads into grid level resource
allocation. Loads' flexibility is limited by all their Quality of Service (QoS)
requirements. In this work we present a characterization of capacity for a
collection of flexible loads. This characterization is in terms of the Power
Spectral Density (PSD) of the reference signal. Two advantages of our
characterization are: (i) it easily allows for a BA to use the characterization
for resource allocation of flexible loads and (ii) it allows for precise
definitions of the power and energy capacity for a collection of flexible
loads.

correct execution over its lifetime. The design rules related to reliability
depend on the process technology being used and the expected operating
conditions of the device. To meet reliability requirements, advanced process
technologies (28 nm and below) impose highly challenging design rules. Such
design-for-reliability rules have become a major burden on the flow of VLSI
implementation because of the severe physical constraints they impose.
  This paper focuses on electromigration (EM), which is one of the major
critical factors affecting semiconductor reliability. EM is the aging process
of on-die wires and vias and is induced by excessive current flow that can
damage wires and may also significantly impact the integrated-circuit clock
frequency. EM exerts a comprehensive global effect on devices because it
impacts wires that may reside inside the standard or custom logical cells,
between logical cells, inside memory elements, and within wires that
interconnect functional blocks.
  The design-implementation flow (synthesis and place-and-route) currently
detects violations of EM-reliability rules and attempts to solve them. In
contrast, this paper proposes a new approach to enhance these flows by using
EM-aware architecture. Our results show that the proposed solution can relax EM
design efforts in microprocessors and more than double microprocessor lifetime.
This work demonstrates this proposed approach for modern microprocessors,
although the principals and ideas can be adapted to other cases as well.

new window on the internal dynamics of neutron stars. We study the minimal
three-component model for pulsar glitches by solving it with generic initial
conditions. The purpose is to use this solution to fit the data of the 2016
Vela glitch by employing a Bayesian approach and to obtain a probability
distribution for the physical parameters of the model and for observational
parameters, such as the glitch rise time and the relaxation timescale. The fit
is achieved through Bayesian inference. Due to the presence of an increase in
the timing residuals near the glitch time, an extra magnetospheric component
was added to the three-component model to deal with this phenomenon. A
physically reasonable, non-informative prior was set on the parameters of the
model, so that the posterior distribution could be compared with information
obtained from microphysical calculations. By considering a model with a
tightened prior on the moment of inertia fractions and by comparing it with the
original model by means of Bayesian model selection, we studied the possibility
of a crust-limited superfluid reservoir. We obtained the posterior distribution
for the moment of inertia fractions of the superfluid components, the coupling
parameters, and the initial velocity lags between the components. An analysis
of the inferred posterior also confirmed the presence of an overshoot in that
glitch and set an upper limit of $\sim 6\,$s on the glitch rise timescale. The
comparison between the two models with different priors on the moment of
inertia fractions appears to indicate a need for a core participation in the
glitch phenomenon, regardless of the uncertain strength of the entrainment
coupling.

due to potential changes in commute patterns, for example caused by events such
as pandemics. Permanent shifts away from transit and carpooling can add
vehicles to congested road networks, increasing travel times. Growth in the
number of workers who avoid commuting and work from home instead can offset
travel time increases. To estimate these potential impacts, 6-9 years of
American Community Survey commute data for 118 metropolitan statistical areas
are investigated. For 74 of the metro areas, the average commute travel time is
shown to be explainable using only the number of passenger vehicles used for
commuting. A universal Bureau of Public Roads model characterizes the
sensitivity of each metro area with respect to additional vehicles. The
resulting models are then used to determine the change in average travel time
for each metro area in scenarios when 25\% or 50\% of transit and carpool users
switch to single occupancy vehicles. Under a 25\% mode shift, areas such as San
Francisco and New York that are already congested and have high transit
ridership may experience round trip travel time increases of 12 minutes (New
York) to 20 minutes (San Francisco), costing individual commuters \$1065 and
\$1601 annually in lost time. The travel time increases and corresponding costs
can be avoided with an increase in working from home. The main contribution of
this work is to provide a model to quantify the potential increase in commute
travel times under various behavior changes, that can aid policy making for
more efficient commuting.

GCF calculations can reproduce the observed scaling of the cross-section ratios

$a_2=(\sigma_A/A)/(\sigma_d/2)$. In the non-relativistic instant-form
formulation, the calculation is very sensitive to the model parameters and only
reproduces the data using parameters that are inconsistent with ab-initio
many-body calculations. Using a light-cone GCF formulation significantly
decreases this sensitivity and improves the agreement with ab-initio
calculations. The ratio of similar mass isotopes, such as $^{40}$Ca and
$^{48}$Ca, should be sensitive to the nuclear asymmetry dependence of SRCs, but
is found to also be sensitive to low-energy nuclear structure. Thus the
empirical association of SRC pair abundances with the measured $a_2$ values is

computation in type theories and use it to abstractly capture the essence of
oracle Turing machines. The resulting objects we call continuous machines. We
prove that it is possible to translate back and forth between such machines and
names in the standard function encoding used in computable analysis. Put
differently, among the operators on Baire space, exactly the partial continuous
ones are implementable by continuous machines and the data that such a machine
provides is a description of the operator as a sequentially realizable
functional.
  Continuous machines are naturally formulated in type theories and we have
formalized our findings in Coq. Continuous machines, their equivalence to the
standard encoding and correctness of basic operations are now part of Incone, a
Coq library for computable analysis. While the correctness proofs use a
classical meta-theory with countable choice, the translations and algorithms
that are proven correct are all fully executable. Along the way we formally
prove some known results such as existence of a self-modulating moduli of
continuity for partial continuous operators on Baire space.
  To illustrate their versatility we use continuous machines to specify some
algorithms that operate on objects that cannot be fully described by finite
means, such as real numbers and functions. We present particularly simple
algorithms for finding the multiplicative inverse of a real number and for
composition of partial continuous operators on Baire space. Some of the
simplicity is achieved by utilizing the fact that continuous machines are
compatible with multivalued semantics. We also connect continuous machines to
the construction of precompletions and completions of represented spaces,
topics that have recently caught the attention of the computable analysis
community.

extinction in the absence of mutants, which can only survive if mutants
sufficiently adapted to the new environment arise and fix. We show that mutants
that appear later during the environment deterioration have a higher
probability to fix. The rescue probability of the population increases with a
sigmoidal shape when the product of the carrying capacity and of the mutation
probability increases. Furthermore, we find that rescue becomes more likely for
smaller population sizes and/or mutation probabilities if the environment
degradation is slower, which illustrates the key impact of the rapidity of
environment degradation on the fate of a population. We also show that our main
conclusions are robust across various types of adaptive mutants, including
specialist and generalist ones, as well as mutants modeling antimicrobial
resistance evolution. We further express the average time of appearance of the

processes that provably preserve the slow timescales. These slow variables are
known as reaction coordinates in molecular dynamical applications, where they
play a key role in system analysis and coarse graining. The defining
characteristics of these slow variables is that they parametrize a so-called
transition manifold, a low-dimensional manifold in a certain density function
space that emerges with progressive equilibration of the system's fast
variables. The existence of said manifold was previously predicted for certain
classes of metastable and slow-fast systems. However, in the original work, the
existence of the manifold hinges on the pointwise convergence of the system's
transition density functions towards it. We show in this work that a
convergence in average with respect to the system's stationary measure is
sufficient to yield reaction coordinates with the same key qualities. This
allows one to accurately predict the timescale preservation in systems where
the old theory is not applicable or would give overly pessimistic results.
Moreover, the new characterization is still constructive, in that it allows for
the algorithmic identification of a good slow variable. The improved
characterization, the error prediction and the variable construction are
demonstrated by a small metastable system.

research, aptly referred to as the Drosophila of artificial intelligence.
Traditionally, researchers have focused on using well-known games to build
strong agents. This progress, however, can be better informed by characterizing
games and their topological landscape. Tackling this latter question can
facilitate understanding of agents and help determine what game an agent should
target next as part of its training. Here, we show how network measures applied
to response graphs of large-scale games enable the creation of a landscape of
games, quantifying relationships between games of varying sizes and
characteristics. We illustrate our findings in domains ranging from canonical
games to complex empirical games capturing the performance of trained agents
pitted against one another. Our results culminate in a demonstration leveraging
this information to generate new and interesting games, including mixtures of
empirical games synthesized from real world games.

transmission of the second photon, thereby converting incident coherent light
into anti-bunched light, which is known as photon blockade effect. On the other
hand, photon anti-pairing, where only the entry of two photons is blocked and
the emission of bunches of three or more photons is allowed, is based on an
unconventional photon blockade mechanism due to destructive interference of two
distinct excitation pathways. We propose quantum plexcitonic systems with
moderate nonlinearity to generate both anti-bunched and anti-paired photons.
The proposed plexitonic systems benefit from subwavelength field localizations
that make quantum emitters spatially distinguishable, thus enabling a
reconfigurable photon source between anti-bunched and anti-paired states via
tailoring the energy bands. For a realistic nanoprism plexitonic system, two
schemes of reconfiguration are suggested: (i) the chemical means by partially
changing the type of the emitters; or (ii) the optical approach by rotating the
polarization angle of the incident light to tune the coupling rate of the
emitters. These results pave the way to realize reconfigurable nonclassical
photon sources in a simple quantum plexcitonic platform with readily accessible

underlying resonance structure into the discretisation. This will allow us to
resolve the nonlinear oscillations of the PDE and to approximate with high
order accuracy a large class of equations under lower regularity assumptions
than classical techniques require. The key idea to control the nonlinear
frequency interactions in the system up to arbitrary high order thereby lies in
a tailored decorated tree formalism. Our algebraic structures are close to the
ones developed for singular SPDEs with Regularity Structures. We adapt them to
the context of dispersive PDEs by using a novel class of decorations {which
encode the dominant frequencies}. The structure proposed in this paper is new
and gives a variant of the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra on decorated
trees. We observe a similar Birkhoff type factorisation as in SPDEs and
perturbative quantum field theory. This factorisation allows us to single out
oscillations and to optimise the local error by mapping it to the particular
regularity of the solution. This use of the Birkhoff factorisation seems new in
comparison to the literature. The field of singular SPDEs took advantage of
numerical methods and renormalisation in perturbative quantum field theory by
extending their structures via the adjunction of decorations and Taylor
expansions. Now, through this work, Numerical Analysis is taking advantage of
these extended structures and provides a new perspective on them.

with seed bank modeling the spread of a beneficial allele in a spatial
population where individuals may switch between an active and a dormant state.
Incorporating dormancy and the resulting seed bank leads to a two-type coupled
system of equations with migration between both states. We first discuss
existence and uniqueness of seed bank SPDEs and provide an equivalent delay
representation that allows a clear interpretation of the age structure in the
seed bank component. The delay representation will also be crucial in the
proofs. Further, we show that the seed bank SPDEs give rise to an interesting
class of ""on/off"" moment duals. In particular, in the special case of the F-KPP
Equation with seed bank, the moment dual is given by an ""on/off-branching
Brownian motion"". This system differs from a classical branching Brownian
motion in the sense that independently for all individuals, motion and
branching may be ""switched off"" for an exponential amount of time after which
they get ""switched on"" again. Here, as an application of our duality, we show
that the spread of a beneficial allele, which in the classical F-KPP Equation,
started from a Heaviside intial condition, evolves as a pulled traveling wave
with speed $\sqrt{2}$, is slowed down significantly in the corresponding seed
bank F-KPP model. In fact, by computing bounds on the position of the rightmost
particle in the dual on/off-branching Brownian motion, we obtain an upper bound
for the speed of propagation of the beneficial allele given by
$\sqrt{\sqrt{5}-1}\approx 1.111$ under unit switching rates. This shows that
seed banks will indeed slow down fitness waves and preserve genetic
variability, in line with intuitive reasoning from population genetics and
ecology.

area breaks classification aims to obtain a coloring for the map such that the
area associated with each of the colors is approximately equal. This is meant
to be an alternative to an approach that assigns an equal number of regions
with a particular range of property values to each color, called quantiles,
which could result in the mapped area being dominated by one or a few colors.
Moreover, it is possible that the other colors are barely discernible. This is
the case when some regions are much larger than others (e.g., compare
Switzerland with Russia). A number of algorithms of varying computational
complexity are presented to achieve an equal area assignment to regions. They
include a pair of greedy algorithms, as well as an optimal algorithm that is
based on dynamic programming. The classification obtained from the optimal
equal area algorithm is compared with the quantiles and Jenks natural breaks
algorithms and found to be superior from a visual standpoint by a user study.
Finally, a modified approach is presented which enables users to vary the
extent to which the coloring algorithm satisfies the conflicting goals of equal
area for each color with that of assigning an equal number of regions to each

x-ray absorption study of UTe$_2$ under applied pressure reveals key new
insights on the superconducting and magnetic states surrounding
pressure-induced quantum criticality at P$_{c1}$ = 1.3 GPa. First, our specific
heat data at low pressures, combined with a phenomenological model, show that
pressure alters the balance between two closely competing superconducting
orders. Second, near 1.5 GPa we detect two bulk transitions that trigger
changes in the resistivity which are consistent with antiferromagnetic order,
rather than ferromagnetism. The presence of both bulk magnetism and
superconductivity at pressures above P$_{c2}$ = 1.4 GPa results in a
significant temperature difference between resistively and thermodynamically
determined transitions into the superconducting state, which indicates a
suppression of the superconducting volume fraction by magnetic order. Third,
the emergence of magnetism is accompanied by an increase in valence towards a
U$^{4+}$ (5f2) state, which indicates that UTe$_2$ exhibits intermediate
valence at ambient pressure. Our results suggest that antiferromagnetic

model for the High-Energy Telescope (HE) of the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
(dubbed as Insight-HXMT). Based on the two-year blank sky observations of
Insight-HXMT/HE, we first investigate the basic properties of the background
and find that both the background spectral shape and intensity have long-term
evolution at different geographical sites. The entire earth globe is then
divided into small grids, each with a typical area of 5x5 square degrees in
geographical coordinate system. For each grid, an empirical function is used to
describe the long-term evolution of each channel of the background spectrum;
the intensity of the background can be variable and a modification factor is
introduced to account for this variability by measuring the contemporary flux
of the blind detector. For a given pointing observation, the background model
is accomplished by integrating over the grids that are passed by the track of
the satellite in each orbit. Such a background model is tested with both the
blank sky observations and campaigns for observations of a series of celestial
sources. The results show an average systematic error of 1.5% for the
background energy spectrum (26-100 keV) under a typical exposure of 8 ks, and
<3% for background light curve estimation (30-150 keV). Therefore, the
background model introduced in this paper is included in the Insight-HXMT
software as a standard part specialized for both spectral and temporal
analyses.

used to solve a set of problems, independent cell-by-cell, to retrieve the

approach is the introduction of a new basis function, utilised for the linear
approximation of the primal variable in each cell. Contrary to the commonly

incompressible limit and insensitive to cell distortion and stretching. The
second-order accuracy of the solution is exploited to devise an automatic mesh

its average at a fixed scale. This is easy: we pick the density $u_{}$ of a

compute the convolution $u_{} * f$. Is there a particularly natural choice for
$u$? This question is studied in scale space theory and the Gaussian is a
popular answer. We were interested whether a canonical choice for $u$ can arise
from a new axiom: having fixed a scale, the average should oscillate as little
as possible, i.e. $$ u_{} = \arg\min_{u_{}} \sup_{f \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}
\frac{\| \nabla (u_{} *f) \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}}{\|f\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)}}.$$

technology. Although its accuracy is closing the gap with that of human level
under certain settings, one area that can further improve is to incorporate
user-specific information or context to bias its prediction. A common framework
is to dynamically construct a small language model from the provided contextual
mini corpus and interpolate its score with the main language model during the
decoding process.
  Here we propose an alternative approach that does not entail explicit
contextual language model. Instead, we derive the bias score for every word in
the system vocabulary from the training corpus. The method is unique in that 1)
it does not require meta-data or class-label annotation for the context or the
training corpus. 2) The bias score is proportional to the word's
log-probability, thus not only would it bias the provided context, but also
robust against irrelevant context (e.g. user mis-specified or in case where it
is hard to quantify a tight scope). 3) The bias score for the entire vocabulary
is pre-determined during the training stage, thereby eliminating
computationally expensive language model construction during inference.
  We show significant improvement in recognition accuracy when the relevant
context is available. Additionally, we also demonstrate that the proposed
method exhibits high tolerance to false-triggering errors in the presence of
irrelevant context.

study the thermalisation dynamics. In the paramagnetic region, the PDF quickly
shows thermal features. Conversely, in the ferromagnetic phase, when
confinement takes place, the relaxation suffers a typical slowing down which
depends on the interplay between the strength of the longitudinal field, the
density of excitations, and the direction of the initial polarisation. Even
when the initial magnetisation is aligned oppositely to the longitudinal field,

  $\bullet$ If $H$ is an atomic l.f.g.u. monoid, then every non-unit has only
finitely many factorizations (into atoms) that are ""minimal"" and ""pairwise
non-equivalent"" (with respect to some naturally defined relations on the free
monoid over the ""alphabet"" of atoms).
  $\bullet$ If $H$ is an acyclic l.f.g.u. monoid, then it is atomic; and
moreover, each element has only finitely many ""pairwise non-equivalent""

$\overset{\circ}{A}$) emission is critical for assessing the evolution of
planetary atmospheres and the habitability of M dwarf systems. Previous studies
from the HAbitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) program
showed the far- and near-UV (FUV, NUV) emission from M stars at various stages
of a stellar lifetime through photometric measurements from the Galaxy
Evolution Explorer (GALEX). The results revealed increased levels of
short-wavelength emission that remain elevated for hundreds of millions of
years. The trend for EUV flux as a function of age could not be determined
empirically because absorption by the interstellar medium prevents access to
the EUV wavelengths for the vast majority of stars. In this paper, we model the
evolution of EUV flux from early M stars to address this observational gap. We
present synthetic spectra spanning EUV to infrared wavelengths of 0.4 $\pm$
0.05 M$_{\odot}$ stars at five distinct ages between 10 and 5000 Myr, computed
with the PHOENIX atmosphere code and guided by the GALEX photometry. We model a
range of EUV fluxes spanning two orders of magnitude, consistent with the
observed spread in X-ray, FUV, and NUV flux at each epoch. Our results show
that the stellar EUV emission from young M stars is 100 times stronger than
field age M stars, and decreases as t$^{-1}$ after remaining constant for a few
hundred million years. This decline stems from changes in the chromospheric
temperature structure, which steadily shifts outward with time. Our models
reconstruct the full spectrally and temporally resolved history of an M star's
UV radiation, including the unobservable EUV radiation, which drives planetary
atmospheric escape, directly impacting a planet's potential for habitability.

is critical for urban planning and public policy development. However, it is a
challenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional
models, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and
limited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors
need to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods
ignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby
regions. To address these issues, we propose Geo-contextual Multitask Embedding
Learner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic
contextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first
construct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual
information. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of
graph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode
geographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are
used to model supply and demand characteristics. A multitask learning framework
is used to introduce stronger restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of the
embedding representation. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based
on the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model
using real-world datasets from New York City and the experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state of the art.

build customised fragment libraries for TFM. Results: We demonstrate that
predicted PB sequences for a query protein can be used to search for high
quality fragments that overall cover above 90% of the query. The fragments
generated are of minimum length of 11 residues, and fragments that cover more
than 30% of the query length were often obtained. Our work shows that PBs can
serve as a good way to extract structurally similar fragments from a database
of representatives of non-homologous structures and of the proteins that

attacks while training a shallow neural network in a regression setup. We focus
on doing supervised learning for a class of depth-2 finite-width neural
networks, which includes single-filter convolutional networks. In this class of
networks, we attempt to learn the network weights in the presence of a
malicious oracle doing stochastic, bounded and additive adversarial distortions
on the true output during training. For the non-gradient stochastic algorithm
that we construct, we prove worst-case near-optimal trade-offs among the
magnitude of the adversarial attack, the weight approximation accuracy, and the
confidence achieved by the proposed algorithm. As our algorithm uses
mini-batching, we analyze how the mini-batch size affects convergence. We also
show how to utilize the scaling of the outer layer weights to counter
output-poisoning attacks depending on the probability of attack. Lastly, we
give experimental evidence demonstrating how our algorithm outperforms
stochastic gradient descent under different input data distributions, including
instances of heavy-tailed distributions.

theory, the skin effects can also be interpreted as instability of spectra for
nonnormal (non-Hermitian) Hamiltonians. Applying the latter interpretation to
the former relation, we develop a theory of zero modes with quantum anomaly for
general Hermitian lattice systems. Our theory is applicable to a wide range of

systems. We relate exact zero modes and quasi-zero modes of a Hermitian system

measured by nonnormality of the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We also

continuum data, MM1 is resolved into a cluster of condensations. The magnetic
field structure in each clump is revealed by the polarized emission. We found a
trend of decreasing polarized emission fraction with increasing Stokes $I$

modified Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method), the plane-of-sky magnetic field

The total virial parameters in MM1-Core1 and MM4-Core4 are calculated to be

intensity gradient in the three clumps, and the magnetic field tends to be
aligned with the local gravity in MM1 and MM4 except for regions near the

regulating the gas collapse. Half of the outflows in MM4 and MM9 are found to
be aligned within 10$^{\circ}$ of the condensation-scale ($<$0.05 pc) magnetic

thermal Jeans fragmentation or turbulent Jeans fragmentation.

NGC 1068, which contains an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The effect of
diffuse dust heating by AGN (beyond the torus) was so far only investigated for
quasars. This additional dust heating source further contaminates the broadband
fluxes on which classic galaxy modelling tools rely to derive physical
properties. We aim to fit a realistic model to the observations of NGC 1068 and
quantify the contribution of the several dust heating sources. Our model is
able to reproduce the global spectral energy distribution of the galaxy. It
matches the resolved optical and infrared images fairly well, but deviates in
the UV and the submm. We find a strong wavelength dependency of AGN
contamination to the broadband fluxes. It peaks in the MIR, drops in the FIR,
but rises again at submm wavelengths. We quantify the contribution of the dust
heating sources in each 3D dust cell and find a median value of 83% for the
star formation component. The AGN contribution is measurable at the percentage
level in the disc, but quickly increases in the inner few 100 pc, peaking above
90%. This is the first time the phenomenon of an AGN heating the diffuse dust
beyond its torus is quantified in a nearby star-forming galaxy. NGC 1068 only
contains a weak AGN, meaning this effect can be stronger in galaxies with a
more luminous AGN. This could significantly impact the derived star formation

evidence that a family of gauged fermionic CFTs saturate bootstrap bounds and
can potentially be solved with the conformal bootstrap. We start by considering
the bootstrap for $SO(N)$ vector 4-point functions in general dimension $D$. In
the large $N$ limit, upper bounds on the scaling dimensions of the lowest
$SO(N)$ singlet and traceless symmetric scalars interpolate between two
solutions at $\Delta =D/2-1$ and $\Delta =D-1$ via generalized free field
theory. In 3D the critical $O(N)$ vector models are known to saturate the
bootstrap bounds and correspond to the kinks approaching $\Delta =1/2$ at large
$N$. We show that the bootstrap bounds also admit another infinite family of
kinks ${\cal T}_D$, which at large $N$ approach solutions containing free
fermion bilinears at $\Delta=D-1$ from below. The kinks ${\cal T}_D$ appear in
general dimensions with a $D$-dependent critical $N^*$ below which the kink
disappears. We also study relations between the bounds obtained from the
bootstrap with $SO(N)$ vectors, $SU(N)$ fundamentals, and $SU(N)\times SU(N)$
bi-fundamentals. We provide a proof for the coincidence between bootstrap
bounds with different global symmetries. We show evidence that the proper
symmetries of the underlying theories of ${\cal T}_D$ are subgroups of $SO(N)$,
and we speculate that the kinks ${\cal T}_D$ relate to the fixed points of
gauge theories coupled to fermions.

transport behavior, we present an ab initio study of electron scattering in

its Fermi surface in momentum space, the anisotropy of which is proposed to be
the origin of the axis-dependent conduction polarity. Further, we obtain the
overall anisotropic lifetime tensors in real space at different electron
chemical potentials and temperatures and discuss how they contribute to the
macroscopic thermopower. While we find that the contribution of the in-plane

Fermi surface alters the electron motion significantly in the presence of a
magnetic field, thus flipping the conduction polarity as measured via the Hall
effect. Our calculations and analysis of NaSn$_2$As$_2$ also suggests the
strong possibility of hydrodynamic electron flow in the system. Finally, our

distinguished from those produced by a comparable-mass mixed binary in which
one of the companions is a black hole. Low-mass black holes are interesting
because they could form in the aftermath of the coalescence of two neutron
stars, from the collapse of massive stars, from matter overdensities in the
primordial Universe, or as the outcome of the interaction between neutron stars
and dark matter. Gravitational waves carry the imprint of the internal
composition of neutron stars via the so-called tidal deformability parameter,
which depends on the stellar equation of state and is equal to zero for black
holes. We present a new data analysis strategy powered by Bayesian inference
and machine learning to identify mixed binaries, hence low-mass black holes,
using the distribution of the tidal deformability parameter inferred from
gravitational-wave observations.

understanding the differences in formation mechanisms between low- and
high-mass stars. The study of the general properties of these objects is
hampered by the fact that few and mostly serendipitously discovered sources are
known. Our goal is to identify new Herbig Ae/Be candidates to create a
homogeneous and well defined catalogue of these objects. We have applied
machine learning techniques to 4,150,983 sources with data from Gaia DR2,
2MASS, WISE, and IPHAS or VPHAS+. Several observables were chosen to identify
new Herbig Ae/Be candidates based on our current knowledge of this class, which
is characterised by infrared excesses, photometric variabilities, and H$\alpha$
emission lines. Classical techniques are not efficient for identifying new
Herbig Ae/Be stars mainly because of their similarity with classical Be stars,
with which they share many characteristics. By focusing on disentangling these
two types of objects, our algorithm has also identified new classical Be stars.
We have obtained a large catalogue of 8470 new pre-main sequence candidates and
another catalogue of 693 new classical Be candidates with a completeness of
$78.8\pm1.4\%$ and $85.5\pm1.2\%$, respectively. Of the catalogue of pre-main
sequence candidates, at least 1361 sources are potentially new Herbig Ae/Be
candidates according to their position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In
this study we present the methodology used, evaluate the quality of the
catalogues, and perform an analysis of their flaws and biases. For this
assessment, we make use of observables that have not been accounted for by the
algorithm and hence are selection-independent, such as coordinates and parallax
based distances. The catalogue of new Herbig Ae/Be stars that we present here
increases the number of known objects of the class by an order of magnitude.

observational evidence suggesting that GRBs are collimated jets; the direct
observation of orphan GRB afterglows would further support this model. An
optimal survey strategy is designed by coupling the PS1 survey with the
Subaru/Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) survey. The PS1 COSMOS survey, one of the survey
fields in the PS1 Medium Deep Survey (PS1/MDS), searches a field of 7 deg$^2$

The dense cadence of PS1/MDS is crucial for identifying transients, and the
deep magnitude reached by the HSC survey (R $\sim$ 26) is important for
evaluating potential GRB hosts. A transient classification method is employed
to select potential orphan GRB afterglow candidates. After a thorough analysis
of the transient and host galaxy properties, we conclude that there are no
candidates in this survey field. The null result implies that the consideration
of jet structures is essential for further orphan GRB afterglow surveys.

the presence of ionisation cones with different orientations depending on the

nebulae around AGNs at redshift z$\sim$3 to probe AGN emission and therefore
the validity of the AGN unification model at this redshift. We compare the
spatial morphology of 19 nebulae previously found around type I AGNs with a new
sample of 4 Ly$\alpha$ nebulae detected around type II AGNs. Using two
independent techniques, we find that nebulae around type II AGNs are more
asymmetric than around type I, at least at radial distances $r>30$~physical kpc
(pkpc) from the ionizing source. We conclude that the type I and type II AGNs
in our sample show evidence of different surrounding ionising geometries. This
suggests that the classical AGN unification model is also valid for
high-redshift sources. Finally, we discuss how the lack of asymmetry in the
inner parts (r$\lesssim$30 pkpc) and the associated high values of the HeII to
Ly$\alpha$ ratios in these regions could indicate additional sources of (hard)
ionizing radiation originating within or in proximity of the AGN host galaxies.
This work demonstrates that the morphologies of giant Ly$\alpha$ nebulae can be
used to understand and study the geometry of high redshift AGNs on

goal of submillimetre astronomy. Here, we present interferometric 650$\mu$m

leakers) is one of the primary, indirect methods of studying galaxy formation
in the epoch of reionization. However, not only has it proved challenging to
identify such systems, it also remains uncertain whether the low-redshift LyC
leakers are truly ""analogues"" of the sources that reionized the Universe. Here,
we use high-resolution cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulations to
examine whether simulated galaxies in the epoch of reionization share similar
emission line properties to observed LyC leakers at $z\sim3$ and $z\sim0$. We
find that the simulated galaxies with high LyC escape fractions ($f_{\rm esc}$)
often exhibit high O32 and populate the same regions of the R23-O32 plane as
$z\sim3$ LyC leakers. However, we show that viewing angle, metallicity, and
ionisation parameter can all impact where a galaxy resides on the O32-$f_{\rm
esc}$ plane. Based on emission line diagnostics and how they correlate with
$f_{\rm esc}$, lower-metallicity LyC leakers at $z\sim3$ appear to be good
analogues of reionization-era galaxies. In contrast, local [SII]-deficient
galaxies do not overlap with the simulated high-redshift LyC leakers on the
SII-BPT diagram; however, this diagnostic may still be useful for identifying
leakers. We use our simulated galaxies to develop multiple new diagnostics to
identify LyC leakers using IR and nebular emission lines. We show that our
model using only [CII]$_{\rm 158\mu m}$ and [OIII]$_{\rm 88\mu m}$ can identify
potential leakers from non-leakers from the local Dwarf Galaxy Survey. Finally,
we apply this diagnostic to known high-redshift galaxies and find that
MACS1149_JD1 at $z=9.1$ is the most likely galaxy to be actively contributing
to the reionization of the Universe.

this letter we show that integrability also features in the building blocks of

n-gon Feynman integrals in generic spacetime dimensions are invariant under a
massive Yangian symmetry. At two loops similar statements can be proven for
graphs built from two n-gons. At generic loop order we conjecture that all
graphs cut from regular tilings of the plane with massive propagators on the

tests for higher loops and legs. The observed Yangian extends the bosonic part
of the massive dual conformal symmetry that was found a decade ago on the
Coulomb branch of N=4 SYM theory. By translating the Yangian level-one
generators from dual to original momentum space, we introduce a massive
generalization of momentum space conformal symmetry. Even for non-dual
conformal integrals this novel symmetry persists. The Yangian can thus be
understood as the closure of massive dual conformal symmetry and this new
massive momentum space conformal symmetry, which suggests an interpretation via
AdS/CFT. As an application of our findings, we bootstrap the hypergeometric
building blocks for examples of massive Feynman integrals.

can qualitatively reproduce the observed relation between asymmetry parameter

correlation between the color of the main branch galaxies at $z_r=0.5$ and the
sum of the Star Formation Rates (SFRs) of the recently accreted galaxies, which
implies that star formation of the accreted galaxies has contributed to the
observed star formation of the massive (host) galaxies (ex situ star
formation). Furthermore, we find two blue and symmetric galaxies, candidates

simulation particles, halos or galaxies, and take advantage of the simple
geometry of the box and periodicity to remove almost all dependence on large
random particle catalogs. By working in configuration-space, both power spectra

estimate of the XUV-driven thermal escape arising from XUV photo-dissociation

constrain the shape of the attenuation curve by comparing the average flux

decrements, i.e., H$\alpha$-to-H$\beta$ luminosities. The average attenuation
curve for the high-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H)>8.5, corresponding to
$M_*\gtrsim10^{10.4}\,M_{\odot}$) has a shallow slope, identical to that of the
Calzetti local starburst curve, and a significant UV 2175A extinction bump that
is $\sim 0.5\times$ the strength of the Milky Way bump. On the other hand, the
average attenuation curve of the low-metallicity sample (12+log(O/H) $\sim
8.2-8.5$) has a steeper slope similar to that of the SMC curve, only consistent
with the Calzetti slope at the $3\sigma$ level. The UV bump is not detected in
the low-metallicity curve, indicating the relative lack of the small dust
grains causing the bump at low metallicities. Furthermore, we find that on
average the nebular reddening (E(B-V)) is a factor of 2 times larger than that
of the stellar continuum for galaxies with low metallicities, while the nebular
and stellar reddening are similar for galaxies with higher metallicities. The
latter is likely due to a high surface density of dusty clouds embedding the
star forming regions but also reddening the continuum in the high-metallicity
galaxies.

the way the planets form on the smallest scales, or the connection to
macroscopic parameters characterizing star-forming regions on the largest ones,
among others. In turn, mass accretion rate estimates depend on the accretion
paradigm assumed. For low-mass T Tauri stars with strong magnetic fields there
is consensus that magnetospheric accretion (MA) is the driving mechanism, but
the transfer of mass in massive young stellar objects with weak or negligible
magnetic fields probably occurs directly from the disk to the star through a
hot boundary layer (BL). The intermediate-mass Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars
bridge the gap between both previous regimes and are still optically visible
during the pre-main sequence phase, thus constituting a unique opportunity to
test a possible change of accretion mode from MA to BL. This review deals with
our estimates of accretion rates in HAeBes, critically discussing the different
accretion paradigms. It shows that although mounting evidence supports that MA
may extend to late-type HAes but not to early-type HBes, there is not yet a
consensus on the validity of this scenario versus the BL one. Based on MA and
BL shock modeling, it is argued that the ultraviolet regime could significantly
contribute in the future to discriminating between these competing accretion

for such accretion models becomes a function of the local radial distance

temperature-preserving standings shocks, we find that the post-shock part of

inclination), $\theta_{\rm obs}$. In binary neutron star (BNS) mergers it is of
special importance due to the role that it plays in the measurement of the
Hubble constant, $H_0$. The opening angle of the jet that these mergers launch,
$\theta_j$, is also of special interest. Following the detection of the first
BNS merger, GW170817, there were numerous attempts to estimate these angles
using the afterglow light curve, finding a wide range of values. Here we
provide a simple formula for the ratio $\theta_{\rm obs}/\theta_j$ based on the
afterglow light curve and show that this is the only quantity that can be
determined from the light curve alone. Namely, it is impossible to determine
each of the angles separately without additional information. Our result
explains the inconsistency of the values found by the various studies of
GW170817 that were largely driven by the different priors taken in each study.
Among the additional information that can be used to estimate $\theta_{\rm
obs}$ and $\theta_j$, the most useful is a VLBI measurement of the afterglow
image superluminal motion. An alternative is an identification of the afterglow
transition to the sub-relativistic phase. These observations are possible only
for mergers observed at small viewing angles, whose afterglow is significantly
brighter than the detector's threshold. We discuss the implications of these
results to measurements of $H_0$ using GW observations. We show that while the
viewing angle will be measured only in a small fraction of future BNS mergers,
it can significantly reduce the uncertainty in $H_0$ in each one of these
events, possibly to a level of 4-5\%. A minority of the mergers with high
precision measurements of this kind may dominate in the future the precision in
which $H_0$ will be measured using this method.

Uncertainty relations then arise by monotonicity of the relative entropies that
participate in the underlying entropic certainty. Examples and applications are
described in quantum field theories with global symmetries, where the COA are
formed by the charge-anticharge local operators (intertwiners) and the unitary
representations of the symmetry group (twists), and in theories with local

effect of an exposure on an outcome by using genetic variants as instrumental
variables. Mendelian randomization analyses which use variants from a single
genetic region (cis-MR) have gained popularity for being an economical way to
provide supporting evidence for drug target validation. This paper proposes
methods for cis-MR inference which use the explanatory power of many correlated
variants to make valid inferences even in situations where those variants only
have weak effects on the exposure. In particular, we exploit the highly
structured nature of genetic correlations in single gene regions to reduce the
dimension of genetic variants using factor analysis. These genetic factors are
then used as instrumental variables to construct tests for the causal effect of
interest. Since these factors may often be weakly associated with the exposure,
size distortions of standard t-tests can be severe. Therefore, we consider two
approaches based on conditional testing. First, we extend results of
commonly-used identification-robust tests to account for the use of estimated
factors as instruments. Secondly, we propose a test which appropriately adjusts
for first-stage screening of genetic factors based on their relevance. Our
empirical results provide genetic evidence to validate cholesterol-lowering
drug targets aimed at preventing coronary heart disease.

Approximate solutions of the mode equation have been found and verified against

the Hubble parameter during inflation $H_{\rm I}$, the equation of state

been determined, justifying the gravitational production as a viable mechanism
for vector dark matter. The results obtained in this paper are applicable

the issues become even worse. Traditional traffic management and control
systems fail to tackle this problem. Currently, the traffic lights at
intersections aren't adaptive and have fixed time delays. There's a necessity
of an optimized and sensible control system which would enhance the efficiency
of traffic flow. Smart traffic systems perform estimation of traffic density
and create the traffic lights modification consistent with the quantity of
traffic. We tend to propose an efficient way to estimate the traffic density on
intersection using image processing and machine learning techniques in real

estimate the traffic density. We use Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG),
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based approach for

performance criteria for linear positive systems as they can be characterized

linear positive impulsive and switched systems through the concept of hybrid
$L_1\times\ell_1$-gain. For LTI positive systems, the $L_\infty$-gain is known
to coincide with the $L_1$-gain of the transposed system and, as a consequence,
one can use linear copositive Lyapunov functions for characterizing the
$L_\infty$-gain of LTI positive systems. Unfortunately, this does not hold in
the time-varying setting and one cannot characterize the hybrid
$L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-gain of a linear positive impulsive system in terms
of the hybrid $L_1\times\ell_1$-gain of the transposed system. An alternative
approach based on the use of linear copositive max-separable Lyapunov functions
is proposed. We first prove very general necessary and sufficient conditions
characterizing the exponential stability and the $L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-
and $L_1\times\ell_1$-gains using linear max-separable copositive and linear
sum-separable copositive Lyapunov functions. Results characterizing the
stability and the hybrid $L_\infty\times\ell_\infty$-gain of linear positive
impulsive systems under arbitrary, constant, minimum, and range dwell-time
constraints are then derived from the previously obtained general results.
These conditions are then exploited to yield constructive convex stabilization
conditions via state-feedback. By reformulating linear positive switched
systems as impulsive systems with multiple jump maps, stability and
stabilization conditions are also obtained for linear positive switched
systems. It is notably proven that the obtained conditions generalize existing
ones of the literature.

stars in massive young and intermediate age stellar clusters. This bimodality
is seen as split main sequences at young ages and also has been recently
directly observed in the $Vsini$ distribution of stars within massive young and
intermediate age clusters. Previous models have invoked binary interactions as
the origin of this bimodality, although these models are unable to reproduce
all of the observational constraints on the problem. Here we suggest that such
a bimodal rotational distribution is set up early within a cluster's life,
i.e., within the first few Myr. Observations show that the period distribution
of low-mass ($\la 2 M_\odot$) pre-main sequence (PMS) stars is bimodal in many
young open clusters and we present a series of models to show that if such a
bimodality exists for stars on the PMS that it is expected to manifest as a
bimodal rotational velocity (at fixed mass/luminosity) on the main sequence for
stars with masses in excess of $\sim1.5$~\msun. Such a bimodal period
distribution of PMS stars may be caused by whether stars have lost (rapid
rotators) or been able to retain (slow rotators) their circumstellar discs
throughout their PMS lifetimes. We conclude with a series of predictions for
observables based on our model.

supernova 2019ehk in the star-forming galaxy M100 (d$\approx$16.2 Mpc) starting
10 hours after explosion and continuing for ~300 days. SN 2019ehk shows a
double-peaked optical light curve peaking at $t = 3$ and $15$ days. The first
peak is coincident with luminous, rapidly decaying $\textit{Swift}$-XRT
discovered X-ray emission ($L_x\approx10^{41}~\rm{erg~s^{-1}}$ at 3 days; $L_x
\propto t^{-3}$), and a Shane/Kast spectral detection of narrow H$\alpha$ and
He II emission lines ($v \approx 500$ km/s) originating from pre-existent
circumstellar material. We attribute this phenomenology to radiation from shock
interaction with extended, dense material surrounding the progenitor star at
$r<10^{15}$ cm and the resulting cooling emission. We calculate a total CSM
mass of $\sim$ $7\times10^{-3}$ $\rm{M_{\odot}}$ with particle density
$n\approx10^{9}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$. Radio observations indicate a significantly
lower density $n < 10^{4}\,\rm{cm^{-3}}$ at larger radii. The photometric and
spectroscopic properties during the second light curve peak are consistent with
those of Ca-rich transients (rise-time of $t_r =13.4\pm0.210$ days and a peak
B-band magnitude of $M_B =-15.1\pm0.200$ mag). We find that SN 2019ehk
synthesized $(3.1\pm0.11)\times10^{-2} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ of
${}^{56}\textrm{Ni}$ and ejected $M_{\rm ej} = (0.72\pm 0.040)~\rm{M_{\odot}}$
total with a kinetic energy $E_{\rm k}=(1.8\pm0.10)\times10^{50}~\rm{erg}$.
Finally, deep $\textit{HST}$ pre-explosion imaging at the SN site constrains
the parameter space of viable stellar progenitors to massive stars in the
lowest mass bin (~10 $\rm{M_{\odot}}$) in binaries that lost most of their He
envelope or white dwarfs. The explosion and environment properties of SN
2019ehk further restrict the potential WD progenitor systems to low-mass hybrid
HeCO WD + CO WD binaries.

construct the vacuum state for quantum particles as a Gaussian function of the

slightly change the characteristics of this singularity and tachyon particles
survive. Finally, we consider a model with the scalar field with the cusped

describe highly anisotropic radiation transport as can be expected in the

measured ratio of the thermal penetration depth of the applied thermal wave to
radius of curvature of the heating wire is 4.3. This result provides useful
design criteria for three-omega experiments by setting a lower bound for the
maximum ratio of thermal penetration depth to wire radius of curvature.

wall-bounded turbulence, using numerical approaches, has shown promise for drag
reduction. For practical implementation, opposition control is only realizable
if there is a degree of coherence between the sensor--actuator pairs of the
control system (these sensors and actuators should typically be wall-based to
avoid parasitic drag). As such, we here inspect the feasibility of real-time
control of the near-wall cycle, by considering the coherence between a
measurable wall-quantity, being the wall-shear stress fluctuations, and the
streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations in a turbulent boundary layer.
Synchronized spatial and temporal velocity data from numerical simulations at
$Re_\tau \approx 590$ and $ 2000$ are employed. It is shown that the spectral
energy of the streamwise velocity fluctuations that is stochastically
incoherent with wall signals is independent of Reynolds number in the near wall
region. Consequently, the streamwise energy-fraction that is stochastically
wall-coherent grows with Reynolds number due to the increasing range of
energetic large scales. This thus implies that a wall-based control system has
the ability to manipulate a larger portion of the total turbulence energy at
off-wall locations, at higher Reynolds numbers. Coherence values of 0.55 and
0.4, which are considerably lower than the maximum possible coherence 1, were
found between the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the near
wall peak in the energy spectrogram, respectively, and the streamwise
fluctuating friction velocity. This suggests that a closed-loop drag reduction
scheme targeting near wall cycle of streaks alone will be of limited success in
practice as the Reynolds number grows.

security (InfoSec) we see few, if any, high-impact ML techniques in deployed
systems, notwithstanding multiple reported successes in open literature. We
hypothesize that the failure of ML in making high-impacts in InfoSec are rooted
in a disconnect between the two communities as evidenced by a semantic gap---a
difference in how executables are described (e.g. the data and features
extracted from the data). Specifically, current datasets and representations
used by ML are not suitable for learning the behaviors of an executable and
differ significantly from those used by the InfoSec community. In this paper,
we survey existing datasets used for classifying malware by ML algorithms and
the features that are extracted from the data. We observe that: 1) the current
set of extracted features are primarily syntactic, not behavioral, 2) datasets
generally contain extreme exemplars producing a dataset in which it is easy to
discriminate classes, and 3) the datasets provide significantly different
representations of the data encountered in real-world systems. For ML to make
more of an impact in the InfoSec community requires a change in the data
(including the features and labels) that is used to bridge the current semantic
gap. As a first step in enabling more behavioral analyses, we label existing

same facts may lead to conflicting understandings if deliberate framing is
employed. Therefore, identifying media framing is a crucial step to
understanding how news media influence the public. Framing is, however,
difficult to operationalize and detect, and thus traditional media framing
studies had to rely on manual annotation, which is challenging to scale up to
massive news datasets. Here, by developing a media frame classifier that
achieves state-of-the-art performance, we systematically analyze the media
frames of 1.5 million New York Times articles published from 2000 to 2017. By
examining the ebb and flow of media frames over almost two decades, we show
that short-term frame abundance fluctuation closely corresponds to major
events, while there also exist several long-term trends, such as the gradually
increasing prevalence of the ``Cultural identity'' frame. By examining specific
topics and sentiments, we identify characteristics and dynamics of each frame.
Finally, as a case study, we delve into the framing of mass shootings,
revealing three major framing patterns. Our scalable, computational approach to
massive news datasets opens up new pathways for systematic media framing

with relevant information, such as biopsy-based malignancy labeling, or

learning methods. Such annotations are particularly difficult to obtain, due to
the subjective nature of the task, with high inter-observer variability

focused on manual feature extraction, while current approaches use auxiliary
tasks, such as a binary classification task (e.g. malignancy), for which
ground-true is more readily accessible. However, in a previous study, we have
shown that binary auxiliary tasks are inferior to the usage of a rough

spikes) which can potentially lead to higher energy-efficiency in neuromorphic
hardware implementations. Many works have shown that an SNN for inference can
be formed by copying the weights from a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
and setting the firing threshold for each layer as the maximum input received
in that layer. These type of converted SNNs require a large number of time
steps to achieve competitive accuracy which diminishes the energy savings. The
number of time steps can be reduced by training SNNs with spike-based
backpropagation from scratch, but that is computationally expensive and slow.
To address these challenges, we present a computationally-efficient training
technique for deep SNNs. We propose a hybrid training methodology: 1) take a
converted SNN and use its weights and thresholds as an initialization step for
spike-based backpropagation, and 2) perform incremental spike-timing dependent
backpropagation (STDB) on this carefully initialized network to obtain an SNN
that converges within few epochs and requires fewer time steps for input
processing. STDB is performed with a novel surrogate gradient function defined
using neuron's spike time. The proposed training methodology converges in less
than 20 epochs of spike-based backpropagation for most standard image
classification datasets, thereby greatly reducing the training complexity
compared to training SNNs from scratch. We perform experiments on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets for both VGG and ResNet architectures. We
achieve top-1 accuracy of 65.19% for ImageNet dataset on SNN with 250 time

the output of complex computer code. We consider the problem of extending an
initial experiment (set of model runs) sequentially to improve the emulator. A
sequential sampling approach based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation is
proposed that can be easily extended to a batch mode. This is a desirable
property since it saves the user time when parallel computing is available.
After fitting a GP to training data points, the expected squared LOO (ES-LOO)
error is calculated at each design point. ES-LOO is used as a measure to
identify important data points. More precisely, when this quantity is large at
a point it means that the quality of prediction depends a great deal on that
point and adding more samples nearby could improve the accuracy of the GP. As a
result, it is reasonable to select the next sample where ES-LOO is maximised.
However, ES-LOO is only known at the experimental design and needs to be
estimated at unobserved points. To do this, a second GP is fitted to the ES-LOO
errors and where the maximum of the modified expected improvement (EI)
criterion occurs is chosen as the next sample. EI is a popular acquisition
function in Bayesian optimisation and is used to trade-off between local/global
search. However, it has a tendency towards exploitation, meaning that its
maximum is close to the (current) ""best"" sample. To avoid clustering, a
modified version of EI, called pseudo expected improvement, is employed which
is more explorative than EI yet allows us to discover unexplored regions. Our
results show that the proposed sampling method is promising.

phenomenon of increasing levels of fragmentation in society into relatively
small and isolated groups that have been termed filter bubbles, or echo
chambers. These pose a number of threats to open societies, in particular, a
radicalisation in political, social or cultural issues, and a limited access to
facts. In this paper we show that these two phenomena might be tightly related.
We study a simple stochastic co-evolutionary model of a society of interacting
people. People are not only able to update their opinions within their social
context, but can also update their social links from collaborative to hostile,
and vice versa. The latter is implemented such that social balance is realised.
We find that there exists a critical level of interconnectedness, above which
society fragments into small sub-communities that are positively linked within
and hostile towards other groups. We argue that the existence of a critical
communication density is a universal phenomenon in all societies that exhibit
social balance. The necessity arises from the underlying mathematical structure
of a phase transition phenomenon that is known from the theory of a kind of
disordered magnets called spin glasses. We discuss the consequences of this
phase transition for social fragmentation in society.

schemes, beyond simple linear averaging used in classical techniques. One of
our key contributions is a novel self-supervised training setup that only
requires a set of high-resolution meshes for learning network weights. For any
training shape, we stochastically generate diverse low-resolution
discretizations of coarse counterparts, while maintaining a bijective mapping
that prescribes the exact target position of every new vertex during the
subdivision process. This leads to a very efficient and accurate loss function
for conditional mesh generation, and enables us to train a method that
generalizes across discretizations and favors preserving the manifold structure
of the output. During training we optimize for the same set of network weights
across all local mesh patches, thus providing an architecture that is not
constrained to a specific input mesh, fixed genus, or category. Our network
encodes patch geometry in a local frame in a rotation- and
translation-invariant manner. Jointly, these design choices enable our method
to generalize well, and we demonstrate that even when trained on a single

are all facing a long standing technical problem given by the need to recover
fundamental variables from those variables that are evolved in time. In the
relativistic case, this requires the numerical solution of a system of
nonlinear equations. Although several approaches are available, none has proven
completely reliable. A recent study comparing different methods showed that all
can fail, in particular for the important case of strong magnetization and
moderate Lorentz factors. Here, we propose a new robust, efficient, and
accurate solution scheme, along with a proof for the existence and uniqueness
of a solution, and analytic bounds for the accuracy. Further, the scheme allows
us to reliably detect evolution errors leading to unphysical states and
automatically applies corrections for typical harmless cases. A reference
implementation of the method is made publicly available as a software library.
The aim of this library is to improve the reliability of binary neutron star
merger simulations, in particular in the investigation of jet formation and
magnetically driven winds.

the famous sharpness principle by Gneiting et al. (2007) from probabilistic to

Special cases of this decomposition are well-known and widely used in

the driving forces behind forecast errors and complements classical forecast
evaluation methods. I discuss estimation of the decomposition via kernel

understanding of the structure of black holes has grown since the first
detection of gravitational waves. Many arguments that are put forward in order
to constraint alternative black hole models rely on substantial assumptions
such as perfect spherical symmetry, which implies absence of rotation. However,
given that astrophysical black holes will generally exhibit nonzero angular
momentum, realistic constraints must take into account the effects of rotation.
In this work we analyze the gravitational effect that rotation has on the
emission from the surface of ultracompact objects, by studying how angular
momentum affects the propagation of light rays. This allows us to evaluate the
reliability of the constraints derived for supermassive black holes (more
specifically, Sagittarius A* and M87*) assuming lack of rotation, as presented
in [Astrophys. J. 701, 1357 (2009); Astrophys. J. 805, 179 (2015)]. We find
that for rapidly spinning objects rotation can significantly affect the
escaping probability of photon emitted from the surface of the object, with a
significant increase at the equatorial regions and a decrease at the poles with
respect to the non-rotating case. For not so rapidly spinning black hole
candidates like Sagittarius A*, such modifications do not affect significantly
the present constraints, which are nevertheless weaker than originally supposed
due to the relativistic lensing here considered and additional phenomenological
parameters that describe basic processes such as absorption. However, taking
into account the angular dependence of the superficial emission of rapidly
spinning black hole mimickers will be necessary for future studies of objects
like e.g. M87*.

particularly towards understanding partonic energy loss in the QGP medium and
its related modifications of the jet shower and fragmentation. Since the QGP is
a colored medium, the extent of jet quenching and consequently, the transport
properties of the medium are expected to be sensitive to fundamental properties
of the jets such as the flavor of the parton that initiates the jet.
Identifying the jet flavor enables an extraction of the mass dependence in
jet-QGP interactions. We present a novel approach to tagging heavy-flavor jets

so dynamical friction strongly affects them. The radial distribution of BSS,
normalized to a reference population, appears bimodal in a fraction of Galactic
GCs, with a density peak in the core, a prominent zone of avoidance at
intermediate radii, and again higher density in the outskirts. The zone of
avoidance appears to be located at larger radii the more relaxed the host
cluster, acting as a sort of dynamical clock. We use a new method to compute
the evolution of the BSS radial distribution under dynamical friction and
diffusion. We evolve our BSS in the mean cluster potential under dynamical
friction plus a random fluctuating force, solving the Langevin equation with
the Mannella quasi symplectic scheme. This amounts to a new simulation method
which is much faster and simpler than direct N-body codes but retains their
main feature: diffusion powered by strong, if infrequent, kicks. We compute the
radial distribution of initially unsegregated BSS normalized to a reference
population as a function of time. We trace the evolution of its minimum,
corresponding to the zone of avoidance. We compare the evolution under kicks
extracted from a Gaussian distribution to that obtained using a Holtsmark
distribution. The latter is a fat tailed distribution which correctly models
the effects of close gravitational encounters. We find that the zone of
avoidance moves outwards over time, as expected based on observations, only
when using the Holtsmark distribution. Thus the correct representation of near
encounters is crucial to reproduce the dynamics of the system. We confirm and
extend earlier results that showed how the dynamical clock indicator depends
both on dynamical friction and effective diffusion powered by dynamical
encounters.

waveform inversion because it allows decreasing the non-linearity of the
problem, decreasing the dimension of the data space, better description of
attenuation, and handling efficiently multiple sources. Besides, performing
2.5D modelling is interesting when physical properties can be assumed invariant
in one horizontal dimension because it allows reducing drastically computation
requirements compared to the 3D case. In 2.5D, finite-difference methods can be
used to propagate the wave in two directions in space and a spatial Fourier
transform is performed in the third direction to get a full three dimensional
solution. With a simple central finite-difference implementation, second order
accuracy in space is obtained and up to twenty grid points per wavelength are
necessary to accurately simulate electromagnetic waves. Such a large number of
grid points will impact on the storage requirement associated with frequency
domain modelling. We propose a high accuracy algorithm to solve the frequency
domain electromagnetic wave equation by finite-differences in 2.5D. The
algorithm relies on a nine-point stencil to build weighted-averaging numerical
operators. The weights are chosen to minimize numerical dispersion and
anisotropy, which allows relaxing the requirements on grid cell size and thus
decreases computational costs by a factor of about 3.6 compared to the central
finite-difference method. This new algorithm reduces the numerical error
without increasing the numerical bandwidth of the matrix system to solve, and
can be easily transposed to 3D frequency domain modelling.

to take advantage of these system's tendency to rapidly settle into states that
are nearly axisymmetric, allowing for 2D evolution of secular timescales. We
implement this scheme in the spectral Einstein code and show the results of
application of this method to four test systems including viscosity, magnetic

be used to quickly allow already existing 3D infrastructure that makes use of
local coordinate system transformations to be made to run in axisymmetric 2D

nanoparticles (NPs) in a polymer matrix are promising for their functionality
and use as structural coatings, and also provide a unique platform to
understand polymer behavior under strong confinement. Previously, we developed
a novel technique to fabricate such nanocomposites at room temperature using
solvent-driven infiltration of polymer (SIP) into NP packings. In the SIP
process, a bilayer made of an underlying polymer film and a dense packing of
NPs is exposed to solvent vapor which induces condensation of the solvent into
the voids of the packing. The condensed solvent plasticizes the underlying
polymer film, inducing polymer infiltration into the solvent-filled voids in
the NP packing. In this work, we study the effect of confinement on the
kinetics of SIP and the final partitioning of polymer into the interstices of
the NP packing. We find that, while the dynamics of infiltration during SIP are
strongly dependent on confinement, the final extent of infiltration is
independent of confinement. The time for infiltration obeys a power law with
confinement, as defined by the ratio of the chain size and the pore size.
Qualitatively, the observed time scale is attributed to changes in
concentration regimes as infiltration proceeds, which lead to shifting
characteristic length scales in the system over time. When the concentration in
the pore exceeds the critical overlap concentration, the characteristic length
scale of the polymer is no longer that of the entire chain, but rather the
correlation length, which is smaller than the pore size. Therefore, at long
times, the extent of infiltration is independent of the confinement ratio.
Furthermore, favorable surface interactions between the polymer and the
nanoparticles enhance partitioning into the NP packing.

quantitative analysis. The model consists of a classical $SIR$ model with
diffusion, to which an additional compartment is added, formed by the infected
individuals travelling on a line of fast diffusion. Exchanges between
individuals on the line and in the rest of the domain are taken into account. A
classical transformation allows us to reduce the proposed model to a system
analogous to one we had previously introduced [5] to describe the enhancement
of biological invasions by lines of fast diffusion. We establish the existence
of a minimal spreading speed and we show that it may be quite large, even when

$\tilde{O}(\min\{m, \frac{m^{\rho(H)}}{\# H}\})$ and

fractional edge-cover of $H$ and $\# H$ is the number of copies of $H$ in $G$.
For any clique on $r$ vertices, i.e., $H=K_r$, our algorithm is almost optimal
as any algorithm that samples an $H$ from any distribution that has $\Omega(1)$
total probability mass on the set of all copies of $H$ must perform

Assadi, Kapralov and Khanna [ITCS 2018] and the lower bound by Eden and
Rosenbaum [APPROX 2018] for approximately counting cliques, our results suggest
that in our query model, approximately counting cliques is ""equivalent to""
exactly uniformly sampling cliques, in the sense that the query and time
complexities of exactly uniform sampling and randomized approximate counting
are within a polylogarithmic factor of each other. This stands in interesting
contrast to an analogous relation between approximate counting and almost

which a vehicle can perceive and react impacts the safety and efficacy of the

perceptual systems including object detection, segmentation, motion estimation,
and action recognition. The latency for perceptual systems based on point cloud
data can be dominated by the amount of time for a complete rotational scan
(e.g. 100 ms). This built-in data capture latency is artificial, and based on
treating the point cloud as a camera image in order to leverage camera-inspired
architectures. However, unlike camera sensors, most LiDAR point cloud data is
natively a streaming data source in which laser reflections are sequentially
recorded based on the precession of the laser beam. In this work, we explore
how to build an object detector that removes this artificial latency
constraint, and instead operates on native streaming data in order to
significantly reduce latency. This approach has the added benefit of reducing
the peak computational burden on inference hardware by spreading the
computation over the acquisition time for a scan. We demonstrate a family of
streaming detection systems based on sequential modeling through a series of
modifications to the traditional detection meta-architecture. We highlight how
this model may achieve competitive if not superior predictive performance with
state-of-the-art, traditional non-streaming detection systems while achieving
significant latency gains (e.g. 1/15'th - 1/3'rd of peak latency). Our results
show that operating on LiDAR data in its native streaming formulation offers
several advantages for self driving object detection -- advantages that we hope
will be useful for any LiDAR perception system where minimizing latency is

capacity and a set of variably sized items. The goal is to pack some of these
items such that they fill the knapsack as much as possible without ever
exceeding the capacity. The online version of this problem reveals the items
and their sizes not all at once but one by one. For each item, the algorithm
has to decide immediately whether to pack it or not. We consider a natural
variant of this online knapsack problem, which has been coined removable
knapsack and we denote by RemKnap. It differs from the classical variant by
allowing the removal of any packed item from the knapsack. Repacking is
impossible, however: Once an item is removed, it is gone for good.
  We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. It measures how many advice
bits an omniscient oracle needs to provide for an online algorithm to reach any
given competitive ratio, which is--understood in its strict sense--just the
algorithm's approximation factor. The online knapsack problem without
removability is known for its peculiar advice behavior involving three jumps in
competitivity. We show that the advice complexity of RemKnap is quite different
but just as interesting. The competitivity starts from the golden ratio when no
advice is given. It then drops down in small increments to (1 + epsilon) for a
constant amount of advice already, which requires logarithmic advice in the
classical version. Removability comes as no relief to the perfectionist,
however: Optimality still requires one full advice bit for every single item in
the instance as before.
  These results are particularly noteworthy from a structural viewpoint for the
exceptionally slow transition from near-optimality to optimality; such a steep
jump up from constant to full linear advice for just an infinitesimally small
improvement is unique among the online problems examined so far.

we develop a novel online learning framework defined over deterministic Markov

prove that if the Markov decision process is guaranteed to admit an oracle that
can simulate any given policy from any initial state with bounded loss -- a
condition that is satisfied in the DRACC problem -- then the online learning
problem can be solved with vanishing regret. Our proof technique is based on a
reduction to online learning with switching cost, in which an online decision
maker incurs an extra cost every time she switches from one arm to another. We
formally demonstrate this connection and further show how DRACC can be used in

(Goman-Khrabrov model) through a Kalman filter. The error of lift coefficient
estimates based only on a weighted-sum of the measured pressures are found to
be noisy and biased, which leads to inaccurate estimates. The estimate is
improved by including the predictive model in an conventional Kalman filter.
The Goman-Khrabrov model is shown to be a linear parameter-varying system and
can therefore be used in the Kalman filter without the need for linearization.
Additional improvement is realized by modifying the algorithm to provide more
accurate estimate of the lift coefficient. The improved Kalman filtering
approach results in a bias-free lift coefficient estimate that is more precise
than either the pressure-based estimate or the Goman-Khrabrov model on their
own. The new method will enable performance enhancements in aerodynamic systems

Neighbor (KNN), and Naive Bayes, and compare them with simple trilateration, in
terms of accuracy, precision, and complexity. We present a comprehensive
analysis between the techniques through the use of three popular IoT wireless

along with three experimental scenarios to verify results across multiple

evolutionary end state of oxygen-neon white-dwarfs (ONe WDs), linking them to
the formation of neutron star (NS) systems. However, there has been no direct
detection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect
observational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS
formation through AIC are still not well investigated. In this article, we
review recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e.,
the single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and
the CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the
double CO/ONe WD channels and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on
these progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios, the
initial parameter space and the related objects. For the single-degenerate
model, the pre-AIC systems could potentially be identified as supersoft X-ray
sources, symbiotics and cataclysmic variables, whereas the post-AIC systems
could be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and the resulting
low-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For
the double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs, whereas
the post-AIC systems are isolated NSs with peculiar properties. We also review
the predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs, and the
gravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources
in the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors. Recent
theoretical and observational constraints on the detection of AIC events are
summarized. In order to confirm the existence of the AIC process, and resolve
this long-term issue presented by current stellar evolution theories, more
numerical simulations and observational identifications are required.

adverse effects associated with chronic opioid use, such as constipation and
analgesic tolerance or related to NTS1 activation, like hypothermia. In in
vitro assays, JMV2009 exhibited high binding affinity for both NTS1 and NTS2,
improved proteolytic resistance as well as agonistic activities similar to NT,
inducing sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK and receptor internalization.
Intrathecal injection of JMV2009 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive
responses in the tail-flick test and almost completely abolished the
nociceptive-related behaviors induced by chemical somatic and visceral noxious
stimuli. Likewise, increasing doses of JMV2009 significantly reduced tactile
allodynia and weight bearing deficits in nerve-injured rats. Importantly,
chronic agonist treatment did not result in the development of analgesic
tolerance. Furthermore, JMV2009 did not cause constipation and was ineffective
in inducing hypothermia. These findings suggest that NT drugs can act as an

construction defines non-perturbative physics for the supergravity that is

matrix models and correspond to the cases $(2\Gamma{+}1,2)$ in the

played by a non-linear `string equation' that naturally incorporates $\Gamma$,

Here, half-integer $\Gamma$ also has an interpretation. In fact,
$\Gamma{=}{\pm}\frac12$ yields the cases $(0,2)$ and $(2,2)$ that were shown by

all make theoretical studies and computation challenging. This paper has two
aims; our first aim is to solve the theoretical and computational challenges in
detecting and identifying change points among covariance matrices from HD
functional data. The second aim is to provide computationally efficient and
tuning-free tools with a guaranteed stochastic error control. The change point
detection procedure is developed in the form of testing the homogeneity of
covariance matrices. The weak convergence of the stochastic process formed by
the test statistics is established under the ""large p, large T and small n""
setting. Under a mild set of conditions, our change point identification
estimator is proven to be consistent for change points in any location of a
sequence. Its rate of convergence depends on the data dimension, sample size,
number of repeated measurements, and signal-to-noise ratio. We also show that
our proposed computation algorithms can significantly reduce the computation
time and are applicable to real-world data such as fMRI data with a large

prior to the eruption, when viewed against the disk, the flux rope appeared as
a reverse S-shaped dark filament along the magnetic polarity inversion line.
During the eruption, the rope exhibited a ""hot channel"" structure in extreme
ultraviolet and soft X-ray passbands sensitive to ~10 MK plasma. The central
portion of the flux rope was nearly aligned with the line of sight, which
quickly developed into a teardrop-shaped dark cavity during the early phase of
the eruption. A long and thin plasma sheet formed below the cavity, interpreted
as the reconnection current sheet viewed edge-on. A nonthermal microwave source
was present at the location of the central current sheet, which extended upward
encompassing the dark cavity. A pair of nonthermal microwave sources were
observed for several minutes on both sides of the main flaring region. They
shared a similar temporal behavior and spectral property to the central
microwave source below the cavity, interpreted as the conjugate footpoints of
the erupting flux rope. These observations are broadly consistent with the
magnetic topology and the associated energy release scenario suggested in the

detection of nonthermal emission at conjugate flux rope footpoints provides
solid evidence of particle transport along an erupting magnetic flux rope.

objects which were formed rapidly and then ejected during the strong dynamical
interactions of massive stars and their disks. This scenario naturally explains
the similar timescales for the outflow of bullets and for the dynamical

observed high velocities of the bullets. In the second scenario, bullets are
formed via hydrodynamic instabilities in a massive, infrared-driven wind,
naturally explaining the high velocities and the morphology of outflow, but the
bullets are not required to be self-gravitating. The processes that created the
Orion fingers are likely not unique to this particular star-forming region and
may result in free-floating, high-velocity, core-less planets.

AI-based solutions can be used to support CT based quantitative reporting and

Percentage of Opacity (PO), can be automatically computed. However, COVID-19
has posed unique challenges to the development of AI, specifically concerning
the availability of appropriate image data and annotations at scale. In this
paper, we propose to use synthetic datasets to augment an existing COVID-19

(GAN) to inpaint COVID-19 related tomographic patterns on chest CTs from
patients without infectious diseases. Additionally, we leverage location priors
derived from manually labeled COVID-19 chest CTs patients to generate
appropriate abnormality distributions. Synthetic data are used to improve both
lung segmentation and segmentation of COVID-19 patterns by adding 20% of
synthetic data to the real COVID-19 training data. We collected 2143 chest CTs,

that synthetic data can help improve both lung segmentation (+6.02% lesion

way is a simple smearing of a matter distribution within the black hole. The
resulting structure is often known in the literature as a ""model inspired by
non-commutative geometry"". The second method involves a more fundamental
approach, in which the Hamiltonian formalism is utilized and a non-trivial
Poisson bracket is introduced between the configuration degrees of freedom, as
well as between the canonical momentum degrees of freedom. This is done in
terms of connection variables instead of the more common ADM variables.
Connection variables are utilized here since non-commutative effects are
usually inspired from the quantum theory, and it is the connection variables
that are used in some of the more promising modern theories of quantum gravity.
We find that in the first study, the singularity of the black holes can easily
be removed. In the second study, we find that introducing a non-trivial bracket
between the connections (the configuration variables) may delay the
singularity, but not necessarily eliminate it. However, by introducing a
non-trivial bracket between the densitized triads (the canonical momentum
variables) the singularity can generally be removed. In some cases, new
horizons also appear due to the non-commutativity.

different names for a gene and different network representations, generating

blockchain of arbitrary pools. First, we show that the equilibrium among $q$
identical pools, coinciding the result demonstrated by Eyal through game
theory, can be constructed using a topological approach. Second, if the pools
are of different size, we show that (i) if the blockchain's pools exhibit two
distinct sizes, an equilibrium can be reached, and (ii) if the blockchain has
at least three distinct pool sizes, there does not exist an equilibrium.

human emotions also spread in online social media. However, the mechanisms
underlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings
spread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social
network, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and
spatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using
conventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are
collection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals,
online social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the
perspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the
analysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger
travels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate
different communities and break free of local traps because strangers share
such content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that
weaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage
metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative
long-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the
mechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive
proliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the
contagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative
impact.

previously observed in multiple quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) ferromagnetic

spin Hall current can excite coherent auto-oscillatory dynamics in
quasi-one-dimensional (1D) ferromagnetic nanowires but not in
quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic films. Here we study the 1D to 2D
dimensional crossover of current-driven magnetization dynamics in wire-based
Pt/$\mathrm{Ni}_{80}\mathrm{Fe}_{20}$ bilayer spin Hall oscillators via varying
the wire width. We find that increasing the wire width results in an increase
of the number of excited auto-oscillatory modes accompanied by a decrease of
the amplitude and coherence of each mode. We also observe a crossover from a
hard to a soft onset of the auto-oscillations with increasing the wire width.
The amplitude of auto-oscillations rapidly decreases with increasing
temperature suggesting that interactions of the phase-coherent auto-oscillatory
modes with incoherent thermal magnons plays an important role in suppression of
the auto-oscillatory dynamics. Our measurements set the upper limit on the
dimensions of an individual spin Hall oscillator and elucidate the mechanisms
leading to suppression of coherent auto-oscillations with increasing oscillator

problem of pixel distortion and stereo mismatch after translation. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end training framework with domain translation and
stereo matching networks to tackle this challenge. First, joint optimization
between domain translation and stereo matching networks in our end-to-end
framework makes the former facilitate the latter one to the maximum extent.
Second, this framework introduces two novel losses, i.e., bidirectional
multi-scale feature re-projection loss and correlation consistency loss, to
help translate all synthetic stereo images into realistic ones as well as
maintain epipolar constraints. The effective combination of above two
contributions leads to impressive stereo-consistent translation and disparity
estimation accuracy. In addition, a mode seeking regularization term is added
to endow the synthetic-to-real translation results with higher fine-grained
diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework on bridging the synthetic-to-real domain gap on stereo matching.

based on Discrete Modal Decomposition (DMD) is introduced, to extend the group
of space and frequency based features. These new features are called modal
features. Initially aiming to decompose a signal into a modal basis built from
a vibration mechanics problem, the DMD projection is applied to images in order
to extract modal features with two approaches. The first one, called full scale
DMD, consists in exploiting directly the decomposition resulting coordinates as
features. The second one, called filtering DMD, consists in using the DMD modes
as filters to obtain features through a local transformation process.
Experiments are performed on image texture classification tasks including
several widely used data bases, compared to several classic feature extraction
methods. We show that the DMD approach achieves good classification
performances, comparable to the state of the art techniques, with a lower

2011) generalized their algorithm and analysis to the vertex-weighted case.
Little is known, however, about the most general edge-weighted problem aside
from the trivial $1/2$-competitive greedy algorithm. In this paper, we present
the first online algorithm that breaks the long-standing $1/2$ barrier and
achieves a competitive ratio of at least $0.5086$. In light of the hardness
result of Kapralov, Post, and Vondr\'ak (SODA 2013) that restricts beating a
$1/2$ competitive ratio for the more general problem of monotone submodular
welfare maximization, our result can be seen as strong evidence that
edge-weighted bipartite matching is strictly easier than submodular welfare
maximization in the online setting.
  The main ingredient in our online matching algorithm is a novel subroutine
called online correlated selection (OCS), which takes a sequence of pairs of
vertices as input and selects one vertex from each pair. Instead of using a
fresh random bit to choose a vertex from each pair, the OCS negatively
correlates decisions across different pairs and provides a quantitative measure
on the level of correlation. We believe our OCS technique is of independent
interest and will find further applications in other online optimization
problems.

topology characters and the spreading dynamics on complex networks. While
random walk is widely used and is proven effective in many community detection
algorithms, there still exists two major defects: (i) the maximal length of
random walk is too large to distinguish the clustering information if using the
average step of all possible random walks; (ii) the useful community
information at all other step lengths are missed if using a pre-assigned
maximal length. In this paper, we propose a novel community detection method
based on the first passage probabilities (FPPM), equipped with a new similarity
measure that incorporates the complete structural information within the
maximal step length. Here the diameter of the network is chosen as an
appropriate boundary of random walks which is adaptive to different networks.
Then we use the hierarchical clustering to group the vertices into communities
and further select the best division through the corresponding modularity
values. Finally, a post-processing strategy is designed to integrate the
unreasonable small communities, which significantly improves the accuracy of
community division. Surprisingly, the numerical simulations show that FPPM
performs best compared to several classic algorithms on both synthetic
benchmarks and real-world networks, which reveals the universality and
effectiveness of our method.

world-wide and 70% of the fields in Asia and Africa are small. The lack of
adequate labeled images for small fields, huge variations in their color,
texture, and shape, and faint boundary lines separating them make it difficult
to develop an end-to-end learning model for detecting such fields. Hence, in
this paper, we present a multi-stage approach that uses a combination of
machine learning and image processing techniques. In the first stage, we
leverage state-of-the-art edge detection algorithms such as holistically-nested
edge detection (HED) to extract first-level contours and polygons. In the
second stage, we propose image-processing techniques to identify polygons that
are non-fields, over-segmentations, or noise and eliminate them. The next stage
tackles under-segmentations using a combination of a novel ``cut-point'' based
technique and localized second-level edge detection to obtain individual
parcels. Since a few small, non-cropped but vegetated or constructed pockets
can be interspersed in areas that are predominantly croplands, in the final
stage, we train a classifier for identifying each parcel from the previous
stage as an agricultural field or not. In an evaluation using high-resolution
imagery, we show that our approach has a high F-Score of 0.84 in areas with
large fields and reasonable accuracy with an F-Score of 0.73 in areas with

thermal relic cross sections for dark matter of mass below $\cal{O}$(10) GeV.
However, such limits typically neglect the possibility that dark matter may
annihilate to assumed invisible or hard-to-detect final states, such as
neutrinos. This is a difficult paradigm to probe due to the weak neutrino
interaction cross section. Considering dark matter annihilation in the Galactic

can be probed by HyperK for annihilation to muon or neutrino final states, and
discuss uncertainties associated with the dark matter halo profile. For

goal of flat optics. Despite the enormous progress of this technology, there
are still critical challenges for real world applications due to a limited
efficiency in the visible, on average lower than $60\%$, which originates by
absorption losses in wavelength thick ($\approx 500$nm) structures. Another
issue is the realization of on-demand optical components for controlling
vectorial light at visible frequencies simultaneously in both reflection and
transmission, and with a predetermined wavefront shape. In this work, we
developed an inverse design approach that allows the realization of highly
efficient (up to $99\%$) ultra-flat (down to $50$nm thick) optics for vectorial
light control and broadband input-output responses on a desired wavefront
shape. The approach leverages on a hidden network of universal approximators,
which exist in the physical layer of suitably engineered semiconductor
nanostructures. Near unity performance results from the ultra-flat nature of
these surfaces, which reduces absorption losses to almost negligible values.
Experimentally, we discuss polarizing beam splitters, comparing their
performances with the best results obtained from both direct and inverse design
techniques, and new flat-optics components represented by dichroic mirrors and

two sub-pixels, overcoming the limitations of conventional LCD/OLED

the multiplicative relations between the roots of a univariate polynomial has
drawn much attention in the field of computer algebra. As is known, almost all
irreducible polynomials with integer coefficients have only trivial exponent
lattices. However, the algorithms in the literature have difficulty in proving
such triviality for a generic polynomial. In this paper, the relations between
the Galois group (respectively, \emph{the Galois-like groups}) and the
triviality of the exponent lattice of a polynomial are investigated. The
$\bbbq$\emph{-trivial} pairs, which are at the heart of the relations between
the Galois group and the triviality of the exponent lattice of a polynomial,
are characterized. An effective algorithm is developed to recognize these
pairs. Based on this, a new algorithm is designed to prove the triviality of
the exponent lattice of a generic irreducible polynomial, which considerably
improves a state-of-the-art algorithm of the same type when the polynomial
degree becomes larger. In addition, the concept of the Galois-like groups of a

and, more importantly, a sufficient and necessary condition is given for a
polynomial (which is not necessarily irreducible) to have trivial exponent

accentuate interactions and activate valley degrees of freedom. Practical
applications of 2D magnetism will likely require room-temperature operation,
air stability, and (for magnetic semiconductors) the ability to achieve optimal

Ferromagnetism peaks at an intermediate vanadium concentration of a few atomic
percent and decreases for higher concentrations, which is consistent with
quenching due to orbital hybridization at closer vanadium-vanadium spacings, as
supported by transmission electron microscopy, magnetometry and
first-principles calculations. Room-temperature two-dimensional dilute magnetic

Previous studies found that if the mass-accretion rate is greater than a
critical value, the He-accreting CO WD will undergo inwardly propagating
(off-centre) carbon ignition when it increases its mass close to the
Chandrasekhar limit. The inwardly propagating carbon flame was supposed to
reach the centre by previous works, leading to the production of an oxygen-neon
(ONe) WD that may collapse into a neutron star but not an SN Ia. However, it is
still uncertain how the carbon flame propagates under the effect of mixing
mechanisms. In the present work, we aim to investigate the off-centre carbon
burning of the He-accreting CO WDs by considering the effect of convective
mixing. We found that the temperature of the flame is high enough to burn the
carbon into silicon-group elements in the outer part of the CO core even if the
convective overshooting is considered, but the flame would quench somewhere
inside the WD, resulting in the formation of a C-O-Si WD. Owing to the
inefficiency of thermohaline mixing, the C-O-Si WD may explode as an SN Ia if
it continues to grow in mass. Our radiation transfer simulations show that the
SN ejecta with the silicon-rich outer layer will form high-velocity absorption
lines in Si II, leading to some similarities to a class of the high-velocity
SNe Ia in the spectral evolution. We estimate that the birthrate of SNe Ia with
Si-rich envelope is ~ 10^(-4)/yr in our galaxy.

choose a global frame that does not correspond to the frame of any inertial

for constructing finite abstractions of continuous-time continuous-space

that describe joint dissipativity-type properties of subsystems and their
abstractions. By utilizing those stochastic storage functions, one can
establish a relation between continuous-time continuous-space stochastic
systems and their finite counterparts while quantifying probabilistic distances
between their output trajectories. Consequently, one can employ the finite
system as a suitable substitution of the continuous-time one in the controller
design process with a guaranteed error bound. In this respect, we first
leverage dissipativity-type compositional conditions for the compositional
quantification of the distance between the interconnection of continuous-time
continuous-space stochastic systems and that of their discrete-time (finite or
infinite) abstractions. We then consider a specific class of stochastic affine
systems and construct their finite abstractions together with their
corresponding stochastic storage functions. The effectiveness of the proposed
results is demonstrated by applying them to a temperature regulation in a
circular network containing 100 rooms and compositionally constructing a
discrete-time abstraction from its original continuous-time dynamic. The
constructed discrete-time abstraction is then utilized as a substitute to

While the incompressible Navier-Stokes system is discretized using a stabilized
Petrov-Galerkin procedure, the multibody structural system consists of a
generic interaction of multiple components such as rigid body, beams and
flexible thin shells along with various types of joints and connections among
them. A co-rotational framework is utilized for the category of small strain
problems where the displacement of the body is decomposed into a rigid body
rotation and a small strain component. This assumption simplifies the
structural equations and allows for the incorporation of multiple bodies (rigid
as well as flexible) in the system. The displacement and rotation constraints
at the joints are imposed by a Lagrange multiplier method. The equilibrium
conditions at the fluid-structure interface are satisfied by the transfer of
tractions and structural displacements via the radial basis function approach,
which is globally conservative. For the coupled stability in low
structure-to-fluid mass ratio regimes, a nonlinear iterative force correction
scheme is employed in the partitioned staggered predictor-corrector scheme. The
convergence and generality of the radial basis function mapping are analyzed by
carrying out systematic error analysis of the transfer of fluid traction across
the non-matching fluid-structure interface where a third-order of convergence
is observed. The proposed aeroelastic framework is then validated by
considering a flow across a flexible pitching plate configuration with
serration at the trailing edge. Finally, we demonstrate the flow across a

interference between the qubit probe signal and sideband transition. From the
width and the depth of the dip, we are able to extract the single-photon
linewidth of the resonator from an analytical model. Working in a previously
unexplored regime in which the qubit has a larger linewidth than the resonator
reduces the technical challenge of making a high-coherence qubit and is
advantageous for remaining in the weakly-invasive limit of coupling to the
resonator. Furthermore, the sideband and the dispersive coupling between the
resonator and the qubit can be tuned $in~situ$ controlling the strength of the
sideband drive power. This $in-situ$ tuneability allows the technique to be
applied for efficient measurement of the resonator loss rate for any quality
factor below a fixed upper bound, on the order of $10^8$ for our device,
allowing a wide range of quality factors to probed using a single design.

  Routing",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, a learning-based optimal transportation algorithm for
autonomous taxis and ridesharing vehicles is presented. The goal is to design a
mechanism to solve the routing problem for multiple autonomous vehicles and
multiple customers in order to maximize the transportation company's profit. As
a result, each vehicle selects the customer whose request maximizes the
company's profit in the long run. To solve this problem, the system is modeled
as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using past customers data. By solving the
defined MDP, a centralized high-level planning recommendation is obtained,
where this offline solution is used as an initial value for the real-time
learning. Then, a distributed SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm is
proposed to capture the model errors and the environment changes, such as
variations in customer distributions in each area, traffic, and fares, thereby
providing optimal routing policies in real-time. Vehicles, or agents, use only
their local information and interaction, such as current passenger requests and
estimates of neighbors' tasks and their optimal actions, to obtain the optimal
policies in a distributed fashion. An optimal adaptive rate is introduced to
make the distributed SARSA algorithm capable of adapting to changes in the
environment and tracking the time-varying optimal policies. Furthermore, a
game-theory-based task assignment algorithm is proposed, where each agent uses
the optimal policies and their values from distributed SARSA to select its
customer from the set of local available requests in a distributed manner.
Finally, the customers data provided by the city of Chicago is used to validate
the proposed algorithms.

is the right semantic treatment of leaks via termination? On the one hand, the
potential harm of untrusted code calls for strong progress-sensitive security.
On the other hand, when the code is trusted to not aggressively exploit
termination channels, practical concerns, such as permissiveness of the
enforcement, make a case for settling for weaker, progress-insensitive
security. This binary situation, however, provides no suitable middle point for
systems that mix trusted and untrusted code. This paper connects the two
extremes by reframing progress-insensitivity as a particular form of
declassification. Our novel semantic condition reconciles progress-insensitive
security as a declassification bound on the so-called progress knowledge in an
otherwise progress or timing sensitive setting. We show how the new condition
can be soundly enforced using a mostly standard information-flow monitor. We
believe that the connection established in this work will enable other
applications of ideas from the literature on declassification to progress
insensitivity.

privacy-preservation in a realistic setting. The grid operator produces a price
signal that varies with the energy demand. We propose an extension to a
multi-agent, deep actor-critic algorithm to address partial observability and
the perceived non-stationarity of the environment from the agent's viewpoint.
This algorithm learns a centralized critic that coordinates training of
decentralized agents. Our approach thus uses centralized learning but

Its influence on Brownian motion remains, however, mostly unexplored. Here, we
investigate its role in nonlinear transport and diffusion within a paradigmatic
model of tilted washboard potential. In this model, a giant enhancement of
driven diffusion over its potential-free limit presents a well-established
paradoxical phenomenon. In the overdamped limit, it occurs at a critical tilt
of vanishing potential barriers. However, for weak damping, it takes place
surprisingly at another critical tilt, where the potential barriers are clearly
expressed. Recently we showed that Basset force could make such a diffusion
enhancement enormously large. In this paper, we discover that even for
moderately strong damping, where the overdamped theory works very well when the
memory effects are negligible, substantial hydrodynamic memory unexpectedly
makes a strong impact. First, the diffusion boost occurs at non-vanishing
potential barriers and can be orders of magnitude larger. Second, transient
anomalous diffusion regimes emerge over many time decades and potential
periods. Third, particles' mobility can also be dramatically enhanced, and a
long transient super-transport regime emerges.

When the qubit-resonator couplings are allowed to vary, its peak value is
enhanced monotonically by increasing the greatest coupling strength to one of

However, it is difficult to trust decisions made by such methods since their
inner working and decision logic is hidden from the user. Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) refers to systems that try to explain how a
black-box AI model produces its outcomes. Post-hoc XAI methods approximate the
behavior of a black-box by extracting relationships between feature values and
the predictions. Perturbation-based and decision set methods are among commonly
used post-hoc XAI systems. The former explanators rely on random perturbations
of data records to build local or global linear models that explain individual
predictions or the whole model. The latter explanators use those feature values
that appear more frequently to construct a set of decision rules that produces
the same outcomes as the target black-box. However, these two classes of XAI
methods have some limitations. Random perturbations do not take into account
the distribution of feature values in different subspaces, leading to
misleading approximations. Decision sets only pay attention to frequent feature
values and miss many important correlations between features and class labels
that appear less frequently but accurately represent decision boundaries of the
model. In this paper, we address the above challenges by proposing an
explanation method named Confident Itemsets Explanation (CIE). We introduce
confident itemsets, a set of feature values that are highly correlated to a
specific class label. CIE utilizes confident itemsets to discretize the whole
decision space of a model to smaller subspaces.

dependability (safety, reliability, availability, maintainability and IT
security) analysis and trade-off analysis. The proposed approach is called DPN
(Dependability Priority Numbers) and allows the comparison of different actual
dependability characteristics of a systems with its target values and evaluates
them regarding trade-off analysis criteria. Therefore, the target values of
system dependability characteristics are taken as requirements, while the
actual value of a specific system design are provided by quantitative and
qualitative dependability analysis (FHA, FMEA, FMEDA, of CFT-based FTA). The
DPN approach evaluates the fulfillment of individual target requirements and
perform trade-offs between analysis objectives. We present the workflow and
meta-model of the DPN approach, and illustrate our approach using a case study
on a brake warning contact system. Hence, we demonstrate how the model-based
DPNs improve system dependability by selecting the project crucial dependable
design alternatives or measures.

  networks","11 pages, 5 figures, 3 Tables,",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The overfitting is one of the cursing subjects in the deep learning field. To
solve this challenge, many approaches were proposed to regularize the learning
models. They add some hyper-parameters to the model to extend the
generalization; however, it is a hard task to determine these hyper-parameters
and a bad setting diverges the training process. In addition, most of the
regularization schemes decrease the learning speed. Recently, Tai et al. [1]
proposed low-rank tensor decomposition as a constrained filter for removing the
redundancy in the convolution kernels of CNN. With a different viewpoint, we
use Low-Rank matrix Factorization (LRF) to drop out some parameters of the
learning model along the training process. However, this scheme similar to [1]
probably decreases the training accuracy when it tries to decrease the number
of operations. Instead, we use this regularization scheme adaptively when the
complexity of a layer is high. The complexity of any layer can be evaluated by
the nonlinear condition numbers of its learning system. The resulted method
entitled ""AdaptiveLRF"" neither decreases the training speed nor vanishes the
accuracy of the layer. The behavior of AdaptiveLRF is visualized on a noisy
dataset. Then, the improvements are presented on some small-size and
large-scale datasets. The preference of AdaptiveLRF on famous dropout
regularizers on shallow networks is demonstrated. Also, AdaptiveLRF competes
with dropout and adaptive dropout on the various deep networks including
MobileNet V2, ResNet V2, DenseNet, and Xception. The best results of
AdaptiveLRF on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets are 98%, 94.1% F-measure, and 97.9%,
94% accuracy. Finally, we state the usage of the LRF-based loss function to
improve the quality of the learning model.

It focuses on the participating methods and final results. The challenge
addresses the real world setting, where paired true high and low-resolution
images are unavailable. For training, only one set of source input images is
therefore provided along with a set of unpaired high-quality target images. In
Track 1: Image Processing artifacts, the aim is to super-resolve images with
synthetically generated image processing artifacts. This allows for
quantitative benchmarking of the approaches \wrt a ground-truth image. In Track
2: Smartphone Images, real low-quality smart phone images have to be
super-resolved. In both tracks, the ultimate goal is to achieve the best
perceptual quality, evaluated using a human study. This is the second challenge
on the subject, following AIM 2019, targeting to advance the state-of-the-art

a deep learning based medical image classifier by verifying that the model
learns and utilizes similar disease-related concepts as described and employed
by dermatologists. We used a well-trained and high performing neural network
developed by REasoning for COmplex Data (RECOD) Lab for classification of three
skin tumours, i.e. Melanocytic Naevi, Melanoma and Seborrheic Keratosis and
performed a detailed analysis on its latent space. Two well established and
publicly available skin disease datasets, PH2 and derm7pt, are used for
experimentation. Human understandable concepts are mapped to RECOD image
classification model with the help of Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs),
introducing a novel training and significance testing paradigm for CAVs. Our
results on an independent evaluation set clearly shows that the classifier
learns and encodes human understandable concepts in its latent representation.
Additionally, TCAV scores (Testing with CAVs) suggest that the neural network
indeed makes use of disease-related concepts in the correct way when making

medical practitioners on CAD but also serve as a stepping stone for further
development of CAV-based neural network interpretation methods.

basis, however in reality, the yield of one species depends, not only on its
own fishing level, but that of other species. We show that bold assumptions
about the effect of interacting species on MSY are made when managing on a
single-species basis, often leading to inconsistent and conflicting advice,
demonstrating the requirement of a multispecies MSY (MMSY). Although there are
several definitions of MMSY, there is no consensus. Furthermore, calculating a
MMSY can be difficult as there are many models, of varying complexity, each
with their own strengths and weaknesses, and the value if MMSY can be sensitive
to the model used. Here, we use an ensemble model to combine different
multispecies models, exploiting their individual strengths and quantifying
their uncertainties and discrepancies, to calculate a more robust MMSY. We
demonstrate this by calculating a MMSY for nine species in the North Sea. We
found that it would be impossible to fish at single-species MSY and that MMSY
led to higher yields and revenues than current levels.

Mironov construction of lagrangian cycles itself can be directly extended to

an anti - holomorphic involution such that the real part $X_{\mathbb{R}}

effects of the learning rate, comparatively few papers concentrate on the
effect of batch size. In this paper, we analyze how increasing batch size
affects gradient direction, and propose to evaluate the stability of gradients
with their angle change. Based on our observations, the angle change of
gradient direction first tends to stabilize (i.e. gradually decrease) while
accumulating mini-batches, and then starts to fluctuate. We propose to
automatically and dynamically determine batch sizes by accumulating gradients
of mini-batches and performing an optimization step at just the time when the
direction of gradients starts to fluctuate. To improve the efficiency of our
approach for large models, we propose a sampling approach to select gradients
of parameters sensitive to the batch size. Our approach dynamically determines
proper and efficient batch sizes during training. In our experiments on the WMT

first-principle methods that can solve the fundamental Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian
of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics efficiently. A possible way to
extend well-established electronic-structure methods to this situation is to
embed the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a higher-dimensional light-matter hybrid
auxiliary configuration space. In this work we show the importance of the
resulting hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics of the polaritons, which are the new
fundamental particles of the ``photon-dressed'' Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for
systems in cavities. We show that violations of these statistics can lead to
unphysical results. We present an efficient way to ensure the proper symmetry
of the underlying wave functions by enforcing representability conditions on
the dressed one-body reduced density matrix. We further present a general
prescription how to extend a given first-principles approach to polaritons and
as an example introduce polaritonic Hartree-Fock theory. While being a
single-reference method in polariton space, polaritonic Hartree-Fock is a
multi-reference method in the electronic space, i.e. it describes electronic
correlations. We also discuss possible applications to polaritonic QEDFT. We
apply this theory to a lattice model and find that the more delocalized the
bound-state wave function of the particles is, the stronger it reacts to
photons. The main reason is that within a small energy range many states with
different electronic configurations are available as opposed to a strongly
bound (and hence energetically separated) ground-state wave function. This
indicates that under certain conditions coupling to the quantum vacuum of a
cavity can indeed modify ground state properties.

3-reflective billiards (Yu.M.Baryshnikov). All the 3-reflective spherical
billiards were classified in a paper by V.Blumen, K.Kim, J.Nance, V.Zharnitsky:
the boundary of each of them lies in three orthogonal big circles. In the
present paper we study the analogue of Ivrii's Conjecture for projective
billiards introduced by S.Tabachnikov. In two dimensions there exists a
3-reflective projective billiard, the so-called right-spherical billiard, which
is the projection of a spherical 3-reflective billiard. We show that the only
3-reflective planar projective billiard with piecewise smooth boundary is the
above-mentioned right-spherical billiard. In higher dimensions, we prove the
non-existence of 3-reflective projective billiards with piecewise smooth
boundary, and also the non-existence of projective billiards with piecewise
smooth boundary having a subset of triangular orbits of non-zero measure in the
phase space.

the logarithmic mean velocity overlap layer at a wall distance of the order of
$10^3$ inner units. Between $y^+\approx 150$, the start of the overlap layer in
zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layers, and $y^+\approx 10^3$, the
Superpipe profile is modeled equally well by a power law or a log-law with a
larger slope than in the overlap layer. In this paper it is shown that the mean
velocity profile in turbulent plane channel flow exhibits analogous
characteristics, namely a sudden decrease of logarithmic slope (increase of
$\kappa$) at a $y^+_{\mathrm{break}}\approx 600$, which marks the start of the
actual overlap layer. This demonstration results from the first construction of
the complete inner and outer asymptotic expansions up to order
$\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{Re}_\tau)^{-1}$ from mean velocity profiles of direct
numerical simulations (DNS) at moderate Reynolds numbers. A preliminary
analysis of a Couette flow DNS, on the other hand, yields an increase of
logarithmic slope (decrease of $\kappa$) at a $y^+_{\mathrm{break}}\approx
400$. The correlation between the sign of the slope change and the flow
symmetry motivates the hypothesis that the breakpoint between the possibly
universal short inner logarithmic region and the actual overlap log-law
corresponds to the penetration depth of large-scale turbulent structures
originating from the opposite wall.

one of the main problems of muon spectroscopy, and computational techniques
that make use of quantum chemistry simulations can be of great help when
looking for this stopping site. The most thorough approach would require the
use of simulations - such as Density Functional Theory (DFT)- to test and
optimise multiple possible sites, accounting for the effect that the added muon
has on its surroundings. However, this can be computationally expensive and
sometimes unnecessary. Hence, in this work we present a software implementation
of the Unperturbed Electrostatic Method (UEP), which is an approach used for
finding the muon stopping site in crystalline materials that calculates the
minima of the electrostatic potential in the crystalline material, and
estimates the stopping site of the muon relying on the approximation that the
muon presence does not significantly affect its surroundings. One of the main
assumptions of the UEP is that the muon stopping site will be one of the
electrostatic potential minima in the crystalline material. In this regard, we
also propose some symmetry-based considerations about the properties of the
electrostatic potential of the crystalline material. In particular, which sites
are more likely to be its minima and why the unperturbed approximation may be
sufficiently robust for them. We introduce the Python software package
pymuon-suite and the various utilities it provides to facilitate these
calculations, and finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with
some chosen example systems.

discuss and elaborate on theoretical evidences that the quantum hairs are
related to the gravitational topological winding number in vacuo. Thus, hairons
are originated from topological degrees of freedom, holographically stored in
the de Sitter area. The hierarchy of the Planck scale over the Cosmological
Constant (CC) is understood as an effect of a Topological Memory intrinsically
stored in the space-time geometry. Any UV quantum destabilizations of the CC
are re-interpreted as Topological Phase Transitions, related to the
desapparence of a large ensamble of topological hairs. This process is
entropically suppressed, as a tunneling probability from the N- to the
0-states. Therefore, the tiny CC in our Universe is a manifestation of the rich
topological structure of the space-time. In this portrait, a tiny neutrino mass
can be generated by quantum gravity anomalies and accommodated into a large
N-vacuum state. We will re-interpret the CC stabilization from the point of
view of Topological Quantum Computing. An exponential degeneracy of topological
hairs non-locally protects the space-time memory from quantum fluctuations as

approaches get degraded fast. We also demonstrate SROM to be computationally
efficient and capable of handling high-speed maneuvers. It also achieves low

has a two-layer structure wherein first, an approximate estimate of the
rotation angle and translation parameters are calculated using a Phase Only
Correlation (POC) method. Next, we use this estimate as an initialization for a
point-to-plane ICP algorithm to obtain fine matching and registration. Another
key feature of the proposed algorithm is the removal of dynamic objects before
matching the scans. This improves the performance of our system as the dynamic
objects can corrupt the matching scheme and derail localization. Our SLAM
system can build reliable maps at the same time generating high-quality
odometry. We exhaustively evaluated the proposed method in many challenging

demonstrate better accuracy in comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods

Therefore, we focus on system performance optimization in non-orthogonal

and power allocation is designed for maximizing energy efficiency. Because of
the nonconvexity of optimization function with an probability constraint for
imperfect CSI, the original problem is converted into a non-probability problem
and then decoupled into two convex subproblems. First, a user scheduling method
is applied in the two-side matching of users and subchannels by the difference

restrictions on pulse sequence design, especially at ultra-high fields ($\geq
7$ tesla). Due to inter-subject variability, the SAR is usually conservatively
estimated based on standard human models that include an applied safety margin
to ensure safe operation. One approach to reducing the restrictions is to
create more accurate subject-specific models from their segmented MR images.
This study uses electromagnetic simulations to investigate the minimum number
of tissue groups required to accurately determine SAR in the human head.
  Methods: Tissue types from a fully characterized electromagnetic human model
with 47 tissue types in the head and neck region were grouped into different
tissue clusters based on the conductivities, permittivities, and mass densities
of the tissues. Electromagnetic simulations of the head model inside a parallel
transmit (pTx) head coil at 7T were used to determine the minimum number of
required tissue clusters to accurately determine the subject-specific SAR. The
identified tissue clusters were then evaluated using two additional
well-characterized electromagnetic human models.
  Results: A minimum of 4 clusters plus air was found to be required for
accurate SAR estimation. These tissue clusters are centered around gray matter,
fat, cortical bone, and cerebrospinal fluid. For all three simulated models the
pTx maximum 10gSAR was consistently determined to within an error of <12%
relative to the full 47-tissue model.
  Conclusion: A minimum of 4 clusters plus air are required to produce accurate
personalized SAR simulations of the human head when using pTx at 7T.

instrumental in the discovery of cosmic acceleration, usually attributed to
some form of dark energy (DE). Recent studies have raised the issue of whether
intrinsic SNeIa luminosities might evolve with redshift. While the evidence for
cosmic acceleration is robust to this possible systematic, the question remains
of how much the latter can affect the inferred properties of the DE component
responsible for cosmic acceleration. This is the question we address in this
work. We use SNeIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon and JLA
samples. We consider models where the DE equation of state is a free parameter,
either constant or time-varying, as well as models where DE and dark matter
interact, and finally a model-agnostic parametrization of effects due to
modified gravity (MG). When SNeIa data are combined with Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements, we find
strong degeneracies between parameters governing the SNeIa systematics, the DE
parameters, and the Hubble constant $H_0$. These degeneracies significantly
broaden the DE parameter uncertainties, in some cases leading to ${\cal
O}(\sigma)$ shifts in the central values. However, including low-redshift
Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, as well as CMB
lensing measurements, considerably improves the previous constraints, and the
only remaining effect of the examined systematic is a $\lesssim 40\%$
broadening of the uncertainties on the DE parameters. The constraints we derive
on the MG parameters are instead basically unaffected by the systematic in
question. We therefore confirm the overall soundness of dark energy properties.

introduces an explicit length scale into the theory, it does it in such a way
that the KK radius can be integrated out from the low energy regime, leaving
the KK vacuum to still enjoy local scale invariance at the classical level.
Imitating a $U(1)\times\tilde{U}(1)$ gauge theory, the emerging 4D theory is
characterized by a kinetic Maxwell-Weyl mixing whose diagonalization procedure
is carried out in detail. In particular, we identify the unique linear
combination which defines the 4D Weyl vector, and fully classify the 4D scalar
sector. The later consists of (using Weyl language) a co-scalar and two
in-scalars. The analysis is performed for a general KK $m$-ansatz, parametrized
by the power $m$ of the scalar field which factorizes the 4D metric. The
no-ghost requirement, for example, is met provided $-\frac{1}{2}\leq m \leq 0$.
An $m$-dependent dictionary is then established between the original 5D
Brans-Dicke parameter $\omega_5$ and the resulting 4D $\omega_4$. The critical
$\omega_5=-\frac{4}{3}$ is consistently mapped into critical $\omega_4 =
-\frac{3}{2}$. The KK reduced Maxwell-Weyl kinetic mixing cannot be scaled away
as it is mediated by a 4D in-scalar (residing within the 5D Weyl vector). The
mixing is explicitly demonstrated within the Einstein frame for the special
physically motivated choice of $m=-\frac{1}{3}$. For instance, a super critical
Brans-Dicke parameter induces a tiny positive contribution to the original (if
introduced via the 5-dimensional scalar potential) cosmological constant.
Finally, some no-scale quantum cosmological aspects are studied at the

we provide three contributions. First, we introduce two previously unreleased

multilabel text classification for the low-resource language Filipino. Second,
we pretrain better BERT and DistilBERT models for use within the Filipino

detected by space-based photometry with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey

pulsations observed in a couple of He-rich hot subdwarf stars. These stars, and

machine-learning methods as statistical emulators for use in the analysis of
agent-based models (ABMs). Analysing ABM outputs can be challenging, as the
relationships between input parameters can be non-linear or even chaotic even
in relatively simple models, and each model run can require significant CPU
time. Statistical emulation, in which a statistical model of the ABM is
constructed to facilitate detailed model analyses, has been proposed as an
alternative to computationally costly Monte Carlo methods. Here we compare
multiple machine-learning methods for ABM emulation in order to determine the
approaches best suited to emulating the complex behaviour of ABMs. Our results
suggest that, in most scenarios, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and
gradient-boosted trees outperform Gaussian process emulators, currently the
most commonly used method for the emulation of complex computational models.
ANNs produced the most accurate model replications in scenarios with high
numbers of model runs, although training times were longer than the other
methods. We propose that agent-based modelling would benefit from using
machine-learning methods for emulation, as this can facilitate more robust
sensitivity analyses for the models while also reducing CPU time consumption
when calibrating and analysing the simulation.

both a dimensional reconstruction of nanostructures and a characterization

this work, we present a soft X-ray fluorescence-based methodology that allows
both of these requirements to be addressed at the same time. By applying the
grazing-incidence X-ray fluorescence technique and thus utilizing the X-ray
standing wave field effect, nanostructures can be investigated with a high
sensitivity with respect to their dimensional and compositional
characteristics. By varying the incident angles of the exciting radiation,
element-sensitive fluorescence radiation is emitted from different regions
inside the nanoobjects. By applying an adequate modeling scheme, these datasets
can be used to determine the nanostructure characteristics. We demonstrate
these capabilities by performing an element-sensitive reconstruction of a
lamellar grating made of Si$_3$N$_4$, where GIXRF data for the O-K$\alpha$ and
N-K$\alpha$ fluorescence emission allows a thin oxide layer to be reconstructed
on the surface of the grating structure. In addition, we employ the technique
also to three dimensional nanostructures and derive both dimensional and
compositional parameters in a quantitative manner.

ionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for
OTHR multitarget tracking and localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric
parameters has a significant deleterious effect on the target localization of
OTHR. Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important
to develop accurate models and estimation methods of ionospheric parameters and
the corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the
variation of the ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the
ionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random field
(GMRF) to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs
for OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional maximization and
GMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution,
called ECM-GMRF, to perform target state estimation, multipath data association
and VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both
ionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better
estimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of data association and
target state estimation, and vice versa. The simulation indicates the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

particular, this leads to two new cluster expansion formulas, and recovers the
lattice path expansion of Propp et al. We provide an explicit,
structure-preserving poset isomorphism between an expansion poset and its dual

effective remnant towards the end of the evaporation. As $d\geqslant 6$,
however, the lifetime of black hole does not diverge with any initial black
hole mass, and it is bounded by a time of the order of $\ell^{d-1}$, similar to
the case of Schwarzschild-AdS in Einstein gravity (which corresponds to

two contention aware resource allocation policies that either maximize the peak

crust of a neutron star is expected to reduce the electrical conductivity of
the crust, with potentially important consequences on the magneto-thermal
evolution of the star. In cooling simulations, the disorder is quantified by an
impurity parameter which is often taken as a free parameter. We aim to give a
quantitative prediction of the impurity parameter as a function of the density
in the crust,performing microscopic calculations including up-to-date
microphysics of the crust. A multi-component approach is developed at finite
temperature using a compressible liquid drop description of the ions with an
improved energy functional based on recent microscopic nuclear models and
optimized on extended Thomas-Fermi calculations. Thermodynamic consistency is
ensured by adding a rearrangement term and deviations from the linear mixing
rule are included in the liquid phase. The impurity parameter is consistently
calculated at the crystallization temperature as determined in the
one-component plasma approximation for the different functionals. Our
calculations show that at the crystallization temperature the composition of
the inner crust is dominated by nuclei with charge number around $Z \approx
40$, while the range of the $Z$ distribution varies from about 20 near the
neutron drip to about 40 closer to the crust-core transition. This reflects on
the behavior of the impurity parameter that monotonically increases with
density up to around 40 in the deeper regions of the inner crust. Our study
shows that the contribution of impurities is non-negligible, thus potentially
having an impact on the transport properties in the neutron-star crust. The
obtained values of the impurity parameter represent a lower limit; larger
values are expected in the presence of non-spherical geometries and/or fast
cooling dynamics.

management. It can be estimated relatively directly by testing of random
population samples. Without such direct epidemiological measurement, other
approaches are required to infer whether the number of new cases is likely to
be increasing or decreasing: for example, estimating the pathogen effective
reproduction number, R, using data gathered from the clinical response to the
disease. For Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) such R estimation is heavily dependent on
modelling assumptions, because the available clinical case data are
opportunistic observational data subject to severe temporal confounding. Given
this difficulty it is useful to retrospectively reconstruct the time course of
infections from the least compromised available data, using minimal prior
assumptions. A Bayesian inverse problem approach applied to UK data on first
wave Covid-19 deaths and the disease duration distribution suggests that fatal
infections were in decline before full UK lockdown (24 March 2020), and that
fatal infections in Sweden started to decline only a day or two later. An
analysis of UK data using the model of Flaxman et al. (2020, Nature 584) gives
the same result under relaxation of its prior assumptions on R, suggesting an
enhanced role for non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) short of full lock
down in the UK context. Similar patterns appear to have occurred in the
subsequent two lockdowns. Estimates from the main UK Covid statistical
surveillance surveys, available since original publication, support these
results. Replication code for the paper is available in the supporting

conventional units by renewable energy sources, mainly wind and PV power
plants. This fact affects significantly the grid frequency response under power
imbalances. As a result, new frequency control strategies for renewable plants
are being developed to emulate the behaviour of conventional power plants under
such contingencies. These approaches are usually called 'virtual inertia
emulation techniques'. In this paper, an analysis of power system inertia
estimation from frequency excursions is carried out by considering different
inertia estimation methodologies, discussing the applicability and coherence of
these methodologies under the new supply-side circumstances. The modelled power
system involves conventional units and wind power plants, including wind
frequency control strategies in line with current mix generation scenarios.
Results show that all methodologies considered provide an accurate result to
estimate the equivalent inertia based on rotational generation units directly
connected to the grid. However, significant discrepancies are found when
frequency control strategies are included in wind power plants decoupled from
the grid. In this way, authors consider that it is necessary to define
alternative inertia estimation methodologies by including virtual inertia
emulation. Extensive discussion and results are also provided in this study.

generic geometry within the framework of charged-bunching coherent curvature
radiation in the magnetosphere of an NS. The sub-pulses in a radio burst come
from bunches of charged particles moving along different magnetic field lines.
Their radiation beam sweep across the line of sight at slightly different time,
and those radiating at the more curved part tend to be seen earlier and at
higher frequency. However, by considering bunches generated at slightly
different times, we find there is also a small probability that the emission
from the less curved part be seen earlier. We simulate the time--frequency
structures by deriving various forms of the electric acceleration field in the
magnetosphere. Such structure of sub-pulses is a natural consequence of
coherent curvature radiation from an NS magnetosphere with suddenly and
violently triggered sparks. We apply this model to explain the time--frequency

pulsar-like sparking from the inner gap of a slowly rotating NS, and have also
developed in more generic configurations.

6 wrist movements. For feature extraction we applied principal component
analysis and the feature set size varied from one to 8 principal components. We
compared results of re-trained classifier with results from leave-one-out
cross-validation classification procedure for three classifiers: LDA (Linear
Discriminant Analysis), QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis), and ANN
(Artificial Neural Network). Our results showed that there was no significant
difference in classification accuracy when the array electrode was repositioned
indicating successful classification re-training and optimal feature set
selection. The results also indicate expectedly that the number of principal
components plays a key role for acceptable classification accuracy ~90 %. For
the largest dataset (9 hand movements), LDA and QDA outperformed ANN, while for
three grasping movements ANN showed promising results. Interestingly, we showed
that interaction between electrode array position and the feature set size is
not statistically significant. This study emphasizes the importance of testing
the interaction of factors that influence classification accuracy and
classifier selection altogether with their impact independently in order to
establish guiding principles for design of hand movement recognition system.

scale heights, hence too the amplitudes of spectral features inconsistent with

efficiently adapts the transmission rate to the signal-to-noise ratio,
accounting for the fading induced by the atmospheric turbulence. The
transponder can support an arbitrarily large number of transmission modes using
a low complexity channel encoder with a small set of supported rates. Hence, it
can provide a solution for FSO backhauling in terrestrial and satellite

algorithms to determine the capacity and capacity-achieving distribution of the
scheme with unipolar M-ary pulse amplitude modulation (M-PAM) signaling. Then,
the signal constellation is probabilistically shaped according to the optimal
distribution, and the shaped signal is channel encoded by an efficient binary
forward error correction scheme. Extensive numerical results and simulations
are provided to evaluate the performance. The proposed scheme yields a rate
close to the tightest lower bound on the capacity of FSO channels. For
instance, the coded modulator operates within 0.2 dB from the M-PAM capacity,

rate of 3 bits per channel use.

  In this paper, we present the first dynamic dictionary for multisets that
achieves these performance guarantees. This answers an open problem of
Arbitman, Naor and Segev (FOCS 2010). The previously best-known construction of
Pagh, Pagh and Rao (SODA 2005) supports membership in constant time,
multiplicity queries in $O(\log n)$ time in the worst case, and insertions and
deletions in constant expected amortized time. The main technical component of
our solution is a strategy for efficiently storing variable-length binary
counters using weighted balls-into-bins experiments in which balls have
logarithmic weights.
  We also obtain a counting filter that approximates multiplicity queries with
a one sided error, using the reduction of Carter et al. (STOC 1978). Counting
filters have received significant attention over the years due to their
applicability in practice.We present the first counting filter with constant
time operations.

gas-puff imaging (GPI) that sample the same plasma discharge. This comparison
is complemented by an analysis of line emission time-series data, synthesized
from the MLP electron density and temperature measurements. The fluctuations
observed by the MLP and GPI typically display relative fluctuation amplitudes
of order unity together with positively skewed and flattened probability
density functions. Such data time series are well described by an established
stochastic framework which model the data as a superposition of uncorrelated,
two-sided exponential pulses. The most important parameter of the process is
the intermittency parameter, {\gamma} = {\tau}d / {\tau}w where {\tau}d denotes
the duration time of a single pulse and {\tau}w gives the average waiting time
between consecutive pulses. Here we show, using a new deconvolution method,
that these parameters can be consistently estimated from different statistics
of the data. We also show that the statistical properties of the data sampled
by the MLP and GPI diagnostic are very similar. Finally, a comparison of the
GPI signal to the synthetic line-emission time series suggests that the
measured emission intensity can not be explained solely by a simplified model

than traditional magnetic materials, which is of fundamental importance for
spintronic applications. An elegant way of achieving carbon-based magnetic
moments is the design of graphene nanostructures with an imbalanced occupation
of the two sublattices forming the carbon honeycomb lattice. According to
Lieb's theorem, this induces local magnetic moments that are proportional to
the sublattice imbalance. Exact positioning of sublattice imbalanced
nanostructures in graphene nanomaterials hence offers a route to control
interactions between induced local magnetic moments and to obtain graphene
nanomaterials with magnetically non-trivial ground states. Here, we show that
such sublattice imbalanced nanostructures can be incorporated along a large
band gap armchair graphene nanoribbon on the basis of asymmetric zigzag edge
extensions, which is achieved by incorporating specifically designed precursor
monomers during the bottom-up fabrication of the graphene nanoribbons. Scanning
tunneling spectroscopy of an isolated and electronically decoupled zigzag edge
extension reveals Hubbard-split states in accordance with theoretical
predictions. Investigation of pairs of such zigzag edge extensions reveals
ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic or quenching of the magnetic interactions
depending on the relative alignment of the asymmetric edge extensions.
Moreover, a ferromagnetic spin chain is demonstrated for a periodic pattern of
zigzag edge extensions along the nanoribbon axis. This work opens a route
towards the design and fabrication of graphene nanoribbon-based spin chains
with complex magnetic ground states.

analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image
collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to
support analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and
interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic
categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between
the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories
of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is
rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that brings the user to insight
requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the
exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions. II-20 brings 3 major
contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing
the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a machine model that closely follows the user's
interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's model,
in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art w. r. t. relevance,
allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without
additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris
metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows the model to analyze the
collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the
classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user
to harness the model to quickly expand (""fast-forward"") the categories of
relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary.
Automated experiments show that II-20's model outperforms the state of the art
and also demonstrate Tetris's analytic quality. User studies confirm that II-20
is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool.

to the evidence supporting the prediction that short-period dwarf novae evolve
toward longer periods after passing through a minimum period -- the ""period

superhump period excess $\epsilon = (P_{\rm sh} - P_{\rm orb} )/P_{\rm orb}$

agreeing at least qualitatively with the predicted behavior. Next, motivated by
the long (decadal) outburst intervals of the WZ Sagittae subclass of
short-period dwarf novae, we ask whether there could be a sizable population of
""lurkers"" -- systems that resemble dwarf novae at minimum light, but do not
outburst over accessible timescales (or at all), and therefore do not draw
attention to themselves. By examining the outburst history of the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey sample of CVs, which were selected by color and not by outburst, we
find that a large majority of the color-selected dwarf-nova-like objects have
been observed to outburst, and conclude that ""lurkers"", if they exist, are a
relatively minor part of the CV population.

high-contrast imaging facilities and accurate control of wavefront aberrations.
Ground-based planet imagers such as VLT/SPHERE or Gemini/GPI have already
demonstrated great performance. However, their limit of detection is hampered
by suboptimal correction of aberrations unseen by adaptive optics (AO). Aims.
Instead of focusing on the phase minimization of the pupil plane as in standard
AO, we aim to directly minimize the stellar residual light in the SPHERE
science camera behind the coronagraph to improve the contrast as close as
possible to the inner working angle. Methods. We propose a dark hole (DH)
strategy optimized for SPHERE. We used a numerical simulation to predict the
global improvement of such a strategy on the overall performance of the
instrument for different AO capabilities and particularly in the context of a
SPHERE upgrade. Then, we tested our algorithm on the internal source with the
AO in closed loop. Results. We demonstrate that our DH strategy can correct for
aberrations of phase and amplitude. Moreover, this approach has the ability to
strongly reduce the diffraction pattern induced by the telescope pupil and the
coronagraph, unlike methods operating at the pupil plane. Our strategy enables
us to reach a contrast of 5e-7 at 150 mas from the optical axis in a few
minutes using the SPHERE internal source. This experiment establishes the
grounds for implementing the algorithm on sky in the near future.

the middle-age pulsars ($\tau_c > 10^5$~yr), the calculated braking indices,
$|n|$, are strongly correlated with $\tau_c$ and the numbers of positive and

their data from an entity storing it. In the context of machine learning (ML),
the right to be forgotten requires an ML model owner to remove the data owner's
data from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known as
machine unlearning. While originally designed to protect the privacy of the
data owner, we argue that machine unlearning may leave some imprint of the data
in the ML model and thus create unintended privacy risks. In this paper, we
perform the first study on investigating the unintended information leakage
caused by machine unlearning. We propose a novel membership inference attack
that leverages the different outputs of an ML model's two versions to infer
whether a target sample is part of the training set of the original model but
out of the training set of the corresponding unlearned model. Our experiments
demonstrate that the proposed membership inference attack achieves strong
performance. More importantly, we show that our attack in multiple cases
outperforms the classical membership inference attack on the original ML model,
which indicates that machine unlearning can have counterproductive effects on
privacy. We notice that the privacy degradation is especially significant for
well-generalized ML models where classical membership inference does not
perform well. We further investigate four mechanisms to mitigate the newly
discovered privacy risks and show that releasing the predicted label only,
temperature scaling, and differential privacy are effective. We believe that
our results can help improve privacy protection in practical implementations of
machine unlearning. Our code is available at

structural coherence of the low-$T$ broken symmetry state is strongly
suppressed on a sub-picosecond timescale above a threshold excitation fluence
of $F_{\mathrm{c}}\approx3$ mJ/cm$^{2}$ (at 1.55-eV photon energy) resulting in
a structurally inhomogeneous transient state which persists for several-tens of

typical training strategy is to adjust their input-output behavior so that it
matches that of the biological circuit of interest. Even though this strategy
ensures that the biological and artificial networks perform the same
computational task, it does not guarantee that their internal activity dynamics
match. This suggests that the trained RNNs might end up performing the task
employing a different internal computational mechanism, which would make them a
suboptimal model of the biological circuit. In this work, we introduce a novel
training strategy that allows learning not only the input-output behavior of an
RNN but also its internal network dynamics, based on sparse neural recordings.
We test the proposed method by training an RNN to simultaneously reproduce
internal dynamics and output signals of a physiologically-inspired neural
model. Specifically, this model generates the multiphasic muscle-like activity
patterns typically observed during the execution of reaching movements, based
on the oscillatory activation patterns concurrently observed in the motor
cortex. Remarkably, we show that the reproduction of the internal dynamics is
successful even when the training algorithm relies on the activities of a small
subset of neurons sampled from the biological network. Furthermore, we show
that training the RNNs with this method significantly improves their
generalization performance. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed
method is suitable for building powerful functional RNN models, which
automatically capture important computational properties of the biological
circuit of interest from sparse neural recordings.

forecasting using long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, validating its
potential and identifying its memory advantage. Specifically, we model the
10-year bond yield using univariate LSTMs with three input sequences and five
forecasting horizons. We compare those with multilayer perceptrons (MLP),
univariate and with the most relevant features. To demystify the notion of
black box associated with LSTMs, we conduct the first internal study of the
model. To this end, we calculate the LSTM signals through time, at selected
locations in the memory cell, using sequence-to-sequence architectures, uni and
multivariate. We then proceed to explain the states' signals using exogenous
information, for what we develop the LSTM-LagLasso methodology. The results
show that the univariate LSTM model with additional memory is capable of
achieving similar results as the multivariate MLP using macroeconomic and
market information. Furthermore, shorter forecasting horizons require smaller
input sequences and vice-versa. The most remarkable property found consistently
in the LSTM signals, is the activation/deactivation of units through time, and
the specialisation of units by yield range or feature. Those signals are
complex but can be explained by exogenous variables. Additionally, some of the
relevant features identified via LSTM-LagLasso are not commonly used in
forecasting models. In conclusion, our work validates the potential of LSTMs

objects, a graph with the agents as vertices and edges encoding which agents
can trade resources with each other, and an initial and a target distribution
of the objects, where each agent owns exactly one object in each distribution.
The question is then whether the target distribution is reachable via a
sequence of rational trades. A trade is rational when the two participating
agents are neighbors in the graph and both obtain an object they prefer over
the object they previously held. We show that Reachable Assignments is NP-hard

production rates, and in some cases completely forbid entropy production, which
usually occurs for systems that deviate from quantum critical points. In this
article, we illustrate how the vanishing entropy production near a quantum

finite temperatures that are otherwise irreversible. Away from the quantum

how both controllable reversible and irreversible dynamics can be potentially

interesting non-perturbative phenomena that can be studied by means of Monte
Carlo lattice simulations. However, the lattice regularization breaks
supersymmetry explicitly, and in general a fine tuning of a large number of
parameters is required to correctly extrapolate the theory to the continuum
limit. From this perspective, it is important to preserve on the lattice as
many symmetries of the original continuum action as possible. Chiral symmetry
for instance prevents an additive renormalization of the fermion mass. A
(modified) version of chiral symmetry can be preserved exactly if the Dirac
operator fulfills the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. In this contribution, we
present an exploratory non-perturbative study of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills
theory using the overlap formalism to preserve chiral symmetry at non-zero
lattice spacings. N=1 SYM is an ideal benchmark toward the extension of our
studies to more complex supersymmetric theories, as the only parameter to be
tuned is the gluino mass. Overlap fermions allow therefore to simulate the
theory without fine-tuning. We compare our approach to previous investigations
of the same theory, and we present clear evidences for gluino condensation.

electron-free case this plasma effect is mediated by the response current of
the residual ions as a dispersive effect on the laser propagation. The residual
ions hence act as an effective background to the propagating electromagnetic
laser field. We demonstrate that this has an impact on the fundamental
nonlinear QED process of photon emission by an electron upon absorption of a

to prove an unconditional polynomial lower bound of a trade-off between the
update time and the query time of an adaptive dynamic data structure computing
some explicit function. Ko and Weinstein provided such lower bound for a
restricted class of {\em semi-adaptive\} data structures, which compute the
Disjointness function. There, the data are subsets $x_1,\dots,x_k$ and $y$ of

regression models are applied, and its existence may affect the analysis of
ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators from both the numerical and statistical
points of views. Thus, multicollinearity can lead to incoherence in the
statistical significance of the independent variables and the global
significance of the model. The variance inflation factor (VIF) is traditionally
applied to diagnose the possible existence of multicollinearity, but it is not
always the case that detection by VIF of a troubling degree of
multicollinearity corresponds to negative effects on the statistical analysis.
The reason for the lack of specificity of VIF is that there are other factors,
such as the size of the sample and the variance of the random disturbance, that
can lead to high values of the VIF but not to problematic variance in the OLS
estimators (see O'Brien 2007). This paper presents a new variance inflation
factor (TVIF) that consider all these additional factors. Thresholds for this
new measure and from the index provided by Stewart (1987) are also provided.
These thresholds are reinterpreted and presented as a new statistical test to

survival model at the local area around a test example due to the linear
relationship of covariates in the model. The second idea is to incorporate the
well-known Kolmogorov-Smirnov bounds for constructing sets of predicted
cumulative hazard functions. As a result, the robust maximin strategy is used,
which aims to minimize the average distance between cumulative hazard functions
of the explained black-box model and of the approximating Cox model, and to
maximize the distance over all cumulative hazard functions in the interval

reduced to the quadratic program. Various numerical experiments with synthetic

two decomposition methods by homogeneous sets and clique-separators in order to
determine optimal $\chi$-binding functions for subclasses of $P_5$-free graphs
and of $(C_5,C_7,\ldots)$-free graphs. In particular, we prove the following
for each $\omega\geq 1$:
  (i) $\ f_{\{P_5,banner\}}^\star(\omega)=f_{3K_1}^\star(\omega)\in
\Theta(\omega^2/\log(\omega)),$
  (ii) $\
f_{\{P_5,co-banner\}}^\star(\omega)=f^\star_{\{2K_2\}}(\omega)\in\mathcal{O}(\omega^2),$
  (iii) $\
f_{\{C_5,C_7,\ldots,banner\}}^\star(\omega)=f^\star_{\{C_5,3K_1\}}(\omega)\notin
\mathcal{O}(\omega),$ and
  (iv) $\ f_{\{P_5,C_4\}}^\star(\omega)=\lceil(5\omega-1)/4\rceil.$
  We also characterise, for each of our considered graph classes, all graphs
$G$ with $\chi(G)>\chi(G-u)$ for each $u\in V(G)$. From these structural
results, we can prove Reed's conjecture -- relating chromatic number, clique
number, and maximum degree of a graph -- for $(P_5,banner)$-free graphs.

and $p$-wave Fermi gases. At resonance, the presence of the effective range
breaks the scale invariance of the system, and hence results in a non-zero bulk
viscosity. However, we show that the effective range plays a very different
role in the two cases. In the $s$-wave case, the role of the effective range is
perturbative, and its contribution to the bulk viscosity vanishes in the limit
of zero effective range. On the other hand, the effective range in $p$-wave
Fermi gases leads to a non-zero bulk viscosity, even in the zero-range limit.
We setup the general diagrammatic approach to compute the bulk viscosity
spectral function that includes the effects of the effective range. We then
compute the analytic expressions for the spectral function in the high
temperature limit, at low- and high-frequencies. We also derive the sum rules
for the bulk viscosity spectral function for both $s$- and $p$-wave gases.

paper presents our study of the nonequilibrium thermodynamics analysis of this

introduced. We demonstrate that the engine's rotational state is in a
quasi-linear response regime where the thermodynamic fluxes show a linear
dependency on the thermodynamic forces. Significantly, it is found that the
response coefficients of the quasi-linear relations are symmetric, which is
similar to Onsager symmetry in linear irreversible thermodynamics. Based on
these relations, we formulate the maximum efficiency of the engine. We also
elucidate that the symmetry of the quasi-linear response coefficients emerges
by reflecting the (anti-)reciprocity of the Onsager kinetic coefficients
identified for the relaxation dynamics of the engine in the vicinity of an

developing nonequilibrium thermodynamics of autonomous heat engines described

such as bending. While the size dependence of this effect makes it weak in bulk
systems in comparison to piezoelectricity, it suggests that it plays a bigger
role in nanoscale systems such as thin films and nanotubes (NTs). In this paper
we demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the walls of carbon
nanotubes (CNTs) and transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes (TMD NTs) are
polarized in the radial direction, the strength of the polarization increasing
as the size of the NT decreases. For CNTs and TMD NTs with chiral indices
$(n,m)$, the radial polarization of the walls $P_R$ starts to diverge below $
C(n,m)/a = \sqrt{n^2 +nm + m^2} \sim 10$, where $C(n,m)$ is the circumference
of the NT and $a$ is the lattice constant of the 2D monolayer. For CNTs, $P_R$
drops to zero above this value but for TMD NTs there is a non-zero polarization
above this value, which is an ionic rather than electronic effect. The size
dependence of $P_R$ in the TMD NTs is interesting: it increases gradually and
reaches a maximum of $P_R \sim 100 \ \text{C/cm}^2$ at $C(n,m)/a \sim 15$, then
decreases until $C(n,m)/a \sim 10$ where it starts to diverge. Measurements of
the radial strain on the chalcogen atoms with respect to the 2D monolayers
shows that this polarization is the result of a significantly larger strain on
the outer bonds than the inner bonds, but did not offer an explanation for the
peculiar size dependence. These results suggest that while the walls of smaller
CNTs and TMD NTs are polarized, the walls of larger TMD NTs are also polarized
due to a difference in strain on the inner and outer atoms in the walls. This
result may prove useful for the application of NTs for screening in liquid or
biological systems.

glaucoma, where the abnormal anatomical structures of the anterior chamber
angle (ACA) may cause an elevated intraocular pressure and gradually lead to
glaucomatous optic neuropathy and eventually to visual impairment and
blindness. Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) imaging
provides a fast and contactless way to discriminate angle closure from open
angle. Although many medical image analysis algorithms have been developed for
glaucoma diagnosis, only a few studies have focused on AS-OCT imaging. In
particular, there is no public AS-OCT dataset available for evaluating the
existing methods in a uniform way, which limits progress in the development of
automated techniques for angle closure detection and assessment. To address
this, we organized the Angle closure Glaucoma Evaluation challenge (AGE), held
in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The AGE challenge consisted of two tasks:
scleral spur localization and angle closure classification. For this challenge,
we released a large dataset of 4800 annotated AS-OCT images from 199 patients,
and also proposed an evaluation framework to benchmark and compare different
models. During the AGE challenge, over 200 teams registered online, and more
than 1100 results were submitted for online evaluation. Finally, eight teams
participated in the onsite challenge. In this paper, we summarize these eight
onsite challenge methods and analyze their corresponding results for the two
tasks. We further discuss limitations and future directions. In the AGE
challenge, the top-performing approach had an average Euclidean Distance of 10
pixels (10um) in scleral spur localization, while in the task of angle closure

best obtaining an accuracy rate of 100%.

from failures. In this approach, an ILP system (the learner) decomposes the
learning problem into three separate stages: generate, test, and constrain. In
the generate stage, the learner generates a hypothesis (a logic program) that
satisfies a set of hypothesis constraints (constraints on the syntactic form of
hypotheses). In the test stage, the learner tests the hypothesis against
training examples. A hypothesis fails when it does not entail all the positive
examples or entails a negative example. If a hypothesis fails, then, in the
constrain stage, the learner learns constraints from the failed hypothesis to
prune the hypothesis space, i.e. to constrain subsequent hypothesis generation.
For instance, if a hypothesis is too general (entails a negative example), the
constraints prune generalisations of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is too
specific (does not entail all the positive examples), the constraints prune
specialisations of the hypothesis. This loop repeats until either (i) the
learner finds a hypothesis that entails all the positive and none of the
negative examples, or (ii) there are no more hypotheses to test. We introduce
Popper, an ILP system that implements this approach by combining answer set
programming and Prolog. Popper supports infinite problem domains, reasoning
about lists and numbers, learning textually minimal programs, and learning
recursive programs. Our experimental results on three domains (toy game
problems, robot strategies, and list transformations) show that (i) constraints
drastically improve learning performance, and (ii) Popper can outperform
existing ILP systems, both in terms of predictive accuracies and learning
times.

reduce the range of atmospheric conditions for which the neural networks are

Predicted optical properties are highly accurate and the resulting radiative
fluxes have average errors within \SI{0.5}{\flux} compared to RRTMGP. Our
neural network-based gas optics parametrization is up to 4 times faster than
RRTMGP, depending on the size of the neural networks. We further test the
trade-off between speed and accuracy by training neural networks for the narrow

generalized fractal dimension was defined by Renyi entropy. Using fractal
dimension, we can describe urban growth and form and characterize spatial
complexity. A number of fractal models and measurements have been proposed for
urban studies. However, the precondition for fractal dimension application is
to find scaling relations in cities. In absence of scaling property, we can
make use of entropy function and measurements. This paper is devoted to
researching how to describe urban growth by using spatial entropy. By analogy
with fractal dimension growth models of cities, a pair of entropy increase
models can be derived and a set of entropy-based measurements can be
constructed to describe urban growing process and patterns. First, logistic
function and Boltzmann equation are utilized to model the entropy increase
curves of urban growth. Second, a series of indexes based on spatial entropy
are used to characterize urban form. Further, multifractal dimension spectrums
are generalized to spatial entropy spectrums. Conclusions are drawn as follows.
Entropy and fractal dimension have both intersection and different spheres of
application to urban research. Thus, for a given spatial measurement scale,
fractal dimension can often be replaced by spatial entropy for simplicity. The
models and measurements presented in this work are significant for integrating
entropy and fractal dimension into the same framework of urban spatial analysis
and understanding spatial complexity of cities.

matter, and its influence on compact star structures. The properties of quark
matter and hadronic matter are fixed based on various model predictions. Beside
adopting constant values, the surface tension $\Sigma$ for the quark-hadron
interface is estimated with the multiple reflection expansion method and
equivparticle model. To fix the structures of quark-hadron pasta phases, a
continuous dimensionality of the structure is adopted as proposed by Ravenhall,
Pethick, and Wilson. The corresponding properties of hybrid stars are then
obtained and confronted with pulsar observations. It is found that the
correlation between radius and tidal deformability in traditional neutron stars
preserves in hybrid stars. For those permitted by pulsar observations, in
almost all cases the quark phase persists inside the most massive compact
stars. The quark-hadron interface plays an important role on hybrid star
structures once quark matter emerges. The surface tension $\Sigma$ estimated
with various methods increases with density, which predicts stiffer EOSs for
the quark-hadron mixed phase and increases the maximum mass of hybrid stars.
The EOSs of hybrid star matter are well constrained at densities $n\lesssim
0.8$ fm${}^{-3}$, while larger uncertainty is expected at higher densities.

coexisting with the synchronous attractor. On the other hand, asynchronous

range to ultralight, can be generated in a natural way in the context of
effective field theory models with anomalous $U(1)$ gauge symmetries. They
include dimension-5 operators which define a coupling of the axion to the gauge
anomaly. They provide a realization, in the domain of ordinary gauge theories,
of models for such particles, which evade the usual mass/coupling constraint of
ordinary (Peccei-Quinn) axions and are natural dark matter candidates. As an
illustration of these models, we present an overview of two of these scenarios.
One of them is built around the next-to-minimal MSSM (NMSSM), a model called
the USSM-A, which illustrates how the St\""uckelberg supermultiplet can be used
to generate two dark matter candidates, a neutralino containing an axino
component coming from the St\""uckelberg sector, plus the axion ($\textrm{Im}\,
b$). The real component of the complex St\""uckelberg field carries dilaton-like
($\textrm{Re}\, b\, FF$) interactions. In a second model, non-supersymmetric,
the St\""uckelberg scale is raised up to the GUT epoch. In this case the axion
mass can be ultralight ($\sim 10^{-20}$ eV). The periodic potential generated
at the GUT phase transition and the corresponding oscillations are related to a
particle whose De Broglie wavelength can be sub-galactic. A similar analysis is
also possible for the supersymmetric scenario.

$n$-step, discrete jump process on a $1D$ lattice. At a given step, the walker
can jump by arbitrary lattice units drawn from a given symmetric probability
distribution. This process includes, as a special case, the standard nearest
neighbor lattice random walk. We derive explicitly the generating function of
the distribution $P(R_n)$ of the number of records, valid for arbitrary
discrete jump distributions. As a byproduct, we provide a relatively simple
proof of the generalized Sparre Andersen theorem for the survival probability
of a random walk on a line, with discrete or continuous jump distributions. For
the discrete jump process, we then derive the asymptotic large $n$ behavior of
$P(R_n)$ as well as of the average number of records $E(R_n)$. We show that
unlike the case of random walks with symmetric and continuous jump
distributions where the record statistics is strongly universal (i.e.,
independent of the jump distribution for all $n$), the record statistics for
lattice walks depends on the jump distribution for any fixed $n$. However, in
the large $n$ limit, we show that the distribution of the scaled record number
$R_n/E(R_n)$ approaches a universal, half-Gaussian form for any discrete jump
process. The dependence on the jump distribution enters only through the scale
factor $E(R_n)$, which we also compute in the large $n$ limit for arbitrary
jump distributions. We present explicit results for a few examples and provide
numerical checks of our analytical predictions.

based on available observations. Once a model has been calibrated, it can be
used as a forecasting tool to make predictions and to evaluate contingency
plans. It is customary to employ only point estimators for such predictions.
However, some models may fit the same data reasonably well for a broad range of
parameter values, and this flexibility means that predictions stemming from
such models will vary widely, depending on the particular parameter values
employed within the range that give a good fit. When data are poor or
incomplete, model uncertainty widens further. A way to circumvent this problem
is to use Bayesian statistics to incorporate observations and use the full
range of parameter estimates contained in the posterior distribution to adjust
for uncertainties in model predictions. Specifically, given the epidemiological
model and a probability distribution for observations, we use the posterior
distribution of model parameters to generate all possible epidemiological
curves via the posterior predictive distribution. From the envelope of all
curves one can extract the worst-case scenario and study the impact of
implementing contingency plans according to this assessment. We apply this
approach to the potential evolution of COVID-19 in Mexico City and assess
whether contingency plans are being successful and whether the epidemiological

The assumption is that the perfect channel state information (CSI) is known at
both the transmitter and the receiver and the number of antennas goes to
infinity. This latter assumption can be relaxed by a large number of antennas
in each RAU, similar to the case for all massive MIMO research. Simulation

opposite view. We argue that blockchains can and should be used to implement
economic mechanisms because they can help to overcome problems that occur if
trust in the mechanism designer cannot be assumed. Mechanism design deals with
the allocation of resources to agents, often by extracting private information
from them. Some mechanisms are immune to early information disclosure, while
others may heavily depend on it. Some mechanisms have to randomize to achieve
fairness and efficiency. Both issues, information disclosure, and randomness
require trust in the mechanism designer. If there is no trust, mechanisms can
be manipulated. We claim that mechanisms that use randomness or sequential
information disclosure are much harder, if not impossible, to audit. Therefore,
centralized implementation is often not a good solution. We consider some of
the most frequently used mechanisms in practice and identify circumstances
under which manipulation is possible. We propose a decentralized implementation
of such mechanisms, that can be, in practical terms, realized by blockchain
technology. Moreover, we argue in which environments a decentralized

installing the required infrastructure for serving Electric Vehicles (EVs).
Utilizing charging and discharging flexibility of parked EVs has the potential
to significantly increase the self-consumption of on-site renewable generation
and reduce building energy costs. Optimal charging and discharge management of
electric vehicles can fill the gap between self-generation and building
electric demand while accounting for electricity tariffs. Optimal interactions
between EVs and buildings will play a key role in the operation of power
networks with a high penetration of distributed energy resources, such as the
Portuguese electric grid. However, in Portugal, the existing regulation does
not allow financial transactions between buildings and EVs in exchange for
charging and discharging. This renders most proposed charging and discharging
management strategies impractical. This paper introduces a novel and practical
framework to connect electricity and parking values at commercial and public

in the context of parking time duration and added value services for the

since it is compatible with the current regulations and relies on existing

Solving directly
this type of optimization problem is often computationally unfeasible. Recent
studies suggest that one can instead turn this problem into one of solving a
dynamical system of equations, which can instead be solved efficiently using
numerical methods. This results in enabling the acquisition of optimal network
topologies from a variety of routing problems. However, the actual extraction
of the solution in terms of a final network topology relies on numerical
details which can prevent an accurate investigation of their topological
properties. In this context, theoretical results are fully accessible only to
an expert audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely
available or insufficiently documented. In particular, in this framework, final
graph acquisition is a challenging problem in-and-of-itself. Here we introduce
a method to extract networks topologies from dynamical equations related to
routing optimization under various parameters' settings. Our method is made of
three steps: first, it extracts an optimal trajectory by solving a dynamical
system, then it pre-extracts a network and finally, it filters out potential
redundancies. Remarkably, we propose a principled model to address the
filtering in the last step, and give a quantitative interpretation in terms of
a transport-related cost function. This principled filtering can be applied to
more general problems such as network extraction from images, thus going beyond
the scenarios envisioned in the first step. Overall, this novel algorithm
allows practitioners to easily extract optimal network topologies by combining
basic tools from numerical methods, optimization and network theory. Thus, we
provide an alternative to manual graph extraction which allows a grounded
extraction from a large variety of optimal topologies.

stakeholders, including botanists, pharmaceutical laboratories, taxonomists,
forestry services, and organizations. The concept has fueled an interest in
research and application from global researchers and engineers in both fields
of machine learning and computer vision. In this paper, the Vietnamese plant
image dataset was collected from an online encyclopedia of Vietnamese
organisms, together with the Encyclopedia of Life, to generate a total of
28,046 environmental images of 109 plant species in Vietnam. A comparative
evaluation of four deep convolutional feature extraction models, which are
MobileNetV2, VGG16, ResnetV2, and Inception Resnet V2, is presented. Those
models have been tested on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to
experiment with the purpose of plant image identification. The proposed models
achieve promising recognition rates, and MobilenetV2 attained the highest with
83.9%. This result demonstrates that machine learning models are potential for
plant species identification in the natural environment, and future works need
to examine proposing higher accuracy systems on a larger dataset to meet the
current application demand.

Height Functions to evaluate the interface curvature, implemented, to the
authors' knowledge, for the first time in OpenFOAM. The method is able to
significantly reduce spurious currents (almost to machine accuracy) for a
stationary droplet, showing second order convergence both for the curvature and
the interface shape. Accurate results are also obtained for additional test
cases such as translating droplets, capillary oscillations and rising bubbles,
for which numerical results are comparable to what obtained by other numerical
codes in the same conditions. Finally, the Height Functions method is extended
to include the treatment of contact angles, both for sessile droplets and
droplets suspended under the effect of gravity, showing a very good agreement
with the theoretical prediction. The code works in parallel mode and details on
the actual implementation in OpenFOAM are included to facilitate the

multicomponent mixtures. To our knowledge, this is the most detailed simulation
performed on this configuration, providing a useful theoretical and numerical
support for the experimental activity on this field. A recent experimental work
is used as a reference, in which a methanol droplet is suspended on a quartz

offers a detailed insight into the physics of the problem and a satisfactory
agreement with the experiments in terms of diameter decay, radial temperature
profiles and sensitivity to the oxygen concentration. The vaporization rate is
affected by the thermal conduction from the fiber, due to the high temperatures
involved. Moreover, the fiber perturbs the flame itself, providing quenching at
its surface. The combustion physics is compared to the one predicted at
zero-gravity, evidencing a lower standoff-ratio, a higher flame temperature and
an intense internal circulation. The distribution of the species around the
droplet shows (i) a local accumulation of intermediate oxidation products at
the fiber surface and (ii) water absorption in the liquid phase, affecting the
vaporization rate.

multidimensional computational framework for the evaporation of fuel droplets,
under the influence of a gravity field and an external fluid flow. The Volume
Of Fluid (VOF) methodology is adopted to dynamically track the interface,
coupled with the solution of energy and species equations. The evaporation rate
is directly evaluated based on the vapor concentration gradient at the phase
boundary, with no need of semi-empirical evaporation sub-models. The strong
surface tension forces often prevent to model small droplets evaporation,
because of the presence of parasitic currents. In this work we by-pass the
problem, eliminating surface tension and introducing a centripetal force toward
the center of the droplet. This expedient represents a major novelty of this
work, which allows to numerically hang a droplet on a fiber in normal gravity
conditions without modeling surface tension. Parasitic currents are completely
suppressed, allowing to accurately model the evaporation process whatever the
droplet size. DropletSMOKE++ shows an excellent agreement with the experimental
data in a wide range of operating conditions, for various fuels and initial
droplet diameters, both in natural and forced convection. The comparison with
the same cases modeled in microgravity conditions highlights the impact of an
external fluid flow on the evaporation mechanism, especially at high pressures.
Non-ideal thermodynamics for phase-equilibrium is included to correctly capture
evaporation rates at high pressures, otherwise not well predicted by an ideal
gas assumption. Finally, the presence of flow circulation in the liquid phase
is discussed, as well as its influence on the internal temperature field.
DropletSMOKE++ will be released as an open-source code, open to contributions
from the scientific community.

overcome current challenges such as the high-power consumption encountered by
artificial neural networks (ANNs), however there is still a gap between them
with respect to the recognition accuracy on practical tasks. A conversion
strategy was thus introduced recently to bridge this gap by mapping a trained
ANN to an SNN. However, it is still unclear that to what extent this obtained
SNN can benefit both the accuracy advantage from ANN and high efficiency from
the spike-based paradigm of computation. In this paper, we propose two new
conversion methods, namely TerMapping and AugMapping. The TerMapping is a
straightforward extension of a typical threshold-balancing method with a
double-threshold scheme, while the AugMapping additionally incorporates a new
scheme of augmented spike that employs a spike coefficient to carry the number
of typical all-or-nothing spikes occurring at a time step. We examine the
performance of our methods based on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets.
The results show that the proposed double-threshold scheme can effectively
improve accuracies of the converted SNNs. More importantly, the proposed
AugMapping is more advantageous for constructing accurate, fast and efficient
deep SNNs as compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. Our study therefore
provides new approaches for further integration of advanced techniques in ANNs
to improve the performance of SNNs, which could be of great merit to applied
developments with spike-based neuromorphic computing.

Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2), is responsible for this deadly disease.
International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) has declared that nCoV is
highly genetically similar to SARS-CoV epidemic in 2003 (89% similarity).
Limited number of clinically validated Human-nCoV protein interaction data is
available in the literature. With this hypothesis, the present work focuses on
developing a computational model for nCoV-Human protein interaction network,
using the experimentally validated SARS-CoV-Human protein interactions.
Initially, level-1 and level-2 human spreader proteins are identified in
SARS-CoV-Human interaction network, using Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible
(SIS) model. These proteins are considered as potential human targets for nCoV
bait proteins. A gene-ontology based fuzzy affinity function has been used to
construct the nCoV-Human protein interaction network at 99.98% specificity
threshold. This also identifies the level-1 human spreaders for COVID-19 in
human protein-interaction network. Level-2 human spreaders are subsequently
identified using the SIS model. The derived host-pathogen interaction network
is finally validated using 7 potential FDA listed drugs for COVID-19 with
significant overlap between the known drug target proteins and the identified
spreader proteins.

i) our EDES protocol (with minor modifications) was able to sample

modulated bandwidth. Because the data volume of chirp or pulse coding schemes
is too large, it brings much pressure to data acquisition and data processing.
So, we can use dechirp to reduce the amount of data. However, there is a
seriously non-linear problem in phase modulation, which strictly prohibited the
dechirp usage. Therefore, in order to solve the above problems, we propose a
method based on Electro-Optic Modulators to achieve a large-bandwidth chirp
signal. Meanwhile, give a method to resolve the seriously non-linear problems.
Firstly, by properly setting the amplitude of the input signal of electro-optic
modulators, the finite order signal coefficients are guaranteed to have an
absolute advantage. Then, an ideal chirp signal can be obtained by filtering
through an optical filter. Finally, the feasibility of the scheme is proved by
theory and experiments.

  Scatterometry is a fast, indirect and non-destructive optical method for
quality control in the production of lithography masks. To solve the inverse
problem in compliance with the upcoming need for improved accuracy, a
computationally expensive forward model has to be defined which maps geometry
parameters to diffracted light intensities.
  Aim:
  To quantify the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the geometry
parameters, a fast to evaluate surrogate for the forward model has to be
introduced.
  Approach:
  We use a non-intrusive polynomial chaos based approximation of the forward
model which increases speed and thus enables the exploration of the posterior
through direct Bayesian inference. Additionally, this surrogate allows for a
global sensitivity analysis at no additional computational overhead.
  Results:
  This approach yields information about the complete distribution of the
geometry parameters of a silicon line grating, which in return allows to
quantify the reconstruction uncertainties in the form of means, variances and
higher order moments of the parameters.
  Conclusion:
  The use of a polynomial chaos surrogate allows to quantify both parameter
influences and reconstruction uncertainties. This approach is easy to use since
no adaptation of the expensive forward model is required.

repeatable mechanisms or approaches to sharing data in a timely, fair, safe and
equitable way. However, there is a gap in terms of practical guidance about how
to establish and operate a data trust.
  Aim and Approach: In December 2019, the Canadian Institute for Health
Information and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence convened a
working meeting of 19 people representing 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives
involved in data sharing, most of which focus on public sector health data. The
objective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and
operation of data trusts. Preliminary findings were presented during the
meeting then refined as participants and co-authors identified relevant
literature and contributed to this manuscript.
  Results: Twelve (12) minimum specification requirements (min specs) for data
trusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet
all legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share
data. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an
accountable governing body which ensures the data trust advances its stated
purpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including
responsible parties and clear processes for the collection, storage, access,
disclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for
all data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement.
  Conclusion / Implications: Based on a review of the literature and advice
from participants from 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives, practical
guidance in the form of twelve min specs for data trusts were agreed on. Public
engagement and continued exchange of insights and experience is recommended on
this evolving topic.

because the solid constantly exists between the two fluids due to the use of
the single design variable field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the

commercial value in the grocery retail industry. Analyzing shopping
transactions demands techniques that can cope with the volume and
dimensionality of grocery transactional data while keeping interpretable
outcomes. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) provides a suitable framework to
process grocery transactions and to discover a broad representation of
customers' shopping motivations. However, summarizing the posterior
distribution of an LDA model is challenging, while individual LDA draws may not
be coherent and cannot capture topic uncertainty. Moreover, the evaluation of
LDA models is dominated by model-fit measures which may not adequately capture
the qualitative aspects such as interpretability and stability of topics.
  In this paper, we introduce clustering methodology that post-processes
posterior LDA draws to summarise the entire posterior distribution and identify
semantic modes represented as recurrent topics. Our approach is an alternative
to standard label-switching techniques and provides a single posterior summary
set of topics, as well as associated measures of uncertainty. Furthermore, we
establish a more holistic definition for model evaluation, which assesses topic
models based not only on their likelihood but also on their coherence,
distinctiveness and stability. By means of a survey, we set thresholds for the
interpretation of topic coherence and topic similarity in the domain of grocery
retail data. We demonstrate that the selection of recurrent topics through our
clustering methodology not only improves model likelihood but also outperforms
the qualitative aspects of LDA such as interpretability and stability. We
illustrate our methods on an example from a large UK supermarket chain.

humans. This model highlights the importance of the localization of the
transition between a convective and a diffusive transport of respiratory gas.
This localization determines how ventilation should be controlled in order to
minimize its energetic cost at any metabolic regime. We generalized this model
to any mammal, based on the core morphometric characteristics shared by all
mammalian lungs and on their allometric scaling from the literature. Since the
main energetic costs of ventilation are related to convective transport, we
prove that, for all mammals, the localization of the shift from a convective
transport to a diffusive transport plays a critical role on keeping this cost
low while fulfilling the lung function. Our model predicts for the first time
the localization of this transition in order to minimize the energetic cost of
ventilation, depending on mammal mass and metabolic regime. From this optimal
localization, we are able to predict allometric scaling laws for both tidal
volumes and breathing rates, at any metabolic rate. We ran our model for the
three common metabolic rates -- basal, field and maximal -- and showed that our
predictions reproduce accurately experimental data available in the literature.
Our analysis supports the hypothesis that mammals allometric scaling laws of
tidal volumes and breathing rates at a given metabolic rate are driven by a few
core geometrical characteristics shared by mammalian lungs and by the physical
processes of respiratory gas transport.
