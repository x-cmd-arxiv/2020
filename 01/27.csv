MNRAS, in press",,"10.1093/mnras/staa194",,"astro-ph.HE astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The dynamical production of low-mass X-ray binaries and brighter cataclysmic
variables (CVs) in dense globular clusters is well-established. We investigate
how the X-ray emissivity of fainter X-ray binaries (principally CVs and
coronally active binaries) varies between different environments. We compile
calculations (largely from the literature) of the X-ray emissivity of old
stellar populations, including open and globular clusters and several galaxies.
We investigate three literature claims of unusual X-ray sources in low-density
stellar populations. We show that a suggested quiescent neutron star in the
open cluster NGC 6819 is a foreground M dwarf. We show that the suggested
diffuse X-ray emission from an old nova shell in the globular cluster NGC 6366
is actually a background galaxy cluster. And we show that a suggested
population of quiescent X-ray binaries in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy is mostly
(perhaps entirely) background galaxies. We find that above densities of $10^4$
M$_{\odot}$/pc$^3$, the X-ray emissivity of globular clusters increases, due to
dynamical production of X-ray emitting systems. Below this density, globular
clusters have lower X-ray emissivity than the other populations, and we do not
see a strong dependence of X-ray emissivity due to density effects. We find
significant correlations between X-ray emissivity and binary fraction,
metallicity, and density. Sampling these fits via bootstrap techniques gives
less significant correlations, but confirms the effect of metallicity on
low-density populations, and that of density on the full globular cluster
sample.

effect on the solar cell efficiency of Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites has
unleashed an intensive research effort to reveal its origin. This effort,
however, has been met with more challenges as the underlying material structure
has still not been identified; new modellings and observations also do not seem
to converge. Using 2D (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 as an example, we show that 3D MAPbBr3
is formed due to the loss of BA on the edge. This self-formed MAPbBr3 can
explain the reported edge emission under various conditions, while the reported
intriguing optoelectronic properties such as fast exciton trapping from the
interior 2D perovskite, rapid exciton dissociation and long carrier lifetime
can be understood via the self-formed 2D/3D lateral perovskite heterostructure.
The 3D perovskite is identified by submicron infrared spectroscopy, the
emergence of XRD signature from freezer-milled nanometer-sized 2D perovskite
and its photoluminescence response to external hydrostatic pressure. The
revelation of this edge emission mystery and the identification of a
self-formed 2D/3D heterostructure provide a new approach to engineering 2D

Biot's low- and high-frequency regimes. Using either a low-storage explicit or

verify its numerical accuracy. In the Biot low frequency case, the wave can be
highly dissipative for small permeabilities; here, numerical errors associated

Privacy of an individual could be severely affected when their sensitive
private information contained in EHR is leaked or exposed to public. Data leak
can cause financial losses or an individuals may encounter social boycott if
their medical condition is exposed in public. To protect patients personal data
from such threats, there exists different privacy regulations such as GDPR,

centralization in social networks and contraction or collapse in the diversity
of semantic expressions such as ideas, opinions, and tastes. We advance formal
examination of this relationship by introducing new methods of manifold
learning that allow us to map social networks and semantic combinations into
comparable hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic representations natively represent
both hierarchy and diversity within a system. We illustrate this method by
examining the relationship between social centralization and semantic diversity
within 21st Century physics, empirically demonstrating how dense, centralized
collaboration is associated with a reduction in the space of ideas and how
these patterns generalize to all modern scholarship and science. We discuss the
complex of causes underlying this association, and theorize the dynamic
interplay between structural centralization and semantic contraction, arguing
that it introduces an essential tension between the supply and demand of
difference.

estimation schemes worked with relatively smaller frame size and large number
of rounds. Here we propose a new estimator named \textquotedblleft Gaussian
Estimator of Active Nodes,\textquotedblright (GEAN), that works with large
enough frame size under which testing statistics is well approximated as a
Gaussian variable, thereby requiring less number of frames, and thus less total
number of channel slots to attain a desired accuracy in estimation. More
specifically, the selection of the frame size is done according to Triangular
Array Central Limit Theorem which also enables us to quantify the approximation
error. Larger frame size helps the statistical average to converge faster to
the ensemble mean of the estimator and the quantification of the approximation
error helps to determine the number of rounds to keep up with the accuracy
requirements. We present the analysis of our scheme under two different channel
models i.e. $ \{0,1 \} $ and $ \{0,1,e \} $, whereas all previous schemes
worked only under $ \{0,1 \} $ channel model. The overall performance of GEAN
is better than the previously proposed schemes considering the number of slots
required for estimation to achieve a given level of estimation accuracy.

Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated oxide metal in which octahedral tilts and

photoemission measurements reveal the destruction of a large hole-like Fermi
surface upon cooling through a coupled structural and spin-reorientation

We demonstrate how these result from band hybridisation mediated by a hidden

distortions and unlocked when the spin reorients perpendicular to the local
symmetry-breaking potential at the Ru sites. We argue that the electronic
energy gain associated with the band hybridisation is actually the key driver
for the phase transition, reflecting a delicate interplay between spin-orbit
coupling and strong electronic correlations, and revealing a new route to
control magnetic ordering in solids.

labels, which could permit more efficient and scalable labeling of images. In
this work, we develop a lopsided loss function based on entropy regularization
that assumes the existence of a nontrivial false negative rate in the target
annotations. Starting with a carefully annotated brain metastasis lesion
dataset, we simulate data with false negatives by (1) randomly censoring the
annotated lesions and (2) systematically censoring the smallest lesions. The
latter better models true physician error because smaller lesions are harder to
notice than the larger ones. Even with a simulated false negative rate as high
as 50%, applying our loss function to randomly censored data preserves maximum
sensitivity at 97% of the baseline with uncensored training data, compared to
just 10% for a standard loss function. For the size-based censorship,
performance is restored from 17% with the current standard to 88% with our
lopsided bootstrap loss. Our work will enable more efficient scaling of the
image labeling process, in parallel with other approaches on creating more
efficient user interfaces and tools for annotation.

More exactly, we find asymptotic formulas for smoothed sums of the singular
series minus one. Based upon Gross and Smith's conjectures, we use our result
to suggest that for large enough 'short intervals' in an algebraic number field
K, the variance of counts of prime elements in a random short interval deviates
from a Cramer model prediction by a universal factor, independent of K. The
conjecture over number fields generalizes a classical conjecture of Goldston
and Montgomery over the integers. Numerical data is provided supporting the
conjecture.

fascinating electrochemical and tribological properties, and have received
widespread attention in industrial applications. Molecular chiralities of
spiroborate anions have a significant effect on microstructures and macroscopic
functionalities of these ionic materials in applications, and thus deserve a
fundamental understanding. In current work, we performed quantum chemistry
calculations to address binding strength and coordination structures of chiral
bis(mandelato)borate ([BMB]) anions with representative alkali metal ions, as
well as electronic properties of alkali metal ion-[BMB] ion pair complexes. The
optimized [BMB] conformers are categorized into V-shaped, bent, and twisted
structures with varied electrostatic potential contours, conformational
energies, and distinct alkali metal ion-[BMB] binding structures. Alkali metal
ions have additional associations with phenyl groups in V-shaped [BMB]
conformers owing to preferential cation-$\pi$ interactions. Furthermore,
effects of molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions on thermodynamics and
microstructural properties of tetraalkylphosphonium [BMB] ILs were studied by
performing extensive atomistic interactions. Oxygen atoms in [BMB] anions have
competitive hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrogen atoms in cations
depending on molecular chiralities and steric hindrance effects of [BMB]
anions. However, molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions have negligible effect
on liquid densities of tetraalkylphosphonium [BMB] ILs and spatial
distributions of boron atoms in anions around phosphorous atoms in cations.
Enlarging tetraalkylphosphonium cation sizes leads to enhanced cation-anion
hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions due to enhanced segregation of
polar groups in apolar networks in heterogeneous IL matrices.

representations without the use of expensive input keypoint-level annotations.
A popular approach is to factorize an image into a pose and appearance data
stream, then to reconstruct the image from the factorized components. The pose
representation should capture a set of consistent and tightly localized
landmarks in order to facilitate reconstruction of the input image. Ultimately,
we wish for our learned landmarks to focus on the foreground object of
interest. However, the reconstruction task of the entire image forces the model
to allocate landmarks to model the background. This work explores the effects
of factorizing the reconstruction task into separate foreground and background
reconstructions, conditioning only the foreground reconstruction on the
unsupervised landmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
factorization results in landmarks that are focused on the foreground object of
interest. Furthermore, the rendered background quality is also improved, as the
background rendering pipeline no longer requires the ill-suited landmarks to
model its pose and appearance. We demonstrate this improvement in the context
of the video-prediction task.

particle showers (cascades) in IceCube data from 2010 -- 2015. Assuming
standard oscillations, the astrophysical neutrinos in this dedicated cascade
sample are dominated ($\sim 90 \%$) by electron and tau flavors. The flux,
observed in the sensitive energy range from $16\,\mathrm{TeV}$ to
$2.6\,\mathrm{PeV}$, is consistent with a single power-law model as expected
from Fermi-type acceleration of high energy particles at astrophysical sources.
We find the flux spectral index to be $\gamma=2.53\pm0.07$ and a flux
normalization for each neutrino flavor of $\phi_{astro} = 1.66^{+0.25}_{-0.27}$
at $E_{0} = 100\, \mathrm{TeV}$, in agreement with IceCube's complementary muon
neutrino results and with all-neutrino flavor fit results. In the measured
energy range we reject spectral indices $\gamma\leq2.28$ at $\ge3\sigma$
significance level. Due to high neutrino energy resolution and low atmospheric
neutrino backgrounds, this analysis provides the most detailed characterization
of the neutrino flux at energies below $\sim100\,{\rm{TeV}}$ compared to
previous IceCube results. Results from fits assuming more complex neutrino flux
models suggest a flux softening at high energies and a flux hardening at low
energies (p-value $\ge 0.06$). The sizable and smooth flux measured below $\sim
100\,{\rm{TeV}}$ remains a puzzle. In order to not violate the isotropic
diffuse gamma-ray background as measured by the Fermi-LAT, it suggests the
existence of astrophysical neutrino sources characterized by dense environments
which are opaque to gamma-rays.

applications from computer-assisted diagnosis to image-guided surgery. In this
context, we address fully-automated multi-organ segmentation from abdominal CT

conditional generative adversarial networks. Additionally to the discriminator
which enforces the model to create realistic organ delineations, it embeds
cascaded partially pre-trained convolutional encoder-decoders as generator.
Encoder fine-tuning from a large amount of non-medical images alleviates data
scarcity limitations. The network is trained end-to-end to benefit from
simultaneous multi-level segmentation refinements using auto-context. Results :
Employed for healthy liver, kidneys and spleen segmentation, our pipeline
provides promising results by outperforming state-of-the-art encoder-decoder
schemes. Followed for the Combined Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation (CHAOS)
challenge organized in conjunction with the IEEE International Symposium on
Biomedical Imaging 2019, it gave us the first rank for three competition
categories: liver CT, liver MR and multi-organ MR segmentation. Conclusion :
Combining cascaded convolutional and adversarial networks strengthens the
ability of deep learning pipelines to automatically delineate multiple
abdominal organs, with good generalization capability. Significance : The
comprehensive evaluation provided suggests that better guidance could be
achieved to help clinicians in abdominal image interpretation and clinical
decision making.

web content, existing taxonomies will become outdated and fail to capture

whether a query concept is the direct hyponym of an anchor concept. We develop
two innovative techniques in TaxoExpan: (1) a position-enhanced graph neural
network that encodes the local structure of an anchor concept in the existing
taxonomy, and (2) a noise-robust training objective that enables the learned

Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets from different domains

characterization of all sources of randomness in the measured data, which
includes the variability within the ensemble of objects to-be-imaged. This can
be accomplished by establishing a stochastic object model (SOM) that describes
the variability in the class of objects to-be-imaged. Generative adversarial
networks (GANs) can be potentially useful to establish SOMs because they hold
great promise to learn generative models that describe the variability within
an ensemble of training data. However, because medical imaging systems record
imaging measurements that are noisy and indirect representations of object
properties, GANs cannot be directly applied to establish stochastic models of
objects to-be-imaged. To address this issue, an augmented GAN architecture
named AmbientGAN was developed to establish SOMs from noisy and indirect

the applicability of the AmbientGAN can be potentially limited. In this work,
we propose a novel training strategy---Progressive Growing of AmbientGANs

computation of the IO test statistic is generally intractable. To approximate
the IO test statistic, sampling-based methods that employ Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been developed. However, current applications of
MCMC techniques have been limited to several object models such as a lumpy
object model and a binary texture model, and it remains unclear how MCMC
methods can be implemented with other more sophisticated object models. Deep
learning methods that employ generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold great
promise to learn stochastic object models (SOMs) from image data. In this
study, we described a method to approximate the IO by applying MCMC techniques
to SOMs learned by use of GANs. The proposed method can be employed with
arbitrary object models that can be learned by use of GANs, thereby the domain
of applicability of MCMC techniques for approximating the IO performance is
extended. In this study, both signal-known-exactly (SKE) and

exacerbate biases along the axes of gender and skin tone when given a skewed

generation using GANs as an economical way to augment data for training
data-hungry machine learning models, it is unclear whether they recognize the
perils of such techniques when applied to real world datasets biased along
latent dimensions. Specifically, we show that (1) traditional GANs further skew
the distribution of a dataset consisting of engineering faculty headshots,
generating minority modes less often and of worse quality and (2)
image-to-image translation (conditional) GANs also exacerbate biases by
lightening skin color of non-white faces and transforming female facial
features to be masculine when generating faces of engineering professors. Thus,
our study is meant to serve as a cautionary tale.

in the surface layers and the FM appears in deeper bulk layers. We then show
that the surface layered AFM transits into the FM at a critical magnetic field
of 2 T, similar to what was found in the few layer case. Interestingly,
concurrent with this magnetic phase transition, we discover a first-order
structural phase transition that alters the crystallographic point group from
C3i to C2h and thus, from a symmetry perspective, this monoclinic structural
phase belongs to the 3D nematic order universality class. Our result not only
unveils the complex single magnon behavior in 3D CrI3, but also settles down

typically assumed to play a large role in generating the quiescent dust coma

campaigns of the CO J=2-1 rotational line using the Arizona Radio Observatory
10m Sub-millimeter Telescope during 2016 and 2018-2019, and compared the
results to visible magnitudes obtained at the same time. As the Centaur
approached its 2019 perihelion, the quiescent dust coma grew $\sim$45\% in
brightness, while it is unclear whether the quiescent CO production rate also
increased. A doubling of the CO production rate on 2016 Feb 28.6 UT did not
trigger an outburst nor a rise in dust production for at least 10 days.
Similarly, two dust outbursts occurred in 2018 while CO production continued at
quiescent rates. Two other dust outbursts may show gas involvement. The data
indicate that CO- and dust-outbursts are not always well-correlated. This may
be explained if CO is not always substantially incorporated with the dust
component in the nucleus, or if CO is primarily released through a porous
material. Additionally, other minor volatiles or physical processes may help
generate dust outbursts.

identification methods of those models vary. It remains unclear what is the
necessary parameterization of a prediction model, whether online adaptation of
the model is necessary, and whether prediction can help improve safety and
efficiency during human robot collaboration. These problems result from the
difficulty to quantitatively evaluate various prediction models in a
closed-loop fashion in real human-robot interaction settings. This paper
develops a method to evaluate the closed-loop performance of different
prediction models. In particular, we compare models with different
parameterizations and models with or without online parameter adaptation.
Extensive experiments were conducted on a human robot collaboration platform.
The experimental results demonstrated that human motion prediction
significantly enhanced the collaboration efficiency and human safety. Adaptable
prediction models that were parameterized by neural networks achieved the best
performance.

data with a wide range of service providers, hoping that their data will remain
confidential. Thus, in case of an unauthorized distribution of their personal
data by these service providers (or in case of a data breach) data owners want
to identify the source of such data leakage. Digital fingerprinting schemes
have been developed to embed a hidden and unique fingerprint into shared
digital content, especially multimedia, to provide such liability guarantees.
However, existing techniques utilize the high redundancy in the content, which
is typically not included in personal data. In this work, we propose a
probabilistic fingerprinting scheme that efficiently generates the fingerprint
by considering a fingerprinting probability (to keep the data utility high) and
publicly known inherent correlations between data points. To improve the
robustness of the proposed scheme against colluding malicious service
providers, we also utilize the Boneh-Shaw fingerprinting codes as a part of the
proposed scheme. Furthermore, observing similarities between privacy-preserving
data sharing techniques (that add controlled noise to the shared data) and the
proposed fingerprinting scheme, we make a first attempt to develop a data
sharing scheme that provides both privacy and fingerprint robustness at the
same time. We experimentally show that fingerprint robustness and privacy have
conflicting objectives and we propose a hybrid approach to control such a
trade-off with a design parameter. Using the proposed hybrid approach, we show
that individuals can improve their level of privacy by slightly compromising
from the fingerprint robustness. We implement and evaluate the performance of
the proposed scheme on real genomic data. Our experimental results show the

Grasping the accurate crowd location (rather than merely crowd count) is
important for spatially identifying high-risk regions in congested scenes. In
this paper, we propose a Compressed Sensing based Output Encoding (CSOE)
scheme, which casts detecting pixel coordinates of small objects into a task of
signal regression in encoding signal space. CSOE helps to boost localization
performance in circumstances where targets are highly crowded without huge
scale variation. In addition, proper receptive field sizes are crucial for
crowd analysis due to human size variations. We create Multiple Dilated
Convolution Branches (MDCB) that offers a set of different receptive field
sizes, to improve localization accuracy when objects sizes change drastically
in an image. Also, we develop an Adaptive Receptive Field Weighting (ARFW)
module, which further deals with scale variation issue by adaptively
emphasizing informative channels that have proper receptive field size.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four mainstream datasets,
especially achieves excellent results in highly crowded scenes. More
importantly, experiments support our insights that it is crucial to tackle
target size variation issue in crowd analysis task, and casting crowd
localization as regression in encoding signal space is quite effective for

were designed for the maximum speed of 90 km/hour. The current market demand
led to an increase in maximum speed to 110 km/hour. We investigate the effects
of this speed increase in the occurrence of cracks of the axle box bogies.
Based on the data obtained from PT Kereta Api Indonesia, a statistical approach
is first used to see a relationship between the occurrence of cracks and some
parameters, namely the distance to one-way destination, the speed, and the
number of stops that the trains make to arrive at the destination. From this
statistical study, stopping frequency is the most dominant factor that affects
the occurrence of cracks and that the increase in speed leads to an increase in
the crack's occurrence. A mathematical model is then designed to further
describe the effects of this increased velocity on the structure of axle box
bogies. From this model, a resonance analysis is derived and numerical
experiments are carried out. It is shown that the wagon resonance is highly
dependent on the velocity. An example of typical data shows that this resonance
occurs when the train reaches a velocity at approximately 104 km/hour. These
resonance effects are believed to create a larger distance between parts of the
axle box bogie that influence the occurrence of the cracks.

  Methods: We use the novel very large zenith angle observations with the MAGIC

an auxiliary procedure of monitoring atmospheric transmission in order to
assure proper calibration of the accumulated data. This employs recording of
optical images of the stellar field next to the source position, which provides
a better than 10% accuracy for the transmission measurements.
  Results: We demonstrate that MAGIC very large zenith angle observations yield
a collection area larger than a square kilometer. In only ~56 hr of

Conventional systems work in an active way in the sense that an active carrier

Especially in the era of 5G6G and with the advent of the Internet of Things

systems with important challenges including limited spectrum resources,
information security, energy consumption and cost efficiency. Here, we
introduce the fundamentally different concept of passive wireless communication
(PWC) which has the potential to resolve the above-mentioned issues. PWC
transfers digital information by modulating demodulating already existing
omnipresent ambient stray electromagnetic waves using a programmable
metasurface. We provide a theoretical framework for encoding decoding and
modulating demodulating in PWC and build a proof-of-principle prototype system
leveraging existing commodity 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals. We demonstrate information
transfer from Alice to Bob with data rates on the order of hundreds of Kbps
using distinguishable information-carrying control coding patterns of
metasurface, neither necessitating an active carrier signal and its associated
radio-frequency chain nor affecting the background active wireless
communication. The presented strategy is particularly appealing for green IoT
connectivity. At the same time, the concept is applicable to all types of wave
phenomena and provides a fundamentally new perspective on the design of future
wireless communication architectures.

act with a high level of autonomy, reducing the burden of manual tasking or
teleoperation. To achieve this level of autonomy, robots must be able to work
fluidly with its human partners, inferring their needs without explicit
commands. This inference requires the robot to be able to detect and classify
the heterogeneity of its partners. We propose a framework for learning from
heterogeneous demonstration based upon Bayesian inference and evaluate a suite
of approaches on a real-world dataset of gameplay from StarCraft II. This
evaluation provides evidence that our Bayesian approach can outperform
conventional methods by up to 12.8$%$.

not only for cosmology and nuclear astrophysics. As a byproduct of these and
subsequent observations, it is now clear that neutron-star mergers can be a
competitive site for the production of half of the elements heavier than iron
in the universe following a sequence of fast neutron capture reactions known as
the r process. In this article we discuss an effect which has been so far
neglected in calculations of r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers.
We show that the corrections due to the neutron environment even at relatively
small neutron densities, within the bounds of numerical hydrodynamical
simulations of neutron star mergers and after the onset of the r process, are
non-negligible and need to be taken into account to accurately describe the
elemental abundance as determined by observations.

obtain a Speech Enhancement (SE) gain function, in combination with a Super
Gaussian Joint Maximum a Posteriori (SGJMAP) single microphone SE gain
function. The proposed SE method can be implemented on a smartphone that works
as an assistive device to hearing aids. Although coherence SE gain function
suppresses the background noise well, it distorts the speech. In contrary, SE
using SGJMAP improves speech quality with additional musical noise, which we
contain by using a post filter. The weighted union of these two gain functions
strikes a balance between noise suppression and speech distortion. A
'weighting' parameter is introduced in the derived gain function to allow the
smartphone user to control the weighting factor based on different background
noise and their comfort level of hearing. Objective and subjective measures of
the proposed method show effective improvement in comparison to standard
techniques considered in this paper for several noisy conditions at signal to
noise ratio levels of -5 dB, 0 dB and 5 dB.

Temperature-dependent inverse magnetic susceptibility coincides with a
piecewise linear function with five regimes, with which we fit a Curie-Weiss
law and calculate the frustration factor $f$. The fit results indicate a
formation of magnetic polarons between 300 and 540 K and a very strong magnetic

lattice configurations (\emph{a}, \emph{b}, \emph{c}, and \emph{V}) obey well
the Gr$\ddot{\textrm{u}}$neisen approximations with an anomaly appearing around
900 K, implying an isosymmetric structural phase transition, and display an
anisotropic character along the crystallographic \emph{a}, \emph{b}, and
\emph{c} axes with the incompressibility $K^a_0 > K^c_0 > K^b_0$. It is
interesting to find that at 321 K, the local distortion size $\Delta$(O2)
$\approx$ 1.96$\Delta$(O1) $\approx$ 4.32$\Delta$(Y) $\approx$
293.89$\Delta$(Cr). Based on the refined Y-O and Cr-O bond lengths, we deduce
the local distortion environments and modes of Y, Cr, O1, and O2 ions.
Especially, the Y and O2 ions display obvious atomic displacement and charge
subduction, which may shed light on the dielectric property of the YCrO$_3$
compound. Additionally, by comparing Kramers Mn$^{3+}$ with non-Kramers

strongly affect the local distortion size, whereas, it may not be able to

Our upper bound is attained by a simple variant of $\textit{{certainty

minimal number of discontinuities is proposed in this work, with the aim to
avoid unnecessary, costly end effector lift-offs for manipulators. The problem
is motivated by the automatic polishing of an object. Due to the non-bijective
mapping between the workspace and the joint-space, a continuous coverage path
in the workspace may easily be truncated in the joint-space, incuring
undesirable end effector lift-offs. Inversely, there may be multiple
configuration choices to cover the same point of a coverage path through the
solution of the Inverse Kinematics. The solution departs from the conventional
local optimisation of the coverage path shape in task space, or choosing
appropriate but possibly disconnected configurations, to instead explicitly
explore the leaast number of discontinuous motions through the analysis of the
structure of valid configurations in joint-space. The two novel contributions
of this paper include proof that the least number of path discontinuities is
predicated on the surrounding environment, independent from the choice of the
actual coverage path; thus has a minimum. And an efficient finite cellular
decomposition method to optimally divide the workspace into the minimum number
of cells, each traversable without discontinuties by any arbitrary coverage
path within. Extensive simulation examples and real-world results on a 5 DoF
manipulator are presented to prove the validity of the proposed strategy in
realistic settings.

richness bins, with average photometric redshifts ranging from 0.70 to 0.80.
The richest bin shows a clear temperature decrement at 148 GHz in the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope data, which we attribute to the SZ effect. All richness
bins show an increment at 220 GHz, which we attribute to dust emission from
cluster galaxies. We correct for dust emission using stacked profiles from
Herschel Stripe 82 data, and allow for synchrotron emission using stacked
profiles created by binning source fluxes from NVSS data. We see dust emission
in all three richness bins, but can only confidently detect the SZ decrement in
the highest richness bin, finding $M_{500}$ = $8.7^{+1.7}_{-1.3} \times 10^{13}

percent, indicating a partial fill-in of the SZ decrement from thermal dust and
synchrotron emission by the cluster member galaxies. We compare our corrected

interactions, such as hydrogen bond and van der Waals (vdW) force. Especially,
identifying the host-guest interactions in porous materials directly at the
molecular level will bring a deeper insight into the behaviors of guest
molecules during the sorption, catalysis, gas separation and energy storage. In
this work, we directly resolved the ordered configurations of p-xylenes (PXs)
adsorbed in ZSM-5 frameworks by the scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM) with the integrated differential phase contrast (iDPC) technique to
identify the host-guest vdW interactions. Based on these observations, we
revealed that the PXs in one straight channel modified the channel geometry
with a coherent orientation. And the adjacent straight channels were deformed
up to 8.8% along the different directions corresponding to three dominant PX
configurations, resulting a negligible overall expansion of ZSM-5 lattices.
Then, we could also image the disorder and desorption of PXs in ZSM-5 channels
during the in situ heating. This work not only helped us to study the
host-guest vdW interactions and the sorption behaviors of PXs in ZSM-5, but
also provided an efficient tool for further imaging and studying other

main reason is that the protocol software state-space is too large to be

automatically generate high-coverage test input packets for a network protocol

ascertaining such an attribution is via the game theoretic Shapley value
decomposition of the coefficient of determination. Such a decomposition has the
desirable efficiency, monotonicity, and equal treatment properties. Under a
weak assumption that the joint distribution is pseudo-elliptical, we obtain the

that our asymptotic confidence intervals are computationally superior to

this end, we explicitly derive the estimation distortion of a coded

Based on this result, we show that in a homogeneous sensing system with

hybrid coding policy, we develop three greedy algorithms, in which the pure

improves performance by using a group of potential sub-polices, and the sorted

tasks simultaneously could generally improve the performance of individual task
due to knowledge sharing in multi-task learning. While a few existing works

the OWC channel is not isotropic, meaning that the device orientation affects
the channel gain significantly. However, due to the lack of proper channel
models for LiFi systems, many studies have assumed that the receiver is
vertically upward and randomly located within the coverage area, which is not a
realistic assumption from a practical point of view. In this paper, novel
realistic and measurement-based channel models for indoor LiFi systems are
proposed. Precisely, the statistics of the channel gain are derived for the
case of randomly oriented stationary and mobile LiFi receivers. For stationary
users, two channel models are proposed, namely, the modified truncated Laplace

models are proposed, namely, the sum of modified truncated Gaussian (SMTG)

the impact of random orientation and spatial distribution of LiFi users is
investigated, where we show that the aforementioned factors can strongly affect

the very first attempt to solve the GAN-based fake localization problem with a
gray-scale fakeness map that preserves more information of fake regions. To
improve the universality of FakeLocator across multifarious facial attributes,
we introduce an attention mechanism to guide the training of the model. To
improve the universality of FakeLocator across different DeepFake methods, we

a stable environment. This implies that behavioral variability arises from
sources within the brain, but the origin and mechanics of these processes
remain largely unknown. Here, we focus on the observation that the timing of
self-initiated actions shows large variability even when they are executed in
stable, well-learned sequences. Could this mix of reliability and stochasticity
arise within the same circuit? We trained rats to perform a stereotyped
sequence of self-initiated actions and recorded neural ensemble activity in
secondary motor cortex (M2), which is known to reflect trial-by-trial action
timing fluctuations. Using hidden Markov models we established a robust and
accurate dictionary between ensemble activity patterns and actions. We then
showed that metastable attractors, representing activity patterns with the
requisite combination of reliable sequential structure and high transition
timing variability, could be produced by reciprocally coupling a high
dimensional recurrent network and a low dimensional feedforward one.
Transitions between attractors were generated by correlated variability arising
from the feedback loop between the two networks. This mechanism predicted a
specific structure of low-dimensional noise correlations that were empirically
verified in M2 ensemble dynamics. This work suggests a robust network motif as
a novel mechanism to support critical aspects of animal behavior and
establishes a framework for investigating its circuit origins via correlated

task in understanding remote sensing images. Recently, deep learning-based

shown enormous potential to understand remote sensing images. CNN-based methods
meet with success by utilizing features learned from data rather than features
designed manually. The feature-learning procedure of CNN largely depends on the
architecture of CNN. However, most of the architectures of CNN used for remote
sensing scene classification are still designed by hand which demands a
considerable amount of architecture engineering skills and domain knowledge,
and it may not play CNN's maximum potential on a special dataset. In this
paper, we proposed an automatically architecture learning procedure for remote
sensing scene classification. We designed a parameters space in which every set
of parameters represents a certain architecture of CNN (i.e., some parameters
represent the type of operators used in the architecture such as convolution,
pooling, no connection or identity, and the others represent the way how these
operators connect). To discover the optimal set of parameters for a given
dataset, we introduced a learning strategy which can allow efficient search in
the architecture space by means of gradient descent. An architecture generator
finally maps the set of parameters into the CNN used in our experiments.

predicts the components movement during reflow in x and y-directions as well as
rotation. Our study is composed of two steps: (1) experimental data are studied
to reveal the relationships between self-alignment and various factors
including component geometry, pad geometry, etc. (2) advanced machine learning
prediction models are applied to predict the distance and the direction of
components shift using support vector regression (SVR), neural network (NN),

multiscale excitable systems, seen for example in physics and neuroscience, has
been the subject of active enquiry since the early 1980s. This classification
problem is fundamental as it also establishes analytical and numerical
foundations for studying complex temporal behaviours in multiple timescale
models. This manuscript begins by reviewing the seminal works of Rinzel and
Izhikevich in classifying bursting patterns of excitable cell models. Moreover,
we recall an alternative, yet complementary, mathematical classification
approach by Golubitsky, which together with the Rinzel-Izhikevich proposals
provide the state-of-the-art foundations to the classification problem.
Unexpectedly, while keeping within the Rinzel-Izhikevich framework, we find
novel cases of bursting mechanisms not considered before. Moving beyond the
state-of-the-art, we identify novel bursting mechanisms that fall outside the
current classifications. This leads us towards a new classification, which
requires the analysis of both the fast and the slow subsystems of an underlying
slow-fast model. This new classification allows the dynamical dissection of a
larger class of bursters. To substantiate this, we add a new class of bursters
with at least two slow variables, which we denote folded-node bursters, to
convey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a folded-node
singularity. In fact, there are two main families of folded-node bursters,
depending upon the phase of the bursting cycle during which folded-node
dynamics occurs. If it occurs during the silent phase, we obtain the classical
folded-node bursting (or simply folded-node bursting). If it occurs during the
active phase, we have cyclic folded-node bursting. We classify both families

structural inputs, diagonal and transition densities, for $^{24}$Mg obtained
with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics to the ($\alpha,\alpha'$) cross
sections. We aim at clarifying how the $B({\rm IS0})$-$(\alpha,\alpha')$
correspondence is affected by the nuclear distortion, the in-medium
modification to the nucleon-nucleon effective interaction in the scattering
process, and the coupled-channels effect. It is found that these effects are
significant and the explanation of the $B({\rm IS0})$-$(\alpha,\alpha')$
correspondence in the plane wave limit with the long-wavelength approximation,
which is often used, makes no sense. Nevertheless, the $B({\rm
IS0})$-$(\alpha,\alpha')$ correspondence tends to remain because of a strong
constraint on the transition densities between the ground state and the $0^+$
excited states. The correspondence is found to hold at 386 MeV with an error of
about 20%-30%, while it is seriously stained at 130 MeV mainly by the strong
nuclear distortion. It is also found that when a $0^+$ state that has a
different structure from a simple $\alpha$ cluster state is considered, the
$B({\rm IS0})$-$(\alpha,\alpha')$ correspondence becomes less valid. For a
quantitative discussion on the $\alpha$ clustering in $0^+$ excited states of
nuclei, a microscopic description of both the structure and reaction parts will
be necessary.

strongly depends on temperature, which makes them efficient temperature sensor
with a sensitivity down to a few mK/$\sqrt{\rm Hz}$. However, the high thermal
conductivity of the host diamond may strongly damp any temperature variations,
leading to invasive measurements when probing local temperature distributions.
In view of determining possible and optimal configurations for diamond-based
wide-field thermal imaging, we here investigate, both experimentally and
numerically, the effect of the presence of diamond on microscale temperature
distributions. Three geometrical configurations are studied: a bulk diamond
substrate, a thin diamond layer bonded on quartz and diamond nanoparticles
dispersed on quartz. We show that the use of bulk diamond substrates for
thermal imaging is highly invasive, in the sense that it prevents any
substantial temperature increase. Conversely, thin diamond layers partly solve
this issue and could provide a possible alternative for microscale thermal
imaging. Dispersions of diamond nanoparticles throughout the sample appear as
the most relevant approach as they do not affect the temperature distribution,
although NV centers in nanodiamonds yield lower temperature sensitivities
compared to bulk diamond.

for commonly occurring bug patterns, thus giving those developers opportunities
to fix the warnings (potential bugs) before they release the software.
Typically, SA tools scan for general bug patterns that are common to any
software project (such as null pointer dereference), and not for project
specific patterns. However, past research has pointed to this lack of
customizability as a severe limiting issue in SA. Accordingly, in this paper,
we propose an approach called Ammonia, which is based on statically analyzing
changes across the development history of a project, as a means to identify
project-specific bug patterns. Furthermore, the bug patterns identified by our
tool do not relate to just one developer or one specific commit, they reflect
the project as a whole and compliment the warnings from other SA tools that
identify general bug patterns. Herein, we report on the application of our
implemented tool and approach to four Java projects: Ant, Camel, POI, and
Wicket. The results obtained show that our tool could detect 19 project
specific bug patterns across those four projects. Next, through manual

submitted pull requests based on those bug patterns. As a result, five of the

dictionaries when sensing the images instead of random dictionaries. The first
uses a low number of compressive measurements to compute the block boundary

2D-DCT transform coefficients to measure from each block. The second uses a low

reconstruction in real time, averaging 8 ms and 26 ms for 256x256 and 512x512

requiring GPU acceleration. Furthermore, we show that an iterative compressive
sensing reconstruction algorithm (IDA), inspired by the denoising-based

$K_{k}$-isolating if $G - N_{G}[S]$ does not contain $K_{k}$ as a subgraph. The
$K_{k}$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\iota_{k}(G)$, is the minimum
cardinality of a $K_{k}$-isolating set of $G$. Analogously, $S$ is said to be
independent $K_{k}$-isolating if $S$ is a $K_{k}$-isolating set of $G$ and
$G[S]$ has no edge. The independent $K_{k}$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by
$\iota'_{k}(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of an independent $K_{k}$-isolating
set of $G$. Clearly, when $k = 1$, we have $\gamma(G) = \iota_{1}(G)$ and $i(G)
= \iota'_{1}(G)$ where $\gamma(G)$ and $i(G)$ are the domination and
independent domination numbers. For classic results between $\gamma(G)$ and
$i(G)$, in 1978, Allan and Laskar proved that $\gamma(G) = i(G)$ for all $K_{1,

Bollob$\acute{a}$s and Cockayne in 1979. In 2013, Rad and Volkmann proved that
the ratio $i(G)/\gamma(G)$ is at most $\Delta(G)/2$ when $\Delta(G) \in \{3, 4,

$i(G)/\gamma(G) \leq \Delta(G) - 2\sqrt{\Delta(G)} + 2$. In this paper, for a
smallest $K_{k}$-isolating set $S$, we prove that $\iota'_k(G)\le
-\frac{\iota_k^2(G)}{\ell} +i_k(G)(\Delta +2)-\ell \Delta$ where $\ell$ is the
number of some specific vertices of $S$ such that the union of their closed
neighborhoods in $S$ is $S$. We prove that this bound is sharp. A special case
of our main theorem implies $\iota'_{k}(G)/\iota_{k}(G) \leq \Delta(G) -
2\sqrt{\Delta(G)} + 2$. Further, we find an inequality between $\iota'_{k}(G)$
and $\iota_{k}(G)$ when $G$ is $K_{1, r}$-free graph. This also generalizes the

the boundaries of the organism is not static by dynamically regulated by the

neural homeodynamic responses to environmental changes using both biological

neural networks and spiking neural networks with spike-timing dependent
plasticity (STDP) learn an action as they avoid stimulation from outside. In
this paper, as a result of our experiments using embodied cultured neurons, we
find that there is also a second property allowing the network to avoid
stimulation: if the agent cannot learn an action to avoid the external stimuli,
it tends to decrease the stimulus-evoked spikes, as if to ignore the
uncontrollable-input. We also show such a behavior is reproduced by spiking
neural networks with asymmetric STDP. We consider that these properties are
regarded as autonomous regulation of self and non-self for the network, in
which a controllable-neuron is regarded as self, and an uncontrollable-neuron
is regarded as non-self. Finally, we introduce neural autopoiesis by proposing
the principle of stimulus avoidance.

be before the function $f$ cannot have enough structure for quantum algorithms
to exploit?
  In this work, we make several steps towards understanding the group actions
$G$ which are ""quantum intolerant"" in this way. We show that sufficiently
transitive group actions do not allow a quantum speedup, and that a
""well-shuffling"" property of group actions -- which happens to be preserved by
several natural transformations -- implies a lack of super-polynomial speedups
for functions symmetric under the group action. Our techniques are motivated by
a recent paper by Chailloux (2018), which deals with the case where $G=S_n$.
  Our main application is for graph symmetries: we show that any Boolean
function $f$ defined on the adjacency matrix of a graph (and symmetric under
relabeling the vertices of the graph) has a power $6$ relationship between its
randomized and quantum query complexities, even if $f$ is a partial function.
In particular, this means no graph property testing problems can have
super-polynomial quantum speedups, settling an open problem of Ambainis,

To simplify these relaxations we exploit the symmetry arising from permuting

explore the potential of ensembles of publicly available, `vanilla-style' DM
segmenters Our ensembles were created from four off-the-shelf DMs: U-Net,
Deepmedic, V-Net, and Dense V-Networks. To prevent further overfitting and to
keep the overall model simple, we use basic non-trainable ensemble combiners:
majority vote, average, product and min/max. Our results with two publicly

potential resource to access the absolute neutrino mass scale. Moreover, if
observed, it will signal that neutrinos are their own anti-particles (Majorana
particles). Presently, this physics case is one of the most important research
""beyond Standard Model"" and might guide the way towards a Grand Unified Theory
of fundamental interactions.
  Since the 0v\b{eta}\b{eta} decay process involves nuclei, its analysis
necessarily implies nuclear structure issues. In the NURE project, supported by
a Starting Grant of the European Research Council (ERC), nuclear reactions of
double charge-exchange (DCE) are used as a tool to extract information on the
0v\b{eta}\b{eta} Nuclear Matrix Elements. In DCE reactions and \b{eta}\b{eta}
decay indeed the initial and final nuclear states are the same and the
transition operators have similar structure. Thus the measurement of the DCE
absolute cross-sections can give crucial information on \b{eta}\b{eta} matrix
elements. In a wider view, the NUMEN international collaboration plans a major
upgrade of the INFN-LNS facilities in the next years in order to increase the
experimental production of nuclei of at least two orders of magnitude, thus
making feasible a systematic study of all the cases of interest as candidates
for 0v\b{eta}\b{eta}.

equivalence. It is based on encoding the language semantics as logically
constrained term rewriting systems (LCTRSs) and the two programs as terms. The
main feature of our method is its flexibility. We illustrate this flexibility
in two applications, which are novel. For the first application, we show how to
encode low-level details such as stack size in the language semantics and how
to prove equivalence between two programs operating at different levels of
abstraction. For our running example, we show how our method can prove
equivalence between a recursive function operating with an unbounded stack and
its tail-recursive optimized version operating with a bounded stack. This type
of equivalence checking can be used to ensure that new, undesirable behavior is
not introduced by a more concrete level of abstraction. For the second
application, we show how to formalize read-sets and write-sets of symbolic
expressions and statements by extending the operational semantics in a
conservative way. This enables the relational verification of program schemas,
which we exploit to prove correctness of compiler optimizations, some of which
cannot be proven by existing tools. Our method requires an extension of
standard LCTRSs with axiomatized symbols. We also present a prototype
implementation that proves the feasibility of both applications that we

physics. Among them, a driven lattice gas known as the asymmetric simple
exclusion process (ASEP) is the most prominent example for which many
intriguing exact results have been obtained. After summarizing key findings,
including the mapping of the ASEP to quantum spin chains, we discuss the
recently introduced Brownian asymmetric simple exclusion process (BASEP) as a
related class of driven diffusive system with continuous space dynamics. In the
BASEP, driven Brownian motion of hardcore-interacting particles through
one-dimensional periodic potentials is considered. We study whether
current-density relations of the BASEP can be considered as generic for
arbitrary periodic potentials and whether repulsive particle interactions other
than hardcore lead to similar results. Our findings suggest that shapes of
current-density relations are generic for single-well periodic potentials and
can always be attributed to the interplay of a barrier reduction, blocking and
exchange symmetry effect. This implies that in general up to five different
phases of nonequilibrium steady states are possible for such potentials. The
phases can occur in systems coupled to particle reservoirs, where the bulk
density is the order parameter. For multiple-well periodic potentials, more
complex current-density relations are possible and more phases can appear.
Taking a repulsive Yukawa potential as an example, we show that the effects of
barrier reduction and blocking on the current are also present. The exchange
symmetry effect requires hardcore interactions and we demonstrate that it can
still be identified when hardcore interactions are combined with weak Yukawa
interactions.

redundant. Information theory has been recognized as a useful concept for this
task, as the prediction power stems from the correlation, i.e., the mutual
information, between features and labels. Many algorithms for feature selection
in the literature have adopted the Shannon-entropy-based mutual information. In
this paper, we explore the possibility of using R\'enyi min-entropy instead. In
particular, we propose an algorithm based on a notion of conditional R\'enyi
min-entropy that has been recently adopted in the field of security and
privacy, and which is strictly related to the Bayes error. We prove that in
general the two approaches are incomparable, in the sense that we show that we
can construct datasets on which the R\'enyi-based algorithm performs better
than the corresponding Shannon-based one, and datasets on which the situation
is reversed. In practice, however, when considering datasets of real data, it
seems that the R\'enyi-based algorithm tends to outperform the other one. We
have effectuate several experiments on the BASEHOCK, SEMEION, and GISETTE

among them are the KdV, BBM, Camassa-Holm and Whitham equations. Finally, we
show how to take vorticity effects into account in shallow water modeling, with
specific focus on the behavior of the turbulent terms. As examples of
challenges that go beyond the present scope of mathematical justification, we

communication systems as pair-sets of interconnected nodes and their linkages

regional economy consisting of daily road transportation flows for labor
purposes, the so-called commuting phenomenon. In particular, the commuting
system in Greece including 39 non-insular prefectures is modeled into a complex
network and it is studied using measures and methods of complex network
analysis and empirical techniques. The study aims to detect the structural
characteristics of the Greek interregional commuting network (GCN) and to
interpret how this network is related to the regional development. The analysis
highlights the effect of the spatial constraints in the structure of the GCN,
it provides insights about the major road transport projects constructed the
last decade, and it outlines a populationcontrolled (gravity) pattern of
commuting, illustrating that high-populated regions attract larger volumes of
the commuting activity, which consequently affects their productivity. Overall,
this paper highlights the effectiveness of complex network analysis in the
modeling of systems of regional economy, such as the systems of spatial
interaction and the transportation networks, and it promotes the use of the

airtransport infrastructures. Nowadays, the importance of air-transport

work, we essentially explore some of the challenges of designing secure
distributed systems by using Intel SGX as cornerstone. We do so by designing
and experimentally evaluating several elementary systems ranging from
communication and processing middleware to a peer-to-peer privacy-preserving

scenarios, namely content-based routing, batching and stream processing
frameworks. We implement prototypes and use them to analyse the manifested
memory usage issues intrinsic to SGX. Next, we aim at protecting very sensitive
data: cryptographic keys. By leveraging TEEs, we design protocols for group
data sharing that have lower computational complexity than legacy methods. As a
bonus, our proposals allow large savings on metadata volume and processing time
of cryptographic operations, all with equivalent security guarantees. Finally,
we propose privacy-preserving systems against established services like
web-search engines. Our evaluation shows that we propose the most robust system

mechanisms that take advantage of TEEs for distributed system architectures. We

increased flexibility, reconfigurability and programmability attributed to
future technologies (i.e. 5G and beyond), and towards the complete network
virtualization and softwarization, a new set of requirements or parameters can
be identified affecting the latency in a virtualized network. In this paper, we
identify different latency requirements for a virtualized network. These
requirements include the Virtual Network Function (VNF) deployment time,
establishment or connection time and application instantiation time. We further
test how some factors such as VNFs resource usage, the applications running
within the VNF and the shared status of the VNF, coordinately affect the
identified latency requirement for a virtualized network. Experimentally, for
performance analysis, we deploy a softwarized network based on the ETSI NFV

overall ultra reliable low latency and how different the factors can affect
these new requirements, especially in the core network. Furthermore, the result

from the canonical Z_0 = 26 value through the electromagnetic shower region to
the surface is not necessarily time-independent but can vary between fixed

channels with memory using reinforcement learning (RL). In RL, one seeks to
maximize cumulative rewards collected in a sequential decision-making
environment. This is done by collecting samples of the underlying environment
and using them to learn the optimal decision rule. The main advantage of this
approach is its computational efficiency, even in high dimensional problems.
Hence, RL can be used to estimate numerically the feedback capacity of unifilar
finite state channels (FSCs) with large alphabet size. The outcome of the RL
algorithm sheds light on the properties of the optimal decision rule, which in
our case, is the optimal input distribution of the channel. These insights can
be converted into analytic, single-letter capacity expressions by solving
corresponding lower and upper bounds. We demonstrate the efficiency of this
method by analytically solving the feedback capacity of the well-known Ising
channel with a ternary alphabet. We also provide a simple coding scheme that
achieves the feedback capacity.

to determine the correct answers to questions based on a given passage. MRC
systems must not only answer question when necessary but also distinguish when
no answer is available according to the given passage and then tactfully
abstain from answering. When unanswerable questions are involved in the MRC
task, an essential verification module called verifier is especially required
in addition to the encoder, though the latest practice on MRC modeling still
most benefits from adopting well pre-trained language models as the encoder
block by only focusing on the ""reading"". This paper devotes itself to exploring
better verifier design for the MRC task with unanswerable questions. Inspired
by how humans solve reading comprehension questions, we proposed a
retrospective reader (Retro-Reader) that integrates two stages of reading and
verification strategies: 1) sketchy reading that briefly investigates the
overall interactions of passage and question, and yield an initial judgment; 2)
intensive reading that verifies the answer and gives the final prediction. The

including image classification, object detection, sequence modelling, and many
more. It is generally assumed that such neural networks are translation
invariant, meaning that they can detect a given feature independent of its
location in the input image. While this is true for simple cases, where
networks are composed of a restricted number of layer classes and where images
are fairly simple, complex images with common state-of-the-art networks do not
usually enjoy this property as one might hope. This paper shows that most of
the existing convolutional architectures define, at initialisation, a specific
feature importance landscape that conditions their capacity to attend to
different locations of the images later during training or even at test time.
We demonstrate how this phenomenon occurs under specific conditions and how it
can be adjusted under some assumptions. We derive the P-objective, or PILCRO

more robust to noise at test time, when compared to their original counterparts

of 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission

urban areas, several significant changes are underway, driven by both new
mobility needs and environmental concerns. The most mature one, which still is
struggling to affirm itself is the process of the adoption of Electric Vehicles
(EVs), thus switching from fuel-based to battery-powered propulsion
technologies. Many social and economic barriers have proved to play a crucial
role in this process, ranging from level of education, environmental awareness,
age and census. This work aims at contributing to the study of this adoption
process through a data-based lens, using real mobility patterns to setup a
social-network analysis to model the spread of consensus among neighbouring
people that can enable the switch to EVs. In particular, we build the network
topology using proximity measures that emerge from the analysis of real trips,
and the initial disposition of the single agents towards the EV technology is
inferred from their real mobility patterns. Based on this network, a cascade
adoption model is simulated to investigate the dynamics of the adoption
process, and an incentive scheme is designed to show how different policies can
contribute to the opinion diffusion over time on the network.

proposed, which organizes networks in layers that conceptually provide the same
mechanisms through a common interface. Instead of defined by function, these
layers are distinguished by scope.
  We report our research on a model for computer networks. Following a rigorous
regime alternating design with the evaluation of its implications in an
implementation, we converged on a recursive architecture, named Ouroboros. One
of our main main objectives was to disentangle the fundamental mechanisms that
are found in computer networks as much as possible. Its distinguishing feature
is the separation of unicast and broadcast as different mechanisms, giving rise
to two different types of layers. These unicast and broadcast layers can easily
be spotted in today's networks.

organization and interfaces, and introduces the free software prototype. We
hope the insights it provides can guide future network design and

in presence of electronic correlations has been less investigated so far. In
the sodium cobaltates NaxCoO2 considered here, unexpected magnetic properties
associated with correlations on the Co sites have been disclosed about 15 years
ago. The distinct Na orders of the stable phases of these cobaltates have been
shown to induce specific Co charge disproportionation with large size unit
cells in the CoO2 planes, linked with the diverse magnetic behaviors. This
provides an original playground in the studies of interplays between topology
and correlations in these layered materials. We present here transport
measurements on a series of single crystals and demonstrate that we do
synthetize pure phases with quite reproducible transport properties. We show
that above room T those display a similar behavior whatever the Na content. On
the contrary we provide evidence for a great diversity in Hall effect low
temperature dependences which underlines the specificities of the Fermi Surface
reconstructions induced by the Na order. We study in some detail the difference
between two metallic phases, one (x = 0.77) antiferromagnetic below TN = 22 K
and the second (x = 2/3) paramagnetic down to T = 0. Both show a sign change in
the Hall effect with decreasing T. We demonstrate that this can be attributed
to quite distinct physical effects. For the x = 0.77 phase the negative Hall
effect occurs in similar conditions to the anomalous Hall effect found in
various magnetic metals. In the x = 2/3 phase have to be assigned to
specificities of its Fermi surface. In both cases the anomalies detected in the

way to access these rare events is by means of an auxiliary dynamics obtained
from the original one through the so-called ``generalised Doob

often impractical, as to define it requires the often impossible task of
diagonalising a (tilted) dynamical generator. While approximate schemes have
been devised to overcome this issue they are difficult to automate as they tend
to require knowledge of the systems under study. Here we address this problem
from the perspective of deep learning. We devise an iterative semi-supervised
learning scheme which converges to the optimal or Doob dynamics with the clear
advantage of requiring no prior knowledge of the system. We test our method in
a paradigmatic statistical mechanics model with non-trivial dynamical
fluctuations, the fully packed classical dimer model on the square lattice,
showing that it compares favourably with more traditional approaches. We

(\dmr $0.91 \pm 0.10$ mag). SNe 2010ae and 2008ha have been classified as type
Iax supernovae, and together the three either make up a distinct physical class
of their own or are at the extreme low luminosity end of this diverse supernova
population. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a low kinetic energy

incorporates the light-matter coupling via both Peierls phases and a
polarization density. We compare this dipolar gauge Hamiltonian and the
straightforward Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional solid, to
describe sub-cycle light-driven electronic motion in the semiclassical limit,
and a coupling of the solid to a quantized cavity mode which renormalizes the
band-structure into electron-polariton bands. Both descriptions yield the same
result when many bands are taken into account, but the dipolar Hamiltonian is
more accurate when the model is restricted to few electronic bands, while the
Coulomb Hamiltonian requires fewer electromagnetic modes.

equality of the MOND acceleration constant, $a_0$ -- as deduced from local,

c^2\Lambda^{1/2}\sim c^2/\ell_U$, where $H_0$ is the present value of the
Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant, $\Lambda$ is the `cosmological constant', and
$\ell_U$ is a cosmological characteristic length; e.g., the Hubble distance, or
the de Sitter radius associated with $\Lambda$. In itself, this near equality
has some important phenomenological consequences, such as the impossibility of
black holes, and of cosmological strong lensing, in the MOND regime. More
importantly perhaps, this `coincidence' may be a pointer to the `FUNDAMOND' --
the more basic theory underlying MOND phenomenology. The manners in which such
a relation emerges in existing, underlying scheme of MOND are also reviewed,
interlaced with examples of similar relations in other physical systems,
between apparently-fundamental velocity, length, and acceleration constants.
Such analogies may point the way to explanation of the MOND `coincidence'.

and perform unsatisfactorily on the blurry images with noise. Unfortunately,
noise is quite common in real scenes. A straightforward solution is to denoise
images before deblurring them. However, even state-of-the-art denoisers cannot
guarantee to remove noise entirely. Slight residual noise in the denoised
images could cause significant artifacts in the deblurring stage. To tackle
this problem, we propose a cascaded framework consisting of a denoiser
subnetwork and a deblurring subnetwork. In contrast to previous methods, we
train the two subnetworks jointly. Joint learning reduces the effect of the
residual noise after denoising on deblurring, hence improves the robustness of
deblurring to heavy noise. Moreover, our method is also helpful for blur kernel
estimation. Experiments on the CelebA dataset and the GOPRO dataset show that
our method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.

we present the concept of high-frequency energy harvesting where the dissipated
heat in a sample excites resonant magnons in a 5-nm thick ferromagnetic metal
layer. The sample is excited by femtosecond laser pulses with a repetition rate
of 10 GHz which results in temperature modulation at the same frequency with
amplitude ~0.1 K. The alternating temperature excites magnons in the
ferromagnetic nanolayer which are detected by measuring the net magnetization
precession. When the magnon frequency is brought onto resonance with the
optical excitation, a 12-fold increase of the amplitude of precession indicates
efficient resonant heat transfer from the lattice to coherent magnons. The
demonstrated principle may be used for energy harvesting in various nanodevices
operating at GHz and sub-THz frequency ranges.

available, none of them is a panacea that can satisfy all diverse expectations

address this challenge in this paper by discussing the promises of Interactive
Machine Learning for improved transparency of black-box systems using the
example of contrastive explanations -- a state-of-the-art approach to
Interpretable Machine Learning.
  Specifically, we show how to personalise counterfactual explanations by
interactively adjusting their conditional statements and extract additional
explanations by asking follow-up ""What if?"" questions. Our experience in
building, deploying and presenting this type of system allowed us to list
desired properties as well as potential limitations, which can be used to guide
the development of interactive explainers. While customising the medium of
interaction, i.e., the user interface comprising of various communication
channels, may give an impression of personalisation, we argue that adjusting
the explanation itself and its content is more important. To this end,
properties such as breadth, scope, context, purpose and target of the
explanation have to be considered, in addition to explicitly informing the
explainee about its limitations and caveats...

description in terms of Poisson transitions between system occupations. We
proceed studying macroscopic fluctuations using the Martin-Siggia-Rose
formalism and large deviation theory. In the macroscopic limit ($N \to
\infty$), we derive the exact nonlinear (mean-field) rate equation describing
the deterministic dynamics of the most likely occupations. We identify the
scaling of the energetics and kinetics ensuring thermodynamic consistency
(including the detailed fluctuation theorem) across microscopic, mesoscopic and
macroscopic scales. The conceptually different nature of the Shannon entropy

inertial forces. They are based on delocalised spatial superpositions and the
combination with internal transitions directly links them to atomic clocks.
Since classical tests of the gravitational redshift are based on a comparison
of two clocks localised at different positions under gravity, it is promising
to explore whether the aforementioned interferometers constitute a competitive
alternative for tests of general relativity. Here we present a specific
geometry which together with state transitions leads to a scheme that is
concurrently sensitive to both violations of the universality of free fall and
gravitational redshift, two premises of general relativity. The proposed
interferometer does not rely on a superposition of internal states, but merely
on transitions between them, and therefore generalises the concept of physical
atomic clocks and quantum-clock interferometry. An experimental realisation
seems feasible with already demonstrated techniques in state-of-the-art
facilities.

density-based clustering algorithm, optimized for high occupancy scenarios,
where the number of clusters is much larger than the average number of hits in
a cluster. The algorithm uses a grid spatial index for fast querying of

phase-aware recurrent two stage network (rTSN). The rTSN is an extension of our
previously proposed two stage network (TSN) framework. This TSN framework was
equipped with a boosting strategy (BS) that initially estimates the multiple
base predictions (MBPs) from a prior neural network (pri-NN) and then the MBPs
are aggregated by a posterior neural network (post-NN) to obtain the final
prediction. The TSN outperformed various state-of-the-art methods; however, it
adopted the simple deep neural network as pri-NN. We have found that the pri-NN
affects the performance (in perceptual quality), more than post-NN; therefore
we adopted the long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM-RNN) as
pri-NN to boost the context information usage within speech signals. Further,
the TSN framework did not consider the phase reconstruction, though phase
information affected the perceptual quality. Therefore, we proposed to adopt
the phase reconstruction method based on the Griffin-Lim algorithm. Finally, we
evaluated rTSN with baselines such as TSN in perceptual quality related metrics

protostar DG Tau B in Taurus. The disk is very large, both in dust continuum
(R$_{\rm eff,95\%}$=174 au) and CO (R$_{CO}$=700 au). It shows Keplerian
rotation around a 1.1$\pm$0.2 M$_{\odot}$ central star and two dust emission
bumps at $r$ = 62 and 135 au. These results confirm that large structured disks
can form at an early stage where residual infall is still ongoing. The
redshifted CO outflow at high velocity shows a striking hollow cone morphology
out to 3000 au with a shear-like velocity structure within the cone walls.
These walls coincide with the scattered light cavity, and they appear to be
rooted within $<$ 60 au in the disk. We confirm their global average rotation
in the same sense as the disk, with a specific angular momentum $\simeq$ 65 au
\kms. The mass-flux rate of 1.7-2.9 $\times$ 10$^{-7}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is
35$\pm$10 times that in the atomic jet. We also detect a wider and slower
outflow component surrounding this inner conical flow, which also rotates in
the same direction as the disk. Our ALMA observations therefore demonstrate
that the inner cone walls, and the associated scattered light cavity, do not
trace the interface with infalling material, which is shown to be confined to
much wider angles ($> 70^{\circ}$). The properties of the conical walls are
suggestive of the interaction between an episodic inner jet or wind with an
outer disk wind, or of a massive disk wind originating from 2-5 au. However,
further modeling is required to establish their origin. In either case, such
massive outflow may significantly affect the disk structure and evolution.

semimetallicity by means of different transport experiments. Semimetallicity
manifests itself in a finite minimum conductance upon sweeping the gate over a
large range in ionic liquid gated devices, which also offer spectroscopic
capabilities enabling the quantitative determination of the band overlap. The
semimetallic state is additionally revealed in Hall effect measurements by the
coexistence of electrons and holes, observed by either looking at the evolution
of the Hall slope with sweeping the gate voltage or with lowering temperature.
Finally, semimetallicity results in the low-temperature metallic conductivity
of interfaces of two materials that are themselves insulating. These results
demonstrate the possibility to implement a state of matter that had not yet
been realized in vdW interfaces, and represent a first step towards using these
interfaces to engineer topological or excitonic insulating states.

a hyperelliptic curve together with a pair of differentials and a line bundle.
The space of spectral data is naturally a fibre bundle over the space of
spectral curves. For homogeneous tori the space of spectral curves is a disc
and the bundle is trivial. For tori with a one-dimensional invariance group, we
enumerate the path connected components of the space of spectral curves and
show that they are either `helicoids' or annuli, and that they densely foliate
the parameter space. The bundle structure of the moduli space of spectral data
over the annuli components is nontrivial. In the two cases, the spectral data
require only elementary and elliptic functions respectively and we give
explicit formulae at every stage. Homogeneous tori and the Gauss maps of
Delaunay cylinders are used as illustrative examples.

two coupled tunable transmons with microwave light while monitoring its state
via joint dispersive readout. Performing high-power spectroscopy, we observe
and identify a variety of single- and multiphoton transitions. We also find
that at certain fluxes, the measured spectrum of the system deviates
significantly from the solution of the stationary Schr\""odinger equation with
no driving. We reproduce these unusual spectral features by solving numerically
the full master equation for a steady-state and attribute them to an
Autler-Townes-like effect in which a single tone is simultaneously dressing the

possible to find analytically the exact frequencies at which the satellite
spectral lines appear by solving self-consistent equations in the rotating

introduce the notion of combinatorial presheaf, by adapting the algebraic
framework of species to the study of substructures in combinatorics.
Afterwards, we consider functions that count the number of patterns of objects
and endow the linear span of these functions with a product and a coproduct. In
this way, any well behaved family of combinatorial objects that admits a notion
of substructure generates a Hopf algebra, and this association is functorial.
For example, the Hopf algebra on permutations studied by Vargas in 2014 and the
Hopf algebra on symmetric functions are particular cases of this construction.
A specific family of pattern Hopf algebras is of interest, the ones arising
from commutative combinatorial presheaves. This includes the presheaves on
graphs, posets and generalized permutahedra. Here, we show that all the pattern
Hopf algebras corresponding to commutative presheaves are free. We also study a
non-commutative presheaf on marked permutations, i.e. permutations with a
marked element. These objects have an inherent product called inflation, which
is an operation motivated by factorization theorems of permutations. In this
paper we find new factorization theorems on marked permutations, and use them
to show that this is another example of a pattern Hopf algebra that is free.

orbits as a consequence of planet planet scattering, Kozai or secular
migration. In this scenario, general relativity and secular perturbations have
comparable timescales and may interfere with each other with relevant effects
on the eccentricity and pericenter evolution of the two planets. We explore,
both analytically and via numerical integration, how the secular evolution is
changed by general relativity for a wide range of different initial conditions.
We find that when the faster secular frequency approaches the general
relativity precession rate, which tipically occurs when the outer planet moves
away from the inner one, it relaxes to it and a significant damping of the
proper eccentricity of the inner planet occurs. The proper eccentricity of the
outer planet is reduced as well due to the changes in the secular interaction
of the bodies. The lowering of the peak eccentricities of the two planets
during their secular evolution has important implications on their stability. A
significant number of two planet systems, otherwise chaotic because of the
mutual secular perturbations, are found stable when general relativity is
included.

establish that in the dissipative case the MI is exponentially damped both

propagates solely through entangled pairs of quasiparticles having a finite
lifetime; this quasiparticle picture is further corroborated by the
out-of-equilibrium analysis of two-point fermionic correlations. Remarkably, in
spite of the finite lifetime of the quasiparticles, a finite steady-state value
of the MI survives in asymptotic times which is an artifact of nonvanishing
two-point correlations. Further, the finite lifetime of quasiparticles renders
to a finite length scale in these steady-state correlations.

responsible for providing availability, consistency, and performance. For high
availability in the presence of failures, these datastores replicate data
across several nodes. This is accomplished with the help of a reliable
replication protocol that is responsible for maintaining the replicas
strongly-consistent even when faults occur. Strong consistency is preferred to
weaker consistency models that cannot guarantee an intuitive behavior for the
clients. Furthermore, to accommodate high demand at real-time latencies,
datastores must deliver high throughput and low latency.
  This work introduces Hermes, a broadcast-based reliable replication protocol
for in-memory datastores that provides both high throughput and low latency by
enabling local reads and fully-concurrent fast writes at all replicas. Hermes
couples logical timestamps with cache-coherence-inspired invalidations to
guarantee linearizability, avoid write serialization at a centralized ordering
point, resolve write conflicts locally at each replica (hence ensuring that
writes never abort) and provide fault-tolerance via replayable writes. Our
implementation of Hermes over an RDMA-enabled reliable datastore with five
replicas shows that Hermes consistently achieves higher throughput than
state-of-the-art RDMA-based reliable protocols (ZAB and CRAQ) across all write
ratios while also significantly reducing tail latency. At 5% writes, the tail
latency of Hermes is 3.6X lower than that of CRAQ and ZAB.

behaviors of the networked systems. Many systems, modeled by multiplex networks
with various types of interactions, display an entirely different dynamical
behavior compared to the corresponding aggregated network. In many cases,
unfortunately, only the aggregated topology and partial observations of the
network layers are available, raising an urgent demand for reconstructing
multiplex networks. We fill this gap by developing a mathematical and
computational tool based on the Expectation-Maximization framework to
reconstruct multiplex layer structures. The reconstruction accuracy depends on
the various factors, such as partial observation and network characteristics,
limiting our ability to predict and allocate observations. Surprisingly, by
using a mean-field approximation, we discovered that a discrimination indicator
that integrates all these factors universally determines the accuracy of
reconstruction. This discovery enables us to design the optimal strategies to
allocate the fixed budget for deriving the partial observations, promoting the
optimal reconstruction of multiplex networks. To further evaluate the
performance of our method, we predict beside structure also dynamical behaviors
on the multiplex networks, including percolation, random walk, and spreading
processes. Finally, applying our method on empirical multiplex networks drawn
from biological, transportation, and social domains, corroborate the
theoretical analysis.

occurs for most frequently in the nature. For~$|J|$ comparable to~$|g_0|^{-1}$

does not depend on a large amount of labeled driving data. This method
comprehensively considers both high-level maneuver selection and low-level
motion control in both lateral and longitudinal directions. We firstly
decompose the driving tasks into three maneuvers, including driving in lane,
right lane change and left lane change, and learn the sub-policy for each
maneuver. Then, a master policy is learned to choose the maneuver policy to be
executed in the current state. All policies including master policy and
maneuver policies are represented by fully-connected neural networks and
trained by using asynchronous parallel reinforcement learners (APRL), which
builds a mapping from the sensory outputs to driving decisions. Different state
spaces and reward functions are designed for each maneuver. We apply this

Study of dynamics of local correlations and entanglement entropy indicates that

delocalized in the presence of the synthetic flux. This residual ergodicity is
enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field with dynamical observables

the evolutionary stage of the donor at the moment of the onset of the

interstellar medium and study UV photolysis as a potential process in the
variations of the deuterium fractionation in the ISM. Methods. The UV
photo-induced fragmentation of various isotopologues of D-enriched, protonated
anthracene and phenanthrene ions was recorded in a FTICR mass spectrometer.
IRMPD spectroscopy using FELIX provided the IR spectra that were compared to
DFT vibrational spectra; reaction barriers and rates were also calculated and
related to the product abundances. Results. The mass spectra for both UV and
IRMPD photolysis show the loss of H from [D-C$_{14}$H$_{10}$]$^+$, whereas
[H-C$_{14}$D$_{10}$]$^+$ shows a strong preference for D loss. Calculations
reveal facile 1,2-H and -D shift reactions, with barriers lower than the energy
supplied by the photo-excitation process. Together with confirmation of the
ground-state structures via the IR spectra, we determined that the photolytic
processes in the 2 PAHs are largely governed by scrambling where the H and the
D atoms relocate between different peripheral C atoms. The $\sim$0.1 eV
difference in zero-point energy between C-H and C-D bonds ultimately leads to
faster H scrambling than D scrambling, and increased H atom loss compared to D.
Conclusion. Scrambling is common in PAH cations under UV radiation. Upon
photoexcitation of deuterium-enriched PAHs, the scrambling results in a higher
probability for the aliphatic D atom to migrate to an aromatic site, protecting
it from elimination. This could lead to increased deuteration as a PAH moves
towards more exposed interstellar environments. Also, large, compact PAHs with
an aliphatic C-HD group on solo sites might be responsible for the majority of
aliphatic C-D stretching bands seen in astronomical spectra.

other bodies with similarly low perihelia: near-Earth asteroids, SOHO comets,
as well as meter-sized and millimeter-sized meteoroids. We determine no known
near-Earth asteroids have past (last 10^4 years) histories residing
significantly inside the Granvik et al. (2016) limit, indirectly supporting the
disruption hypothesis. The exception is asteroid (467372) 2004 LG which spent
2500 years within this limit, and thus presents a challenge to that theory.
Phaethon has a perihelion distance hovering just above the limit and may be
undergoing slow disruption, which may be the source of its dust complex. We
find that the rate at which ungrouped SOHO comets are observed is consistent
with expected rates for the injection of small (25 m) class asteroids into the
near-Sun region and suggest that this fraction of the SOHO-observed comet
population may in fact be asteroidal in origin. We also find that there is an
absence of meter-sized bodies with near-Sun perihelia but an excess of
millimeter-sized meteoroids. This implies that if near-Sun asteroids disrupt,
they do not simply fragment into meter-sized chunks but disintegrate ultimately
into millimeter-sized particles. We propose that the disruption of near-Sun
asteroids as well as the anomalous brightening and destruction processes that
affect SOHO comets occur through meteoroid erosion, that is, the removal of
material through impacts by high-speed near-Sun meteoroids.

arising in different fields of geosciences. The base of a suitable
regularization is the prior expressed by the regularizer, which can be
non-adaptive or adaptive (data-driven). In this paper, we propose general
black-box regularization algorithms for solving nonlinear inverse problems such
as full-waveform inversion (FWI), which admit empirical priors that are
determined adaptively by sophisticated denoising algorithms. The nonlinear
inverse problem is solved by a proximal Newton method, which generalizes the
traditional Newton step in such a way to involve the gradients/subgradients of
a (possibly non-differentiable) regularization function through operator
splitting and proximal mappings. Furthermore, it requires to account for the
Hessian matrix in the regularized least-squares optimization problem. We
propose two different splitting algorithms for this task. In the first, we
compute the Newton search direction with an iterative method based upon the
first-order generalized iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA), and
hence Newton-ISTA (NISTA). The iterations require only Hessian-vector products
to compute the gradient step of the quadratic approximation of the nonlinear
objective function. The second relies on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), and hence Newton-ADMM (NADMM), where the least-square
optimization subproblem and the regularization subproblem in the composite are
decoupled through auxiliary variable and solved in an alternating mode. We
compare NISTA and NADMM numerically by solving full-waveform inversion with
BM3D regularizations. The tests show promising results obtained by both
algorithms. However, NADMM shows a faster convergence rate than Newton-ISTA
when using L-BFGS to solve the Newton system.

asked the question of characterization, in terms of infinite reduced words, of
the minimal elements of the limit weak order for other affine types. In this
paper, we answer this question by characterizing the minimal infinite reduced
words for other irreducible affine Weyl groups by one of their reduced
expressions.

have proposed to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) aiming at exploiting
the information contained in other samples treated concurrently, what is
commonly referred to as the transductive setting in the literature. These GNNs
are trained all together with a backbone feature extractor. In this paper, we
propose a new method that relies on graphs only to interpolate feature vectors

Scintillation events in the liquid argon (LAr) are registered by 255
photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), and pulseshape discrimination (PSD) is used to
suppress electromagnetic background events. The excellent PSD performance of
LAr makes it a viable target for dark matter searches, and the LAr
scintillation pulseshape discussed here is the basis of PSD.
  The observed pulseshape is a combination of LAr scintillation physics with
detector effects. We present a model for the pulseshape of electromagnetic
background events in the energy region of interest for dark matter searches.
The model is composed of a) LAr scintillation physics, including the so-called
intermediate component, b) the time response of the TPB wavelength shifter,
including delayed TPB emission at $\mathcal O$(ms) time-scales, and c) PMT
response.
  TPB is the wavelength shifter of choice in most LAr detectors. We find that
approximately 10\% of the intensity of the wavelength-shifted light is in a
long-lived state of TPB. This causes light from an event to spill into
subsequent events to an extent not usually accounted for in the design and data
analysis of LAr-based detectors.

from non-neural sources such as physiology. Thus, it is essential to first
reduce thermal noise and then correctly identify and remove non-neural

However, existing tools that correct for these effects have been developed for
human brain and are not readily transposable to rat data. Therefore, the aim of
the present study was to establish a data processing pipeline that can robustly

that: I) MP-PCA denoising substantially improves the temporal signal-to-noise

classification; III) both artefact cleaning and global signal regression are
essential steps in minimizing the within-group variability in control animals
and identifying functional connectivity changes in a rat model of sporadic
Alzheimer's disease, as compared to controls.

Wave Approach (RCWA) for p-polarized monochromatic incident light. The RCWA is
a semi-analytical numerical method that is widely used to solve the
boundary-value problem of scattering by a grating. The approach requires the
expansion of all electromagnetic field phasors and the relative permittivity as
Fourier series in the spatial variable along the direction of the periodicity
of the grating. In the direction perpendicular to the grating periodicity, the
domain is discretized into thin slices and the actual relative permittivity is
replaced by an approximation. The approximate relative permittivity is chosen
so that the solution of the Maxwell equations in each slice can be computed
without further approximation. Thus, there is error due to the approximate
relative permittivity as well as the trucation of the Fourier series. We show
that the RCWA embodies a Galerkin scheme for a perturbed problem, and then we
use tools from the Finite Element Method to show that the method converges with
increasing number of retained Fourier modes and finer approximations of the
relative permittivity. Numerical examples illustrate our analysis, and suggest
further work.

is electrophoresis driven by an alternating current (AC) as it eliminates
electrode blocking and produces a steady motion. The known mechanisms of AC
electrophoresis require that either the particle or the surrounding medium are
asymmetric. This asymmetry is usually assured before the field is applied, as
in the case of Janus spheres. We report on a new mechanism of AC
electrophoresis, in which the symmetry is broken only when the field exceeds
some threshold. The new mechanism is rooted in the nature of electrophoretic
medium, which is an orientationally ordered nematic liquid crystal. Below the
threshold, the director field of molecular orientation around a spherical
particle is of a quadrupolar symmetry. Above the threshold, the director forms
a polar self confined perturbation around the inclusion that oscillates with
the frequency of the applied field and propels the sphere. The director
perturbations are topologically trivial and represent particle like solitary
waves, called ""director bullets"" or ""directrons"". The direction of
electrophoretic transport can be controlled by the frequency of the field. The
AC directron induced liquid crystal enabled electrophoresis can be used to
transport microscopic cargo when other modes of electrophoresis such as induced
charge electrophoresis are forbidden.

invariance resulting in a tilted (type-I) or over-tilted (type-II) energy
dispersion. The tilting energy spectrums can lead to exotic quantum
interference effects in a junction set up. Here, we theoretically investigate
the Josephson current in a Weyl superconductor-Weyl (semi)metal-Weyl
superconductor junction of a time-reversal (TR) broken type-I Weyl semimetal.
We demonstrate that the Cooper pairs of BCS-like pairing acquire a finite
momentum in case of inversion symmetric tilt. Consequently, the system exhibits
tilt induced anomalous current phase relations which are manifested by
supercurrent $0$-$\pi$ transition and Josephson $\phi$ junction. On the
contrary, these effects remain absent in case of inversion breaking tilt and
for FFLO-like pairing in the Weyl superconductor. We further chart out
qualitative differences between the two distinct types of pairings by studying
the critical current dependency on junction length. Our study opens a new
avenue to probe the unconventional superconducting pairings in TR-broken Weyl
semimetals. It is also quite interesting that the tilting in Weyl nodes
naturally leads to anomalous current phase relations in this model without any
magnetic manipulation!

properties of the viscosity of glass-forming systems, considering
super-Arrhenius diffusive processes. We establish the viscous activation energy
as a function of the temperature, measure the degree of fragility of the
system, and characterize the fragile-to-strong transition through the standard
Angell's plot. Our results show that the non-Arrhenius behavior observed in
fragile liquids can be understood through the non-Markovian dynamics that
characterize the diffusive processes of these systems. Moreover, the
fragile-to-strong transition corresponds to a change in the spatio-temporal
range of correlations during the glass transition process.

approach for studying the structural symmetry and functional invariance of
complex networks. Along this line, we systematically investigate the
finite-size scaling of structural and dynamical observables in geometric
renormalization flows of synthetic and real evolutionary networks. Our results
show that these observables can be well characterized by a certain scaling
function. Specifically, we show that the critical exponent implied by the
scaling function is independent of these observables but only depends on the
small-world properties of the network, namely, all networks located in the
small-world phase have a uniform scaling exponent, while those located in the
non-small-world phase and in their critical regions have another uniform
scaling. More importantly, we perform extensive experiments on real
evolutionary networks with small-world characteristics, and our results show
that these observables also have uniform scaling in their geometric
renormalization flows. Therefore, in a sense this exponent can be used as an
effective measure for classifying universal small-world and non-small-world
network models.

cold -- hot, soft -- hard). The core idea of our approach is to transform
existing, pre-trained word embeddings via semantic differentials to a new
""polar"" space with interpretable dimensions defined by such polar opposites.
Our framework also allows for selecting the most discriminative dimensions from
a set of polar dimensions provided by an oracle, i.e., an external source. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by deploying it to various
downstream tasks, in which our interpretable word embeddings achieve a
performance that is comparable to the original word embeddings. We also show
that the interpretable dimensions selected by our framework align with human
judgement. Together, these results demonstrate that interpretability can be
added to word embeddings without compromising performance. Our work is relevant

  study and improvement for virtual machine working set estimation",,,,,"cs.DC cs.OS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Intel Page Modification Logging (PML) is a novel hardware feature for
tracking virtual machine (VM) accessed memory pages. This task is essential in
today's data centers since it allows, among others, checkpointing, live
migration and working set size (WSS) estimation. Relying on the Xen hypervisor,
this paper studies PML from three angles: power consumption, efficiency, and
performance impact on user applications. Our findings are as follows. First,
PML does not incur any power consumption overhead. Second, PML reduces by up to
10.18% both VM live migration and checkpointing time. Third, PML slightly
reduces by up to 0.95% the performance degradation on applications incurred by
live migration and checkpointing. Fourth, PML however does not allow accurate
WSS estimation because read accesses are not tracked and hot pages cannot be
identified. A naive extension of PML for addressing these limitations could
lead to severe performance degradation (up to 34.8%) for the VM whose WSS is
computed.
  This paper presents Page Reference Logging (PRL), a smart extension of PML
for allowing both read and write accesses to be tracked. It does this without
impacting user VMs. The paper also presents a WSS estimation system which
leverages PRL and shows how this algorithm can be integrated into a data center
which implements memory overcommitment. We implement PRL and the WSS estimation
system under Gem5, a very popular hardware simulator. The evaluation results
validate the accuracy of PRL in the estimation of WSS. They also show that PRL
incurs no performance degradation for user VMs.

Therefore, rather than aiming at completeness, which leads to exhibiting a
tedious catalog of methods, this pedagogical review aims at a coherent
presentation of four important special cases: (1) prior shift, a situation in
which training samples were selected according to their labels without any
knowledge of their actual distribution in the target, (2) covariate shift which
deals with a situation where training examples were picked according to their
features but with some selection bias, (3) concept shift where the dependence
of the labels on the features defers between the source and the target, and
last but not least (4) subspace mapping which deals with a situation where
features in the target have been subjected to an unknown distortion with
respect to the source features. In each case we first build an intuition, next
we provide the appropriate mathematical framework and eventually we describe a
practical application.

Programming this hardware can be difficult, requiring that the kernels be

kernels from a dynamic application trace, facilitating further code
optimization.
  Dynamic trace collection is fast and compact. With optimization, it only
incurs a time-dilation of a factor on nine and file-size of one megabyte per
second, addressing a significant criticism of this approach. Kernel extraction
is accurate and performed in linear time within logarithmic memory, detecting a
wide range of kernels. This approach was validated across 16 libraries,
comprised of 10,507 kernels instances. To validate the accuracy of our detected
kernels, five test programs were written that spans traditional kernel
definitions and were certified to contain all the kernels that were expected.

paper, we develop a new screening method called Newton screening (NS) which is
a generalized Newton method with a built-in screening mechanism. We derive an
equivalent KKT system for the Lasso and utilize a generalized Newton method to
solve the KKT equations. Based on this KKT system, a built-in working set with
a relatively small size is first determined using the sum of primal and dual
variables generated from the previous iteration, then the primal variable is
updated by solving a least-squares problem on the working set and the dual
variable updated based on a closed-form expression. Moreover, we consider a
sequential version of Newton screening (SNS) with a warm-start strategy. We
show that NS possesses an optimal convergence property in the sense that it
achieves one-step local convergence. Under certain regularity conditions on the
feature matrix, we show that SNS hits a solution with the same signs as the
underlying true target and achieves a sharp estimation error bound with high
probability. Simulation studies and real data analysis support our theoretical
results and demonstrate that SNS is faster and more accurate than several

  presentation)",,"10.1145/3366423.3380270",,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ability to ask questions is important in both human and machine
intelligence. Learning to ask questions helps knowledge acquisition, improves
question-answering and machine reading comprehension tasks, and helps a chatbot
to keep the conversation flowing with a human. Existing question generation
models are ineffective at generating a large amount of high-quality
question-answer pairs from unstructured text, since given an answer and an
input passage, question generation is inherently a one-to-many mapping. In this
paper, we propose Answer-Clue-Style-aware Question Generation (ACS-QG), which
aims at automatically generating high-quality and diverse question-answer pairs
from unlabeled text corpus at scale by imitating the way a human asks
questions. Our system consists of: i) an information extractor, which samples
from the text multiple types of assistive information to guide question
generation; ii) neural question generators, which generate diverse and
controllable questions, leveraging the extracted assistive information; and
iii) a neural quality controller, which removes low-quality generated data
based on text entailment. We compare our question generation models with
existing approaches and resort to voluntary human evaluation to assess the
quality of the generated question-answer pairs. The evaluation results suggest
that our system dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art neural question
generation models in terms of the generation quality, while being scalable in
the meantime. With models trained on a relatively smaller amount of data, we
can generate 2.8 million quality-assured question-answer pairs from a million
sentences found in Wikipedia.

  Nanophotonic Structures with Graphene Heaters",,,"10.1021/acsami.0c02333",,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Progress in integrated nanophotonics has enabled large-scale programmable
photonic integrated circuits (PICs) for general-purpose electronic-photonic
systems on a chip. Relying on the weak, volatile thermo-optic or electro-optic
effects, such systems usually exhibit limited reconfigurability along with high
energy consumption and large footprints. These challenges can be addressed by
resorting to chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)
that provide substantial optical contrast in a self-holding fashion upon phase
transitions. However, current PCM-based integrated photonic applications are
limited to single devices or simple PICs due to the poor scalability of the
optical or electrical self-heating actuation approaches. Thermal-conduction
heating via external electrical heaters, instead, allows large-scale
integration and large-area switching, but fast and energy-efficient electrical
control is yet to show. Here, we model electrical switching of GST-clad
integrated nanophotonic structures with graphene heaters based on the
programmable GST-on-silicon platform. Thanks to the ultra-low heat capacity and
high in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene, the proposed structures exhibit
a high switching speed of ~80 MHz and high energy efficiency of 19.2 aJ/nm^3
(6.6 aJ/nm^3) for crystallization (amorphization) while achieving complete
phase transitions to ensure strong attenuation (~6.46 dB/micron) and optical
phase (~0.28 dB/micron at 1550 nm) modulation. Compared with indium tin oxide
and silicon p-i-n heaters, the structures with graphene heaters display two
orders of magnitude higher figure of merits for heating and overall
performance. Our work facilitates the analysis and understanding of the
thermal-conduction heating-enabled phase transitions on PICs and supports the
development of the future large-scale PCM-based electronic-photonic systems.

properties can be controlled by tuning core chemistry and peptide composition,
but the sequence-structure-function relations remain poorly characterized. In
this work, we employ coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations within an
active learning protocol employing deep representational learning and Bayesian
optimization to efficiently identify molecules capable of assembling pseudo-1D
nanoaggregates with good stacking of the electronically-active $\pi$-cores. We
consider the DXXX-OPV3-XXXD oligopeptide family, where D is an Asp residue and
OPV3 is an oligophenylene vinylene oligomer (1,4-distyrylbenzene), to identify
the top performing XXX tripeptides within all 20$^3$ = 8,000 possible
sequences. By direct simulation of only 2.3% of this space, we identify
molecules predicted to exhibit superior assembly relative to those reported in
prior work. Spectral clustering of the top candidates reveals new design rules
governing assembly. This work establishes new understanding of DXXX-OPV3-XXXD
assembly, identifies promising new candidates for experimental testing, and
presents a computational design platform that can be generically extended to
other peptide-based and peptide-like systems.

  text overlap with arXiv:2001.09648",,,,"nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neutrinoless double beta decay (0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta}) is considered the best
potential resource to determine the absolute neutrino mass scale. Moreover, if
observed, it will signal that the total lepton number is not conserved and
neutrinos are their own anti-particles. Presently, this physics case is one of
the most important research beyond Standard Model and might guide the way
towards a Grand Unified Theory of fundamental interactions. Since the
\b{eta}\b{eta} decay process involves nuclei, its analysis necessarily implies
nuclear structure issues. The 0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta} decay rate can be expressed
as a product of independent factors: the phase-space factors, the nuclear
matrix elements (NME) and a function of the masses of the neutrino species.
Thus the knowledge of the NME can give information on the neutrino mass scale,
if the 0{\nu}\b{eta}\b{eta} decay rate is measured. In the NURE project,
supported by a Starting Grant of the European Research Council, nuclear
reactions of double charge-exchange (DCE) will be used as a tool to extract
information on the \b{eta}\b{eta} NME. In DCE reactions and \b{eta}\b{eta}
decay, the initial and final nuclear states are the same and the transition
operators have similar structure. Thus the measurement of the DCE absolute
crosssections can give crucial information on \b{eta}\b{eta} matrix elements.

  Space",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present an approach to explain the decisions of black box models for image
classification. While using the black box to label images, our explanation
method exploits the latent feature space learned through an adversarial
autoencoder. The proposed method first generates exemplar images in the latent
feature space and learns a decision tree classifier. Then, it selects and
decodes exemplars respecting local decision rules. Finally, it visualizes them
in a manner that shows to the user how the exemplars can be modified to either
stay within their class, or to become counter-factuals by ""morphing"" into
another class. Since we focus on black box decision systems for image
classification, the explanation obtained from the exemplars also provides a
saliency map highlighting the areas of the image that contribute to its
classification, and areas of the image that push it into another class. We
present the results of an experimental evaluation on three datasets and two
black box models. Besides providing the most useful and interpretable
explanations, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing explainers
in terms of fidelity, relevance, coherence, and stability.

generate context-oriented image descriptions to assess incoming threats. The
key functionality of the system includes the detection and identification of
human and generating image descriptions from the real-time video streams
obtained from the cameras placed in strategic locations around the house. In
this paper, we focus on developing a robust model called ""SafeNet"" to generate
image descriptions. To interact with the system, we implemented a dialog
enabled interface for creating a personalized profile from face images or
videos of friends/families. To improve computational efficiency, we apply
change detection to filter out frames that do not have any activity and use
Faster-RCNN to detect the human presence and extract faces using Multitask
Cascaded Convolutional Networks (MTCNN). Subsequently, we apply LBP/FaceNet to
identify a person. SafeNet sends image descriptions to the users with an MMS
containing a person's name if any match found or as ""Unknown"", scene image,
facial description, and contextual information. SafeNet identifies
friends/families/caregiver versus intruders/unknown with an average F-score
0.97 and generates image descriptions from 10 classes with an average F-measure
0.97.

that $\A\in \RCA_n$ is representable up to $m$ if $\Cm\At\A$ has an $m$-square

represenation that is classical locally only on so called $m$-squares'. Roughly
if we zoom in by a movable window to an $m$ square representation, there will
become a point determinded and depending on $m$ where we mistake the $m$
square-representation for a genuine classical one. When we zoom out the
non-representable part gets more exposed. For $2<n<m<l\leq \omega$, an $l$
