localization length and electron-hole overlaps at low and elevated
temperatures, we find alloy-induced localization effects are crucial for the
accurate description of InGaN quantum wells across the range of In content
studied. However, our calculations show very little change in the localization
effects when moving from the blue to the green spectral regime; i.e. when the
internal quantum efficiency and wall plug efficiencies reduce sharply, for
instance, the in-plane carrier separation due to alloy induced localization
effects change weakly. We conclude that other effects, such as increased defect
densities, are more likely to be the main reason for the green gap problem.
This conclusion is further supported by our finding that the electron
localization length is large, when compared to that of the holes, and changes
little in the In composition range of interest for the green gap problem. Thus
electrons may become increasingly susceptible to an increased (point) defect
density in green emitters and as a consequence the nonradiative recombination
rate may increase.

under construction that are capable of observing thousands of Galactic and
extragalactic objects simultaneously.
  Aims. In this paper we present a probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment
algorithm that takes spectrograph targeting constraints into account and is
capable of dealing with multiple concurrent surveys. We present this algorithm
using the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) as an example.
  Methods. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to assign probabilities to
fibre-target pairs. The assignment of probabilities takes the fibre
positioner's capabilities and constraints into account. Additionally, these
probabilities include requirements from surveys and take the required exposure
time, number density variation, and angular clustering of targets across each
survey into account. The main advantage of a probabilistic approach is that it
allows for accurate and easy computation of the target selection function for
the different surveys, which involves determining the probability of observing
a target, given an input catalogue.
  Results. The probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment allows us to achieve
maximally uniform completeness within a single field of view. The proposed
algorithm maximises the fraction of successfully observed targets whilst
minimising the selection bias as a function of exposure time. In the case of
several concurrent surveys, the algorithm maximally satisfies the scientific
requirements of each survey and no specific survey is penalised or prioritised.
  Conclusions. The algorithm presented is a proposed solution for the 4MOST
project that allows for an unbiased targeting of many simultaneous surveys.
With some modifications, the algorithm may also be applied to other
multi-object spectroscopic surveys.

identity of Melnikov [17] linking the universal Cauchy kernel $K_0$ to Menger
curvature. Analogous identities hold for the real and the imaginary parts of
$K_0$ as well. Such connections have been immensely productive in the study of
singular integral operators and in geometric measure theory. \vskip0.1in In
this article, given any function $h: \mathbb C \rightarrow \mathbb R$, we
consider an inhomogeneous variant $K_h$ of $K_0$ which is inspired by complex
function theory. While an operator with integration kernel $K_h$ is easily seen
to be $L^2$-bounded for all $h$, the symmetrization identities for each of the
real and imaginary parts of $K_h$ show a striking lack of robustness in terms
of boundedness and positivity, two properties that were critical in [18] and in
subsequent works by many authors. Indeed here we show that for any continuous
$h$ on $\mathbb C$, the only member of $\{K_h\}_h$ whose symmetrization has the
right properties is $K_0$! This global instability complements our previous
investigation [12] of symmetrization identities in the restricted setting of a
curve, where a sub-family of $\{K_h\}_h$ displays very different behaviour than
its global counterparts considered here. Our methods of proof have some overlap

properties of one of the famous charmonium-like states, $Z_c(3900)$, in a cold
dense matter. We investigate the possible shifts in the mass and current-meson
coupling of the $Z_c(3900)$ state due to the dense medium at saturation
density, $ \rho^{sat} $, by means of the in-medium sum rules. We also estimate
the vector self-energy of this state at saturation nuclear matter density. We
discuss the behavior of the spectroscopic parameters of this state with respect
to the density up to a high density corresponding to the core of neutron stars,
$\rho\approx 5\rho^{sat}$. Both the mass and current-coupling of this state
show nonlinear behavior and decrease with respect to the density of the medium:
the mass reaches roughly $30\%$ of its vacuum value at $ \rho=5\rho^{sat} $,
while the current-coupling approaches zero at $ \rho\approx2.1\rho^{sat} $,
when the central values of the auxiliary and other input parameters are used.

three-time Leggett-Garg inequalities (LGIs) in a two interacting qubits system.
The two qubits are coupled either with two bosonic (thermal or photonic) baths
or fermionic (electronic) baths. We study both how the equilibrium and
nonequilibrium environments influence the LGIs. One way to characterize the
nonequilibrium condition is by the temperature difference (for the bosonic
bath) or the chemical potential difference (for the fermionic bath). We also
study the heat or particle current and the entropy production rate generated by
the nonequilibrium environments. Analytical forms of LGIs and the maximal value
of LGIs based on the quantum master equation beyond the secular approximation
are derived. The LGI functions and the corresponding maximal value have
separated contributions, the part describing the coherent evolution and the
part describing the coupling between the system and environments. The
environment-coupling part can be from the equilibrium environment or the
nonequilibrium environment. The nonequilibrium dynamics is quantified by the
Bloch-Redfield equation which is beyond the Lindblad form. We found that the
nonequilibriumness quantified by the temperature difference or the chemical
potential difference can lead to the LGIs violations or the increase of the
maximal value of LGIs, restoring the quantum nature from certain equilibrium
cases where LGIs are preserved. The corresponding nonequilibrium thermodynamic
cost is quantified by the nonzero entropy production rate. Our finding of the
nonequilibrium promoted LGIs violations suggests a new strategy for the design
of quantum information processing and quantum computational devices to maintain
the quantum nature and quantum correlations for long.

appears and some of the previous knowledge becomes obsolete. In order to
reflect this evolution of knowledge, KBs should be expanded with the new
knowledge and contracted from the obsolete one. This problem is well-studied
for propositional but much less for first-order KBs. In this work we
investigate knowledge expansion and contraction for KBs expressed in DL-Lite, a
family of description logics (DLs) that underlie the tractable fragment OWL 2
QL of the Web Ontology Language OWL 2. We start with a novel knowledge
evolution framework and natural postulates that evolution should respect, and
compare our postulates to the well-established AGM postulates. We then review
well-known model and formula-based approaches for expansion and contraction for
propositional theories and show how they can be adapted to the case of DL-Lite.
In particular, we show intrinsic limitations of model-based approaches: besides
the fact that some of them do not respect the postulates we have established,
they ignore the structural properties of KBs. This leads to undesired
properties of evolution results: evolution of DL-Lite KBs cannot be captured in
DL-Lite. Moreover, we show that well-known formula-based approaches are also
not appropriate for DL-Lite expansion and contraction: they either have a high
complexity of computation, or they produce logical theories that cannot be
expressed in DL-Lite. Thus, we propose a novel formula-based approach that
respects our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite. For
this approach we also propose
  polynomial time deterministic algorithms to compute evolution of DL-Lite KBs
when evolution affects only factual data.

a combinatorial latent structure. Exact inference in these models is generally
intractable and so practitioners typically apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods for posterior inference. The most widely used MCMC strategies
rely on an element wise Gibbs update of the feature allocation matrix. These
element wise updates can be inefficient as features are typically strongly
correlated. To overcome this problem we have developed a Gibbs sampler that can
update an entire row of the feature allocation matrix in a single move.
However, this sampler is impractical for models with a large number of features
as the computational complexity scales exponentially in the number of features.
We develop a Particle Gibbs sampler that targets the same distribution as the
row wise Gibbs updates, but has computational complexity that only grows
linearly in the number of features. We compare the performance of our proposed
methods to the standard Gibbs sampler using synthetic data from a range of
feature allocation models. Our results suggest that row wise updates using the
PG methodology can significantly improve the performance of samplers for
feature allocation models.

introduced during transmission by optimizing various parameters of the code.
Bennett, Dudek, and LaForge framed a variation of this problem in the language
of alternating paths in edge-colored complete bipartite graphs in 2016. Here,
we extend this problem to the random graph $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. We seek the
alternating connectivity, $\kappa_{r,\ell}(G)$, which is the maximum $t$ such
that there is an $r$-edge-coloring of $G$ such that any pair of vertices is
connected by $t$ internally disjoint and alternating (i.e. no consecutive edges
of the same color) paths of length $\ell$. We have three main results about how
this parameter behaves in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ that basically cover all ranges of
$p$: one for paths of length two, one for the dense case, and one for the
sparse case. For paths of length two, we found that $\kappa_{r,\ell}(G)$ is
essentially the codegree of a pair of vertices. For the dense case when $p$ is
constant, we were able to achieve the natural upper bounds of minimum degree
(minus some intersection) or the total number of disjoint paths between a pair
of vertices. For the sparse case, we were able to find colorings that achieved
the natural obstructions of minimum degree or (in a slightly less precise
result) the total number of paths of a certain length in a graph. We broke up
this sparse case into ranges of $p$ corresponding to when $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ has
diameter $k$ or $k+1$. We close with some remarks about a similar parameter and
a generalization to pseudorandom graphs.

challenge for online dating platforms is to determine suitable matches for
their users. A lot of dating services rely on self-reported user traits and
preferences for matching. At the same time, some services largely rely on user
images and thus initial visual preference. Especially for the latter approach,
previous research has attempted to capture users' visual preferences for
automatic match recommendation. These approaches are mostly based on the
assumption that physical attraction is the key factor for relationship
formation and personal preferences, interests, and attitude are largely
neglected. Deep learning approaches have shown that a variety of properties can
be predicted from human faces to some degree, including age, health and even
personality traits. Therefore, we investigate the feasibility of bridging
image-based matching and matching with personal interests, preferences, and
attitude. We approach the problem in a supervised manner by predicting
similarity scores between two users based on images of their faces only. The
ground-truth for the similarity matching scores is determined by a test that
aims to capture users' preferences, interests, and attitude that are relevant
for forming romantic relationships. The images are processed by a Siamese
Multi-Task deep learning architecture. We find a statistically significant
correlation between predicted and target similarity scores. Thus, our results
indicate that learning similarities in terms of interests, preferences, and
attitude from face images appears to be feasible to some degree.

for dual fuelling - sand is added both at the centre of the sandpile, and near
the edge. We observe that when the additional sand is added at the top of the
pedestal, MLEs are largely suppressed. While this suppression comes at a cost
by way of reduction in total energy confinement, that reduction is lower than
the reduction in MLE size. The trade-off between MLE suppression and reduction
in energy confinement depends not only on the amount of extra sand, but also on
its precise location relative to the top of the pedestal. We suggest that the
approach of constant dual fuelling may be equally applicable to plasmas, and
may suggest a strategy for ELM suppression in fusion plasmas. We observe that
when the proposed amount of extra sand is added in 'pellets', using frequencies
and amounts based on those proposed for ELM suppression for ITER, MLEs are
similarly suppressed, although MLEs are not significantly suppressed when the
pellet rate does not substantially exceed the MLE frequency. This suggests that
pellet injection at the top of the pedestal at small pellet size and high
frequency may represent a reasonable physical proxy for our proposed scheme.
However, our results suggest that it is not the synchronisation of pellets to
ELM frequencies which is the key factor for ELM suppression in this regime, but
rather the introduction of additional fuelling at the top of the pedestal.

has been attracting growing attention. The problem is challenging since it
requires not only generating chemically valid molecular structures but also
optimizing their chemical properties in the meantime. Inspired by the recent
progress in deep generative models, in this paper we propose a flow-based

advantages of both autoregressive and flow-based approaches and enjoys: (1)
high model flexibility for data density estimation; (2) efficient parallel
computation for training; (3) an iterative sampling process, which allows
leveraging chemical domain knowledge for valency checking. Experimental results
show that GraphAF is able to generate 68% chemically valid molecules even
without chemical knowledge rules and 100% valid molecules with chemical rules.
The training process of GraphAF is two times faster than the existing
state-of-the-art approach GCPN. After fine-tuning the model for goal-directed
property optimization with reinforcement learning, GraphAF achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both chemical property optimization and
constrained property optimization.

international competitions, yet to our knowledge nothing is formally known on
how to make them \textit{also} differential private (DP), up to the point that
random forests currently reign supreme in the DP stage. Our paper starts with
the proof that the privacy vs boosting picture for DT involves a notable and
general technical tradeoff: the sensitivity tends to increase with the boosting
rate of the loss, for any proper loss. DT induction algorithms being
fundamentally iterative, our finding implies non-trivial choices to select or
tune the loss to balance noise against utility to split nodes. To address this,
we craft a new parametererized proper loss, called the M$\alpha$-loss, which,
as we show, allows to finely tune the tradeoff in the complete spectrum of
sensitivity vs boosting guarantees. We then introduce \textit{objective
calibration} as a method to adaptively tune the tradeoff during DT induction to
limit the privacy budget spent while formally being able to keep
boosting-compliant convergence on limited-depth nodes with high probability.
Extensive experiments on 19 UCI domains reveal that objective calibration is
highly competitive, even in the DP-free setting. Our approach tends to very
significantly beat random forests, in particular on high DP regimes
($\varepsilon \leq 0.1$) and even with boosted ensembles containing ten times
less trees, which could be crucial to keep a key feature of DT models under
differential privacy: interpretability.

celestial object (scattering centre) increases with the latter's speed and
compactness (stronger deflection of the mass' trajectory becomes possible
without it hitting the surface of the object). The black holes (BHs) in a tight
binary (consisting of two black holes; we are not considering X-ray binaries),
themselves moving at relativistic speeds, represent optimal scattering centres.
Therefore, a sub-population of accreting matter particles, swept up into
chaotic orbits around a BH binary, might repeatedly take slingshots and become
accelerated to ultra-relativistic speeds (as seen by observers on Earth),
ultimately escaping from the binary, as well as the fate of being devoured by a
BH. The escaped particles can plausibly be observed on Earth as
ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). Investigating such a possibility would
require general relativistic slingshot formulae due to the high speeds involved
and the close encounters with BHs. We derive them in this paper, and show that
the percentage gain per slingshot in a particle's Lorentz factor remains
undiminished even as the particle energizes up, thus demonstrating that the
slingshot mechanism can in principal accelerate particles to extreme energies.

This surprising behavior has serious implications towards Bayesian constrained

capture at parts of the true function of interest. Without further

level, is supposed to trip offline during an islanding situation. However,
islanding detection is done by comparing the voltage and frequency measurements

ride-through curves. Current practice is to use the same limit throughout the
year independent of the operating conditions. This could result in the tripping
of RG at times when the system is already weak, thereby posing a threat to
voltage security by heavily limiting the load margin (LM). Conversely, heavily
relaxing these limits would result in scenarios where the generation does not
go offline even during an islanding situation. The proposed methodology focuses
on optimizing low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) settings at selective RGs as a
preventive control for maintaining a desired steady-state voltage stability
margin while not sacrificing dependability during islanding. The proposed
process is a multi-stage approach, in which at each stage, a subset of
estimated poor-quality solutions is screened out based on various

for phase-sensitive measurements. Here, we implement a self-heterodyned
detection scheme in noncollinear wave-mixing measurements with a short
attosecond XUV pulse train and two few-cycle near infrared (NIR) pulses. The
initial spatiotemporally overlapped XUV and NIR pulses generate a coherence of
both odd (1snp) and even (1sns and 1snd) parity states within gaseous helium. A
variably delayed noncollinear NIR pulse generates angularly-dependent four-wave
mixing signals that report on the evolution of this coherence. The diffuse
angular structure of the XUV harmonics underlying these emission signals is
used as a reference field for heterodyne detection, leading to cycle
oscillations in the transient wave-mixing spectra. With this detection scheme,
wave-mixing signals emitting from at least eight distinct light-induced, or
dressed, states can be observed, in contrast to only one light induced state
identified in a similar homodyne wave-mixing measurement. In conjunction with
the self-heterodyned detection scheme, the noncollinear geometry permits the
conclusive identification and angular separation of distinct wave-mixing
pathways, reducing the complexity of transient spectra. These results
demonstrate that the application of heterodyne detection schemes can provide
signal amplification and phase-sensitivity, while maintaining the versatility
and selectivity of noncollinear attosecond XUV wave-mixing spectroscopies.
These techniques will be important tools in the study of ultrafast dynamics
within complex chemical systems in the XUV regime.

experimentally that Lagrangian duality brings significant benefits for these
applications. In energy domains, the combination of Lagrangian duality and deep
learning can be used to obtain state-of-the-art results to predict optimal
power flows, in energy systems, and optimal compressor settings, in gas

a Doppler interval around the zero-Doppler axis. The transmit and receive pulse
trains are constructed by coordinating the transmission of a pair of Golay
complementary waveforms across time according to zeros and ones in a binary
sequence $P$. In the receive pulse train filter, each waveform is weighted
according to an element from another sequence $Q$. We show that the spectrum of
essentially the product of $P$ and $Q$ sequences controls the size of the range
sidelobes of the cross-ambiguity function. We annihilate the range sidelobes at
low Doppler by designing the $(P,Q)$ pairs such that their products have
high-order spectral nulls around zero Doppler. We specify the subspace, along
with a basis, for such sequences, thereby providing a general way of
constructing $(P,Q)$ pairs. At the same time, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
at the receiver output, for a single point target in white noise, depends only
on the choice of $Q$. By jointly designing the transmit-receive sequences
$(P,Q)$, we can maximize the output SNR subject to achieving a given order of
the spectral null. The proposed $(P,Q)$ constructions can also be extended to
sequences consisting of more than two complementary waveforms; this is done
explicitly for a library of Golay complementary quads. Finally, we extend the
construction of $(P,Q)$ pairs to multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) radar,

macroscopic magnetic field inhomogeneities in the images obtained by
multi-Gradient-Recalled-Echo (mGRE) techniques. The goal of this study is to
develop a library-driven approach for fast VSF implementation. Methods: The VSF
approach describes the contribution of the magnetic field inhomogeneity effects
on the mGRE signal decay in terms of the F-function calculated from mGRE phase
and magnitude images. A pre-calculated library accounting for a variety of
background field gradients caused by magnetic field inhomogeneities was used
herein to speed up calculation of the F-function and to generate quantitative
R2* maps from the mGRE data collected from two healthy volunteers. Results: As
compared with direct calculation of the F-function based on a voxel-wise
approach, the new library-driven method substantially reduces computational
time from several hours to few minutes, while, at the same time, providing
similar accuracy of R2* mapping. Conclusion: The new procedure proposed in this
study provides a fast post-processing algorithm that can be incorporated in the
quantitative analysis of mGRE data to account for background field
inhomogeneity artifacts, thus can facilitate the applications of mGRE-based
quantitative techniques in clinical practices.

theory of Markowitz and use this distance between asset structural breaks for
our penalty function, rather than portfolio variance. Our experiments are
promising: on synthetic data, we show that our proposed method does indeed
diversify among time series with highly similar structural breaks and enjoys
advantages over existing metrics between sets. On real data, experiments
illustrate that our proposed optimization method performs well relative to nine
other commonly used options, producing the second-highest returns, the lowest
volatility, and second-lowest drawdown. The main implication for this method in
portfolio management is reducing simultaneous asset shocks and potentially
sharp associated drawdowns during periods of highly similar structural breaks,
such as a market crisis. Our method adds to a considerable literature of
portfolio optimization techniques in econometrics and could complement these

bounds the error of the one-dimensional NUFFT of types 1 and 2 in exact

points, the error is shown to decrease with an exponential rate arbitrarily
close to that of the popular Kaiser--Bessel kernel. This requires controlling a

An interesting and challenging task in this application domain is to detect
polarized communities in signed graphs. A number of different methods have been
proposed for this task. However, existing approaches aim at finding globally
optimal solutions. Instead, in this paper we are interested in finding
polarized communities that are related to a small set of seed nodes provided as
input. Seed nodes may consist of two sets, which constitute the two sides of a
polarized structure.
  In this paper we formulate the problem of finding local polarized communities
in signed graphs as a locally-biased eigen-problem. By viewing the eigenvector
associated with the smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix as the solution
of a constrained optimization problem, we are able to incorporate the local
information as an additional constraint. In addition, we show that the
locally-biased vector can be used to find communities with approximation
guarantee with respect to a local analogue of the Cheeger constant on signed
graphs. By exploiting the sparsity in the input graph, an indicator vector for
the polarized communities can be found in time linear to the graph size.
  Our experiments on real-world networks validate the proposed algorithm and
demonstrate its usefulness in finding local structures in this semi-supervised

suffers from two numerical difficulties: the particle deficiency problem, which
will deteriorate the simulation accuracy, and the particle clumping problem,
which usually leads to poor stability of particle simulations. We propose to
solve these two problems by developing an approximate projection method for
incompressible free-surface flows under a variational staggered particle
framework. After particle discretization, we first categorize all fluid
particles into four subsets. Then according to the classification, we propose
to solve the particle deficiency problem by analytically imposing free surface
boundary conditions on both the Laplacian operator and the source term. To
address the particle clumping problem, we propose to extend the Taylor-series
consistent pressure gradient model with kernel function correction and
semi-analytical boundary conditions. Compared to previous approximate
projection method [1], our incompressibility solver is stable under both
compressive and tensile stress states, no pressure clumping or iterative
density correction (e.g., a density constrained pressure approach) is necessary
to stabilize the solver anymore. Motivated by the Helmholtz free energy
functional, we additionally introduce an iterative particle shifting algorithm
to improve the accuracy. It significantly reduces particle splashes near the
free surface. Therefore, high-fidelity simulations of the formation and
fragmentation of liquid jets and sheets are obtained for both the two-jets and

semiconductor material, the electric field will interact nonlinearly with the
solid, driving a coherent current. An asymmetry of the ultrashort,
carrier-envelope-phase-stable waveform results in a net transfer of charge,
which can be measured by macroscopic electric contact leads. This effect has
been pioneered with extremely short, single-cycle laser pulses at low
repetition rate, thus limiting the applicability of its potential for ultrafast
electronics. We investigate lightwave-driven currents in gallium nitride using
few-cycle laser pulses of nearly twice the duration and at a repetition rate
two orders of magnitude higher than in previous work. We successfully simulate
our experimental data with a theoretical model based on interfering multiphoton
transitions, using the exact laser pulse shape retrieved from dispersion-scan
measurements. Substantially increasing the repetition rate and relaxing the
constraint on the pulse duration marks an important step forward towards
applications of lightwave-driven electronics.

beginning to make such a `Monte-Carlo' approach practical in fluid mechanics.
The process of data generation, classification and model creation is described
in some detail, stressing the importance of validation and verification.
Although the purpose of the paper is to explore the procedure, rather than to
model two-dimensional turbulence, it is encouraging that the Monte Carlo
process naturally leads to the consideration of vortex dipoles as building
blocks of the flow, on a par with the more conventional individual vortex
cores. Although not completely novel, this `spontaneous' discovery supports the
claim that an important advantage of randomised experiments is to bypass
researcher prejudice and alleviate paradigm lock. It is finally noted that the
method can be extended to three-dimensional flows in practical times.

the feature extraction for more suitability to the polar nature of radar scan
formation using cylindrical convolutions, anti-aliasing blurring, and
azimuth-wise max-pooling; all in order to bolster the rotational invariance.
The enforced metric space is then used to encode a reference trajectory,
serving as a map, which is queried for nearest neighbours (NNs) for recognition
of places at run-time. We demonstrate the performance of our topological
localisation system over the course of many repeat forays using the largest

including nonlinearity in the analysis, the proposed frequency-domain framework
identifies the worst-case disturbances for laminar-turbulent transition. We
demonstrate the framework on a flat-plate boundary layer by considering
three-dimensional spanwise-periodic perturbations triggered by a few optimal
forcing modes of finite amplitude. Two types of volumetric forcing are
considered, one corresponding to a single frequency/spanwise-wavenumber pair,
and a multi-harmonic where a harmonic frequency and wavenumber are also added.
Depending on the forcing strategy, we recover a range of transition scenarios
associated with K-type and H-type mechanisms, including oblique and
Tollmien-Schlichting waves, streaks and their breakdown. We show that
nonlinearity plays a critical role in optimizing growth by combining and
redistributing energy between the linear mechanisms and the higher perturbation
harmonics. With a very limited range of frequencies and wavenumbers, the
calculations appear to reach the early stages of the turbulent regime through
the generation and breakdown of hairpin and quasi-streamwise staggered

the interaction between a spatially localized electron-positron cloud and an
electron-ion plasma. The latter is permeated by a magnetic field that is
initially spatially uniform and aligned with the mean velocity vector of the
pair cloud. The pair cloud expels the magnetic field and piles it up into an
electromagnetic piston. Its electromagnetic field is strong enough to separate
the pair cloud from the ambient plasma in the direction that is perpendicular
to the cloud propagation direction. The piston propagates away from the spine
of the injected pair cloud and it accelerates the protons to a high
nonrelativistic speed. The accelerated protons form an outer cocoon that will
eventually become separated from the unperturbed ambient plasma by a fast
magnetosonic shock. No electromagnetic piston forms at the front of the cloud
and a shock is mediated here by the filamentation instability. The final plasma
distribution resembles that of a hydrodynamic jet. Collisionless plasma jets
may form in the coronal plasma of accreting black holes and the interaction
between the strong magnetic field of the piston and the hot pair cloud may
contribute to radio emissions by such objects.

of the heavy meson decays and their $SU(N)$ decomposition. In the framework,
the topological amplitudes are expressed in invariant tensors and classified
into tree- and penguin-operator-induced diagrams according to which four-quark
operators, tree or penguin, being inserted into their effective weak vertexes.
By decomposing the four-quark operators into irreducible representations of
$SU(N)$ group, one can derive the $SU(N)$ irreducible amplitudes from the
tensor form of the topology. Taking the $D\to PP$ decay ($P$ denoting a
pseudoscalar meson) with $SU(3)_F$ symmetry as an example, we show our
framework in detail. The fact that some topologies are not independent in the
$SU(3)_F$ limit is explained by group theory. It is found that there are only
nine independent topologies in all tree- and penguin-operator-induced diagrams
contributing to the $D\to PP$ decays in the Standard Model. If a large
quark-loop diagram is assumed, the large $\Delta A_{CP}$ and the very different
$D^0\to K^+K^-$ and $D^0\to \pi^+\pi^-$ branching fractions can be explained
with a normal $U$-spin breaking. Moreover, our framework provides a simple and
systematic way to analyze the $SU(N)$ breaking effects. As examples, the linear
$SU(3)_F$ breaking and the high order $U$-spin breaking in charm decays are
re-investigated in our framework, which are consistent with literature. We
propose the concepts of splitting and degeneracy of topologies, and use them to
describe the charm-less bottom decay. We find $SU(3)_F$ analysis for the
charm-less $B$ decays is different from the $D$ decays because the charm-quark
loop is beyond the $SU(3)$ symmetry and should be investigated in the symmetry
breaking chain of $SU(4)\to SU(3)$.

statistical iterative reconstruction that accurately models the scanner
geometry and physics remains unknown to researchers. Therefore, this paper
presents a novel physics-based iterative reconstruction method for DS-FFS CT
and assess its image quality. Our algorithm uses precise physics models to
reconstruct from the native cone-beam geometry and interleaved dual source
helical trajectory of a DS-FFS CT. To do so, we construct a noise physics model
to represent data acquisition noise and a prior image model to represent image
noise and texture. In addition, we design forward system models to compute the
locations of deflected focal spots, the dimension and sensitivity of voxels and
detector units, as well as the length of intersection between X-rays and
voxels. The forward system models further represent the coordinated movement
between the dual sources by computing their X-ray coverage gaps and overlaps at
an arbitrary helical pitch. With the above models, we reconstruct images by
using an advanced Consensus Equilibrium (CE) numerical method to compute the
maximum a posteriori estimate to a joint optimization problem that
simultaneously fits all models. We compared our reconstruction with Siemens
ADMIRE, which is the clinical standard hybrid iterative reconstruction (IR)
method for DS-FFS CT, in terms of spatial resolution, noise profile and image
artifacts through both phantoms and clinical datasets. Experiments show that
our reconstruction has a consistently higher spatial resolution than the
clinical standard hybrid IR. In addition, our reconstruction shows a reduced
magnitude of image undersampling artifacts than the clinical standard.

also referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are
not always able to discern, with their own cognitive capacities, genuine
information from fake one. Hence, in the last years, several approaches have
been proposed to automatically assess credibility in social media. Many of them
are based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine learning techniques
to identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are
emerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility
propagation, and knowledge-based ones exploiting Semantic Web technologies.
Three of the main contexts in which the assessment of information credibility
has been investigated concern: (i) the detection of opinion spam in review
sites, (ii) the detection of fake news in microblogging, and (iii) the
credibility assessment of online health-related information. In this article,
the main issues connected to the evaluation of information credibility in the

single-resonator structures cannot avoid contamination from nonlinear noise
without significantly compromising pump power efficiency, and are thus limited
to generating only weak degenerate squeezing. We use this device to generate

for scalable design methods which can incorporate the heterogeneity present in
the hardware and software components of FPGA systems. Moreover, these FPGA
systems need to be maintainable and adaptable to changing workloads while
improving accessibility for the application developers. However, current FPGA
systems fail to achieve modularity and support for multi-tenancy due to
dependencies between system components and lack of standardised abstraction
layers. To solve this, we introduce a modular FPGA operating system -- FOS,
which adopts a modular FPGA development flow to allow each system component to
be changed and be agnostic to the heterogeneity of EDA tool versions, hardware
and software layers. Further, to dynamically maximise the utilisation
transparently from the users, FOS employs resource-elastic scheduling to
arbitrate the FPGA resources in both time and spatial domain for any type of
accelerators. Our evaluation on different FPGA boards shows that FOS can
provide performance improvements in both single-tenant and multi-tenant
environments while substantially reducing the development time and, at the same
time, improving flexibility.

required image for an ordinary user is a challenging task in computer vision
systems. During the past two decades, many types of research have been
introduced to improve the performance of the automatic annotation of images,
which are traditionally focused on content-based image retrieval. Although,
recent research demonstrates that there is a semantic gap between content-based
image retrieval and image semantics understandable by humans. As a result,
existing research in this area has caused to bridge the semantic gap between
low-level image features and high-level semantics. The conventional method of
bridging the semantic gap is through the automatic image annotation (AIA) that
extracts semantic features using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we
propose a novel AIA model based on the deep learning feature extraction method.
The proposed model has three phases, including a feature extractor, a tag
generator, and an image annotator. First, the proposed model extracts
automatically the high and low-level features based on dual-tree continues
wavelet transform (DT-CWT), singular value decomposition, distribution of color
ton, and the deep neural network. Moreover, the tag generator balances the
dictionary of the annotated keywords by a new log-entropy auto-encoder (LEAE)
and then describes these keywords by word embedding. Finally, the annotator
works based on the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network in order to obtain the
importance degree of specific features of the image. The experiments conducted
on two benchmark datasets confirm that the superiority of the proposed model
compared to the previous models in terms of performance criteria.

multilingual individuals under different task circumstances (Dijkstra et al.,
2018). In the present study, we added lateral inhibition to Multilink's lexical
network. Parameters were fit on the basis of reaction times from the English,
British, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. We found a maximum correlation of 0.643
(N=1,205) on these data sets as a whole. Furthermore, the simulations
themselves became faster as a result of adding lateral inhibition. We tested
the fitted model to stimuli from a neighbourhood study (Mulder et al., 2018).
Lateral inhibition was found to improve Multilink's correlations for this
study, yielding an overall correlation of 0.67. Next, we explored the role of
lateral inhibition as part of the model's task/decision system by running
simulations on data from two studies concerning interlingual homographs
(Vanlangendonck et al., in press; Goertz, 2018). We found that, while lateral
inhibition plays a substantial part in the word selection process, this alone
is not enough to result in a correct response selection. To solve this problem,
we added a new task component to Multilink, especially designed to account for
the translation process of interlingual homographs, cognates, and
language-specific control words. The subsequent simulation results showed
patterns remarkably similar to those in the Goertz study. The isomorphicity of
the simulated data to the empirical data was further attested by an overall
correlation of 0.538 (N=254) between reaction times and simulated model cycle
times, as well as a condition pattern correlation of 0.853 (N=8). We conclude
that Multilink yields an excellent fit to empirical data, particularly when a
task-specific setting of the inhibition parameters is allowed.

to obtain phase, instantaneous frequency and amplitude information of SAT
seasonal cycles in different geographical zones. The analysis of the phase
dynamics reveals large regions with coherent seasonality. The analysis of the
instantaneous frequencies uncovers clean wave patterns formed by alternating
regions of negative and positive correlations. In contrast, the analysis of the
amplitude dynamics uncovers wave patterns with additional large-scale
structures. These structures are interpreted as due to the fact that the
amplitude dynamics is affected by processes that act in long and short time
scales, while the dynamics of the instantaneous frequency is mainly governed by
fast processes. Therefore, Hilbert analysis allows to disentangle climatic
processes and to track planetary atmospheric waves. Our results are relevant
for the analysis of complex oscillatory signals because they offer a general
strategy for uncovering interactions that act at different time scales.
