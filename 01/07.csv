separated by a thin ferroelectric barrier, have recently aroused significant
interest for technological applications as nanoscale resistive switching
devices. So far, most of existing FTJs have been based on perovskite-oxide
barrier layers. The recent discovery of the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals
ferroelectric materials opens a new route to realize tunnel junctions with new
functionalities and nm-scale dimensions. Due to the weak coupling between the
atomic layers in these materials, the relative dipole alignment between them
can be controlled by applied voltage. This allows transitions between
ferroelectric and antiferroelectric orderings, resulting in significant changes
of the electronic structure. Here, we propose to realize 2D antiferroelectric
tunnel junctions (AFTJs), which exploit this new functionality, based on
bilayer In$_2$X$_3$ (X = S, Se, Te) barriers and different 2D electrodes. Using
first-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that
the In$_2$X$_3$ bilayers exhibit stable ferroelectric and antiferroelectric
states separated by sizable energy barriers, thus supporting a non-volatile
switching between these states. Using quantum-mechanical modeling of the
electronic transport, we explore in-plane and out-of-plane tunneling across the
In$_2$S$_3$ van der Waals bilayers, and predict giant tunneling
electroresistance (TER) effects and multiple non-volatile resistance states
driven by ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order transitions. Our proposal opens
a new route to realize nanoscale memory devices with ultrahigh storage density
using 2D AFTJs.

system based on the cell-free massive MIMO technology. In such a system, during
the downlink phase, the sensors harvest radio-frequency (RF) energy emitted by
the distributed access points (APs). During the uplink phase, sensors transmit
data to the APs using the harvested energy. Collocated massive MIMO and
small-cell IoT can be treated as special cases of cell-free IoT. We derive the
tight closed-form lower bound on the amount of harvested energy, and the
closed-form expression of SINR as the metrics of power transfer and data
transmission, respectively. To improve the energy efficiency, we jointly
optimize the uplink and downlink power control coefficients to minimize the
total transmit energy consumption while meeting the target SINRs. Extended
simulation results show that cell-free IoT outperforms collocated massive MIMO
and small-cell IoT both in terms of the per user throughput for uplink, and the
amount of energy harvested for downlink. Moreover, significant gains can be
achieved by the proposed joint power control in terms of both per user
throughput and energy consumption.

deflection of massive particles. For a receiver and a source at infinite
distance from the lens object, we use an osculating Riemannian manifold method.
While the distance is finite, we apply the generalized Jacobi metric method.
For the case between the two situations, the Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler

very-high-energies (VHE, E > 100 GeV). The aim of this work is to locate the
region of the VHE gamma-ray emission and to describe the observed broadband
spectral energy distribution (SED) during the low VHE gamma-ray state. The data
from M87 collected between 2012 and 2015 as part of a MAGIC monitoring
programme are analysed and combined with multi-wavelength data from Fermi-LAT,
Chandra, HST, EVN, VLBA and the Liverpool Telescope. The averaged VHE gamma-ray
spectrum can be fitted from 100GeV to 10TeV with a simple power law with a
photon index of (-2.41 $\pm$ 0.07), while the integral flux above 300GeV is
$(1.44 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$. During the campaign between
2012 and 2015, M87 is generally found in a low emission state at all observed
wavelengths. The VHE gamma-ray flux from the present 2012-2015 M87 campaign is
consistent with a constant flux with some hint of variability ($\sim3\sigma$)
on a daily timescale in 2013. The low-state gamma-ray emission likely
originates from the same region as the flare-state emission. Given the
broadband SED, both a leptonic synchrotron self Compton and a hybrid
photo-hadronic model reproduce the available data well, even if the latter is
preferred. We note, however, that the energy stored in the magnetic field in
the leptonic scenario is very low suggesting a matter dominated emission
region.

functional separation of variables for nonlinear PDEs. It proposes a more
general approach to the construction of exact solutions to nonlinear equations
of applied mathematics and mathematical physics, based on a special
transformation with an integral term and the generalized splitting principle.
The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by nonlinear diffusion-type
equations that contain reaction and convective terms with variable
coefficients. The focus is on equations of a fairly general form that depend on
one, two or three arbitrary functions (such nonlinear PDEs are most difficult
to analyze and find exact solutions). A number of new functional separable
solutions and generalized traveling wave solutions are described (more than 30
exact solutions have been presented in total). It is shown that the method of
functional separation of variables can, in certain cases, be more effective
than (i) the nonclassical method of symmetry reductions based on an invariant
surface condition, and (ii) the method of differential constraints based on a
single differential constraint. The exact solutions obtained can be used to
test various numerical and approximate analytical methods of mathematical
physics and mechanics.

are studied. We theoretically investigated how solar parameters, such as the
solar wind dynamic pressure and the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux,
influence the bow shock location, which is still currently not well understood.
We present the formula for the location of the bow shock nose of the
unmagnetized planet. The bow shock location, the sum of the ionopause location
and bow shock standoff distance, is calculated in the gasdynamics approach. The
ionopause location is determined using thermal pressure continuity, i.e., the
solar wind thermal pressure equal to the ionospheric pressure, according to
tangential discontinuity. The analytical formula of the ionopause nose location
and the ionopause profile around the nose are obtained. The standoff distance
is calculated using the empirical model. Our derived formula shows that the
shock nose location is a function of the scale height of ionosphere, the
dynamic pressure of the solar wind and the peak ionospheric pressure. The
theoretical model implies that the shock nose location is more sensitive to the
solar EUV flux than solar wind dynamics pressure. Further, we theoretically
show that the bow shock location is proportional to the solar wind dynamic
pressure to the power of negative C, where C is about the ratio of the
ionospheric scale height to the distance between bow shock nose and the planet
center. This theory matches the gasdynamics simulation and is consistent with
the spacecraft measurement result by Mars Express [Hall, et al. (2016) J.

system remains unexplored to date. Here, we investigate native point defects in
monolayer CrI$_3$ by means of first-principles calculations. We consider a
large set of intrinsic impurities and address their atomic structure,
thermodynamic stability, diffusion and aggregation tendencies as well as local
magnetic moments. Under thermodynamic equilibrium, the most stable defects are
found to be either Cr or I atomic vacancies along with their complexes,
depending on the chemical potential conditions. These defects are predicted to
be quite mobile at room temperature and to exhibit a strong tendency to
agglomerate. In addition, our calculations indicate that the defect-induced
deviation from the nominal stoichiometry largely impacts the local magnetic
moments, thereby suggesting a marked interplay between magnetism and disorder
in CrI$_3$. Overall, this work portrays a comprehensive picture of intrinsic
point defects in monolayer CrI$_3$ from a theoretical perspective.

cost of data movement on cached architectures depends on global state, does not

consider the cost of data movement. Existing cache models and simulators
provide the missing information but are computationally expensive. We present a
lightweight cache model for fully associative caches with least recently used
(LRU) replacement policy that gives fast and accurate results. We count the
cache misses without explicit enumeration of all memory accesses by using
symbolic counting techniques twice: 1) to derive the stack distance for each
memory access and 2) to count the memory accesses with stack distance larger
than the cache size. While this technique seems infeasible in theory, due to
non-linearities after the first round of counting, we show that the counting
problems are sufficiently linear in practice. Our cache model often computes
the results within seconds and contrary to simulation the execution time is
mostly problem size independent. Our evaluation measures modeling errors below
0.6% on real hardware. By providing accurate data placement information we
enable memory hierarchy aware software development.

unexpected result is that the halo of the Sombrero is strikingly metal-rich:
even the outer field, located at $\sim$17 effective radii of the bulge, has a
median metallicity [Z/H]$\sim$-0.15 and the fraction of stars with [Z/H]<-1.0

heavy-fermion compound CeB6 and its La-diluted alloys are among the
best-studied realizations of the long-range-ordered multipolar phases, often
referred to as ""hidden order"". Previously the hidden order in phase II was
identified as primary antiferroquadrupolar (AFQ) and field-induced octupolar

investigation of collective excitations in the phase II of CeB6. Inelastic
neutron scattering (INS) in fields up to 16.5 T reveals a new high-energy mode

scholars in the humanities, as they provide insights into people, cultures, and

of travelogue and report upon an interdisciplinary method that, using machine
learning as well as domain knowledge, can effectively identify German
travelogues in the digitized inventory of the Austrian National Library with F1
scores between 0.94 and 1.00. We applied our method on a corpus of 161,522
German volumes and identified 345 travelogues that could not be identified
using traditional search methods, resulting in the most extensive collection of
early modern German travelogues ever created. To our knowledge, this is the
first time such a method was implemented for the bibliographic indexing of a
text corpus on this scale, improving and extending the traditional methods in
the humanities. Overall, we consider our technique to be an important first
step in a broader effort of developing a novel mixed-method approach for the
large-scale serial analysis of travelogues.

species that form upon phase separation are self-limiting in size, pinned to

to the local modulation of an existing miscibility phase transition in the

molecular changes due to OEEFs; understanding the characteristics of
OEEF-induced couplings between atomic and molecular properties is an important
step toward comprehensive understanding of the effects of strong external
fields on molecular structure, stability, and reactivity. We focus on the
atomic and molecular (bond) properties of a set of homo- (H2, N2, O2, F2, and
Cl2) and hetero-diatomic (HF, HCl, CO, and NO) molecules under intense external
electric fields in the context of quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM).
It is shown that atomic properties (atomic charges and energies, and
localization index) correlate linearly with the field strengths, but molecular
properties (bond length, electron density at bond critical point, bond length,
and electron delocalization index) exhibit non-linear responses to the imposed
fields. In particular, the changes in the electron density distribution alter
the shapes and locations of the zero-flux surfaces, atomic volumes, atomic
electron population, and localization/delocalization indices. At the molecular
level, the topography and topology of the molecular electrostatic potential
undergo dramatic changes. The external fields also perturb the
covalent-polar-ionic characteristic of the studied chemical bonds, hallmarking
the impact of electric fields on the stability and reactivity of chemical
compounds. The findings are well-rationalized within the framework of the
quantum theory of atoms in molecules and form a coherent conceptual
understanding of these effects in prototypical molecules such as diatomics.

seen throughout the literature for the inifinite chain: an essential
singularity that includes an exponential dependence on the inverse temperature.
Assuming an arbitrary (but finite) number of spins and retaining terms that are
usually considered ignorable in the thermodynamic limit, the analysis involves
nothing beyond straightforward series expansions, starting either from the
partition function for a closed chain in a magnetic field, obtained using the
transfer-matrix approach; or from the expression for the zero-field
susceptibility found via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. In both cases,
the exponential singularity is exactly removed. In addition, the susceptibility

Unfortunately, for non-compact spaces this fact is not longer true. For the
geodesic flow we provide a criterion that ensures the existence of a maximizing
measure for uniformly continuous potentials. We prove that the only obstruction
to the existence of a maximizing measure is the full escape of mass phenomenon.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first general result on the existence
of maximizing measures for non-compact topological spaces which does not
require the potential to be coercive. We study zero temperature limits of
equilibrium measures for a suitable family of potentials. We prove some
convergence and divergence results for the limiting behaviour of such measures.
Among some consequences we obtain that the geodesic flow has the intermediate

(1) table-based interpolation, (2)Generalized Moving Least-Squares, and (3)
feed-forward Deep Neural Networks, to develop compact models for a p-n junction
diode. We evaluate the performance of these ""data-driven"" compact models by (1)
comparing their voltage-current characteristics against laboratory data, and
(2) building a bridge rectifier circuit using these devices, predicting the
circuit's behavior using SPICE-like circuit simulations, and then comparing
these predictions against laboratory measurements of the same circuit.

complementary information and highlight different perspectives, albeit each
with their own limitations. A focus on a single modality may lead to incorrect
inferences, which is especially important when a studied phenomenon is a
disease. In this paper, we introduce a method that takes advantage of
multimodal data in addressing the hypotheses of disconnectivity and dysfunction
within schizophrenia (SZ). Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing
links within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian
graphical model (GGM). We then propose a modularity-based method that can be
applied to the GGM to identify links that are associated with mental illness
across a multimodal data set. Through simulation and real data, we show our
approach reveals important information about disease-related network
disruptions that are missed with a focus on a single modality. We use
functional MRI (fMRI), diffusion MRI (dMRI), and structural MRI (sMRI) to
compute the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (fALFF),
fractional anisotropy (FA), and gray matter (GM) concentration maps. These
three modalities are analyzed using our modularity method. Results: Our results
show missing links that are only captured by the cross-modal information that
may play an important role in disconnectivity between the components.
Conclusion: We identified multimodal (fALFF, FA and GM) disconnectivity in the
default mode network area in patients with SZ, which would not have been
detectable in a single modality. Significance: The proposed approach provides
an important new tool for capturing information that is distributed among
multiple imaging modalities.

for mid- and high-level self-similarity, tonal and rhythmic relationships. In
this thesis, I explore the application of ANNs to different aspects of musical

studied. Then, a top-down method for imposing a high-level structural template
in music generation is presented, which combines Gibbs sampling using a
convolutional RBM with gradient-descent optimization on the intermediate
solutions. Furthermore, I motivate the relevance of musical transformations in
structure modeling and show how a connectionist model, the Gated Autoencoder
(GAE), can be employed to learn transformations between musical fragments. For
learning transformations in sequences, I propose a special predictive training
of the GAE, which yields a representation of polyphonic music as a sequence of
intervals. Furthermore, the applicability of these interval representations to
a top-down discovery of repeated musical sections is shown. Finally, a
recurrent variant of the GAE is proposed, and its efficacy in music prediction

demonstrating how the fracton phenomenon naturally arises as a consequence of
higher moment conservation laws, often accompanied by the emergence of tensor

mature enough for their application on future satellite CMB polarization

JAXA's H3 rocket. It will accommodate more than 4000 TESs in focal planes of
reflective low-frequency and refractive medium-and-high-frequency telescopes in
order to detect a signature imprinted on the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
by the primordial gravitational waves predicted in cosmic inflation. The total
wide frequency coverage between 34GHz and 448GHz enables us to extract such
weak spiral polarization patterns through the precise subtraction of our
Galaxy's foreground emission by using spectral differences among CMB and
foreground signals. Telescopes are cooled down to 5Kelvin for suppressing
thermal noise and contain polarization modulators with transmissive half-wave
plates at individual apertures for separating sky polarization signals from
artificial polarization and for mitigating from instrumental 1/f noise. Passive
cooling by using V-grooves supports active cooling with mechanical coolers as
well as adiabatic demagnetization refrigerators. Sky observations from the
second Sun-Earth Lagrangian point, L2, are planned for three years. An
international collaboration between Japan, USA, Canada, and Europe is sharing
various roles. In May 2019, the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science
(ISAS), JAXA selected LiteBIRD as the strategic large mission No. 2.

To describe the system, we generalize the tight-binding model of the Hofstadter
butterfly to include the effect of the superconducting islands. The quantum
Hall topological phases, appearing in the absence of superconductivity, are
characterized by integer fermionic Chern numbers corresponding to the number of
occupied bulk Landau levels. As the strength of the superconducting pairing
increases a series of transitions occurs, with one less chiral Majorana edge
mode at each consecutive phase, leading to a reduction of the fermionic Chern
number by a half. When the pairing potential exceeds the tight-binding model
bandwidth, Cooper pairs are localized in the islands, the Chern number is zero,
and there are no low-energy edge modes. We identify domains in the model's
parameter space for which the system is topological and supports an odd number
of chiral Majorana edge modes. While the precise shape of the domains depends
on the details of the model, the general structure of the phase diagram is
robust, and it is obtained numerically and in several simplified traceable
analytical models. We discuss the relevance of this study to recent
experimental research of two-dimensional superconductor arrays on semiconductor

time at cosmological distances. They will also reveal key, unexplored LSB
structures which strongly constrain our structure-formation paradigm, such as
merger-induced tidal features and intra-cluster light. However, exploitation of
these revolutionary new datasets will require us to address several
data-analysis challenges. Data-processing pipelines will have to preserve LSB
structures, which are susceptible to sky over-subtraction. Analysis of the
prodigious data volumes will require machine-learning (in particular
unsupervised techniques), to augment or even replace traditional methods.
Cosmological simulations, which are essential for a statistical understanding
of the physics of galaxy evolution, will require mass and spatial resolutions
that are high enough to resolve LSB/dwarf galaxies and LSB structures. And
finally, estimation of physical properties (e.g. stellar masses and star
formation rates) will require reliable redshift information. Since it is
unlikely that even next-generation spectrographs will provide complete spectral
coverage in the LSB/dwarf regime outside the nearby Universe, photometric
redshifts may drive the science from these datasets. It is necessary,
therefore, that the accuracy of these redshifts is good enough (e.g. < 10 per

differently. Nevertheless, the Poisson noise to $rms$ variation value for IGR

consistently larger densities and intensities of the UV radiation fields in

(ANITA) experiment, the collaboration detected several neutrino candidates. Two
of these candidate events were consistent with an ultra-high-energy up-going
air shower and compatible with a tau neutrino interpretation. A third neutrino
candidate event was detected in a search for Askaryan radiation in the
Antarctic ice, although it is also consistent with the background expectation.
The inferred emergence angle of the first two events is in tension with IceCube
and ANITA limits on isotropic cosmogenic neutrino fluxes. Here, we test the
hypothesis that these events are astrophysical in origin, possibly caused by a
point source in the reconstructed direction. Given that any ultra-high-energy
tau neutrino flux traversing the Earth should be accompanied by a secondary
flux in the TeV-PeV range, we search for these secondary counterparts in seven
years of IceCube data using three complementary approaches. In the absence of
any significant detection, we set upper limits on the neutrino flux from
potential point sources. We compare these limits to ANITA's sensitivity in the
same direction and show that an astrophysical explanation of these anomalous
events under standard model assumptions is severely constrained regardless of
source spectrum.

significant improvements on the sub-grid model with respect to the previous
Illustris boxes, IllustrisTNG300 allows us to explore the dependencies of
galaxy clustering over a large cosmological volume and wide halo-mass range. We
show, at high statistical significance, that the halo assembly bias signal
(i.e., the secondary dependence of halo bias on halo formation redshift)
manifests itself on the clustering of the central galaxy population when this
is split by stellar mass, colour, specific star formation rate, and surface
density. A significant detection is also obtained for galaxy size: at fixed
halo mass, larger central galaxies are more tightly clustered than smaller
central galaxies in haloes of mass M$_{\rm vir} \lesssim 10^{12.5}$
$h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. This effect, however, seems to be uncorrelated with halo
formation time, unlike the rest of the secondary dependencies analysed. We also
explore the transmission of the halo spin bias signal, i.e., the secondary
dependence of halo bias on halo spin. Although galaxy spin retains little
information about the total spin of the halo, the correlation is enough to
produce a significant galaxy spin bias signal. We discuss possible ways to
probe the spin bias effects with observations.

topological invariant of the finite width of ribbons of HgTe/CdTe quantum well
is studied in the absence and presence of an external transverse electric
field. It will be recognized that a critical current changes topological
invariant of ribbons of quantum well. This topological phase transition, which
occurred by adjustment of the bias voltage, depends on the width of the sample
and the gate voltage. The profound effects of an external transverse electric
field are considered to the separation of spin-up and spin-down band
structures, decreasing band gap and tuning the topological phase transition
between ordinary and quantum spin Hall regime. These declares the transverse
electric field amplifies the quantum spin Hall regime and causes inducing the
topological phase transition in ribbons of quantum well. Our finding may
instantly clear some practical aspects of the study in the field of spintronic
for employment in spin-based devices.

proposed to find out, or at least to get an indication about, which one is
false. It is based on recording the time evolution of the rate of series of
outcomes that are found not-random in a pulsed Bell's setup. The results of
such experiment would be important not only to the foundations of Quantum

accretion flow instabilities. By means of a ~2yr very long baseline array
(VLBA) monitoring at 15, 24, and 43 GHz we investigate the source pc-scale
properties during an entire cycle of gamma-ray activity in the period
2015-2017. In contrast to the well-defined periodicity in the gamma-ray
emission, at radio frequencies no clear periodic pattern can be recognized. The
jet position angle, constrained by means of the total intensity ridge line,
varies across the different observing epochs in the range 40-60 deg. We also
investigate the time evolution of the source polarization properties, including
the rotation measure. The brightness temperature is found to decrease as the
frequency increases with an intrinsic value of ~1.5 x 10^10 K and the estimated
Doppler factor is ~1.4.

neural network model, indicating the model's failure to generalize to unseen
data. Neural net pruning can not only help to reduce a model's size but can
improve the model's generalization capacity as well. Pruning approaches look
for low-salient neurons that are less contributive to a model's decision and
hence can be removed from the model. This work investigates if pruning
approaches are successful in detecting neurons that are either high-salient
(mostly active or hyper) or low-salient (barely active or hypo), and whether
removal of such neurons can help to improve the model's generalization
capacity. Traditional blind adaptation techniques update either the whole or a
subset of layers, but have never explored selectively updating individual
neurons across one or more layers. Focusing on the fully connected layers of a
convolutional neural network (CNN), this work shows that it may be possible to
selectively adapt certain neurons (consisting of the hyper and the hypo
neurons) first, followed by a full-network fine tuning. Using the task of
automatic speech recognition, this work demonstrates how the removal of hyper
and hypo neurons from a model can improve the model's performance on
out-of-domain speech data and how selective neuron adaptation can ensure
improved performance when compared to traditional blind model adaptation.

Hence the present paper explores the possibility of using nonlinear BEM for
real-time simulation of biological organs. This paper begins with a general
discussion about using the nonlinear BEM for real-time simulation of biological
organs. Literature on nonlinear BEM is reviewed and the literature that deal
with nonlinear formulations and coding are noted down next. In the later
sections, some results obtained from nonlinear analyses are compared with the
corresponding results from linear analyses. The last section concludes with
remarks that indicate that it might be possible to obtain better simulations in
the future by using nonlinear BEM.

separation of 320 AU from its $\sim$2 Myr old host star DH Tau. With an
estimated mass of $8-22$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$ this object straddles the
deuterium-burning limit, and might have formed via core or pebble accretion,
disk instability, or molecular cloud fragmentation. To shed light on the
formation history of DH Tau b, we obtain the first measurement of rotational
line broadening for this object using high-resolution (R $\sim$25,000)
near-infrared spectroscopy from Keck/NIRSPEC. We measure a projected rotational
velocity ($v$sin$i$) of $9.6\pm0.7$ km/s, corresponding to a rotation rate that
is between 9-15% of DH Tau b's predicted break-up speed. This low rotation rate
is in good agreement with scenarios in which magnetic coupling between the
companion and its circumplanetary disk during the late stages of accretion
reduces angular momentum and regulates spin. We compare the rotation rate of DH
Tau b to published values for other planetary-mass objects with masses between
$0.3-20$ $M_{\rm{Jup}}$ and find no evidence of a correlation between mass and
rotation rate in this mass regime. Finally, we search for evidence of
individual molecules in DH Tau b's spectrum and find that it is dominated by CO
and H$_2$O, with no evidence for the presence of CH$_4$. This agrees with
expectations given DH Tau b's relatively high effective temperature ($\sim$2300
K).

coalescence with signal-to-noise ratio 12.9. The Virgo detector was also taking
data that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio,
but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90% credible intervals
for the component masses range from 1.12 to 2.52 $M_{\odot}$ (1.45 to 1.88
$M_{\odot}$ if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be
smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual
binary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp
mass $1.44^{+0.02}_{-0.02} M_{\odot}$ and the total mass
$3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}\,M_{\odot}$ of this system are significantly larger than
those of any other known binary neutron star system. The possibility that one
or both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out
from gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based
on its inconsistency with the known Galactic binary neutron star population.
Under the assumption that the signal was produced by a binary neutron star
coalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to $250-2810
\text{Gpc}^{-3}\text{yr}^{-1}$.

conditions, called the optimal $L^p$-estimate condition, the multiple coarse
$L^p$-estimate condition, the optimal $L^p$-extension condition, and the
multiple coarse $L^p$-extension condition, for a Hermitian (or Finsler) vector
bundle $(E,h)$. The main result of the present paper is to give a
characterization of the Nakano positivity of $(E,h)$ via the optimal
$L^2$-estimate condition. We also show that $(E,h)$ is Griffiths positive if it
satisfies the multiple coarse $L^p$-estimate condition for some $p>1$, the
optimal $L^p$-extension condition, or the multiple coarse $L^p$-extension
condition for some $p>0$. These results can be roughly viewed as converses of
H\""{o}rmander's $L^2$-estimate of $\bar\partial$

result, we get a totally different method to Nakano positivity of direct image

semiconducting transitional metal dichalcogenides have emerged as an
outstanding platform for studying these coupling effects because they possess
unique spin-valley locking physics for hosting rich excitonic species and the
reduced screening for strong Coulomb interactions. Here, we report the
observation of multiple valley phonons, phonons with momentum vectors pointing
to the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, and the resulting exciton
complexes in the monolayer semiconductor WSe2. From Lande g-factor and
polarization analyses of photoluminescence peaks, we find that these valley
phonons lead to efficient intervalley scattering of quasi particles in both
exciton formation and relaxation. This leads to a series of photoluminescence
peaks as valley phonon replicas of dark trions. Using identified valley
phonons, we also uncovered an intervalley exciton near charge neutrality, and
extract its short-range electron-hole exchange interaction to be about 10 meV.
Our work not only identifies a number of previously unknown 2D excitonic
species, but also shows that monolayer WSe2 is a prime candidate for studying
interactions between spin, pseudospin, and zone-edge phonons.

  Tactile Internet",,,,,"cs.NI eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The next frontier in communications is teleoperation -- manipulation and
control of remote environments. Compared to conventional networked
applications, teleoperation poses widely different requirements, ultra-low
latency (ULL) being the primary one. Teleoperation, along with a host of other
applications requiring ULL communication, is termed as Tactile Internet (TI). A
significant redesign of conventional networking techniques is necessary to
realize TI applications. Further, these advancements can be evaluated only when
meaningful performance metrics are available. However, existing TI performance
metrics fall severely short of comprehensively characterizing TI performance.
In this paper, we take the first step towards bridging this gap. To this end,
we propose a method that captures the fine-grained performance of TI in terms
of delay and precision. We take Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as the basis of our
work and identify whether it is sufficient in characterizing TI systems. We
refine DTW by developing a framework called Effective Time- and Value-Offset
(ETVO) that extracts fine-grained time and value offsets between input and
output signals of TI. Using ETVO, we present two quantitative metrics for TI --
Effective Delay-Derivative (EDD) and Effective Root Mean Square Error. Through
rigorous experiments conducted on a realistic TI setup, we demonstrate the
potential of the proposed metrics to precisely characterize TI interactions.

We now prove convergence of CRM for finding a point in the intersection of a

smoothness on polygonal meshes. Here, ""mixed smoothness"" refers to the choice
of different orders of smoothness across different edges of the mesh. To study
the dimension of spaces of such splines, we use tools from Homological Algebra.
These tools were first applied to the study of splines by Billera (1988). Using
them, estimation of the spline space dimension amounts to the study of the
generalized Billera-Schenck-Stillman complex for the spline space. In
particular, when the homology in positions one and zero of this complex are
trivial, the dimension of the spline space can be computed combinatorially. We
call such spline spaces ""lower-acyclic."" In this paper, starting from a spline
space which is lower-acyclic, we present sufficient conditions that ensure that
the same will be true for the spline space obtained after relaxing the
smoothness requirements across a subset of the mesh edges. This general recipe
is applied in a specific setting: meshes of arbitrary topologies. We show how
our results can be used to compute the dimensions of spline spaces on
triangulations, polygonal meshes, and T-meshes with holes.

and give a simple limit-free definition. We prove two extremal results on the
sum of Ricci curvatures for weighted graph.
  A weighted graph $G=(V,E,d)$ is an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ associated with
a distance function $d\colon E\to [0,\infty)$. By redefining the weights if
possible, without loss of generality, we assume that the shortest weighted
distance between $u$ and $v$ is exactly $d(u,v)$ for any edge $uv$. Now
consider a random walk whose transitive probability from an vertex $u$ to its
neighbor $v$ (a jump move along the edge $uv$) is proportional to
$w_{uv}:=F(d(u,v))/d(u,v)$ for some given function $F(\bullet)$. We first
generalize Lin-Lu-Yau's Ricci curvature definition to this weighted graph and
give a simple limit-free representation of $\kappa(x, y)$ using a so called
$\ast$-coupling functions. The total curvature $K(G)$ is defined to be the sum
of Ricci curvatures over all edges of $G$. We proved the following theorems: if
$F(\bullet)$ is a decreasing function, then $K(G)\geq 2|V| -2|E|$; if
$F(\bullet)$ is an increasing function, then $K(G)\leq 2|V| -2|E|$. Both
equalities hold if and only if $d$ is a constant function plus the girth is at
least $6$.
  In particular, these imply a Gauss-Bonnet theorem for (unweighted) graphs
with girth at least $6$, where the graph Ricci curvature is defined
geometrically in terms of optimal transport.

By limiting search to a line, the distribution of segments over the sequence of

optimal labelling can be computed exactly using a standard dynamic programming
algorithm, in linear time. The Markov assumption also leads to an intuitive
ranking method that uses the local marginal posterior probabilities to estimate
the expected number of correctly labelled points on a segment. To assess the

vibrations. An acceleration signal collected within a moving vehicle contains a
trace of the bridge's structural response, but also includes other sources such
as the vehicle suspension system and surface roughness-induced vibrations. This
paper introduces two methods for the bridge system identification using data
collected by a network of moving vehicles. The contributions of the vehicle
suspension system are removed by deconvolving the vehicle response in frequency
domain. The first approach utilizes the vehicle transfer function, and the
second uses EEMD method. Next, roughness-induced vibrations are extracted using
second-order blind identification (SOBI) method. After these two processes the
resulting signal is equivalent to the readings of mobile sensors that scan the
bridge's dynamic response. Structural modal identification using mobile sensor
data has been recently introduced as STRIDEX algorithm. The processed mobile
sensor data is analyzed using STRIDEX to identify the modal properties of the
bridge. The performance of the methods is validated on numerical case studies
of a long single-span bridge monitored via a network of moving vehicles. The
analyses consider three road surface roughness patterns. Results show that the
proposed algorithms are successful in extracting pure bridge vibrations, and
produce accurate and comprehensive modal properties of the bridge. The study
shows that the proposed transfer function method can efficiently deconvolve the
linear dynamics of a moving vehicle. EEMD method is able to extract vehicle
dynamic response without a-priori information about the vehicle. This study is
the first proposed methodology for complete bridge modal identification,
including operational natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios using
\textit{moving vehicles sensor data}.

two directions leads to the presence of bulk modes localized at the corners of
finite two-dimensional lattices. Our results describe fundamental properties of
non-Hermitian elastic lattices, and open new possibilities for the design of

real-world applications, such as trajectories and Internet flows.
Differentially private trajectory publishing concerns publishing path
information that is usable to the genuine users yet secure against adversaries
to reconstruct the path with maximum background knowledge. The exiting studies
all assume this knowledge to be all but one vertex on the path. To prevent the
adversaries recovering the missing information, they publish a perturbed path
where each vertex is sampled from a pre-defined set with differential privacy
(DP) to replace the corresponding vertex in the original path. In this paper,
we relax this assumption to be all but one edge on the path, and hence consider
the scenario of more powerful adversaries with the maximum background knowledge
of the entire network topology and the path (including all the vertices) except
one (arbitrary) missing edge. Under such an assumption, the perturbed path
produced by the existing work is vulnerable, because the adversary can
reconstruct the missing edge from the existence of an edge in the perturbed
path. To address this vulnerability and effectively protect edge privacy,
instead of publishing a perturbed path, we propose a novel scheme of
graph-based path publishing to protect the original path by embedding the path
in a graph that contains fake edges and replicated vertices applying the
differential privacy technique, such that only the legitimate users who have
the full knowledge of the network topology are able to recover the exact
vertices and edges of the original path with high probability. We theoretically
analyse the performance of our algorithm in differential privacy, utility, and
execution efficiency. We also conduct extensive experimental evaluations on a
high-performance cluster system to validate our analytical results.

the shortcomings of existing ones. Existing listwise learning-to-rank models
are generally derived from the classical Plackett-Luce model, which has three
major limitations. (1) Its permutation probabilities overlook ties, i.e., a
situation when more than one document has the same rating with respect to a
query. This can lead to imprecise permutation probabilities and inefficient
training because of selecting documents one by one. (2) It does not favor
documents having high relevance. (3) It has a loose assumption that sampling
documents at different steps is independent. To overcome the first two
limitations, we model ranking as selecting documents from a candidate set based
on unique rating levels in decreasing order. The number of steps in training is
determined by the number of unique rating levels. We propose a new loss
function and associated four models for the entire sequence of weighted
classification tasks by assigning high weights to the selected documents with
high ratings for optimizing Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To
overcome the final limitation, we further propose a novel and efficient way of
refining prediction scores by combining an adapted Vanilla Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) model with pooling given selected documents at previous steps. We
encode all of the documents already selected by an RNN model. In a single step,
we rank all of the documents with the same ratings using the last cell of the
RNN multiple times. We have implemented our models using three settings: neural
networks, neural networks with gradient boosting, and regression trees with
gradient boosting. We have conducted experiments on four public datasets. The

plasma to an error field when the plasma has weakly damped linear tearing modes
(TM's), stabilized by pressure gradient and favorable curvature. Favorable
curvature leads to the Glasser effect: the occurrence of real frequencies and
stabilization with positive stability index $\Delta'$. A cylinder with hollow
pressure is used to model the toroidal favorable curvature. Linear simulations
with rotation and an error field $\tilde{\psi}_w$ show, in agreement with
analytic results, that the peak reconnected flux occurs for a rotation rate
near the TM phase velocity. Nonlinear simulations with small $\tilde{\psi}_w$
show that the real frequency and stabilization by favorable average curvature
are masked by a nonlinear effect that occurs for very thin islands: flattening
of the pressure across the island, mainly due to sound wave propagation. This
flattening causes the disappearance of real frequencies destabilization of the
mode, allowing it to grow to large amplitude similar to a $\beta=0$ unstable
TM. The flattening of the current for larger islands saturates the mode
nonlinearly. In the post-saturation phase, the interaction of the error field
with the destabilized spontaneous tearing mode, which rotates with the plasma,
leads to oscillations in the Maxwell torque and therefore modulations in the
plasma rotation. The islands also rotate with modulated phase velocity,
undergoing small-amplitude oscillations due to these modulations. We also
present a quasilinear model with an unstable spontaneous TM and error fields,
showing that the superposition of these fields results in similar oscillations.

Beside its original application in the domain of constraint satisfaction
problems, the algorithm has since then found widespread adoption in areas as

of finding irreducible subsets on the one hand, and to QuickXPlain's general

by presenting an intelligible formal proof of it. Apart from showing the
correctness of the algorithm and excluding the later detection of errors (proof

e.g., (i) that the workings of the algorithm often become completely clear only
after studying, verifying and comprehending the proof (didactic effect), (ii)
the shown proof methodology can be used as a guidance for proving other
recursive algorithms (transfer effect), and (iii) the possibility of providing

that when the ratio of the channel conditional density r(y) = P(Y=y|X=0)/ P(Y

having a single threshold can maximize mutual information. Furthermore, we show
that an optimal quantizer (possibly with multiple thresholds) is the one with
the thresholding vector whose elements are all the solutions of r(y) = r* for
some constant r* > 0. Interestingly, the optimal constant r* is unique. This

subset of the giants in NGC 1817 (and in the similarly aged cluster NGC 6811)
have $\nu_{\rm max}$ and $\Delta \nu$ values at or near the maximum observed
for core helium burning stars, indicating they have core masses near the
minimum for fully non-degenerate helium ignition. Further asteroseismic study
of these stars can constrain the minimum helium core mass in red clump stars
and the physics that determines this limit.
  Two giant stars show photometric variations on timescales similar to
previously measured spectroscopic orbits. Thirteen systems in the field show
eclipses, but only five are probable cluster members.
  We identify 32 $\delta$ Sct pulsators, 27 $\gamma$ Dor candidates, and 7
hybrids that are probable cluster members, with most new detections. We used
the ensemble properties of the $\delta$ Sct stars to identify stars with
possible radial pulsation modes. Among the oddities we have uncovered are: an
eccentric orbit for a short-period binary containing a $\delta$ Sct pulsating
star; a rare subgiant within the Hertzsprung gap showing $\delta$ Sct
pulsations; and two hot $\gamma$ Dor pulsating star candidates.

redirection to the cloud, secure middlebox systems (e.g., BlindBox) draw much
attention; they can process encrypted packets against encrypted rules directly.
However, most of the existing systems supporting pattern matching based network
functions require the enterprise gateway to tokenise packet payloads via
sliding windows. Such tokenisation induces a considerable communication
overhead, which can be over 100$\times$ to the packet size. To overcome this
bottleneck, in this paper, we propose the first bandwidth-efficient encrypted
pattern matching protocol for secure middleboxes. We resort to a primitive
called symmetric hidden vector encryption (SHVE), and propose a variant of it,
aka SHVE+, to achieve constant and moderate communication cost. To speed up, we
devise encrypted filters to reduce the number of accesses to SHVE+ during
matching highly. We formalise the security of our proposed protocol and conduct
comprehensive evaluations over real-world rulesets and traffic dumps. The
results show that our design can inspect a packet over 20k rules within 100

the ""island of inversion"" and is an exotic, weakly bound system. Little is
known about this system beyond its two-neutron separation energy ($S_{2n}$)
with large uncertainties. A similar situation is found for the low-lying
spectrum of its unbound binary subsystem $^{28}$F.
  Purpose$\colon$ To investigate the configuration mixing, matter radius and
neutron-neutron correlations in the ground state of $^{29}$F within a
three-body model, exploring the possibility of $^{29}$F to be a two-neutron
halo nucleus.
  Method$\colon$ The $^{29}$F ground-state wave function is built within the
hyperspherical formalism by using an analytical transformed harmonic oscillator
basis. The Gogny-Pires-Tourreil (GPT) nn interaction with central, spin-orbit
and tensor terms is employed in the present calculations, together with
different core$+n$ potentials constrained by the available experimental
information on $^{28}$F.
  Results$\colon$ The $^{29}$F ground-state configuration mixing and its matter
radius are computed for different choices of the $^{28}$F structure and
$S_{2n}$ value. The admixture of d-waves with pf components are found to play
an important role, favoring the dominance of dineutron configurations in the
wave function. Our computed radii show a mild sensitivity to the $^{27}$F$+n$
potential and $S_{2n}$ values. The relative increase of the matter radius with
respect to the $^{27}$F core lies in the range 0.1-0.4 fm depending upon these
choices.
  Conclusions$\colon$ Our three-body results for $^{29}$F indicate the presence
of a moderate halo structure in its ground state, which is enhanced by larger
intruder components. This finding calls for an experimental confirmation.

assortative networks, the suppression is sustained producing an early
convergence to equilibrium. In highly disassortative networks, however, the
suppression effect diminishes over time due to scattering of non-vaccinating

This explanation is made more precise by a model in which the local
relationship between the order flow and the fundamental price (i.e. the local
price impact) is linear, with a constant slope, which makes the model
dynamically consistent. Nevertheless, the expected impact on midprice from a
large sequence of co-directional trades is nonlinear and asymptotically
concave. The main practical conclusion of the proposed explanation is that,
throughout a meta-order, the volumes at the best bid and ask prices change (on
average) in favor of the executor. This conclusion, in turn, relies on two more

automatically track which columns in a dataset have been used to derive the

information in the context of Python, the most common language used by data
scientists. We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance
from Python scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K
real data science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of
coverage, and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller
subset of manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and
recall range from 90.4% to 99.1% and its latency is in the order of
milliseconds for average size scripts. Drawing from our experience in deploying
ML models in production, we also present an example in which Vamsa helps
automatically identify models that are affected by data corruption issues.

Gurevich's behavioural theory of sequential algorithms (aka the sequential ASM

algorithms axiomatically, without referring to a particular machine model or
programming language, and showing that they are captured by (non-deterministic)
sequential Abstract State Machines (nd-seq ASMs). Moschovakis pointed out that
recursive algorithms such as mergesort are not covered by this theory. In this
article we propose an axiomatic definition of the notion of sequential
recursive algorithm which extends Gurevich's axioms for sequential algorithms
by a Recursion Postulate and allows us to prove that sequential recursive
algorithms are captured by recursive Abstract State Machines, an extension of
nd-seq ASMs by a CALL rule. Applying this recursive ASM thesis yields a
characterization of sequential recursive algorithms as finitely composed
concurrent algorithms all of whose concurrent runs are partial-order runs.

complexity of a given text were identified. Using a corpus of 6171 texts, which
had already been classified into three different levels of difficulty by ESL
experts, different experiments were conducted with five machine learning
algorithms. The results showed that the adopted linguistic features provide a
good overall classification performance (F-Score = 0.97). A scalability
evaluation was conducted to test if such a classifier could be used within real
applications, where it can be, for example, plugged into a search engine or a
web-scraping module. In this evaluation, the texts in the test set are not only
different from those from the training set but also of different types (ESL
texts vs. children reading texts). Although the overall performance of the
classifier decreased significantly (F-Score = 0.65), the confusion matrix shows
that most of the classification errors are between the classes two and three
(the middle-level classes) and that the system has a robust performance in
categorizing texts of class one and four. This behavior can be explained by the
difference in classification criteria between the two corpora. Hence, the
observed results confirm the usability of such a classifier within a real-world

approximately isotropically distributed over the whole sky, but the
last-generation UHECR detector arrays, the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and
the Telescope Array (TA), have detected thousands of events, allowing us to
study small deviations from isotropy. So far, Auger has detected a large-scale
anisotropy consistent with a $\sim 6.5\%$ dipole moment in the distribution of
cosmic rays with $E > 8$~EeV, and both collaborations have reported indications
for smaller-scale anisotropies at higher energies. On the other hand, neither
array has full-sky coverage, the Auger field of view being limited to
declinations $\delta < +45^\circ$ and the TA one to $\delta > -16^\circ$.
Searches for anisotropies with full-sky coverage thus require combining data
from both arrays. A working group with members from both collaborations has
been established for this task. Since even a minor systematic error in the
energy determinations at either of the arrays could result in a sizeable
spurious anisotropy along the north--south axis, we devised a method to
cross-calibrate the energy scales of the two experiments with respect to each
other by using events in a declination band within the intersection of their
fields of view. In this contribution, we report on both updates on blind
searches for anisotropies and the first full-sky studies of flux models based
on possible local extragalactic sources.

IB objective: $\text{IB}_\beta[p(z|x)] = I(X; Z) - \beta I(Y; Z)$ defined on
the encoding distribution p(z|x) for input $X$, target $Y$ and representation
$Z$, where sudden jumps of $dI(Y; Z)/d \beta$ and prediction accuracy are
observed with increasing $\beta$. We introduce a definition for IB phase
transitions as a qualitative change of the IB loss landscape, and show that the
transitions correspond to the onset of learning new classes. Using second-order
calculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides a practical condition
for IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information
matrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the
formula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of
maximum (nonlinear) correlation between $X$ and $Y$ orthogonal to the learned
representation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in
linear settings. Based on the theory, we present an algorithm for discovering
phase transition points. Finally, we verify that our theory and algorithm
accurately predict phase transitions in categorical datasets, predict the onset

image/video, is an open-set problem by nature, i.e., the number of population
can vary in [0, inf) in theory. However, collected data and labeled instances
are limited in reality, which means that only a small closed set is observed.
Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they
are prone to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the
closed set. In fact, counting has an interesting and exclusive
property---spatially decomposable. A dense region can always be divided until
sub-region counts are within the previously observed closed set. We therefore
introduce the idea of spatial divide-and-conquer (S-DC) that transforms
open-set counting into a closed-set problem. This idea is implemented by a
novel Supervised Spatial Divide-and-Conquer Network (SS-DCNet). Thus, SS-DCNet
can only learn from a closed set but generalize well to open-set scenarios via
S-DC. SS-DCNet is also efficient. To avoid repeatedly computing sub-region
convolutional features, S-DC is executed on the feature map instead of on the
input image. We provide theoretical analyses as well as a controlled experiment
on toy data, demonstrating why closed-set modeling makes sense. Extensive
experiments show that SS-DCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Code

Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) at the LR. To minimize the
received signal power at the LR, we consider the joint optimization of
magnitudes of reflection coefficients and discrete phase shifts at the IRS.
Based on the block coordinate descent, semidefinite relaxation, and Gaussian

simulation results, we show that by using the IRS-based jammer, we can reduce

be obtained from any possible state on two classical bits. In a resource
theoretic set-up, this feature of quantum systems can be interpreted as an
advantage in winning a two players co-operative game, which we call the
`non-monopolize social subsidy' game. It turns out that the quantum states
leading to the desired advantage must possess non-classicality in the form of
quantum discord. On the other hand, while distributing such sources of shared
randomness between two parties via noisy channels, quantum channels with zero
capacity as well as with classical capacity strictly less than unity perform
more efficiently than the perfect classical channel. Protocols presented here

  Motivated by the success of MaxSAT solvers over the past decade, recently
MaxSAT-based approach, called MLIC, was proposed that seeks to reduce the
problem of learning interpretable rules expressed in Conjunctive Normal Form
(CNF) to a MaxSAT query. While MLIC was shown to achieve accuracy similar to
that of other state of the art black-box classifiers while generating small
interpretable CNF formulas, the runtime performance of MLIC is significantly

sound framework for interpretable learning that can take advantage of MaxSAT
solvers while scaling to real-world instances?
  In this paper, we take a step towards answering the above question in
affirmation. We propose IMLI: an incremental approach to MaxSAT based framework

``overestimating"" the tidal parameter with the decreasing signal-to-noise ratio

prior (which is not well understood and has been assumed to be
widely-distributed) in the low SNR case. Though this effect is interesting, the
slightly higher SNR of H1 than L1 at frequencies above $\sim 100$ Hz is
most-likely not the main reason for the lower tidal parameter region favored by
H1. In view of the large fluctuation of the expected tide parameter in the case
of low SNR, the different probability distributions favored by the L1 and H1

smoothing to mitigate the potential negative consequences of the operation

periodically spaced non-identical quantums emitters coupled to a waveguide, in
the special case when the inter-atomic separation is a half-integral multiple
of the resonant wavelength, i.e. $kL$ is an integral multiple of $\pi$, with
$k$ being the spatial frequency and $L$ the spatial periodicity. When equal but
opposite frequency detunings are assigned in pairs to a system of even number
of atoms, perfect transmission ensues. When the chain size is odd, a similar
assignment leads to the disappearance of collective effects as the odd atom
determines the spectral behavior. We also manifest the robustness of these
features against dissipative effects and show, how the spectral behavior hinges
significantly on the relative detunings between the atoms as compared to the
decay rate. A key distinction from the phenomenon of Electromagnetically
Induced Transparency (EIT) is that in the waveguide case, the presence of an
intrinsic waveguide mediated phase coupling between the atoms strongly affects
the transport properties. Furthermore, while reciprocity in single-photon
transport does not generally hold due to the phase coupling, we observe an
interesting exception for $kL = n\pi$ at which the waveguide demonstrates
reciprocal behavior with regard to both the transmission and reflection
coefficients.

localization. DL's ability to extract features and to classify autonomously
makes it an attractive solution for fingerprint-based localization. These
solutions require frequent retraining of DL models with vast amounts of

collect labeled data at a centralized server. Recently, federated learning has
emerged as a practical concept in solving the privacy preservation issue of
crowdsourcing participants by performing model training at the edge devices in
a decentralized manner; the participants do not expose their data anymore to a

the oscillator critical frequency Fmax, threshold power and voltage, as well as
the time of current rise, on the switching structure size are obtained by
numerical simulation. The empirical dependence of the threshold voltage on the
switching region dimensions and film thickness is found. It is shown that, for
the VO2 channel sizes of 10*10 nm, Fmax can reach the value of 300 MHz at a

capacitive coupling, we revealed the dependence of the phase difference upon
synchronization on the coupling capacitance value. When the switches are scaled
down, the limiting time of synchronization is reduced to Ts ~13 {\mu}s, and the
number of oscillation periods for the entering to the synchronization mode
remains constant, Ns ~ 17. In the case of weak thermal coupling in the
synchronization mode, we observe in-phase behavior of oscillators, and there is
a certain range of parameters of the supply current, in which the
synchronization effect becomes possible. With a decrease in dimensions, a
decrease in the thermal coupling action radius is observed, which can vary in

new state, termed compressed PH-Pfaffian state by ""compressing"" the PH-Pfaffian

quasiparticles of the maximum avoidance from one another (or of the maximum

short range component of the Coulomb interaction, the ground state undergoes a
phase transition from the Pfaffian state to the compressed PH-Pfaffian state
before further entering into a gapless state. The low energy gapped excited

Particular attention is devoted to the band crossings. For this nucleus with
the Fermi surface high up in the $h_{11/2}$ shell, we conclude that except for
the paired AB and BC crossings in configurations with an even and odd number of

understood within the unpaired formalism. Especially, it means that above the
AB and BC crossings, the evolution with spin is described as a gradual
alignment of the spin vectors of the particles outside closed shells.
Consequently, the configurations can be characterized by the number of

when the particles undergo diffusive dynamics (passive case) and (ii)
run-and-tumble dynamics for each particle (active case). In analogy with
disordered systems, we consider the flux distribution both for the annealed and
the quenched initial conditions, for the passive and active particles. In the
annealed case, we show that, for arbitrary particle dynamics, the flux
distribution is a Poissonian with a mean $\mu(t)$ that we compute exactly in
terms of the Green's function of the single particle dynamics. For the quenched

distribution takes an anomalous large deviation form at large times $P_{\rm

tumbling and $v_0$ is the ballistic speed between two successive tumblings. In
this paper, we compute the rate function $\psi_{\rm RTP}(q)$ and show that it
is nontrivial. Our method also gives access to the probability of the rare
event that, at time $t$, there is no particle to the right of the origin. For
diffusive and run-and-tumble dynamics, we find that this probability decays

randomly associated with the elements through a random compartment element
mapping (CEM). Multiple CEM were simulated in parallel to investigate the
intrinsic randomness of the model. The model was confronted with experimental
data extracted from the literature and it was demonstrated that the model was
able to reproduce the dependence of the apparent moduli on the tensile
prestrain. It was also observed that the evolution of the apparent moduli was
predicted even if it was not an explicit input of the experimental dataset used
to identify the input parameters of the model. It was then deduced that the
shape of the hardening and the dependancy of moduli on the prestrain were two
manifestations of a single cause: the heterogeneous yield stress in DP steels.

mostly been studied in the case of ""dry"" active matter, where particle dynamics
are dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known
about systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to ""wet""
active matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modelled as
self-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged
hydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of
active systems. Their phenomenology is well-established: at sufficiently high
density of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many
individual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial
turbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective
motion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual
microswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here we
demonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of
microswimmers. We develop a kinetic theory that goes beyond the commonly used
mean-field assumption, and explicitly takes into account such correlations.
Notably, these can be computed exactly within our theory. We calculate the
fluid velocity variance, spatial and temporal correlation functions, the fluid
velocity spectrum, and the enhanced diffusivity of tracer particles. We find
that correlations are suppressed by particle self-propulsion, although the
mean-field behaviour is not restored even in the limit of very fast swimming.

of them belonging to the new $\gamma$-ray emitting MeV blazars. Thorough X-ray
analysis reveals spectral flattening at soft X-ray for three of these objects.
The source NVSS J151002$+$570243 also shows a peculiar re-hardening of the

emission model, this combination of hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays enables us to
determine the location of the Inverse Compton peak and to accurately constrain

we find that all six sources have jet powers exceeding accretion disk
luminosity, seemingly validating this positive correlation even beyond $z>3$.
Our six sources are found to have $10^9 \rm M_{\odot}$ black holes, further

in Organic Light Emitting Diodes. In practice, the presence of the transition
metals surrounded by carefully designed ligands allows the fine tuning of the
emission frequency as well as a good efficiency of the device. To support the
development of new compounds the experimental measurements are generally
compared with ab-initio calculation of the absorption and emission spectra. The
standard approach for these calculations is TDDFT with hybrid exchange and
correlation functional like the B3LYP. Due to the size of these compounds the
application of more complex quantum chemistry approaches can be challenging. In
this work we used Many Body Perturbation Theory approaches (in particular the
GW approximation with the Bethe-Salpeter equation) implemented in gaussian
basis sets, to calculate the quasiparticle properties and the adsorption
spectra of six cyclometalled Ir(III) complexes going behind TDDFT. In the
presented results we compared standard TDDFT simulation with BSE calculations
performed on top on perturbative G 0 W 0 and accounting for eigenvalue self
consistency. Moreover, in order to investigate in detail the effect of the DFT
starting point, we concentrate on Ir(ppy) 3 performing GW-BSE simulations
starting from different DFT exchange and correlation potentials.

are labeled by strings, has application in different fields, from data mining
to computational biology. Several variants of the problem have been considered,
depending on the fact that the match is exact or approximate and, in this
latter case, which edit operations are considered and where are allowed. In
this paper we present results on the complexity of the approximate matching
problem, where edit operations are symbol substitutions and are allowed only on
the graph labels or both on the graph labels and the query string. We introduce
a variant of the problem that asks whether there exists a path in a graph that
represents a query string with any number of edit operations and we show that
is is NP-complete, even when labels have length one and in the case the
alphabet is binary. Moreover, when it is parameterized by the length of the
input string and graph labels have length one, we show that the problem is
fixed-parameter tractable and it is unlikely to admit a polynomial kernel. The
NP-completeness of this problem leads to the inapproximability (within any
factor) of the approximate matching when edit operations are allowed only on
the graph labels. Moreover, we show that the variants of approximate string
matching to graph we consider are not fixed-parameter tractable, when the
parameter is the number of edit operations, even for graphs that have distance
one from a DAG. The reduction for this latter result allows us to prove the
inapproximability of the variant where edit operations can be applied both on
the query string and on graph labels.

in the zero-temperature limit, we obtain a well defined free energy. We have
shown that cancellations of divergent terms occur in the case of an infinite

gap. After 2011, the system went into a prolonged low state, continuing to
accrete at a low level. We present an accurate alias-free long-term orbital
ephemeris and report a highly significant period change by 10 ms that took
place over the time interval from 2011 to 2018. We acquired a high-quality
eclipse spectrum that shows the secondary star as a dM5-6 dwarf at a distance
$d = 1050 \pm 110$ pc. Based on phase-resolved cyclotron and Zeeman
spectroscopy, we identify the white dwarf (WD) in HY Eri as a two-pole accretor
with nearly opposite accretion spots of 28 and 30 MG. The Zeeman analysis of
the low state spectrum reveals a complex magnetic field structure, which we fit
by a multipole model. We detected narrow emission lines from the irradiated
face of the secondary star, of which Mg I $\lambda 5170$ with a radial velocity
amplitude of $K_2' = 139 \pm 10$ km/s (90% confidence) tracks the secondary
more reliably than the narrow H$\alpha$ line. Based on the combined dynamical
analysis and spectroscopic measurement of the angular radius of the WD, we
obtain a primary mass of $M_1 = 0.42 \pm 0.05$ $M_\odot$ (90% confidence
errors), identifying it as a probable He WD or hybrid HeCO WD. The secondary is
a main sequence star of $M_2 = 0.24 \pm 0.04$ $M_\odot$ that seems to be
slightly inflated. The large distance of HY Eri and the lack of similar systems
suggest a very low space density of polars with low-mass primary. According to
current theory, these systems are destroyed by induced runaway mass transfer,
suggesting that HY Eri may be doomed to destruction.

similar to the Milky Way curve at age $\sim$ 10 Gyr, in terms of the carbon
bump strength and the far-ultraviolet slope. We also apply our model to
starburst galaxies by shortening the star formation time-scale (0.5 Gyr) and
increasing the dense-gas fraction (0.9), finding that the extinction curve
maintains bumpless shapes (because of low aromatic fractions), which are
similar to the extinction curves observed in the Small Magellanic Cloud and

important input to address the well-being and comfort perceived by their

real-time indoor air quality data are monitored round the clock using sensors
and operating in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) environment. In this work, we
propose an air quality management system merging indoor air quality index
(IAQI) and humidex into an enhanced indoor air quality index (EIAQI) by using
sensor data on a real-time basis. Here, indoor air pollutant levels are
measured by a network of waspmote sensors while IAQI and humidex data are fused
together using an extended fractional-order Kalman filter (EFKF). According to
the obtained EIAQI, overall air quality alerts are provided in a timely fashion
for accurate prediction with enhanced performance against measurement noise and
nonlinearity. The estimation scheme is implemented by using the
fractional-order modeling and control (FOMCON) toolbox. A case study is
analysed to prove the effectiveness and validity of the proposed approach.

to be solved which are required to make practical and useful devices that can

photonic topological insulators with their topological edge state energies
spanning across the visible wavelength range including in the sub-500 nm

preserved six-fold rotational symmetry patterned on suspended SiNx membranes.
The experimentally measured energy-momentum dispersion of the topological

transport of the helical edge modes in real space is demonstrated by
successfully guiding circularly polarized light beams unidirectionally through
sharp kinks without major signal loss. This work paves the way for small

Radio Access Network (RAN) slice subnet, Network Function Virtualization (NFV)
enables the deployment of some of the gNB components as Virtual Networks
Functions (VNFs). Deploying individual VNF instances for these components could
guarantee the customization of each RAN slice subnet. However, due to the
multiplicity of VNFs, the required amount of virtual resources will be greater
compared to the case where a single VNF instance carries the aggregated traffic
of all the RAN slice subnets. Sharing gNB components between RAN slice subnets
could optimize the trade-off between customization, isolation and resource
utilization. In this article, we shed light on the key aspects in the Third
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)/NFV standards for sharing gNB components.
First, we identify four possible scenarios for sharing gNB components. Then, we
analyze the impact of sharing on the customization level of each RAN slice
subnet. Later, we determine the main factors that enable isolation between RAN
slice subnets. Finally, we propose a 3GPP/NFV-based description model to define

predictions of neural networks based on the softmax activation layer. In
existing work, this connection has been analyzed empirically, but it has never
before been mathematically derived. The softmax function partitions the
transformed input space into cones, each of which encompasses a class. This is
equivalent to putting a number of centroids in this transformed space at equal
distance from the origin, and k-means clustering the data points by proximity
to these centroids. Softmax only cares in which cone a data point falls, and
not how far from the centroid it is within that cone. We formally prove that
networks with a small Lipschitz modulus (which corresponds to a low
susceptibility to adversarial attacks) map data points closer to the cluster
centroids, which results in a mapping to a k-means-friendly space. To leverage
this knowledge, we propose Centroid Based Tailoring as an alternative to the
softmax function in the last layer of a neural network. The resulting Gauss
network has similar predictive accuracy as traditional networks, but is less
susceptible to one-pixel attacks; while the main contribution of this paper is
theoretical in nature, the Gauss network contributes empirical auxiliary
benefits.

wave packets, which are the unique family of one-dimensional
propagation-invariant pulsed optical beams. We observe `hybrid guided'
space-time modes that are index-guided in one transverse dimension in the film

spatio-temporal structure of the field. We demonstrate that these field
configurations enable overriding the boundary conditions by varying
post-fabrication the group index of the fundamental mode in a 2-$\mu$m-thick,

debated. Parker Solar Probe's (PSP's) second solar encounter provided a new
opportunity to relate in situ measurements of the nascent slow solar wind with
white-light images of streamer flows. We exploit data taken by the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory
(STEREO) and the Wide Imager on Solar Probe to reveal for the first time a
close link between imaged streamer flows and the high-density plasma measured
by the Solar Wind Electrons Alphas and Protons (SWEAP) experiment. We identify
different types of slow winds measured by PSP that we relate to the
spacecraft's magnetic connectivity (or not) to streamer flows. SWEAP measured
high-density and highly variable plasma when PSP was well connected to
streamers but more tenuous wind with much weaker density variations when it
exited streamer flows. STEREO imaging of the release and propagation of small
transients from the Sun to PSP reveals that the spacecraft was continually
impacted by the southern edge of streamer transients. The impact of specific
density structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic field reversals
measured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the
streamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals
originating outside streamers. We tentatively interpret these findings in terms
of magnetic reconnection between open magnetic fields and coronal loops with
different properties, providing support for the formation of a subset of the
slow wind by magnetic reconnection.

parameters with the ones obtained with ASPCAP for the same stellar spectra, and
find that the values agree within the expected uncertainties. A comparison with
the optical samples California Planet Survey, HARPS-GTO (High Accuracy Radial

Eras (WFE), for deleted memory blocks in wait-free concurrent data structures.
WFE's key innovation is that it is completely wait-free. Although some prior
techniques provide similar guarantees for certain data structures, they lack
support for arbitrary wait-free data structures. Consequently, developers are
typically forced to marry their wait-free data structures with lock-free Hazard
Pointers or (potentially blocking) epoch-based memory reclamation. Since both
these schemes provide weaker progress guarantees, they essentially forfeit the
strong progress guarantee of wait-free data structures. Though making the
original Hazard Pointers scheme or epoch-based reclamation completely wait-free
seems infeasible, we achieved this goal with a more recent, (lock-free) Hazard
Eras scheme, which we extend to guarantee wait-freedom. As this extension is
non-trivial, we discuss all challenges pertaining to the construction of
universal wait-free memory reclamation.
  WFE is implementable on ubiquitous x86_64 and AArch64 (ARM) architectures.
Its API is mostly compatible with Hazard Pointers, which allows easy
transitioning of existing data structures into WFE. Our experimental
evaluations show that WFE's performance is close to epoch-based reclamation and
almost matches the original Hazard Eras scheme, while providing the stronger
wait-free progress guarantee.

_n\leq \delta $ for some positive $\delta $. Under this assumption, if the
sequence $x_n$ converges to a critical point $z$, then with large values of $n$
the update will be small because $||x_{n+1}-x_n||\lesssim ||\nabla f(x_n)||$.
This may also force the sequence to converge to a bad minimum. If we can allow,
at least theoretically, that the learning rates $\delta _n$'s are not bounded,
then we may have better convergence to better minima.
  A previous joint paper by the author showed convergence for the usual version
of Backtracking GD under very general assumptions on the cost function $f$. In
this paper, we allow the learning rates $\delta _n$ to be unbounded, in the
sense that there is a function $h:(0,\infty)\rightarrow (0,\infty )$ such that
$\lim _{t\rightarrow 0}th(t)=0$ and $\delta _n\lesssim \max \{h(x_n),\delta \}$
satisfies Armijo's condition for all $n$, and prove convergence under the same
assumptions as in the mentioned paper. It will be shown that this growth rate
of $h$ is best possible if one wants convergence of the sequence $\{x_n\}$.

strongly compresses magnetospheric plasma and pushes it away. The

losses of these impulsively accelerated electrons. Evolution of the energy
budget of thermal and nonthermal components during the flare is analysed using

results suggest that (i) the flare geometry is consistent with a two-loop
morphology and the magnetic energy is likely released due to interaction
between these two loops; (ii) the released magnetic energy converted to the
nonthermal energy of accelerated electrons only, which is subsequently
converted to the thermal energy of the plasma; (iii) the energy is partitioned

learned knowledge in the source domain and transferring it to the target

in alleviating the distribution shift between the source and the target
domains. However, these methods assume an identical label space between the two
domains. This assumption imposes a significant limitation for real applications
since the target training set may not contain the complete set of classes. We
demonstrate in this paper that the performance of domain adversarial methods
can be vulnerable to an incomplete target label space during training. To
overcome this issue, we propose a two-stage unilateral alignment approach. The
proposed methodology makes use of the inter-class relationships of the source
domain and aligns unilaterally the target to the source domain. The benefits of
the proposed methodology are first evaluated on the MNIST$\rightarrow$MNIST-M
adaptation task. The proposed methodology is also evaluated on a fault
diagnosis task, where the problem of missing fault types in the target training
dataset is common in practice. Both experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed methodology.

of motion in the theory we find that the $(D-2)$-dimensional submanifold has to
admit constant triplet structures in which the torsion scalar is one of them.
This implies that these equations of motion can be simplified into a single
highly non-linear ordinary differential equation called the master equation.
Then, we show that in this case the solution admits at least a naked
singularity at the origin which is not a black hole. In the asymptotic region,
the spacetimes converge to spaces of constant scalar curvature which are
generally not Einstein. We also use perturbative method to linearize the master
equation and construct the first order solutions. At the end, we establish the

observed in AGN X-ray spectra. Presently there are two competitive models to
explain it: blurred ionized reflection and warm Comptonisation. In the latter
case, observations suggest a corona temperature $\sim$ 1 keV and a corona
optical depth $\sim$ 10. Moreover, radiative constraints from spectral fits
with Comptonisation models suggest that most of the accretion power should be
released in the warm corona. The disk below is basically non-dissipative,
radiating only the reprocessed emission from the corona. The true radiative
properties of such a warm and optically thick plasma are not well-known,
however. For instance, the importance of the Comptonisation process, the
potential presence of strong absorption/emission features or the spectral shape
of the output spectrum have been studied only very recently. We present in this
paper simulations of warm and optically thick coronae using the TITAN radiative
transfer code coupled with the NOAR Monte-Carlo code, the latter fully
accounting for Compton scattering of continuum and lines. Illumination from
above by a hard X-ray emission and from below by an optically thick accretion
disk is taken into account as well as (uniform) internal heating. Our
simulations show that for a large part of the parameter space, the warm corona
with sufficient internal mechanical heating is dominated by Compton cooling and
neither strong absorption nor emission lines are present in the outgoing
spectra. In a smaller part of the parameter space, the calculated emission
agrees with the spectral shape of the observed soft X-ray excess. Remarkably,
this also corresponds to the conditions of radiative equilibrium of an extended
warm corona covering almost entirely a non-dissipative accretion disk. These
results confirm the warm Comptonisation as a valuable model for the soft X-ray
excess.

in fracture-intersections. The main characteristic of the method is the
immersion of the fracture, modelled as a linear elastic solid, in the
surrounding computational fluid domain, modelled with the incompressible Navier
Stokes equations. The fluid and the solid problems are coupled with variational
transfer operators. Variational transfer operators are also used to solve
contact within the fracture using a dual mortar approach and to generate
problem specific fluid meshes. With respect to our applications, the key
features of the method are the usage of different finite element
discretizations for the solid and the fluid problem and the automatically
generated representation of the fluid-solid boundary. We demonstrate that the
presented methodology resolves small-scale roughness on the fracture surface,
while capturing fluid flow field changes during mechanical loading. Starting
with 2D/3D benchmark simulations of intersected fractures, we end with an
intersected fracture composed of complex fracture surface topographies, which
are in contact under increasing loads. The contributions of this article are:

of NW lasers is characterised, binned by threshold energy density and
subsequently printed in arrays onto a secondary substrate. Statistical analysis

highly directional links to overcome severe pathloss in these frequency bands.
Establishing such links requires the mutual discovery of the transmitter and
the receiver %in the angular domain potentially leading to a large latency and
high energy consumption. In this work, we show that both the discovery latency
and energy consumption can be significantly reduced by using fully digital
front-ends. In fact, we establish that by reducing the resolution of the
fully-digital front-ends we can achieve lower energy consumption compared to
both analog and high-resolution digital beamformers. Since beamforming through
analog front-ends allows sampling in only one direction at a time, the mobile
device is ''on'' for a longer time compared to a digital beamformer which can
get spatial samples from all directions in one shot. We show that the energy
consumed by the analog front-end can be four to six times more than that of the
digital front-ends, depending on the size of the employed antenna arrays. We
recognize, however, that using fully digital beamforming post beam discovery,
i.e., for data transmission, is not viable from a power consumption standpoint.
To address this issue, we propose the use of digital beamformers with
low-resolution analog to digital converters (4 bits). This reduction in
resolution brings the power consumption to the same level as analog beamforming
for data transmissions while benefiting from the spatial multiplexing
capabilities of fully digital beamforming, thus reducing initial discovery
latency and improving energy efficiency.

field. In this work, we systematically develop a perturbative method to compute
the deflection angle of rays with general velocity $v$ in arbitrary static and
spherically symmetric spacetimes and in equatorial plane of arbitrary static

approach $x_0$ limit depends on the asymptotic behavior of the metric functions
only, and the generated integrand is always integrable, resulting in a
deflection angle in a series form of either $x_0$ or $b$, the impact parameter.
Using this method, the deflection angles as series of both $x_0$ and $b$ are
found in Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m and Kerr-Newman spacetimes to
17-th, 15-th and 6-th orders respectively, for both lightrays and particles

spacetimes whose metric functions are only asymptotically known, the deflection
angle in the weak field limit can also be calculated. Furthermore, it is shown
that the deflection angle in general static and spherically symmetric spacetime

non-trivial order, depends only on the impact parameter, velocity of the
particle, and the effective ADM mass of the spacetime but not on other
parameters such as charge or angular momentum. These deflection angles are used
in an exact gravitational lensing equation and the corresponding apparent

avoid the high cost and circuit complexity of fully-digital SM, we mainly
consider the hybrid SM system with a hybrid precoding transmitter architecture,
combining a digital precoder and an analog precoder. Here, the
partially-connected structure is adopted with each radio frequency chain (RF)
being connected to a transmit antenna subarray (TAS). In such a system, we made
an investigation of secure hybrid precoding and transmit antenna subarray
selection (TASS) methods. Two hybrid precoding methods, called maximizing the
approximate secrecy rate (SR) via gradient ascent (Max-ASR-GA) and maximizing
the approximate SR via alternating direction method of multipliers
(Max-ASR-ADMM), are proposed to improve the SR performance. As for TASS, a
high-performance method of maximizing the approximate SR (Max-ASR) TASS method
is first presented. To reduce its high complexity, two low-complexity TASS
methods, namely maximizing the eigenvalue (Max-EV) and maximizing the product
of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and artificial

results will demonstrate that the proposed Max-ASR-GA and Max-ASR-ADMM hybrid

The reason is that a formal condition of the applicability of the RLE is not

to infinity. The present numerical study demonstrates that, for large friction,
the decay rate calculated using the RLE agrees with the rate resulting from the

4.0. For the industrial environments, the wireless networks are more suitable
mainly due to their great flexibility, low deployment cost and for being less
invasive. Although new wireless protocols are emerging or being updated,
changes in existing industries generally can lead to large expenditures. As the
well known and accepted IEEE 802.11g standard, mostly used in residential and
commercial applications, has a low deployment and maintenance cost, many
industries also decide to adopt it. In this scenario, there is a need to
evaluate the signal quality to better design the network infrastructure in
order to obtain good communication coverage. In this work, we present a
practical study about the 802.11g signal strength in a thermoelectric power
plant. We collected signal strength values in different points along the engine
room and compared our measured values with the estimated ones through the
Log-Distance Path Loss model. We concluded that it is possible to use this
model in an industrial environment to estimate signal strength with a low error
by choosing the right propagation (path loss) exponent.

transition in gravity, and we argue that the existence of the critical
dimension is qualitatively consistent with it. Besides, in the first order
transition case, a stable phase having negative specific heat appears in the
microcanonical ensemble, which is similar to Schwarzschild black holes. We

queueing models at the large deviations (LD) scale. These tools are based on
the recently introduced robust R\'enyi bounds, which provide LD estimates (and
more generally risk-sensitive (RS) cost estimates) that hold uniformly over an
uncertainty class of models, provided that the class is defined in terms of
R\'enyi divergence with respect to a reference model and that estimates are
available for the reference model. One very attractive quality of the approach
is that the class to which the estimates apply may consist of hard models, such
as highly non-Markovian models and ones for which the LD principle is not
available. Our treatment provides exact expressions as well as bounds on the
R\'enyi divergence rate on families of marked point processes, including as a
special case renewal processes. Another contribution is a general result that
translates robust RS control problems, where robustness is formulated via
R\'enyi divergence, to finite dimensional convex optimization problems, when
the control set is a finite dimensional convex set. The implications to
queueing are vast, as they apply in great generality. This is demonstrated on
two non-Markovian queueing models. One is the multiclass single-server queue
considered as a RS control problem, with scheduling as the control process and
exponential weighted queue length as cost. The second is the many-server queue
with reneging, with the probability of atypically large reneging count as
performance criterion. As far as LD analysis is concerned, no robust estimates
or non-Markovian treatment were previously available for either of these
models.

model parameter inference can be a computation-intensive work, which makes it
hard to perform a direct one-stage model parameter inference by using MCMC
sampling method in Bayesian framework. Instead, a two-stage inference is
usually used, i.e., the parameters of some characteristic points on the EoR
spectrum model are first estimated, which are then used as the input to
estimate physical model parameters further. However, some previous works had
noticed that this kind of method could bias results, and it could be meaningful
to answer the question of whether it is feasible to perform direct one-stage
MCMC sampling and obtain unbiased physical model parameter estimations. In this
work, we studied this problem and confirmed the feasibility. We find that
unbiased estimations to physical model parameters can be obtained with a
one-stage direct MCMC sampling method. We also study the influence of some
factors that should be considered in practical observations to model parameter
inference. We find that a very tiny amplifier gain calibration error ($10^{-5}$
relative error) with complex spectral structures can significantly bias the
parameter estimation; the frequency-dependent antenna beam and geographical
position can also influence the results, so that should be carefully handled.

considerable attention in several domains, especially in machine learning with
the so-called multitask learning problem or learning to learn problem [1], [2].
Multitask learning is an approach to inductive transfer learning (using what is
learned for one problem to assist in another problem) and helps improve
generalization performance relative to learning each task separately by using
the domain information contained in the training signals of related tasks as an
inductive bias. Several strategies have been derived within this community
under the assumption that all data are available beforehand at a fusion center.
However, recent years have witnessed an increasing ability to collect data in a
distributed and streaming manner. This requires the design of new strategies
for learning jointly multiple tasks from streaming data over distributed (or
networked) systems. This article provides an overview of multitask strategies
for learning and adaptation over networks. The working hypothesis for these
strategies is that agents are allowed to cooperate with each other in order to
learn distinct, though related tasks. The article shows how cooperation steers
the network limiting point and how different cooperation rules allow to promote
different task relatedness models. It also explains how and when cooperation
over multitask networks outperforms non-cooperative strategies.

human experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's

making, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to
optimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately
\textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when
to trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply
their knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely
to perform poorly. This research conducts a case study of AI-assisted decision
making in which humans and AI have comparable performance alone, and explores
whether features that reveal case-specific model information can calibrate
trust and improve the joint performance of the human and AI. Specifically, we
study the effect of showing confidence score and local explanation for a
particular prediction. Through two human experiments, we show that confidence
score can help calibrate people's trust in an AI model, but trust calibration
alone is not sufficient to improve AI-assisted decision making, which may also
depend on whether the human can bring in enough unique knowledge to complement
the AI's errors. We also highlight the problems in using local explanation for

bacteria. Although the structure of mitochondrial complex I is similar to that
of hydrogenase, whether it has hydrogen metabolic activity remain unclear.
Here, we show that a H2 evolving activity exists in higher plants mitochondria
and is closely related to complex I, especially around ubiquinone binding site.
The H2 production could be inhibited by rotenone and ubiquinone. Hypoxia could
simultaneously promote H2 evolution and succinate accumulation. Redox
properties of quinone pool, adjusted by NADH or succinate according to oxygen
concentration, acts as a valve to control the flow of protons and electrons and
the production of H2. The coupling of H2 evolving activity of mitochondrial
complex I with metabolic regulation reveals a more effective redox homeostasis
regulation mechanism. Considering the ubiquity of mitochondria in eukaryotes,
H2 metabolism might be the innate function of higher organisms. This may serve
to explain, at least in part, the broad physiological effects of H2.

said to be ""moment-indeterminate"", or ""M-indeterminate"". Determining whether or
not a density is M-indeterminate, or how to generate an M-indeterminate
density, is a challenging problem with a long history. Quantum mechanics is
inherently probabilistic, yet the way in which probability densities are
obtained is dramatically different in comparison to standard probability
theory, involving complex wave functions and operators, among other aspects.
Nevertheless, the end results are standard probabilistic quantities, such as
expectation values, moments and probability density functions. We show that the
quantum mechanics procedure to obtain densities leads to a simple method to
generate an infinite number of M-indeterminate densities. Different
self-adjoint operators can lead to new classes of M-indeterminate densities.
Depending on the operator, the method can produce densities that are of the
Stieltjes class or new formulations that are not of the Stieltjes class. As
such, the method complements and extends existing approaches and opens up new
avenues for further development. The method applies to continuous and discrete
probability densities. A number of examples are given.

Individual electron-encoded artificial atoms either formed by impurities or

for large-distance exchange of information have not yet been isolated in such a
prevailing semiconductor. Here we show the isolation of single optically-active

accommodate point defects optically isolable at single scale, like in
wide-bandgap semiconductors. This work opens numerous perspectives for

computational comparative genomics over the last 25 years. Substantial results
include the polynomial-time computability of the inversion distance by
Hannenhalli and Pevzner in 1995 and the introduction of the double-cut and join
(DCJ) distance by Yancopoulos et al. in 2005. Both results, however, rely on
the assumption that the genomes under comparison contain the same set of unique
markers (syntenic genomic regions, sometimes also referred to as genes). In
2015, Shao, Lin and Moret relax this condition by allowing for duplicate
markers in the analysis. This generalized version of the genomic distance
problem is NP-hard, and they give an ILP solution that is efficient enough to
be applied to real-world datasets. A restriction of their approach is that it
can be applied only to balanced genomes, that have equal numbers of duplicates
of any marker. Therefore it still needs a delicate preprocessing of the input
data in which excessive copies of unbalanced markers have to be removed.
  In this paper we present an algorithm solving the genomic distance problem
for natural genomes, in which any marker may occur an arbitrary number of
times. Our method is based on a new graph data structure, the multi-relational
diagram, that allows an elegant extension of the ILP by Shao, Lin and Moret to
count runs of markers that are under- or over-represented in one genome with
respect to the other and need to be inserted or deleted, respectively. With
this extension, previous restrictions on the genome configurations are lifted,
for the first time enabling an uncompromising rearrangement analysis. Any
marker sequence can directly be used for the distance calculation.
  The evaluation of our approach shows that it can be used to analyze genomes
with up to a few ten thousand markers, which we demonstrate on simulated and
real data.

curves (CTCs), which theoretically would allow an observer to travel back in
time and interact with their past self. This raises the question of whether
this could create a grandfather paradox, in which the observer interacts in
such a way to prevent their own time travel. Previous research has proposed a
framework for deterministic, reversible, dynamics compatible with non-trivial
time travel, where observers in distinct regions of spacetime can perform
arbitrary local operations with no contradiction arising. However, only
scenarios with up to three regions have been fully characterised, revealing
only one type of process where the observers can verify to both be in the past
and future of each other. Here we extend this characterisation to an arbitrary
number of regions and find that there exist several inequivalent processes that
can only arise due to non-trivial time travel. This supports the view that
complex dynamics is possible in the presence of CTCs, compatible with free
choice of local operations and free of inconsistencies.

that builds parts in a layer-by-layer fashion out of a bed of metal powder via
the selective melting action of a laser or electron beam heat source. The
technology has become widespread, however the demand is growing for closed loop
process monitoring and control in PBF systems to replace the open loop
architectures that exist today. Controls-based models have potential to satisfy
this demand by utilizing computationally tractable, simplified models while
also decreasing the error associated with these models. This paper introduces a
controls theoretic analysis of the PBF process, demonstrating models of PBF
that are asymptotically stable, stabilizable, and detectable. We show that
linear models of PBF are structurally controllable and structurally observable,
provided that any portion of the build is exposed to the energy source and
measurement, we provide conditions for which time-invariant PBF models are
classically controllable/observable, and we demonstrate energy requirements for
performing state estimation and control for time-invariant systems. This paper
therefore presents the foundation for an effective means of realizing closed
loop PBF quality control.

Italian high school students and of 59 international researchers in STEM are
reconstructed through forma mentis networks, i.e., cognitive networks of
concepts connected by free associations and enriched with sentiment labels. The
layout of conceptual associations between positively/negatively/neutrally
perceived concepts is informative on how people build their own mental
constructs or beliefs about specific topics. Researchers displayed mixed
positive/neutral mental representations of ``teacher'', ``student'' and,
``scientist''. Students' conceptual associations of ``scientist'' were highly
positive and largely non-stereotypical, although links about the ``mad
scientist'' stereotype persisted. Students perceived ``teacher'' as a complex
figure, associated with positive aspects like mentoring/knowledge transmission
but also to negative sides revolving around testing and grading. ``School''
elicited stronger differences between the two groups. In the students' mindset,
``school'' was surrounded by a negative emotional aura or set of associations,
indicating an anxious perception of the school setting, mixing scholastic
concepts, anxiety-eliciting words, STEM disciplines like maths and physics, and
exam-related notions. Researchers' positive stance of ``school'' included
concepts of fun, friendship, and personal growth instead. Along the perspective
of Education Research, the above results are discussed as quantitative evidence
for test- and STEM anxiety co-occurring in the way Italian students perceive
education places and their actors. Detecting these patterns in student
populations through forma mentis networks offers new, simple to gather yet

wide concern. In this paper, a decentralized spectrum allocation approach is
presented to avoid mutual interference among automotive radars. Although
decentralized spectrum allocation has been extensively studied in cognitive
radio sensor networks, two challenges are observed for automotive sensors using
radar. First, the allocation approach should be dynamic as all radars are
mounted on moving vehicles. Second, each radar does not communicate with the
others so it has quite limited information. A machine learning technique,
reinforcement learning, is utilized because it can learn a decision making
policy in an unknown dynamic environment. As a single radar observation is
incomplete, a long short-term memory recurrent network is used to aggregate
radar observations through time so that each radar can learn to choose a
frequency subband by combining both the present and past observations.
Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the proposed approach with
other common spectrum allocation methods such as the random and myopic policy,
indicating that our approach outperforms the others.

channel and the channel between legitimate users) can decrypt the information
data under the same condition as the legitimate receiver. We study the

eavesdropper in a more generalized scheme when an arbitrary precoder at the
transmitter is employed. On the negative side, we show that if the eavesdropper
uses a number of receive antennas much larger than the number of legitimate
user antennas, then there is no advantage, independent of the precoding scheme
employed at the transmitter. On the positive side, for the case where the
adversary is limited to have the same number of antennas as legitimate users,
we give an $O\left(n^2\right)$ upper bound on the advantage and show that this
bound can be approached using an inverse precoder. For the second cryptosystem,

learning can or cannot learn in poly-time. A universality result is proved for
SGD-based deep learning and a non-universality result is proved for GD-based
deep learning; this also gives a separation between SGD-based deep learning and
statistical query algorithms:
  (1) {\it Deep learning with SGD is efficiently universal.} Any function
distribution that can be learned from samples in poly-time can also be learned
by a poly-size neural net trained with SGD on a poly-time initialization with
poly-steps, poly-rate and possibly poly-noise.
  Therefore deep learning provides a universal learning paradigm: it was known
that the approximation and estimation errors could be controlled with poly-size
neural nets, using ERM that is NP-hard; this new result shows that the
optimization error can also be controlled with SGD in poly-time. The picture
changes for GD with large enough batches:
  (2) {\it Result (1) does not hold for GD:} Neural nets of poly-size trained
with GD (full gradients or large enough batches) on any initialization with
poly-steps, poly-range and at least poly-noise cannot learn any function
distribution that has super-polynomial {\it cross-predictability,} where the
cross-predictability gives a measure of ``average'' function correlation --
relations and distinctions to the statistical dimension are discussed. In
particular, GD with these constraints can learn efficiently monomials of degree
$k$ if and only if $k$ is constant.
  Thus (1) and (2) point to an interesting contrast: SGD is universal even with
some poly-noise while full GD or SQ algorithms are not (e.g., parities).

terms of computation and energy. The development of such approaches is among
the major challenges in current machine learning research and key to ensure a
smooth transition of machine learning technology from a scientific environment
with virtually unlimited computing resources into everyday's applications. In
this article, we provide an overview of the current state of the art of machine
learning techniques facilitating these real-world requirements. In particular,
we focus on deep neural networks (DNNs), the predominant machine learning
models of the past decade. We give a comprehensive overview of the vast
literature that can be mainly split into three non-mutually exclusive
categories: (i) quantized neural networks, (ii) network pruning, and (iii)
structural efficiency. These techniques can be applied during training or as
post-processing, and they are widely used to reduce the computational demands
in terms of memory footprint, inference speed, and energy efficiency. We also
briefly discuss different concepts of embedded hardware for DNNs and their
compatibility with machine learning techniques as well as potential for energy
and latency reduction. We substantiate our discussion with experiments on
well-known benchmark datasets using compression techniques (quantization,
pruning) for a set of resource-constrained embedded systems, such as CPUs, GPUs
and FPGAs. The obtained results highlight the difficulty of finding good
trade-offs between resource efficiency and predictive performance.

novel loss term inspired by knowledge distillation, by explicitly constraining
the KL-divergence of our derived prediction distributions between modalities.
We have extensively validated our approach on two multi-class segmentation

machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed
material behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However,
learning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity,
is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling
framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning
based hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network
(FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed
by using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward
Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the
accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the
plasticity model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity
is collected from different loading-unloading paths based on the concept of
sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress
sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient
sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by
multiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output,
which leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the
machine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent
matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen. The
effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a

$A$ together with three constants and a ternary operation. In the case of the
closed unit interval $A=[0,1]$, the three constants are 0, 1 and 1/2 while the
ternary operation is $p(x,y,z)=x-yx+yz$. A mobility space is a set $X$ together
with a map $q\colon{X\times A\times X\to X}$ with the meaning that $q(x,t,y)$
indicates the position of a particle moving from point $x$ to point $y$ at the

is thus defined with respect to a mobility algebra, in the same way as a module

light on the issue notably by looking at other dimension of macroeconomic
stability than the ones usually employed in previous studies as well as by
examining other factors that might accentuate or diminish the effects of
decentralization on macroeconomic stability. Our results found that
decentralization appears to lead to a decrease in inflation rate. However, we
do not find any correlation between decentralization with the level of fiscal
deficit. Our results also show that the impact of decentralization on inflation
is conditional on the level of perceived corruption and political institutions.

Traditionally and even today this process has been carried out manually. Humans

the limit of infinitely many input data. This leads to a Vlasov-type partial

two-step process: (i) reconstruct line integrals of the material densities from
the available energy measurements; and (ii) reconstruct densities from their
line integrals. Step (ii) is the standard linear x-ray CT problem whose
invertibility is well-known, so this paper focuses on step (i). We show that
ME-CT admits stable, global inversion provided that (a well-chosen linear

almost every life aspect; traditional devices are becoming connected,
ubiquitous, pervasive, wireless, context-aware, smart, controlled through
mobile solutions, to name but a few. IoT devices can now be found in our
apartments, places of work, cars, buildings, and in almost every aspect of
life. In this investigation, we propose an IoT system Development Model (IDM).
The proposed IDM enables the development of IoT systems from concept to
prototyping. The model comprises concept refinement pyramids, decision trees,
realistic constraint lists, architecture and organization diagrams,
communication interface patterns, use cases, and menus of analysis metrics and
evaluation indicators. The investigation confirms that the proposed model
enjoys several properties, such as, clarity, conciseness, thoroughness,
productivity, etc. The model is deployed for a variety of systems that belong
to heterogeneous areas of application; the model is proven to be effective in
application and successful in integrating mobile solutions. This chapter
includes the presentation of the IDM submodels, the reasoning about their
usefulness, and the technical developments of several systems. The chapter
includes thorough discussions, analysis of the model usability and application,
and in-depth evaluations.

synaptic weights to update postsynaptic neurons. This limits parallelism and
becomes a bottleneck for hardware.
  We present an approach for spike propagation based on a probabilistic
interpretation of weights, thus reducing memory accesses and updates. We study
the effects of introducing randomness into the spike processing, and show on
benchmark networks that this can be done with minimal impact on the recognition
accuracy.
  We present an architecture and the trade-offs in accuracy on fully connected
and convolutional networks for the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets on the Xilinx
Zynq platform.

lack of planning can have vast impacts on a patient's well-being, the
well-being of her family, and the medical community as a whole. Advance Care
Planning (ACP) has been a field in the United States for a half-century. Many
modern techniques prompting patients to think about end of life (EOL) involve
short surveys or questionnaires. Different surveys are targeted to different
populations (based off of likely disease progression or cultural factors, for
instance), are designed with different intentions, and are administered in
different ways. There has been recent work using technology to increase the
number of people using advance care planning tools. However, modern techniques
from machine learning and artificial intelligence could be employed to make
additional changes to the current ACP process. In this paper we will discuss
some possible ways in which these tools could be applied. We will discuss
possible implications of these applications through vignettes of patient
scenarios. We hope that this paper will encourage thought about appropriate
applications of artificial intelligence in ACP as well as implementation of AI
in order to ensure intentions are honored.

  dosimetry in cell cultures","20 pages, including Supplementary Materials",,,,"q-bio.TO q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Potential human and environmental hazards resulting from the exposure of
living organisms to silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) have been the subject of
intensive discussion in the last decade. Despite the growing use of Ag NPs in
biomedical applications, a quantification of the toxic effects as a function of
the total silver mass reaching cells (namely, target cell dose) is still
needed. To provide a more accurate dose-response analysis, we propose a novel
integrated approach combining well-established computational and experimental
methodologies. We first used the particokinetic model (ISD3) proposed by Thomas
and colleagues (2018) for providing experimental validation of computed Ag NP
sedimentation in static-cuvette experiments. After validation, ISD3 was
employed to predict the total mass of silver reaching human endothelial cells
and hepatocytes cultured in 96 well plates. Cell viability measured after 24h
of culture was then related to this target cell dose. Our results show that the
dose perceived by the cell monolayer after 24 h of exposure is around 85% lower
than the administered nominal media concentration. Therefore, accurate
dosimetry considering particle characteristics and experimental conditions
(e.g., time, size and shape of wells) should be employed for better
interpreting effects induced by the amount of silver reaching cells.

Dark Universe 27(2020)100436",,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we formulate an analytic expression of the greybody factor for
the Kerr-Newman black hole in the presence of the quintessential field.
Primarily, we analyze the profile of effective potential by transforming the
radial equation of motion into standard Schr$\ddot{o}$dinger form through
tortoise coordinate. The two asymptotic solutions, in the form of
hypergeometric functions, are computed at distinct radial regions such as a
black hole and cosmological horizons determined by the quintessence. To extend
the viability over the whole radial regime, we match the analytical solutions
smoothly in an intermediate region by using a semi-classical approach. We also
calculate the emission rates and absorption cross-section for the massless
scalar fields to elaborate on the significance of our result. It is found that
the electromagnetic force together with the gravitational pull of the black
hole maximizes the effective potential and consequently, decreases the emission
process of scalar field particles.

They
convert alternating current into direct one by allowing unidirectional charge
flows. In analogy to the current-flow rectification for itinerary electrons,
here, a polar rectification that based on the localized oxygen vacancies (OVs)
in a Ti/fatigued-SrTiO3 (fSTO) Schottky junction is first demonstrated. The
fSTO with OVs is produced by an electro-degradation process. The different
movability of localized OVs and itinerary electrons in the fSTO yield a
unidirectional electric polarization at the interface of the junction under the
coaction of external and built-in electric fields. Moreover, the fSTO displays
a pre-ferroelectric state located between paraelectric and ferroelectric
phases. The pre-ferroelectric state has three sub-states and can be easily
driven into a ferroelectric state by external electric field. These
observations open up opportunities for potential polar devices and may underpin
many useful polar-triggered electronic phenomena.
