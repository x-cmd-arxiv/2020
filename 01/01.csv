Mathematical Society} published an essay critical of the use of diversity
statements in academic hiring. The publication of this essay prompted many
responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical
sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was
published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a
study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing
approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of
signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or
members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with
respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic
institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather,
asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of
individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at
highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically
against diversity statements, calling them ""a mistake,"" and claiming that their
usage during early stages of faculty hiring ""diminishes mathematical
achievement."" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories
who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly
inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities. Our
empirical results are consistent with theories of power drawn from the social
sciences.

attacks, suffer from them, defend against them, and sometimes even cause them.
This article is a concise tutorial on the large subject of networks and
security, written for all those interested in networking, whether their
specialty is security or not. To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and
organization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, although
mechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they are all instances
of a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic classification of security
attacks, the main sections of the tutorial cover the four patterns for
providing network security, of which the familiar three are cryptographic
protocols, packet filtering, and dynamic resource allocation. Although
cryptographic protocols hide the data contents of packets, they cannot hide
packet headers. When users need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which
may include the network from which they are receiving service, they must resort
to the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective comes
from the observation that security mechanisms interact in important ways, with
each other and with other aspects of networking, so each pattern includes a
discussion of its interactions.

components of many systems such as ecosystems. A bipartite graph is a set of
$n$ nodes that is decomposed into two disjoint subsets, having $m$ and $n-m$
vertices each, such that there are no adjacent vertices within the same set.
The connectivity between both sets, which is the relevant quantity in terms of
connections, can be quantified by a parameter $\alpha\in[0,1]$ that equals the
ratio of existent adjacent pairs over the total number of possible adjacent
pairs. Here, we study the spectral and localization properties of such random
bipartite graphs. Specifically, within a Random Matrix Theory (RMT) approach,
we identify a scaling parameter $\xi\equiv\xi(n,m,\alpha)$ that fixes the
localization properties of the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrices of random
bipartite graphs. We also show that, when $\xi<1/10$ ($\xi>10$) the
eigenvectors are localized (extended), whereas the
localization--to--delocalization transition occurs in the interval
$1/10<\xi<10$. Finally, given the potential applications of our findings, we
round off the study by demonstrating that for fixed $\xi$, the spectral
properties of our graph model are also universal.

distribution $P_n$ of layer sizes and densities. When $m$ grows linearly and
$P_n \to P$ as $n \to \infty$, the model generates sparse random graphs with a
rich statistical structure, admitting a nonvanishing clustering coefficient
together with a limiting degree distribution and clustering spectrum with
tunable power-law exponents. Remarkably, the model admits parameter regimes in
which bond percolation exhibits two phase transitions: the first related to the
emergence of a giant connected component, and the second to the appearance of
gigantic single-layer components.

actions in reinforcement learning. In particular, the option-critic
architecture provides general purpose policy gradient theorems for learning
actions from scratch that are extended in time. However, past work makes the
key assumption that each of the components of option-critic has independent
parameters. In this work we note that while this key assumption of the policy
gradient theorems of option-critic holds in the tabular case, it is always
violated in practice for the deep function approximation setting. We thus
reconsider this assumption and consider more general extensions of
option-critic and hierarchical option-critic training that optimize for the
full architecture with each update. It turns out that not assuming parameter
independence challenges a belief in prior work that training the policy over
options can be disentangled from the dynamics of the underlying options. In
fact, learning can be sped up by focusing the policy over options on states
where options are actually likely to terminate. We put our new algorithms to
the test in application to sample efficient learning of Atari games, and
demonstrate significantly improved stability and faster convergence when
learning long options.

the convergence of the end-to-end network. We achieve superior EDoF imaging
performance compared to the state of the art, where we demonstrate results with
minimal artifacts in various scenarios, including deep 3D scenes and broadband

genetics, including directed evolution for improving the activity of molecules
and enzymes, in breeding experiments in animals and in plants, and in devising
public health strategies to suppress evolving pathogens. An optimal
intervention to direct evolution should be designed by considering its impact
over an entire stochastic evolutionary trajectory that follows. As a result, a
seemingly suboptimal intervention at a given time can be globally optimal as it
can open opportunities for desirable actions in the future. Here, we propose a
feedback control formalism to devise globally optimal artificial selection
protocol to direct the evolution of molecular phenotypes. We show that
artificial selection should be designed to counter evolutionary tradeoffs among
multi-variate phenotypes to avoid undesirable outcomes in one phenotype by
imposing selection on another. Control by artificial selection is challenged by
our ability to predict molecular evolution. We develop an information
theoretical framework and show that molecular time-scales for evolution under
natural selection can inform how to monitor a population in order to acquire
sufficient predictive information for an effective intervention with artificial
selection. Our formalism opens a new avenue for devising artificial selection
methods for directed evolution of molecular functions.

algorithms for problems that could not be solved by existing frameworks. To
support this claim and illustrate the technique we include output-polynomial
algorithms for several problems for which output-polynomial algorithms were not
known, including the enumeration of Maximal Bipartite Subgraphs, Maximal
k-Degenerate Subgraphs (for bounded k), Maximal Induced Chordal Subgraphs, and
Maximal Induced Trees. Using known techniques, such as reverse search, the
space of all maximal solutions induces an implicit directed graph called
""solution graph"" or ""supergraph"", and solutions are enumerated by traversing
it; however, nodes in this graph can have exponential out-degree, thus
requiring exponential time to be spent on each solution. The novelty of
proximity search is a formalization that allows us to define a better solution
graph, and a technique, which we call canonical reconstruction, by which we can
exploit the properties of given problems to build such graphs. This results in
solution graphs whose nodes have significantly smaller (i.e., polynomial)
out-degree with respect to existing approaches, but that remain strongly
connected, so that all solutions can be enumerated in polynomial delay by a
traversal. A drawback of this approach is the space required to keep track of
visited solutions, which can be exponential: we further propose a technique to
induce a parent-child relationship among solutions and achieve polynomial space
when suitable conditions are met.

the observers follow geodesics. In this paper, we compute these three
persistent observables in nonlinear plane wave spacetimes, and we find that the
fully nonlinear observables contain effects that differ qualitatively from the
effects present in the observables at linear order. Many parts of these
observables can be determined from two functions, the transverse Jacobi
propagators, and their derivatives (for geodesic observers). These functions,
at linear order in the spacetime curvature, reduce to the one, two, and three
time integrals of the Riemann tensor mentioned above.

which can define transition probabilities of renewal processes. They should be
monotonic since the described time or destruction does not go back, it should
admit existence of a distribution with a lack of memory property because the
analog of the Poisson process shall exist. Another valuable property is the
simplicity of calculating and inverting the corresponding generalized
characteristic function (in particular Williamson transform) so that the
technique of generalized characteristic function can be used in description of
our processes. The convex linear combination property (the generalized
convolution of two point measures is the convex combination of several fixed
measures), or representability (which means that the generalized convolution
can be easily written in the language of independent random variables) - they
also facilitate the modeling of real processes in that language.
  We describe examples of generalized convolutions having the required
properties ranging from the maximum convolution and its simplest generalization
- the Kendall convolution (associated with the Williamson transform), up to the
most complicated here - Kingman convolution. It is novel approach to apply in
the extreme value theory. Stochastic representation of the Kucharczak-Urbanik

Archimedean copulas. This paper open the door to solve an old open problem of
the relationship between copulas and generalized convolutions mentioned by B.

paper, we compare four potential approaches for identifying essential

comparison of the techniques shows that there is no single technique sufficient
for identifying essential sentences that can serve as navigational cues, while
our qualitative analysis shows that participants valued explanations and
specific conditions, and did not value filler sentences or speculations. Our
work sheds light on the importance of navigational cues, and our findings can
be used to guide future research to find the best combination of techniques to

detecting forgery in face images. The face X-ray of an input face image is a
greyscale image that reveals whether the input image can be decomposed into the
blending of two images from different sources. It does so by showing the
blending boundary for a forged image and the absence of blending for a real
image. We observe that most existing face manipulation methods share a common
step: blending the altered face into an existing background image. For this
reason, face X-ray provides an effective way for detecting forgery generated by
most existing face manipulation algorithms. Face X-ray is general in the sense
that it only assumes the existence of a blending step and does not rely on any
knowledge of the artifacts associated with a specific face manipulation
technique. Indeed, the algorithm for computing face X-ray can be trained
without fake images generated by any of the state-of-the-art face manipulation
methods. Extensive experiments show that face X-ray remains effective when
applied to forgery generated by unseen face manipulation techniques, while most
existing face forgery detection or deepfake detection algorithms experience a
significant performance drop.

statistical thermodynamics in multicomponent alloys. However, a data-driven
approach to construct the effective Hamiltonian requires sufficiently large
data sets, which is expensive to calculate with conventional density functional
theory (DFT). To solve this problem, we propose to use the atomic local energy
as the target variable, and harness the power of the linear-scaling DFT to
accelerate the data generating process. Using the large amounts of DFT data
sets, various complex models are devised and applied to learn the effective
Hamiltonians of a range of refractory high entropy alloys (HEAs). The testing
$R^2$ scores of the effective pair interaction model are higher than 0.99,
demonstrating that the pair interactions within the 6-th coordination shell
provide an excellent description of the atomic local energies for all the four
HEAs. This model is further improved by including nonlinear and multi-site
interactions. In particular, the deep neural networks (DNNs) built directly in
the local configuration space (therefore no hand-crafted features) are employed
to model the effective Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate that neural
networks are promising for the modeling of effective Hamiltonian due to its
excellent representation power.

trajectories collected from sub-optimal policies can be viewed as optimal
supervision, not for maximizing the reward, but for matching the reward of the
given trajectory. By then conditioning the policy on the numerical value of the
reward, we can obtain a policy that generalizes to larger returns. We show how
such an approach can be derived as a principled method for policy search,
discuss several variants, and compare the method experimentally to a variety of
current reinforcement learning methods on standard benchmarks.

there is no unified framework that encompasses all them. This paper presents a
new perspective to establish a connection between different statistical
linguistic laws. Characterizing each word type by two random variables, length
(in number of characters) and absolute frequency, we show that the
corresponding bivariate joint probability distribution shows a rich and precise
phenomenology, with the type-length and the type-frequency distributions as its
two marginals, and the conditional distribution of frequency at fixed length
providing a clear formulation for the brevity-frequency phenomenon. The
type-length distribution turns out to be well fitted by a gamma distribution
(much better than with the previously proposed lognormal), and the conditional
frequency distributions at fixed length display power-law-decay behavior with a
fixed exponent $\alpha\simeq 1.4$ and a characteristic-frequency crossover that
scales as an inverse power $\delta\simeq 2.8$ of length, which implies the
fulfilment of a scaling law analogous to those found in the thermodynamics of
critical phenomena. As a by-product, we find a possible model-free explanation
for the origin of Zipf's law, which should arise as a mixture of conditional
frequency distributions governed by the crossover length-dependent frequency.

SO(5) symmetry and a WZW term, which is relevant to deconfined criticality. If
such a continuation exists, the structure of the renormalization group flows at
small $\epsilon$ may be fixed by assuming analyticity in $\epsilon$. This leads
to the conjecture that the WZW fixed point annihilates with a new, unstable
fixed point at a critical dimensionality $d_c>2$. We suggest that $d_c < 3$ for
all $k$, and we compute $d_c$ in the limit of large $k$. The flows support the

Extending the theoretical results developed in Part I, Part II evaluates a

with power flow constraints, TLMP is shown to have an energy-congestion-ramping
price decomposition. Under the one-shot dispatch and pricing model, this
decomposition leads to a nonnegative merchandising surplus equal to the sum of
congestion and ramping surpluses. It is also shown that, comparing with LMP,
TLMP imposes a penalty on generators with limited ramping capabilities, thus
giving incentives for generators to reveal their ramping limits truthfully and
improve their ramping capacities. Several benchmark pricing mechanisms are
evaluated under the rolling-window dispatch and pricing models. The performance
measures considered are the level of out-of-the-market uplifts, the revenue
adequacy of the system operator, consumer payment, generator profit, level of
discriminative payment, and price volatility.

sub-optimal local minima exist in some appropriate sense. From this, one may be
tempted to conclude that descent algorithms which escape saddle points will
reach a good local minimum. However, basic optimization theory tell us that it
is also possible for a descent algorithm to diverge to infinity if there are
paths leading to infinity, along which the loss function decreases. It is not
clear whether for non-linear neural networks there exists one setting that no
bad local-min and no decreasing paths to infinity can be simultaneously
achieved. In this paper, we give the first positive answer to this question.
More specifically, for a large class of over-parameterized deep neural networks
with appropriate regularizers, the loss function has no bad local minima and no
decreasing paths to infinity. The key mathematical trick is to show that the

assumptions needed for its derivation. The two assumed properties of the data
$X$, $Y$ and their latent representation $T$ take the form of two Markov chains
$T-X-Y$ and $X-T-Y$. Requiring both to hold during the optimisation process can
be limiting for the set of potential joint distributions $P(X,Y,T)$. We
therefore show how to circumvent this limitation by optimising a lower bound
for $I(T;Y)$ for which only the latter Markov chain has to be satisfied. The
actual mutual information consists of the lower bound which is optimised in
DVIB and cognate models in practice and of two terms measuring how much the

that in this framework the original and deep information bottlenecks are

and on computational concepts, have been elaborated to explain the emergence of
consciousness in the central nervous system. These theories propose key
fundamental mechanisms to explain consciousness, but they only partially
connect such mechanisms to the possible functional and adaptive role of
consciousness. Recently, some cognitive and neuroscientific models try to solve
this gap by linking consciousness to various aspects of goal-directed
behaviour, the pivotal cognitive process that allows mammals to flexibly act in
challenging environments. Here we propose the Representation
Internal-Manipulation (RIM) theory of consciousness, a theory that links the
main elements of consciousness theories to components and functions of
goal-directed behaviour, ascribing a central role for consciousness to the
goal-directed manipulation of internal representations. This manipulation
relies on four specific computational operations to perform the flexible
internal adaptation of all key elements of goal-directed computation, from the
representations of objects to those of goals, actions, and plans. Finally, we
propose the concept of `manipulation agency' relating the sense of agency to
the internal manipulation of representations. This allows us to propose that
the subjective experience of consciousness is associated to the human capacity
to generate and control a simulated internal reality that is vividly perceived
and felt through the same perceptual and emotional mechanisms used to tackle
the external world.

also has a dual symmetry - a $(n-1)$-symmetry described by a higher group when
$G$ is Abelian or an algebraic $(n-1)$-symmetry beyond higher group when $G$ is
non-Abelian. In fact, any $G$-symmetric system can be viewed as a boundary of
$G$-gauge theory in one higher dimension. The conservation of gauge charge and
gauge flux in the bulk $G$-gauge theory gives rise to the symmetry and the dual
symmetry respectively. So any $G$-symmetric system actually has a larger
symmetry called categorical symmetry, which is a combination of the symmetry
and the dual symmetry. However, part (and only part) of the categorical
symmetry must be spontaneously broken in any gapped phase of the system, but
there exists a gapless state where the categorical symmetry is not
spontaneously broken. Such a gapless state corresponds to the usual critical
point of Landau symmetry breaking transition. The above results remain valid
even if we expand the notion of symmetry to include higher symmetries and
algebraic higher symmetries. Thus our result also applies to critical points
for transitions between topological phases of matter. In particular, we show
that there can be several critical points for the transition from the 3+1D
$Z_2$ gauge theory to a trivial phase. The critical point from Higgs
condensation has a categorical symmetry formed by a $Z_2$ 0-symmetry and its

  Retrieval Perspective","Submitted for publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.CR cs.DB eess.SP math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the problem of private set intersection (PSI). In this problem,
there are two entities $E_i$, for $i=1, 2$, each storing a set $\mathcal{P}_i$,
whose elements are picked from a finite field $\mathbb{F}_K$, on $N_i$
replicated and non-colluding databases. It is required to determine the set
intersection $\mathcal{P}_1 \cap \mathcal{P}_2$ without leaking any information
about the remaining elements to the other entity with the least amount of
downloaded bits. We first show that the PSI problem can be recast as a
multi-message symmetric private information retrieval (MM-SPIR) problem. Next,
as a stand-alone result, we derive the information-theoretic sum capacity of
MM-SPIR, $C_{MM-SPIR}$. We show that with $K$ messages, $N$ databases, and the
size of the desired message set $P$, the exact capacity of MM-SPIR is
$C_{MM-SPIR} = 1 - \frac{1}{N}$ when $P \leq K-1$, provided that the entropy of
the common randomness $S$ satisfies $H(S) \geq \frac{P}{N-1}$ per desired
symbol. This result implies that there is no gain for MM-SPIR over successive
single-message SPIR (SM-SPIR). For the MM-SPIR problem, we present a novel
capacity-achieving scheme that builds on the near-optimal scheme of
Banawan-Ulukus originally proposed for the multi-message PIR (MM-PIR) problem
without database privacy constraints. Surprisingly, our scheme here is exactly
optimal for the MM-SPIR problem for any $P$, in contrast to the scheme for the
MM-PIR problem, which was proved only to be near-optimal. Our scheme is an
alternative to the SM-SPIR scheme of Sun-Jafar. Based on this capacity result
for MM-SPIR, and after addressing the added requirements in its conversion to
the PSI problem, we show that the optimal download cost for the PSI problem is
$\min\left\{\left\lceil\frac{P_1 N_2}{N_2-1}\right\rceil, \left\lceil\frac{P_2
N_1}{N_1-1}\right\rceil\right\}$, where $P_i$ is the cardinality of set
$\mathcal{P}_i$

five-dimensional superconformal field theories (5d SCFTs) compactified on a
circle. By engineering these theories in M-theory on ${\mathbf X} \times S^1 $,
for ${\mathbf X}$ an isolated Calabi-Yau threefold singularity, we naturally
identify the BPS category of the 5d theory on a circle with the derived
category of coherent sheaves on a resolution of ${\mathbf X}$. It follows that
the BPS spectrum can be studied in terms of 5d BPS quivers, which are the
fractional-brane quivers for the singularity ${\mathbf X}$. 5d BPS quivers
generalize the well-studied 4d BPS quivers for 4d $\mathcal{N}{=}2$ gauge
theories that can be obtained from ${\mathbf X}$ in so-called geometric
engineering limits. We study the interplay between 4d and 5d BPS quivers in
detail. We particularly focus on examples when ${\mathbf X}$ is a toric
singularity, in which case the 5d BPS quiver is given in terms of a brane
tiling. For instance, the well-studied $Y^{p,q}$ brane tiling gives a 5d BPS
quiver for the $SU(p)_q$ 5d gauge theory. We present a conjecture about the
structure of the BPS spectra of a wide class of models, which we test in the
simple case of the 5d $SU(2)_0$ theory (more precisely, the $E_1$ SCFT). We
also argue that 5d UV dualities can be realized in terms of mutation sequences
on the BPS quivers, which are in turn interpreted as autoequivalences of the
BPS category.

pre-trained network rather than starting from randomly initialized weights.
Adaptation can be useful in cases when training data is scarce, when a single

the network. The most commonly employed approaches for network adaptation are
fine-tuning and using the pre-trained network as a fixed feature extractor,
among others.
  In this paper, we propose a straightforward alternative: side-tuning.
Side-tuning adapts a pre-trained network by training a lightweight ""side""
network that is fused with the (unchanged) pre-trained network via summation.
This simple method works as well as or better than existing solutions and it
resolves some of the basic issues with fine-tuning, fixed features, and other
common approaches. In particular, side-tuning is less prone to overfitting, is
asymptotically consistent, and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting in
incremental learning. We demonstrate the performance of side-tuning under a
diverse set of scenarios, including incremental learning (iCIFAR, iTaskonomy),
reinforcement learning, imitation learning (visual navigation in Habitat), NLP
question-answering (SQuAD v2), and single-task transfer learning (Taskonomy),
with consistently promising results.

phases in 2D. In particular, the so-called non-Abelian statistics plays a
crucial role towards realizing universal topological quantum computation.
Recently, the study of topological phases has been extended to 3D and it has
been proposed that loop-like extensive objects can also carry fractional
statistics. In this work, we systematically study the so-called three-loop
braiding statistics for loop-like excitations for 3D fermionic topological
phases. Most surprisingly, we discovered new types of non-Abelian three-loop
braiding statistics that can only be realized in fermionic systems (or
equivalently bosonic systems with fermionic particles). The simplest example of
such non-Abelian braiding statistics can be realized in interacting fermionic
systems with a gauge group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_8$ or $\mathbb{Z}_4
\times \mathbb{Z}_4$, and the physical origin of non-Abelian statistics can be
viewed as attaching an open Majorana chain onto a pair of linked loops, which
will naturally reduce to the well known Ising non-Abelian statistics via the
standard dimension reduction scheme. Moreover, due to the correspondence
between gauge theories with fermionic particles and classifying fermionic
symmetry-protected topological (FSPT) phases with unitary symmetries, our study
also give rise to an alternative way to classify FSPT phases with unitary
symmetries. We further compare the classification results for FSPT phases with
arbitrary Abelian total symmetry $G^f$ and find systematical agreement with
previous studies using other methods. We believe that the proposed framework of
understanding three-loop braiding statistics (including both Abelian and
non-Abelian cases) in interacting fermion systems applies for generic fermonic
topological phases in 3D.

consequential effects on the strangeness-changing decays of hyperons and kaons

such processes have suppressed rates in the standard model (SM), they could get
significant enhancement in the presence of the LQs. In order to respect the
available data on the kaon modes $K\to\pi\nu\bar\nu$ and increase the rates of
the hyperon decays substantially at the same time, two different scalar LQs are
needed. If the LQs have Yukawa couplings solely to SM fermions, we find that
the hyperon rates cannot attain values within the reach of ongoing or
near-future experiments because of the combined constraints from the
measurements on kaon mixing and lepton-flavor-violating processes. However, if
we include light right-handed neutrinos in the LQ interactions, their
contributions can evade the leading restrictions and translate into hyperon
rates which may be big enough to be probed by upcoming searches. Thus, these
hyperon modes could provide a new avenue for seeking sterile neutrinos.

In some regimes this has been formally conjectured, and there had been no

random gates, approximate simulation of typical instances is almost as hard as
exact simulation. We prove that this is not the case by exhibiting a shallow
circuit family with uniformly random gates that cannot be efficiently
classically simulated near-exactly under standard hardness assumptions, but can
be simulated approximately for all but a superpolynomially small fraction of
circuit instances in time linear in the number of qubits and gates. We
furthermore conjecture that sufficiently shallow random circuits are
efficiently simulable more generally. To this end, we propose and analyze two
simulation algorithms. Implementing one of our algorithms numerically, we give
strong evidence that it is efficient both asymptotically and, in some cases, in
practice. To argue analytically for efficiency, we reduce the simulation of 2D
shallow random circuits to the simulation of a form of 1D dynamics consisting
of alternating rounds of random local unitaries and weak measurements -- a type
of process that has generally been observed to undergo a phase transition from
an efficient-to-simulate regime to an inefficient-to-simulate regime as
measurement strength is varied. Using a mapping from quantum circuits to
statistical mechanical models, we give evidence that a similar computational
phase transition occurs for our algorithms as parameters of the circuit

constraints only. While inequality constraints can be reduced to equality ones
in some situations, there are situations where they cannot, especially when a
drift field is present in the Hamiltonian. The drift which we cannot control
appears in a wide range of systems. We first develop a framework based on
Pontryagin's maximum principle (MP) in order to deal with inequality
constraints as well. The new framework contains QB as a special case, and their
detailed correspondence is given. Second, using this framework, we discuss
general relations among the drift, the singular controls, and the inequality
constraints. The singular controls are those that satisfy MP trivially so as to
cause a trouble in determining the optimal protocol. Third, to overcome this

vulnerabilities of machine learning approaches in adversarial settings and
developing techniques accordingly to make learning robust to adversarial

and has attracted tremendous attention across different communities recently.
In this paper, we explore different adversarial scenarios in the context of

based on classical neural networks, quantum learning systems are likewise
vulnerable to crafted adversarial examples, independent of whether the input
data is classical or quantum. In particular, we find that a quantum classifier
that achieves nearly the state-of-the-art accuracy can be conclusively deceived
by adversarial examples obtained via adding imperceptible perturbations to the
original legitimate samples. This is explicitly demonstrated with quantum
adversarial learning in different scenarios, including classifying real-life
images (e.g., handwritten digit images in the dataset MNIST), learning phases
of matter (such as, ferromagnetic/paramagnetic orders and symmetry protected
topological phases), and classifying quantum data. Furthermore, we show that
based on the information of the adversarial examples at hand, practical defense
strategies can be designed to fight against a number of different attacks. Our
results uncover the notable vulnerability of quantum machine learning systems
to adversarial perturbations, which not only reveals a novel perspective in
bridging machine learning and quantum physics in theory but also provides
valuable guidance for practical applications of quantum classifiers based on

would create new composites with properties that are much more superior to the

natural polysaccharides, starch and chitosan, which form mesoscale composites
that may promise many applications. By using X-ray microscopic imaging,
small-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry, we were
able to characterize the interactions of chitosan and starch in the mesoscale
composites. The morphology of the composite is far more complex from the simple
mixture of starch granules with a nominal size of a few micrometers and
chitosan microbundles of tens and hundreds of micrometers. This unique
morphology can only be explained by the enhanced miscibility of chitosan in a
starch granular matrix. It is evidenced that there is a possible ionic
interaction between the amino group in chitosan and the hydroxyl groups in
starch granules. Despite the limited solubility of chitosan in water, this
ionic interaction allows for the disassembly of chitosan microbundles within
the starch suspension. The result is a chemically stronger and more stable
granular composite formed by two biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide
polymers. The mechanism of chitosan to disperse throughout starch granules has
implications for the application of chitosan in water and other solvents.

object at the center of M87 can constrain deviations from General Relativity
(GR) in a relatively model-independent way. We focus on the class of theories
whose deviations from GR modify black holes into alternative compact objects
whose properties approach those of an ordinary black hole sufficiently far from
the would-be event horizon. We examine this class for two reasons: ($i$) they
tend to reproduce black-hole expectations for astrophysical accretion disks
(and so do not undermine the evidence linking black holes to active galactic
nuclei); ($ii$) they lend themselves to a robust effective-field-theory
treatment that expands in powers of $\ell/r$, where $\ell$ is the fundamental
length scale that sets the distance over which deviations from GR are
significant and $r$ is a measure of distance from the would-be horizon. At
leading order the observational impact of these types of theories arise as
modifications to the transmission and reflection coefficients of modes as they
approach the horizon. We show how EHT observations can constrain this
reflection coefficient, assuming only that the deviations from GR are small
enough to be treated perturbatively. Our preliminary analysis indicates that
such reflection coefficients can already be constrained to be less than of
order 10\% (corresponding to $\ell \lesssim 100 \mu m$), and so can rule out
some benchmark cases used when seeking black-hole echoes. The precise bounds
depend on the black hole spin, as well as on detailed properties of the
reflection coefficient (such as its dependence on angular direction).

distribution of the local density of states (LDOS). While the real part of
defect potential induces a well-pronounced peak in the density of states (DOS),
the DOS is either weakly enhanced at small frequencies or even forms a peak at
the zero frequency for a lattice in the case of non-Hermitian impurity. As for
the spatial distribution of the LDOS, it is enhanced in the vicinity of
impurity but shows a dip at a defect itself when the potential is sufficiently
strong. The results for a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice demonstrate the

explicit section $\mathscr{P}$ of a sheaf of Selmer groups over $\mathscr{X}$.
We show, answering a question of Howard, that $\mathscr{P}$ is a universal
Heegner class, in the sense that it interpolates geometrically defined Heegner
classes at all the relevant classical points of $\mathscr{X}$. We also propose
a `Bertolini-Darmon' conjecture for the leading term of $\mathscr{P}$ at
classical points.
  We then prove that the $p$-adic height of $\mathscr{P}$ is given by the
cyclotomic derivative of a $p$-adic $L$-function. This formula over
$\mathscr{X}$ (which is an identity of functionals on some universal ordinary
automorphic representations) specialises at classical points to all the
Gross-Zagier formulas for ${\rm G}$ that may be expected from
representation-theoretic considerations.
  Combined with a result of Fouquet, the formula implies the $p$-adic analogue
of the Beilinson-Bloch-Kato conjecture in analytic rank one, for the selfdual
motives attached to Hilbert modular forms and their twists by CM Hecke
characters. It also implies one half of the first example of a non-abelian

imperative to find ways to compress large data sets such that intrinsic
features necessary for subsequent analysis are not lost. The traditional
workhorse for data dimensionality reduction and feature extraction has been the
matrix SVD, which presupposes that the data has been arranged in matrix format.
Our main goal in this study is to show that high-dimensional data sets are more
compressible when treated as tensors (aka multiway arrays) and compressed via
tensor-SVDs under the tensor-tensor product structures in (Kilmer and Martin,
2011; Kernfeld et al., 2015). We begin by proving Eckart Young optimality
results for families of tensor-SVDs under two different truncation strategies.
As such optimality properties can be proven in both matrix and tensor-based
algebras, a fundamental question arises: does the tensor construct subsume the
matrix construct in terms of representation efficiency? The answer is yes, as
shown when we prove that a tensor-tensor representation of an equal dimensional
spanning space can be superior to its matrix counterpart. We then investigate
how the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor-SVD is
related both theoretically and in compression performance to its closest
tensor-based analogue, truncated HOSVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000; De Lathauwer
and Vandewalle, 2004), thereby showing the potential advantages of our
tensor-based algorithms. Finally, we propose new tensor truncated SVD variants,
namely multi-way tensor SVDs, provide further approximated representation
efficiency and discuss under which conditions they are considered optimal. We
conclude with a numerical study demonstrating the utility of the theory.

tubes filled with high purity neon or argon at pressure 1-4 Torr. The main
feature of the discharge is the low rate (less than 10 kHz) of the voltage
pulses of given polarity which are applied to only one electrode of the tube,
while another one remains free or missing. This type of the discharge was named
one-electrode discharge (OED), and seems not to be described in previous
studies. The discharge is observed as a glowing plasma column which occupies
either entire tube or its part dependent on actual voltage amplitude and on its
rate. Current-volt characteristics, ignition thresholds and the OED length
changing patterns demonstrate features unknown for RF discharges. It was found
that the plasma generation mechanism in OED consists in formation and traveling
of the set of ionization waves (IW). It was shown that the wave motion is
characterized by a pronounced attenuation the patterns of which were
investigated by the time-position diagrams method. The attenuation specifies
the length of the occupied plasma area as well as other OED parameters.
Kinematic model of the wave propagation is proposed. This model allows to
estimate the electric field in different OED points as well as average electron
concentration via the current measurements; the typical values of the above
parameters are $5 V/cm$ and $10^9-10^{10}$ $cm^{-3}$. It was shown that
nonhomogeneous electric field behind the IW front creates the conditions for
appearance of plasma channel striations observed in the experiment. The
stationary striations found in neon are more distinctive for negative polarity
OED. It was shown that ionization-drift mechanism with account of metastable
states existence in plasma seems to be much adequate for the OED striation
description.

understanding of their composition and evolution. Recent discoveries of low
mass, large radii objects (""super-puffs"") have challenged theories of planet
formation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses make them
vulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that
high altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass
planets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres
in radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and
haze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation,
diffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams
that include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the
outflow, such that young (~0.1-1 Gyr), warm (T$_{eq}$ $\geq$ 500 K), low mass
objects ($M_c$ < 4M$_{\rm Earth}$) should experience the most apparent radius
enhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the
densities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the
inclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to <10%, similar to
that of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This
suggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some
warm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render
transmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent
with recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations
of super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we
predict that the planet radius will be half of that observed in the
near-infrared.

neural network (RNN) based inversion model control has been proposed for output
tracking. However, some issues still need to be addressed when using the
RNN-based inversion model. First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it
cannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model
has been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high
frequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot
be improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the
length of the RNN training set. Therefore, this article focuses on addressing
these limitations of RNN-based inversion model control. Specifically, a novel
modeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear model in a way that it
does not affect the existing high-frequency control performance achieved by
RNN. Additionally, an interpolation method is proposed to double the sampling
frequency (compared to the RNN training sampling frequency). Analysis on the
stability issues which may arise when the proposed new model is used for
predictive control is presented along with the instructions on determining the
parameters for ensuring the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed
approach is demonstrated on a commercial piezo actuator, and the experiment
results show that the tracking performances can be significantly improved.

Unfortunately, its computation is computationally challenging. In particular,
although exact algorithms have been proposed, they must traverse all connected

paper, we consider the issue of approximating the Myerson value for arbitrary

proposed for the related concept of the Shapley value, their suitability for
the Myerson value has not been studied. Given this, we evaluate and compare
(both theoretically and empiraclly) three Monte Carlo sampling methods for the

However, Bayesian approaches to multi-model ensembles have been criticized for
making oversimplified assumptions about bias and variability, as well as
treating different models as statistically independent. This paper extends the
Bayesian hierarchical approach of Sansom et al. (2017) by explicitly accounting
for spatial variability and inter-model dependence. We propose a Bayesian
hierarchical model that accounts for bias between climate models and
observations, spatial and inter-model dependence, the emergent relationship
between historical and future periods, and natural variability. Extensive
simulations show that our model provides better estimates and uncertainty
quantification than the commonly used simple model mean. These results are
illustrated using data from the CMIP5 model archive. As examples, for Central
North America our projected mean temperature for 2070--2100 is about 0.8 K
lower than the simple model mean, while for East Asia it is about 0.5 K higher;
however, in both cases, the widths of the 90% credible intervals are of the
order 3--6 K, so the uncertainties overwhelm the relatively small differences

characterizations for classes of bidirected graphs known as radials and

general radials and semiradials. A bidirected graph is a graph in which each
end of each edge has a sign $+$ or $-$. Bidirected graphs are a common
generalization of digraphs and signed graphs. We define a new concept of
radials as a generalization of a classical concept in matching theory, critical
graphs. Radials are also a generalization of a class of digraphs known as
flowgraphs. We also define semiradials, which are a relaxed concept of radials.
We further define special classes of radials and semiradials, that is, absolute
semiradials, strong and almost strong radials, linear semiradials, and
sublinear radials. We provide constructive characterizations for these five
classes of bidirected graphs. Our serial papers are a part of a series of works
that establish the strong component decomposition for bidirected graphs.

photochemically to generate nitrogenated hydrocarbons at rates determined by
solar radiation and hydrogen escape, on timescales ranging up to tens of

with multiple coupling constants and add a discussion on transversality. In
particular, this allows us to apply our results to (effective) Quantum General
Relativity, possibly coupled to matter from the Standard Model, as was
suggested by Kreimer (2008). To this end, we introduce different gradings on
the renormalization Hopf algebra and study combinatorial properties of the
superficial degree of divergence. Then we generalize known coproduct and
antipode identities to the super- and non-renormalizable cases and to theories
with multiple vertex residues. Building upon our main result, we provide
criteria for the compatibility of these Hopf ideals with the corresponding
renormalized Feynman rules. A direct consequence of our findings is the
well-definedness of the Corolla polynomial for Quantum Yang--Mills theory
without reference to a particular renormalization scheme.

sampling method, the proposed framework infers conservation laws by extracting
symmetries of dynamics from trained DNNs. The proposed framework is developed
by deriving the relationship between a manifold structure of time-series

the proposed framework has been verified in some primitive cases for which the

conservation law estimation for a more practical case that is a large-scale
collective motion system in the metastable state, and we obtain a result

$\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$ is an isomorphism class of square root line

compatibility condition on the stack of short exact sequences. It was
introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman arXiv:1006.270 in their theory of
motivic Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and is important in categorifying
Donaldson-Thomas theory using perverse sheaves.
  We show that natural orientation data can be constructed for all compact
Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and also for compactly-supported coherent sheaves and
perfect complexes on noncompact Calabi-Yau 3-folds $X$ with a spin smooth
projective compactification $X\hookrightarrow Y$. This proves a long-standing
conjecture in Donaldson-Thomas theory.
  These are special cases of a more general result. Let $X$ be a spin smooth
projective 3-fold. Using the spin structure we construct line bundles
$K_{\mathcal M}\to\mathcal M$, $K_{\bar{\mathcal M}}\to\bar{\mathcal M}$. We
define spin structures on $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$ to be isomorphism

prove that natural spin structures exist on $\mathcal M,\bar{\mathcal M}$. They
are equivalent to orientation data when $X$ is a Calabi-Yau 3-fold with the
trivial spin structure.

'spin structures' (square roots of a certain complex line bundle

among the most effective but difficult-to-detect attacks. While many
countermeasures against AEs have been proposed, detection of adaptive CW-$L_2$
AEs is still an open question. We find that, by randomly erasing some pixels in
an $L_2$ AE and then restoring it with an inpainting technique, the AE, before
and after the steps, tends to have different classification results, while a
benign sample does not show this symptom. We thus propose a novel AE detection
technique, Erase-and-Restore (E&R), that exploits the intriguing sensitivity of
$L_2$ attacks. Experiments conducted on two popular image datasets, CIFAR-10
and ImageNet, show that the proposed technique is able to detect over 98% of
$L_2$ AEs and has a very low false positive rate on benign images. The
detection technique exhibits high transferability: a detection system trained
using CW-$L_2$ AEs can accurately detect AEs generated using another $L_2$
attack method. More importantly, our approach demonstrates strong resilience to
adaptive $L_2$ attacks, filling a critical gap in AE detection. Finally, we
interpret the detection technique through both visualization and

Classic methods rely on getting feedback via extrinsic rewards to train the
agent, and in situations where this occurs very rarely the agent learns slowly
or cannot learn at all. Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that
create suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely
stop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to
encourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary
target for the Q-function. In this paper, we present a novel approach that (1)
plans exploration actions far into the future by using a long-term visitation
count, and (2) decouples exploration and exploitation by learning a separate
function assessing the exploration value of the actions. Contrary to existing
methods which use models of reward and dynamics, our approach is off-policy and
model-free. We further propose new tabular environments for benchmarking
exploration in reinforcement learning. Empirical results on classic and novel
benchmarks show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in
environments with sparse rewards, especially in the presence of rewards that
create suboptimal modes of the objective function. Results also suggest that
our approach scales gracefully with the size of the environment. Source code is

formalism (FTP) and renormalization theory (RT). The potential conflict of FTP
and RT is investigated in $g \phi^3$ QFT, by using the retarded/advanced
($R/A$) basis of Green functions and dimensional renormalization (DR). For
example, vertices immediately after (in time) divergent self-energy loops do
not conserve energy, as integrals diverge. We ""repair"" them, while keeping
$d<4$, to obtain energy conservation at those vertices. Already in the S-matrix
theory, the renormalized, finite part of Feynman self-energy $\Sigma_{F}(p_0)$
does not vanish when $|p_0|\rightarrow\infty$ and cannot be split to retarded
and advanced parts. In the Glaser--Epstein approach, the causality is repaired
in the composite object $G_F(p_0)\Sigma_{F}(p_0)$. In the FTP approach, after
repairing the vertices, the corresponding composite objects are
$G_R(p_0)\Sigma_{R}(p_0)$ and $\Sigma_{A}(p_0)G_A(p_0)$. In the limit
$d\rightarrow 4$, one obtains causal QFT. The tadpole contribution splits into
diverging and finite parts. The diverging, constant component is eliminated by
the renormalization condition $\langle 0|\phi|0\rangle =0$ of the S-matrix

the flyby target of the New Horizons extended mission. Three of the four
efforts led to positive detections of the body, and all constrained the
presence of rings and other debris, finding none. Twenty-five mobile stations
were deployed for 2017 June 3 and augmented by fixed telescopes. There were no
positive detections from this effort. The event on 2017 July 10 was observed by
SOFIA with one very short chord. Twenty-four deployed stations on 2017 July 17
resulted in five chords that clearly showed a complicated shape consistent with
a contact binary with rough dimensions of 20 by 30 km for the overall outline.
A visible albedo of 10% was derived from these data. Twenty-two systems were
deployed for the fourth event on 2018 Aug 4 and resulted in two chords. The
combination of the occultation data and the flyby results provides a
significant refinement of the rotation period, now estimated to be 15.9380
$\pm$ 0.0005 hours. The occultation data also provided high-precision
astrometric constraints on the position of the object that were crucial for
supporting the navigation for the New Horizons flyby. This work demonstrates an
effective method for obtaining detailed size and shape information and probing
for rings and dust on distant Kuiper Belt objects as well as being an important
source of positional data that can aid in spacecraft navigation that is
particularly useful for small and distant bodies.

Although some exciting progress has been made, considerable scientific and

promising catalysts because of its atomically dispersed activity sites and
maximized atom efficiency, unsaturated coordination environment, and its unique
electronic structure, which could significantly improve the rate of reaction

comprehensively understand the reaction mechanism owing to their structural
simplicity and diversity, and in turn expedite the rational design of fantastic

sequential order of influenced users by projecting diffusion cascades onto
their local social neighborhoods. However, this fails to capture global social
structures that do not explicitly manifest in any of the cascades, resulting in
poor performance for inactive users with limited historical activities.
  In this paper, we present a novel variational autoencoder framework (Inf-VAE)
to jointly embed homophily and influence through proximity-preserving social
and position-encoded temporal latent variables. To model social homophily,
Inf-VAE utilizes powerful graph neural network architectures to learn social
variables that selectively exploit the social connections of users. Given a
sequence of seed user activations, Inf-VAE uses a novel expressive co-attentive
fusion network that jointly attends over their social and temporal variables to
predict the set of all influenced users. Our experimental results on multiple
real-world social network datasets, including Digg, Weibo, and Stack-Exchanges
demonstrate significant gains (22% MAP@10) for Inf-VAE over state-of-the-art

AGN is thermal driving. The same X-rays that ionize and heat the plasma are
also expected to make it thermally unstable. Indeed, it has been proposed that
the observed clumpiness in AGN winds is caused by thermal instability (TI).
While many studies employing time-dependent numerical simulations of AGN
outflows have included the necessary physics for TI, none have so far managed
to produce clumpiness. Here we present the first such clumpy wind simulations
in 1-D and 2-D, obtained by simulating parsec scale outflows irradiated by an
AGN. By combining an analysis of our extensive parameter survey with physical
arguments, we show that the lack of clumps in previous numerical models can be
attributed to the following three effects: (i) insufficient radiative heating
or other physical processes that prevent the outflowing gas from entering the
TI zone; (ii) the stabilizing effect of stretching (due to rapid radial
acceleration) in cases where the gas enters the TI zone; and (iii) a flow speed
effect: in circumstances where stretching is inefficient, the flow can still be
so fast that it passes through the TI zone too quickly for perturbations to
grow. Besides these considerations, we also find that a necessary condition to
trigger TI in an outflow is for the pressure ionization parameter to decrease
along a streamline once gas enters a TI zone.

controller is a complex system where a vehicle senses immediate upstream
vehicles using its sensors and receives information about its surroundings via
wireless connectivity, and move forward accordingly. In this study, we develop
an information-aware driver model (IADM) that utilizes information regarding an
immediate upstream vehicle of a subject CAV through CAV sensors and V2X
connectivity while considering passenger comfort and operational efficiency
along with maintaining safety gap for longitudinal vehicle motion of the
autonomous vehicle. Unlike existing driver models for longitudinal control, the
IADM intelligently fuses data received from in vehicle sensors, and immediate
upstream vehicles of the subject CAV through wireless connectivity, and IADM
parameters do not need to be calibrated for different traffic states, such as
congested and non congested traffic conditions. It only requires defining the
subject CAVs maximum acceleration and deceleration limit, and computation time
that is needed to update the subject CAVs trajectory from its previous state.
Our analyses suggest that the IADM (i) is able to maintain safety using a newly
defined safe gap function depending on the speed and reaction time of a CAV;
(ii) shows local stability and string stability and (iii) provides riding
comfort for a range of autonomous driving aggressiveness depending on the
passenger preferences.

processing refer to text with missing or incorrect words, and its presence can
hinder the performance of current models that were not implemented to withstand

storage demands, specifically, if real-time performance with high accuracy is

extremes in the design space: non-structured pruning is fine-grained, accurate,
but not hardware friendly; structured pruning is coarse-grained,
hardware-efficient, but with higher accuracy loss. In this paper, we introduce
a new dimension, fine-grained pruning patterns inside the coarse-grained
structures, revealing a previously unknown point in design space. With the
higher accuracy enabled by fine-grained pruning patterns, the unique insight is
to use the compiler to re-gain and guarantee high hardware efficiency. In other

theory/algorithm, compiler, and hardware levels. The proposed PatDNN is an
end-to-end framework to efficiently execute DNN on mobile devices with the help
of a novel model compression technique (pattern-based pruning based on extended

a set of linear constraints that would render all the given observations
feasible while making the preferred ones optimal for the cost (objective)
function. By doing so, we infer the implicit feasible region of the linear
programming problem. Providing such feasible regions (i) builds a baseline for
categorizing future observations as feasible or infeasible, and (ii) allows for
using sensitivity analysis to discern changes in optimal solutions if the
objective function changes in the future.
  In this paper, we propose an inverse optimization framework to recover the
constraints of a forward optimization problem using multiple past observations
as input. We focus on linear models in which the objective function is known
but the constraint matrix is partially or fully unknown. We propose a general
inverse optimization methodology that recovers the complete constraint matrix
and then introduce a tractable equivalent reformulation. Furthermore, we
provide and discuss several generalized loss functions to inform the desirable
properties of the feasible region based on user preference and historical data.
Our numerical examples verify the validity of our approach, emphasize the
differences among the proposed measures, and provide intuition for large-scale
implementations. We further demonstrate our approach using a diet

function $\gamma(\cdot)$ represents a signal-dependent diffusion motility and
is decreasing in $v$ which models a density-suppressed motility in process of
stripe pattern formation through self-trapping mechanism [8,20]. The major
difficulty in analysis lies in the possible degeneracy of diffusion as
$v\nearrow+\infty.$ In the present contribution, based on a subtle observation
of the nonlinear structure, we develop a new method to rule out finite-time
degeneracy in any spatial dimension for all smooth motility function satisfying
$\gamma(v)>0$ and $\gamma'(v)\leq0$ for $v\geq0$. Then we prove global
existence of classical solution for (0.1) in the two-dimensional setting with

bounded if either $1/\gamma$ satisfies certain polynomial growth condition or
$\mu>0.$ Besides, we pay particular attention to the specific case

In addition, bipeds largely have underactuations due to the interactions

observed PTFO8-8695 for around five years at optical and infrared bands
simultaneously using Kanata telescope at the Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory.
Through our observations, we found that the reported fading event split into
two: deeper but phase-shifted ""dip-A"" and shallower but equiphase ""dip-B"".
These dips disappeared at different epochs, and then, dip-B reappeared. Based
on the observed wavelength dependence of dip depths, a dust clump and a
precessing planet are likely origins of dip-A and B, respectively. Here we
propose ""a precessing planet associated with a dust cloud"" scenario for this
system. This scenario is consistent with the reported change in the depth of
fading events, and even with the reported results, which were thought to be
negative evidence to the planetary hypothesis, such as the past non-detection
of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. If this scenario is correct, this is the
third case of a young (<3 Myr) planet around a pre-main sequence star. This
finding implies that a planet can be formed within a few Myr.

method in rhytidectomy. Proper parameters are required to evaluate the surgical
effect. In this paper, a simulation method was proposed to obtain the
parameters. Methods: Three-dimensional point cloud data with a resolution of 50
{\mu}m were employed. First, a smooth supporting contour under the wrinkled
forehead was generated via b-spline interpolation and extrapolation to
constrain the deformation of the wrinkled zone. Then, based on the vector
formed intrinsic finite element (VFIFE) algorithm, the simulation was
implemented in Matlab for the deformation of wrinkled forehead skin in the
stretching process. Finally, the stress distribution and the residual wrinkles
of forehead skin were employed to evaluate the surgical effect. Results:
Although the residual wrinkles are similar when forehead wrinkles are finitely
stretched, their stress distribution changes greatly. This indicates that the
stress distribution in the skin is effective to evaluate the surgical effect,
and the forehead wrinkles are easily to be overstretched, which may lead to
potential skin injuries. Conclusion: The simulation method can predict stress
distribution and residual wrinkles after forehead wrinkle stretching surgery,
which can be potentially used to control the surgical process and further
reduce risks of skin injury.

whether that framework can be extended to capture an intrinsical nonequilibrium

an equal footing. In this work, we are motivated to investigate the
Landau-Zenner problem of polariton condensates in a periodic potential under
nonresonant pumping, considering driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equations
coupled to the rate equation of a reservoir. Using a two-mode approach, we find
fluctuation of the reservoir can be considered as a constant and the relative
phase plays a very important role. The evolution of the dissipative
Landau-Zener model we obtain presents its adiabatic process very different from
the closed system because the fluctuation of the reservoir has a peak and leads
to the damping of the condensates. We substitute the fluctuation of the
reservoir to Hamiltonian and get an effective two-level model. The motion of
Hamiltonian in phase space is also discussed and is directly corresponding to
the pumping rate. The instability of the band structure can also be studied by
the curvatures in phase space and there may be two loops in the middle of the
Brillouin zone when the pumping rate is far beyond the threshold.

labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain. Previous adversarial
domain adaptation methods mostly adopt the discriminator with binary or
$K$-dimensional output to perform marginal or conditional alignment
independently. Recent experiments have shown that when the discriminator is
provided with domain information in both domains and label information in the
source domain, it is able to preserve the complex multimodal information and
high semantic information in both domains. Following this idea, we adopt a
discriminator with $2K$-dimensional output to perform both domain-level and
class-level alignments simultaneously in a single discriminator. However, a
single discriminator can not capture all the useful information across domains
and the relationships between the examples and the decision boundary are rarely
explored before. Inspired by multi-view learning and latest advances in domain
adaptation, besides the adversarial process between the discriminator and the
feature extractor, we also design a novel mechanism to make two discriminators
pit against each other, so that they can provide diverse information for each
other and avoid generating target features outside the support of the source
domain. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to explore a dual
adversarial strategy in domain adaptation. Moreover, we also use the
semi-supervised learning regularization to make the representations more
discriminative. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify

Apache Spark and Flink, which provide a variety of frontend APIs for SQL,
statistical inference, machine learning, stream processing, and many others.
Yet rather few details are reported on the integration of these engines into
the underlying High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructure and the
communication protocols they use. Spark and Flink, for example, are implemented
in Java and still rely on a dedicated master node for managing their control
flow among the worker nodes in a compute cluster.
  In this paper, we describe the architecture of our AIR engine, which is
designed from scratch in C++ using the Message Passing Interface (MPI),
pthreads for multithreading, and is directly deployed on top of a common HPC
workload manager such as SLURM. AIR implements a light-weight, dynamic sharding
protocol (referred to as ""Asynchronous Iterative Routing""), which facilitates a
direct and asynchronous communication among all client nodes and thereby
completely avoids the overhead induced by the control flow with a master node
that may otherwise form a performance bottleneck. Our experiments over a
variety of benchmark settings confirm that AIR outperforms Spark and Flink in
terms of latency and throughput by a factor of up to 15; moreover, we
demonstrate that AIR scales out much better than existing DSPSs to clusters
consisting of up to 8 nodes and 224 cores.

(2,0,0)-colorable and also (1,1,0)-colorable, and on the result that planar

  with Integral Regression for Vertebrae Labeling","10 pages with 9 figures",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Accurate identification and localization of the vertebrae in CT scans is a
critical and standard preprocessing step for clinical spinal diagnosis and
treatment. Existing methods are mainly based on the integration of multiple
neural networks, and most of them use the Gaussian heat map to locate the
vertebrae's centroid. However, the process of obtaining the vertebrae's
centroid coordinates using heat maps is non-differentiable, so it is impossible
to train the network to label the vertebrae directly. Therefore, for end-to-end
differential training of vertebra coordinates on CT scans, a robust and
accurate automatic vertebral labeling algorithm is proposed in this study.
Firstly, a novel residual-based multi-label classification and localization
network is developed, which can capture multi-scale features, but also utilize
the residual module and skip connection to fuse the multi-level features.
Secondly, to solve the problem that the process of finding coordinates is
non-differentiable and the spatial structure is not destructible, integral
regression module is used in the localization network. It combines the
advantages of heat map representation and direct regression coordinates to
achieve end-to-end training, and can be compatible with any key point detection
methods of medical image based on heat map. Finally, multi-label classification
of vertebrae is carried out, which use bidirectional long short term memory
(Bi-LSTM) to enhance the learning of long contextual information to improve the
classification performance. The proposed method is evaluated on a challenging
dataset and the results are significantly better than the state-of-the-art
methods (mean localization error <3mm).

  Support",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the main use cases for advanced cellular networks is represented by
massive Internet-of-things (MIoT), i.e., an enormous number of IoT devices that
transmit data toward the cellular network infrastructure. To make cellular MIoT
a reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the
support of IoT are needed. For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control
Plane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer
instantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control
and data traffic. The performance of the MME has therefore become critical, and
properly scaling its computational capability can determine the ability of the
whole network to tackle MIoT effectively. In particular, considering
virtualized networks and the need for an efficient allocation of computing
resources, it is paramount to characterize the MME performance as the MIoT
traffic load changes. We address this need by presenting compact, closed-form
expressions linking the number of IoT sources with the rate at which bearers
are requested, and such a rate with the delay incurred by the IoT data. We show
that our analysis, supported by testbed experiments and verified through
large-scale simulations, represents a valuable tool to make effective scaling
decisions in virtualized cellular core networks.

implausible given finite and scarce resources in the brain. Quantization is an
information encoding process whereby a continuous quantity is systematically
divided into a finite number of possible categories. Rounding is a simple
example of quantization. We apply this information theoretic concept to develop
a novel quantized (i.e., discrete) probability distortion function. We develop
three conjunction probability gambling tasks to look for evidence of quantized
probability representations in the brain. We hypothesize that certain ranges of
probability will be lumped together in the same indifferent category if a
quantized representation exists. For example, two distinct probabilities such
as 0.57 and 0.585 may be treated indifferently. Our extensive data analysis has
found strong evidence to support such a quantized representation: 59/76
participants (i.e., 78%) demonstrated a best fit to 4-bit quantized models
instead of continuous models. This observation is the major development and
novelty of the present work. The brain is very likely to be employing a
quantized representation of probability. This discovery demonstrates a major
precision limitation of the brain's representational and decision-making

adaptive mesh refinement code Ramses, of a collapsing, one solar mass,
molecular core to study the disc formation and early, up to 100 kyr, evolution,
paying great attention to the impact of numerical resolution and accretion
scheme. We found that while the mass of the central object is almost
independent of the numerical parameters such as the resolution and the
accretion scheme onto the sink particle, the disc mass, and to a lower extent
its size, heavily depend on the accretion scheme, which we found, is itself
resolution dependent. This implies that the accretion onto the star and through
the disc are largely decoupled. For a relatively large domain of initial
conditions (except at low magnetisation), we found that the properties of the
disc do not change too significantly. In particular both the level of initial
rotation and turbulence do not influence the disc properties provide the core
is sufficiently magnetized. After a short relaxation phase, the disc settles in
a stationary state. It then slowly grows in size but not in mass. The disc
itself is weakly magnetized but its immediate surrounding is on the contrary
highly magnetized. Our results show that the disc properties directly depend on
the inner boundary condition, i.e. the accretion scheme onto the central
object, suggesting that the disc mass is eventually controlled by the small
scale accretion process, possibly the star-disc interaction. Because of
ambipolar diffusion and its significant resistivity, the disc diversity remains
limited and except for low magnetisation, their properties are (abridged).

initially propagate through a heavy envelope of the massive progenitor stars or
through a merger ejecta formed from the compact binary mergers. The interaction
of a jet with a stellar envelope or a merger ejecta can lead to the
deceleration of the head material of the jet and simultaneously the formation
of a hot cocoon. However, this jet-envelope/ejecta interaction is actually
undetectable with electromagnetic radiation and can only be inferred indirectly
by the structure of the breakout jet. Therefore, as a solution to this
phenomenon, we suggest that the jet-envelope/ejecta interaction can produce a
gravitational-wave (GW) memory of an amplitude of $h\sim10^{-26}-10^{-23}$,
which could be detected with some future GW detectors sensitive in the
frequency range from sub-Hertz to several tens of Hertz. This provides a
potential direct way to probe the jet propagation and then the interior of the
GRB progenitors. Moreover, this method is in principle available even if the
jet is finally chocked in the stellar envelope or the merger ejecta.

uncertainties caused by the environment to have more reliable model. The model
has formulated the population densities of the speakers of two languages, which
are competing against each other to be saved from destruction, attract more

factors including the status of the languages and the growth rates of the

deep learning based image segmentation algorithms and the problem becomes more
pronounced in multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we propose a unified
training strategy that enables a novel multi-scale deep neural network to be
trained on multiple partially labeled datasets for multi-organ segmentation. In
addition, a new network architecture for multi-scale feature abstraction is
proposed to integrate pyramid input and feature analysis into a U-shape pyramid

different scales, an equal convolutional depth mechanism is introduced.
Furthermore, we employ a deep supervision mechanism to refine the outputs in
different scales. To fully leverage the segmentation features from all the
scales, we design an adaptive weighting layer to fuse the outputs in an
automatic fashion. All these mechanisms together are integrated into a Pyramid
Input Pyramid Output Feature Abstraction Network (PIPO-FAN). Our proposed

length m and a text of length n, both over an alphabet of size $\sigma$,
compute the Hamming distance between the pattern and the text at every
location. Several $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithms have been proposed in
the literature, with running time of the form $O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}n\log n\log
m)$, all using fast Fourier transform (FFT). We describe a simple
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is faster and does not need FFT.
Combining our approach with additional ideas leads to numerous new results:
  - We obtain the first linear-time approximation algorithm; the running time
is $O(\epsilon^{-2}n)$.
  - We obtain a faster exact algorithm computing all Hamming distances up to a
given threshold k; its running time improves previous results by logarithmic
factors and is linear if $k\le\sqrt m$.
  - We obtain approximation algorithms with better $\epsilon$-dependence using
rectangular matrix multiplication. The time-bound is $\~O(n)$ when the pattern
is sufficiently long: $m\ge \epsilon^{-28}$. Previous algorithms require
$\~O(\epsilon^{-1}n)$ time.
  - When k is not too small, we obtain a truly sublinear-time algorithm to find
all locations with Hamming distance approximately (up to a constant factor)
less than k, in $O((n/k^{\Omega(1)}+occ)n^{o(1)})$ time, where occ is the
output size. The algorithm leads to a property tester, returning true if an
exact match exists and false if the Hamming distance is more than $\delta m$ at
every location, running in $\~O(\delta^{-1/3}n^{2/3}+\delta^{-1}n/m)$ time.
  - We obtain a streaming algorithm to report all locations with Hamming
distance approximately less than k, using $\~O(\epsilon^{-2}\sqrt k)$ space.
Previously, streaming algorithms were known for the exact problem with \~O(k)
space or for the approximate problem with $\~O(\epsilon^{-O(1)}\sqrt m)$ space.

constraints on the formation route of formamide (NH2CHO), exploiting its
observed spatial distribution and comparison with astrochemical model
predictions. In this work, we follow the same strategy to study the case of
acetaldehyde (CH3CHO). Method: To this end, we used the data obtained with the
IRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the framework of the Large Program SOLIS to image
the B0 and B1 shocks along the L1157 blueshifted outflow in methanol (CH3OH)
and acetaldehyde line emission. Results: We imaged six CH3OH and eight CH3CHO
lines which cover upper level energies up to 30 K. Both species trace the B0
molecular cavity as well as the northern B1 portion, i.e. the regions where the
youngest shocks (1000 yr) occurred. The CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CHO emission peaks
towards the B1b clump, where we measured the following column densities and
relative abundances: 1.3 x 10^16 cm-2 and 6.5 x 10-6 (methanol), and 7 x 10^13
cm-2 and 3.5 x 10-8 (acetaldehyde). We carried out a non-LTE LVG analysis of
the observed CH3OH line: the average kinetic temperature and density of the
emitting gas are Tkin = 90 K and nH2 = 4 x 10^5 cm-3, respectively. The CH3OH
and CH3CHO abundance ratio towards B1b is 190, varying by less than a factor 3
throughout the whole B0-B1 structure. Conclusions: The comparison of
astrochemical model predictions with the observed methanol and acetaldehyde
spatial distribution does not allow to distinguish whether acetaldehyde is
formed on the grain mantles or rather on the gas-phase, as its gas-phase
formation, dominated by the reaction of ethyl radical (CH3CH2) with atomic
oxygen, is very fast. Observations of acetaldehyde in younger shocks, e.g. 10^2
yr old, or/and of the ethyl radical, whose frequencies are not presently
available, are necessary to settle the issue.

infrastructure- (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service (PaaS)cloud platforms for
applications with ample parallelism and intermittent activity. Serverless
promises greater resource elasticity, significant cost savings, and simplified
application deployment. All major cloud providers, including Amazon, Google,
and Microsoft, have introduced serverless to their public cloud offerings. For
serverless to reach its potential, there is a pressing need for programming
frameworks that abstract the deployment complexity away from the user. This
includes simplifying the process of writing applications for serverless
environments, automating task and data partitioning, and handling scheduling
and fault tolerance.
  We present Ripple, a programming framework designed to specifically take
applications written for single-machine execution and allow them to take
advantage of the task parallelism of serverless. Ripple exposes a simple
interface that users can leverage to express the high-level dataflow of a wide
spectrum of applications, including machine learning (ML) analytics, genomics,
and proteomics. Ripple also automates resource provisioning, meeting
user-defined QoS targets, and handles fault tolerance by eagerly detecting
straggler tasks. We port Ripple over AWS Lambda and show that, across a set of
diverse applications, it provides an expressive and generalizable programming
framework that simplifies running data-parallel applications on serverless, and
can improve performance by up to 80x compared to IaaS/PaaS clouds for similar
costs.

signal-dependent motility function $\gamma(\cdot)$, which is decreasing in $v$
and will vanish as $v$ tends to infinity. The major difficulty in analysis
comes from the possible degeneracy as $v\nearrow+\infty.$ In this work we
develop a new comparison method different from the conventional energy method
in literature, which reveals a striking fact that there is no finite-time
degeneracy in this system. More precisely, we use comparison principles for
elliptic and parabolic equations to prove that degeneracy cannot take place in
finite time in any spatial dimensions for all smooth motility functions

particular, we consider system (0.1) with $\gamma(v)=e^{-v}$. We prove that
classical solution always exists globally, which must be uniformly-in-time

importance for accelerating material discovery and design. Here, our focus is
on the macroscopic, nonlinear elastic response of materials harboring
microstructure. Because of the diversity of microstructural patterns that can
form, there is interest in taking a purely computational approach to predicting
their macroscopic response. However, the evaluation of macroscopic, nonlinear
elastic properties purely based on direct numerical simulations (DNS) is
computationally very expensive, and hence impractical for material design when
a large number of microstructures need to be tested. A further complexity of a
hierarchical nature arises if the elastic free energy and its variation with
strain is a small-scale fluctuation on the dominant trajectory of the total

mode to investigate wavelengths and refractive indices. From varying the
distance of the movable mirror in the Michelson setup the wavelength of the
HeNe laser beam is found to be $630.6\pm7.9~\mathrm{nm}$; $0.28$ sigmas away
from the accepted $632.8~\mathrm{nm}$ and agreeing with it. Then after
considering the fact that the index of refraction for low pressure gasses
varies linearly with pressure we place a vacuum cell in front of the movable
mirror and pump out the air within it to find the individual slopes. By
extrapolating the average slope we calculate the index of refraction for air to
be $n=1.000226\pm0.000026$. This is $1.44$ sigmas away from the manufacturer's
measured $1.000263$ and barely agreeing with it as we underestimated our error
in the fringe count (which is caused by the change in pressure). Furthermore,
the vacuum cell is replaced by a crown glass plate which is rotated to vary the
length at which the EM wave travels in the Michelson interferometer. The angle
of rotation is measured and utilized to find the refractive index of glass to
be $1.514\pm0.006$; agreeing with the accepted value of $1.515$ as it is
$0.125$ sigmas away from it. Thus, along with the wavelength observation this
experiment is conducted successfully. Although the experiment to find the
refractive index of air is conducted less successfully, it is also prosperous
as the measured value is close to the accepted.

accelerate training of GCNs, due to (1) substantial and irregular data
communication to propagate information within the graph, and (2) intensive
computation to propagate information along the neural network layers. To
address these challenges, we design a novel accelerator for training GCNs on
CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems, by incorporating multiple
algorithm-architecture co-optimizations. We first analyze the computation and
communication characteristics of various GCN training algorithms, and select a
subgraph-based algorithm that is well suited for hardware execution. To
optimize the feature propagation within subgraphs, we propose a lightweight
pre-processing step based on a graph theoretic approach. Such pre-processing
performed on the CPU significantly reduces the memory access requirements and
the computation to be performed on the FPGA. To accelerate the weight update in
GCN layers, we propose a systolic array based design for efficient
parallelization. We integrate the above optimizations into a complete hardware
pipeline, and analyze its load-balance and resource utilization by accurate
performance modeling. We evaluate our design on a Xilinx Alveo U200 board
hosted by a 40-core Xeon server. On three large graphs, we achieve an order of
magnitude training speedup with negligible accuracy loss, compared with
state-of-the-art implementation on a multi-core platform.

a great challenge to date. In this paper, based on the hydrothermal vent theory
for the origins of life, I tentatively put forward a new hypothesis that the
prebiotic emergence of the uniform chirality of biomolecules might have been
specifically determined by the spin state of electrons during their prebiotic
syntheses on the surfaces of greigite, a mineral which has been frequently
argued to have played an important role in the evolutionary context of life. An
experimental model to test the hypothesis has also been proposed. Taken into
consideration the possible widespread existence of greigite in submarine
hydrothermal vent systems which have been frequently argued as a potential
cradle for the origins of life, the suggested model, if could be experimentally
demonstrated, may be suggestive of where and how life originated on early
Earth.

after several iterations of machine learning predictions and user feedback.
Machine-caused biases risk leading to undesirable social effects ranging from
polarization to unfairness and filter bubbles.
  In this paper, we study the bias inherent in widely used recommendation
strategies such as matrix factorization. Then we model the exposure that is
borne from the interaction between the user and the recommender system and
propose new debiasing strategies for these systems.
  Finally, we try to mitigate the recommendation system bias by engineering
solutions for several state of the art recommender system models.
  Our results show that recommender systems are biased and depend on the prior
exposure of the user. We also show that the studied bias iteratively decreases
diversity in the output recommendations. Our debiasing method demonstrates the
need for alternative recommendation strategies that take into account the
exposure process in order to reduce bias.

to pairs to packs. Domestic dogs have descended from pack-living gray wolf-like
ancestors. Unlike their group living ancestors, free-ranging dogs are
facultatively social, preferring to forage solitarily. They are scavengers by
nature, mostly dependent on human garbage and generosity for their sustenance.
Free-ranging dogs are highly territorial, often defending their territories
using vocalizations. Vocal communication plays a critical role between inter
and intraspecies and group interaction and maintaining their social dynamics.
Barking is the most common among the different types of vocalizations of dogs.
Dogs have a broad hearing range and can respond to sounds over long distances.
Domestic dogs have been shown to have the ability to distinguish between
barking in different contexts. Since free-ranging dogs regularly engage in
various kinds of interactions with each other, it is interesting to know
whether they are capable of distinguishing between vocalizations of their own
and other groups. In this study, a playback experiment was used to test if dogs
can distinguish between barking of their own group member from a non-group
member. Though dogs respond to barking from other groups in territorial
exchanges, they did not respond differently to the self and other group barking
in the playback experiments. This suggests a role of context in the
interactions between dogs and opens up possibilities for future studies on the
comparison of the responses of dogs in playback experiments with their natural
behavior through long-term observations.

networks can capture spatiotemporal correlations and topological information
within the entire network. A 3D CNN is then applied to deeply integrate the
inflow and outflow information. High-level spatiotemporal features between
different inflow and outflow patterns and between stations that are nearby and
far away can be extracted by 3D CNN. Finally, a fully connected layer is used

circumventing label-scarce problems is pre-training a model to learn

to utilize the full range of student interaction data available and do not
model student learning behavior. To this end, we propose Assessment Modeling, a
class of fundamental pre-training tasks for general interactive educational

serve as a pedagogical evaluation. Examples include the correctness and
timeliness of a student's answer. Assessment Modeling is the prediction of
assessments conditioned on the surrounding context of interactions. Although it
is natural to pre-train on interactive features available in large amounts,
limiting the prediction targets to assessments focuses the tasks' relevance to
the label-scarce educational problems and reduces less-relevant noise. While
the effectiveness of different combinations of assessments is open for
exploration, we suggest Assessment Modeling as a first-order guiding principle
