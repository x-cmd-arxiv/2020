related to Whitham's theory of wave hierarchies, which brings out the
physically relevant parameters in a much clearer way than in the original
analysis. It is also used for the stability of non-equilibrium states and we
show that for gas cooling behind a shock, the usual analysis is only
quantitatively valid for shocks that are just able to trigger a transition to
the cold phase. A magnetic field can readily be included and we show that this
does not change the stability criteria. By considering steady shock solutions,
we show that almost all plausible initial conditions lead to a magnetically
dominated state on the unstable part of the equilibrium curve. These results
are used to analyse numerical calculations of perturbed steady shock solutions
and of shocks interacting with a warm cloud.

structures on the stellar surface and about the planetary body and atmosphere.
To advance understanding of how this information is entangled, a surface-flux
transport code, based on observed properties of the Sun's magnetic field, is
used to simulate the appearance of hypothetical stellar photospheres from the
visible near 4000 Angstrom to the near-IR at 1.6 micron, by mapping intensities
characteristic of faculae and spots onto stellar disks. Stellar appearances are
computed for a Sun-like star of solar activity up to a star with mean magnetic
flux density ~30 times higher. Simulated transit signals for a Jupiter-class
planet are compared with observations. This (1) suggests that the solar
paradigm is consistent with observations for stars throughout the activity
range explored provided that infrequent large active regions with fluxes up to
$\sim 3\times 10^{23}$ Mx are included in the emergence spectrum, (2)
quantitatively confirms that for such a model, faculae brighten relatively
inactive stars while starspots dim more active stars, (3) suggests that large
starspots inferred from transits of active stars are consistent with clusters
of more compact spots seen in the model runs, (4) that wavelength-dependent
transit-depth effects caused by stellar magnetic activity for the range of
activity and the planetary diameter studied here can introduce apparent changes
in the inferred exoplanetary radii across wavelengths from a few hundred to a
few thousand kilometers, increasing with activity, and (5) that
activity-modulated distortions of broadband stellar radiance across the visible

paramount importance in the analysis of geophysical flows as these rare events
relate to critical phenomena such as atmospheric blocking, the weakening of the
Gulf stream, or the splitting of the polar vortex. In this work our aim is to
develop first steps towards a theoretical understanding of vortex splitting
phenomena. To this end, we study bifurcations of global flow patterns in
parameter-dependent two-dimensional incompressible flows, with the flow
patterns of interest corresponding to specific invariant sets. Under small
random perturbations these sets become almost-invariant and can be computed and
studied by means of a set-oriented approach, where the underlying dynamics is
described in terms of a reversible finite-state Markov chain. Almost-invariant
sets are obtained from the sign structure of leading eigenvectors of the
corresponding transition matrix. By a flow pattern bifurcation we mean a
qualitative change in the form of a break-up of an almost-invariant set, when a
critical external parameter of the underlying dynamical system is reached. For
different examples and settings we follow the spectrum and the corresponding
eigenvectors under continuous changes of the underlying system and yield
indicators for different bifurcation scenarios for almost-invariant sets. In
particular, we study a Duffing-type oscillator, which is known to undergo a
classic pitchfork bifurcation. We find that the set-oriented analogue of this
classical bifurcation includes a splitting of a rotating pattern, which has
generic precursor signal that can be deduced from the behavior of the spectrum.

December and quantified variability by using excess variance (F_var). On
month-like time scales, 371/481 FSRQs are variable ( 80%), while only about 50%
(304/639) of BL Lacs are variable. This suggests that FSRQs are more variable
than BL Lac objects. We find a mean F_var of 0.55 +/- 0.33 and 0.47 +/- 0.29
for FSRQs and BL Lacs respectively. Large F_var in FSRQs is also confirmed from
the analysis of the ensemble structure function. By Dividing our sample of
blazars based on the position of the synchrotron peak in their broad-band
spectral energy distribution, we find that the low synchrotron peaked (LSP)
sources have the largest mean F_var value of 0.54 +/- 0.32 while the
intermediate synchrotron peaked (ISP) and high synchrotron peaked (HSP) sources
have mean F_var values of 0.45 +/- 0.25 and 0.47 +/- 0.33 respectively. On
month-like time scales, we find FSRQs to show a high duty cycle (DC) of
variability of 66% relative to BL Lacs that show a DC of 36%. We find that both
the F_var and time scale of variability ({\tau}) do not correlate with the
black hole mass. We note that F_var is found to be weakly correlated with
Doppler factor ({\delta}) and {\tau} is also weakly correlated with {\delta}.
Most of the sources in our sample have {\tau} of the order of days, which might
be related to processes in the jet. We find marginal difference in the
distribution of {\tau} between FSRQs and BL Lacs.

all the moons involved in the Laplace resonance (Io, Europa, and Ganymede),
leading to a migration of their orbits.
  Aims. We aim to characterize the future behavior of the Galilean satellites
over the Solar System lifetime and to quantify the stability of the Laplace
resonance. Since tidal dissipation makes possible the exit from the current
resonances or capture into new ones, we investigate the capture of Callisto
into resonance.
  Methods. We perform hundreds of propagations using an improved version of a
recent semi-analytical model. As Ganymede moves outwards, it approaches the 2:1
resonance with Callisto, inducing a temporary chaotic motion in the system. For
this reason, we draw a statistical picture of the outcome of the resonant
encounter.
  Results. The system can settle into two distinct outcomes: A) a chain of
three 2:1 two-body resonances (Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede and
Ganymede-Callisto), or B) a resonant chain involving the 2:1 two-body resonance
Io-Europa plus at least one pure 4:2:1 three-body resonance, most frequently
between Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In case A (56\% of the simulations), the
Laplace resonance is always preserved and the eccentricities remain confined to
small values below 0.01. In case B (44\% of the simulations), the Laplace
resonance is generally disrupted and the eccentricities of Ganymede and
Callisto can increase up to about 0.1, making this configuration unstable and
driving the system into new resonances.
  Conclusion. From our results, the capture of Callisto into resonance appears
to be extremely likely (100\% of our simulations). Assuming the most recent
estimate of the dissipation between Io and Jupiter, the resonant encounter
happens at about 1.5 Gyrs from now. Therefore, the stability of the Laplace
resonance is guaranteed at least up to about 1.5 Gyrs.

producing vehicle accelerations on arterial roads and potentially increasing
vehicle fuel consumption levels. Eco-driving systems are one method to improve
vehicle energy efficiency with the help of vehicle connectivity. In this paper,
an eco-driving system is developed that computes a fuel-optimized vehicle
trajectory while traversing more than one signalized intersection. The system
is designed in a modular and scalable fashion allowing it to be implemented in
large networks without significantly increasing the computational complexity.
The proposed system utilizes signal phasing and timing (SPaT) data that are
communicated to connected vehicles (CVs) together with real-time vehicle
dynamics to compute fuel-optimum trajectories. The proposed algorithm is
incorporated in the INTEGRATION microscopic traffic assignment and simulation
software to conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of various variables,
including: system market penetration rates (MPRs), demand levels, phase splits,
offsets and traffic signal spacings on the system performance. The analysis
shows that at 100\% MPR, fuel consumption can be reduced by as high as 13.8\%.
Moreover, higher MPRs and shorter phase lengths result in larger fuel savings.
Optimum demand levels and traffic signal spacings exist that maximize the
effectiveness of the algorithm. Furthermore, the study demonstrates that the
algorithm works less effective when the traffic signal offset is closer to its
optimal value. Finally, the study highlights the need for further work to
enhance the algorithm to deal with over-saturated traffic conditions.

communicative data may be especially helpful if predicting rare events or
classifying members of hidden populations - tasks requiring huge and sparse
datasets for generalizable analyses. For example, due to social stigma and
comorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online
groups. Predicting suicidality among individuals in these settings using
standard network analyses is prohibitive due to resource limits (e.g., memory),
and adding auxiliary data like text to such models exacerbates complexity- and
sparsity-related issues. Here, I show how merging graph and language embedding
models (metapath2vec and doc2vec) avoids these limits and extracts unsupervised
clustering data without domain expertise or feature engineering. Graph and
language distances to a suicide support group have little correlation (\r{ho} <
0.23), implying the two models are not embedding redundant information. When
used separately to predict suicidality among individuals, graph and language
data generate relatively accurate results (69% and 76%, respectively); however,
when integrated, both data produce highly accurate predictions (90%, with 10%
false-positives and 12% false-negatives). Visualizing graph embeddings
annotated with predictions of potentially suicidal individuals shows the
integrated model could classify such individuals even if they are positioned
far from the support group. These results extend research on the importance of
simultaneously analyzing behavior and language in massive networks and efforts

multiple areas from different points of view, thus generating partially
overlapping point clouds of the real world scenes. Traditionally, ICP

clouds together to form a unique point cloud that captures the scanned real

coarse initial alignment to converge to the optimum. In this work, we present
an algorithm for registering multiple, overlapping LiDAR scans. We introduce a
geometric metric called Transformation Compatibility Measure (TCM) which aids
in choosing the most similar point clouds for registration in each iteration of

transformed using simplex technique. An optimization of the transformation
using gradient descent and simulated annealing techniques are then applied to
improve the resulting registration. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on four

oscillating cylinder immersed within a fluid, under high amplitude forcing so
that inertial effects are significant. This streaming is decomposed into a
viscous boundary layer flow where vorticity is created, and an outer flow of
larger size. We operate under conditions of relatively low viscosity, so that
the boundary layer is smaller than the object diameter. While for low
Keulegan-Carpenter (KC) number (small enough amplitude), the size of the outer
flow is typically that of the object, here we show that at large enough
forcing, the outer flow stretches along the direction of the vibration by up to
8 times, while the flow still keeps its axial symmetry. We quantify the
elongation through PIV measurements under an unprecedented range of frequency
and amplitude, so that the streaming Reynolds number reaches values much larger
than unity. The absence of significant unsteady component of vorticity outside
the viscous boundary layer - and the fact that the length of elongation scales
well with the streaming Reynolds number - suggest that the stretching should be
due to the convection of stationary vorticity by the streaming flow itself.

transition is continuous for N_f=2 and for all values of Nc we investigated,
N_c=2,3,4. Such continuous transitions belong to universality classes related
to the global symmetry group of the theory. For N_c=2 it belongs to the
SO(5)=Sp(2)/Z_2 universality class, while for N_c>2 it belongs to the
SO(3)=SU(2)/Z_2 universality class. For N_f>2, the transition is always of
first order. These results match the predictions obtained by using the
effective Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson approach in terms of a gauge-invariant order
parameter. Our results indicate that the nonabelian gauge degrees of freedom
are irrelevant at the transition. These conclusions are supported by an

the hydrolysis of ATP. This energy is distributed across the tissue as
strain-energy potentials in the contractile elements, strain-energy potential
from the 3D deformation of the base-material tissue (containing cellular and
ECM effects), energy related to changes in the muscle's nearly incompressible
volume and external work done at the muscle surface. Thus, energy is
redistributed through the muscle's tissue as it contracts, with only a
component of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces in
the muscle's line-of-action. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are
redistributed through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical
performance of whole muscle in its line-of-action does not match the
performance that would be expected from the contractile elements alone. Here we
demonstrate these physical effects using a 3D muscle model based on the finite
element method. The tissue deformations within contracting muscle are large,
and so the mechanics of contraction were explained using the principles of
continuum mechanics for large deformations. We present simulations of a
contracting medial gastrocnemius muscle, showing tissue deformations that
mirror observations from MRI-based images. This paper tracks the redistribution
of strain-energy potentials through the muscle tissue during isometric

this geometry, we derive a new Riemannian optimization framework for robust

function, which is exploited to define a geometrical error measure on the
quotient, and the corresponding intrinsic Cram\'er-Rao lower bound is derived.

framework for proving lower bounds for Massively Parallel Computation using
techniques from boolean function complexity. We extend their framework in two
different ways, to capture two common features of Massively Parallel
Computation:
  $\circ$ Adaptivity, where machines can write to and adaptively read from
shared memory throughout the execution of the computation. Recent work of
Behnezhad et al. (SPAA 19) showed that adaptivity enables significantly
improved round complexities for a number of central graph problems.
  $\circ$ Promise problems, where the algorithm only has to succeed on certain
inputs. These inputs may have special structure that is of particular interest,
or they may be representative of hard instances of the overall problem.
  Using this extended framework, we give the first unconditional lower bounds
on the complexity of distinguishing whether an input graph is a cycle of length
$n$ or two cycles of length $n/2$. This promise problem, 1v2-Cycle, has emerged
as a central problem in the study of Massively Parallel Computation. We prove
that any adaptive algorithm for the 1v2-Cycle problem with I/O capacity
$O(n^{\varepsilon})$ per machine requires $\Omega(1/\varepsilon)$ rounds,
matching a recent upper bound of Behnezhad et al.
  In addition to strengthening the connections between Massively Parallel
Computation and boolean function complexity, we also develop new machinery to
reason about the latter. At the heart of our proofs are optimal lower bounds on
the query complexity and approximate certificate complexity of the 1v2-Cycle
problem.

molecular bases of high enough basicity to accept protons from weak acids to
form ionic liquids of both high basicity and high iconicity. The consequence is
that no ionic liquid with proton activity outside the aqueous base limit of pH
=14, has yet been made. The problem is resolved by considering the six possible
types of proton transfer processes, selecting the process of transfer from weak
molecular acids to very basic ionic anions - partnered with alkali metal
cations, and then replacing the alkali metals cations with reduction-resistant
organic cations by metathesis. In many cases the alkali metal salts of target
anions are commercially available, and only the metathesis reaction is needed
to obtain the basic ionic liquid. A thermodynamic route to the assessment of
basicity levels on the water scale, i.e. relative to the H3O+/H2O

It is then applied to show how to extend the possible proton activity range

than general-purpose schemes. Our approach avoids the case of divergence of the
iterative sequence of approximate stable manifolds, and reduces the computation
cost. We illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by an optimal control
problem with exponential nonlinearity.

twisting has recently been used to create moir\'e superlattices, enabling the
realization of new optical and electronic properties in solid-state systems. In
particular, moir\'e lattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been shown to lead to exciton trapping, host Mott
insulating and superconducting states, and act as unique Hubbard systems whose
correlated electronic states can be detected and manipulated optically.
Structurally, these twisted heterostructures also feature atomic reconstruction
and domain formation. Unfortunately, due to the nanoscale sizes (~10 nm) of
typical moir\'e domains, the effects of atomic reconstruction on the electronic
and excitonic properties of these heterostructures could not be investigated
systematically and have often been ignored. Here, we use near-0$^o$ twist angle
MoSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ bilayers with large rhombohedral AB/BA domains to directly
probe excitonic properties of individual domains with far-field optics. We show
that this system features broken mirror/inversion symmetry, with the AB and BA
domains supporting interlayer excitons with out-of-plane (z) electric dipole
moments in opposite directions. The dipole orientation of ground-state
$\Gamma$-K interlayer excitons (X$_{I,1}$) can be flipped with electric fields,
while higher-energy K-K interlayer excitons (X$_{I,2}$) undergo
field-asymmetric hybridization with intralayer K-K excitons (X$_0$). Our study
reveals the profound impacts of crystal symmetry on TMD excitons and points to
new avenues for realizing topologically nontrivial systems, exotic
metasurfaces, collective excitonic phases, and quantum emitter arrays via
domain-pattern engineering.

equations. For solving the radiation diffusion equations, many linear systems
are obtained in the nonlinear iterations at each time step. The cost of linear
equations dominates the numerical simulation of radiation diffusion
applications, such as inertial confinement fusion, etc. {Usually,} iterative
methods are used to solve the linear systems in {a} real application.
{Moreover, the solution of the previous nonlinear iteration or the solution of
the previous time step is typically used as the initial guess for solving the
current linear equations.} Because of the strong local character in ICF, with
the advancing of nonlinear iteration and time step, the solution of the linear
system changes dramatically in some local domain, and changes mildly or even
has no change in the rest domain. In this paper, a local {character-based}
method is proposed to solve the linear systems of radiation diffusion problems.
The proposed method consists of three steps: firstly, a local domain (algebraic
domain) is constructed; secondly, the subsystem on the local domain is solved;
and lastly, the whole system will be solved. Two methods are given to construct
the local domain. One is based on the spatial gradient, and the other is based
on the residual. Numerical tests for a two-dimensional heat conduction model
problem, and two real application models, the multi-group radiation diffusion
equations and the three temperature energy equations, are conducted. The test
results show that the solution time for solving the linear system can be
reduced dramatically by using the local character-based method.

leading to $1\sigma$ precisions of $\sim 15\%$ at $0.4<z_{\rm cl}<0.7$ and
$0.7<z_{\rm cl}<1.0$. These constraints are more consistent with the model
predictions ($\lesssim 1\sigma$) than their $20\%$ smaller values as suggested
by the previous studies with the redMaPPer ($\sim 2\sigma$). We also
investigate selection effects of the optical cluster-finding algorithms on the

computationally generated model decoys is not yet a solved problem. One route
to distinguish real protein structures from decoys is to delineate the
important physical features that specify a real protein. For example, it has
long been appreciated that the hydrophobic cores of proteins contribute
significantly to their stability. As a dataset of decoys to compare with real
protein structures, we studied submissions to the bi-annual CASP competition
(specifically CASP11, 12, and 13), in which researchers attempt to predict the
structure of a protein only knowing its amino acid sequence. Our analysis
reveals that many of the submissions possess cores that do not recapitulate the
features that define real proteins. In particular, the model structures appear
more densely packed (because of energetically unfavorable atomic overlaps),
contain too few residues in the core, and have improper distributions of
hydrophobic residues throughout the structure. Based on these observations, we
developed a deep learning method, which incorporates key physical features of
protein cores, to predict how well a computational model recapitulates the real
protein structure without knowledge of the structure of the target sequence. By
identifying the important features of protein structure, our method is able to
rank decoys from the CASP competitions equally well, if not better than,
state-of-the-art methods that incorporate many additional features.

low-resolution counterpart. With the rapid rise of deep learning, many recently
proposed video super-resolution methods use convolutional neural networks in
conjunction with explicit motion compensation to capitalize on statistical
dependencies within and across low-resolution frames. Two common issues of such
methods are noteworthy. Firstly, the quality of the final reconstructed HR
video is often very sensitive to the accuracy of motion estimation. Secondly,
the warp grid needed for motion compensation, which is specified by the two
flow maps delineating pixel displacements in horizontal and vertical
directions, tends to introduce additional errors and jeopardize the temporal
consistency across video frames. To address these issues, we propose a novel
dynamic local filter network to perform implicit motion estimation and
compensation by employing, via locally connected layers, sample-specific and
position-specific dynamic local filters that are tailored to the target pixels.
We also propose a global refinement network based on ResBlock and autoencoder
structures to exploit non-local correlations and enhance the spatial
consistency of super-resolved frames. The experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and validate its strength
in terms of local transformation handling, temporal consistency as well as edge
sharpness.

scale, the development of new statistical models is being pushed forward.
Functional data analysis provides the required statistical methods to deal with
large-scale and complex data by assuming that data are continuous functions,
e.g., a realization of a continuous process (curves) or continuous random
fields (surfaces), and that each curve or surface is considered as a single
observation. Here, we provide an overview of functional data analysis when data
are complex and spatially correlated. We provide definitions and estimators of
the first and second moments of the corresponding functional random variable.
We present two main approaches: The first assumes that data are realizations of
a functional random field, i.e., each observation is a curve with a spatial
component. We call them 'spatial functional data'. The second approach assumes
that data are continuous deterministic fields observed over time. In this case,
one observation is a surface or manifold, and we call them 'surface time
series'. For the two approaches, we describe software available for the
statistical analysis. We also present a data illustration, using a
high-resolution wind speed simulated dataset, as an example of the two
approaches. The functional data approach offers a new paradigm of data
analysis, where the continuous processes or random fields are considered as a
single entity. We consider this approach to be very valuable in the context of
big data.

capturing correlated information from subtle and dynamic AUs. Existing methods
often resort to the localization of correlated regions of AUs, in which
predefining local AU attentions by correlated facial landmarks often discards
essential parts, or learning global attention maps often contains irrelevant
areas. Furthermore, existing relational reasoning methods often employ common
patterns for all AUs while ignoring the specific way of each AU. To tackle
these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive attention and relation (AAR)
framework for facial AU detection. Specifically, we propose an adaptive
attention regression network to regress the global attention map of each AU
under the constraint of attention predefinition and the guidance of AU
detection, which is beneficial for capturing both specified dependencies by
landmarks in strongly correlated regions and facial globally distributed
dependencies in weakly correlated regions. Moreover, considering the diversity
and dynamics of AUs, we propose an adaptive spatio-temporal graph convolutional

inter-dependencies among AUs, as well as the temporal dependencies. Extensive

commonly computed in molecular simulation and of significant value in
understanding and engineering molecular behavior. These free energy surfaces

such approaches obscure two important facets of these functions. First, the
empirical observations along the collective variable are defined by an ensemble
of discrete observations and the coarsening of these observations into a
histogram bins incurs unnecessary loss of information. Second, the free energy
surface is itself almost always a continuous function, and its representation
by a histogram introduces inherent approximations due to the discretization. In
this study, we relate the observed discrete observations from biased

These relativistic pairs will then up-scatter cosmic microwave background (CMB)
photons and emit secondary GeV emission. Meanwhile, the motion of these pairs
are deflected by intergalactic magnetic field (IGMF), so the secondary GeV
photons arrive later than the primary emission. It has been suggested that the

Recently, TeV gamma-ray emission has been detected, for the first time, from a

find a limit of $>10^{-19.5}$ G for the coherence length of $\lambda \leq 1$
Mpc. Although this limit is weaker than that obtained by using blazars, it
represents the first limit from ${\rm \gamma-ray}$ observations of GRBs, which
provides an independent constraint on IGMF. We also find that, for transient

performance. Subsequently, we carry out numerical simulations to corroborate
the error performance analysis and the proposed dynamic power allocation
schemes. By studying the numerical results, we find that the depth of the
Huffman tree has a significant impact on the error performance when the
SAP-to-leaf mapping relation is optimized based on CSI. Meanwhile, through
numerical results, we also discuss the trade-off between error performance and
data transmission rate and investigate the impacts of imperfect CSI on the
error performance of EHC-OFDM-IM.

We provide bounds on the conditioning of tensor network representations to

approximation error in the tensor sites of a tensor network can be amplified to
error in the tensor it represents. In known tensor network methods, canonical
forms of tensor network are used to minimize such error amplification. However,

We quantify the extent to which error can be amplified in general tensor

corresponding Langevin dynamics of the field variables is given by stochastic
partial differential equations that are Markovian. This is in contrast to the
Hawkes process, which is non-Markovian (in general) by construction as a result
of its (long) memory kernel. We derive the exact solutions of the
Lagrange-Charpit equations for the hyperbolic master equations in the Laplace

correspond to a transcritical bifurcation in the Lagrange-Charpit equations. We
predict a power law scaling of the PDF of the intensities in an intermediate

beyond a characteristic intensity that diverges as the critical condition is
approached. We also discuss the formal relationship between quantum field

image types and the results presented cannot be expected to apply to real-world
scenarios. For example, the results of the latest NIST Face Recognition Vendor
Test MORPH show that the submitted MAD algorithms lack robustness and
performance when considering unseen and challenging datasets. In this work,
subsets of the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases are used to create a large
realistic database for training and testing of morphing attack detection
algorithms, containing a large number of ICAO-compliant bona fide facial
images, corresponding unconstrained probe images, and morphed images created

their original geometrical symmetries. It is an important topic in the layered
graphene-like two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), but its
origin remains unclear. Using diamond-anvil cell techniques, synchrotron x-ray
diffraction, x-ray absorption, and the first-principles calculations, we show
that the evolution from the weak Van der Waals bonding to the Heisenberg
covalent bonding between layers induces an isostructural transition in
quasi-two-dimensional 1$\textit{T}$-type VSe$_2$ at high pressure. Furthermore,
our results show that high-pressure induce a novel superstructure at 15.5 GPa,
rather than suppress as it would normally, which is unexpected. It is driven by
the Fermi surface nesting, enhanced by the pressure-induced distortion. The
results suggest that the superstructure not only appears in the two-dimensional
structure but also can emerge in the pressure-tuned three-dimensional structure
with new symmetry and develop superconductivity.

\SI{8.2e-22}{\ampere\per\centi\meter\squared} and a readout noise of
\SI{1.6}{\electron}, achieved with 5 CCDs. A new DAMIC apparatus will be
installed at Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane in a few years. The DAMIC at

use non-destructive readout with multiple-sampling, enabling the CCDs to
achieve a readout noise of \SI{0.068}{\electron}. The low readout noise, in
conjunction with low leakage current of these skipper CCDs, will allow DAMIC-M
to observe physics processes with collisions energies as low as
\SI{1}{\electronvolt}. The DAMIC-M experiment will consist of an array of 50
large-area skipper CCDs with more than 36 million pixels in each CCD. The

pooling operation in several pre-defined orientations. Each orientation defines
one kind of spatial alignment, and the network automatically determines which
is the optimal alignments through learning. With the proposed two modules, our

generate more robust target representations being invariant to various

learning better spatial-scale invariant target representations, yielding

such as radar, array processing, ultrasound imaging and communications. In the
context of correlation-based processing, such arrays enable to resolve more
uncorrelated sources than physical sensors. This property of sparse arrays
stems from the size of their difference coarrays, defined as the differences of
element locations. Thus, the design of sparse arrays with large difference
coarrays is of great interest. In addition, other array properties such as
symmetry, robustness and array economy are important in different applications.
Numerous studies have proposed diverse sparse geometries, focusing on certain
properties while lacking others. Incorporating multiple properties into the
design task leads to combinatorial problems which are generally NP-hard. For
small arrays these optimization problems can be solved by brute force, however,
in large scale they become intractable. In this paper, we propose a scalable
systematic way to design large sparse arrays considering multiple properties.
To that end, we introduce a fractal array design in which a generator array is
recursively expanded according to its difference coarray. Our main result
states that for an appropriate choice of the generator such fractal arrays
exhibit large difference coarrays. Furthermore, we show that the fractal arrays
inherit their properties from their generators. Thus, a small generator can be
optimized according to desired requirements and then expanded to create a
fractal array which meets the same criteria. This approach paves the way to
efficient design of large arrays of hundreds or thousands of elements with
specific properties.

needed when the system configuration changes. The resulting inefficiency in
terms of data and training time requirements can be mitigated, if domain
knowledge is available, by selecting a suitable model class and learning
procedure, collectively known as inductive bias. However, it is generally
difficult to encode prior knowledge into an inductive bias, particularly with

on the same analysis of the combined low-energy $\pi^+ p$ and charge-exchange

absence of significant systematic effects in the determination of the absolute
normalisation of the datasets) and the insignificance of residual effects in
the electromagnetic corrections, a significant difference between these two

in the low-energy $\pi N$ interaction. We examine the sensitivity of the
standard low-energy observables to the effect, and identify the kinematical
regions which are promising for experimental survey. Accurate experiments under

from diverse domains. Many of these problems are NP-hard and designing
efficient heuristics for them requires considerable time and experimentation.
On the other hand, the number of optimization problems in the industry
continues to grow. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been
explored to address this gap. We propose a framework for leveraging machine
learning techniques to scale-up exact combinatorial optimization algorithms. In
contrast to the existing approaches based on deep-learning, reinforcement
learning and restricted Boltzmann machines that attempt to directly learn the
output of the optimization problem from its input (with limited success), our
framework learns the relatively simpler task of pruning the elements in order
to reduce the size of the problem instances. In addition, our framework uses
only interpretable learning models based on intuitive features and thus the
learning process provides deeper insights into the optimization problem and the
instance class, that can be used for designing better heuristics. For the
classical maximum clique enumeration problem, we show that our framework can
prune a large fraction of the input graph (around 99 % of nodes in case of
sparse graphs) and still detect almost all of the maximum cliques. This results
in several fold speedups of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the model
used in our framework highlights that the chi-squared value of neighborhood
degree has a statistically significant correlation with the presence of a node
in a maximum clique, particularly in dense graphs which constitute a
significant challenge for modern solvers. We leverage this insight to design a
novel heuristic for this problem outperforming the state-of-the-art. Our
heuristic is also of independent interest for maximum clique detection and
enumeration.

Assessing network candidates under a proxy (i.e., computationally reduced

network candidates. In particular, some proxies can be more reliable -- the
rank of candidates does not differ much comparing their reduced setting
performance and final performance. In this paper, we systematically investigate
some widely adopted reduction factors and report our observations. Inspired by
these observations, we present a reliable proxy and further formulate a
hierarchical proxy strategy. The strategy spends more computations on candidate
networks that are potentially more accurate, while discards unpromising ones in
early stage with a fast proxy. This leads to an economical evolutionary-based
NAS (EcoNAS), which achieves an impressive 400x search time reduction in

drift-biased suspended graphene sheet in close proximity of them. Nonreciprocal
graphene plasmons are induced by the drift currents in the graphene sheet, and
then couple to the waves emitted by the particles in near-field regime. Based
on the asymmetry with respect to their propagation direction of graphene
plasmons, the thermal rectification between the two particles is observed. The
performance of the radiative thermal diode can be actively adjusted through
tuning the chemical potential or changing the drift currents in the graphene
sheet. With a large drift velocity and a small chemical potential, a perfect
radiative thermal diode with a rectification coefficient extremely approaching
to 1 can be achieved within a wide range of the interparticle distance from
near to far-field. The dispersion relations of the graphene plasmons are
adopted to analyze the underlying physics of the rectification effect. In
addition, due to the wide band characteristic of the nonreciprocal graphene
plasmons, the driftbiased graphene can act as a universal platform for the
thermal rectification between particles. The particles with a larger particle
resonance frequency are much more preferred to produce a better thermal diode.

Li-plating-induced internal stress in Li metal and its effect on dendrite

plating-induced stress in dendrite formation through first-principles
calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the
deposited Li forms a stable atomic nanofilm structure on copper (Cu) substrate.
It is found that the adsorption energy of Li atoms increases from the Li-Cu
interface to deposited Li surface, leading to more aggregated Li atoms at the
interface. Compared to the pristine Li metal, the deposited Li in the early
stage becomes compacted and suffers in-plane compressive stress. Interestingly,
we find that there is a giant strain gradient distribution from the Li-Cu
interface to deposited Li surface, which makes the deposited atoms adjacent to
the Cu surface tend to press upwards with perturbation, causing the dendrite
growth. This understanding provides an insight to the atomic-scale origin of Li
dendrite growth and may be useful for suppressing the Li dendrite in the
Li-metal-based rechargeable batteries.

that in this case only first bunch is in the finite longitudinal electrical

probability increases the number of infinite strings inside the horizon and
enhances the kink production, which leads a larger amplitude of the GW
background. Second, a kink going through a Y-junction transforms into three
daughter kinks. In this way, the existence of Y-junctions also increases the
number of kinks on cosmic superstrings. However, at the same time, it smooths
out the sharpness of kinks rapidly and reduces the number of sharp kinks, which
are responsible for the emissions of strong GW bursts. We compute the number
distribution of kinks as a function of the sharpness by taking into account the
above two effects, and translate it to the amplitude of the GW background
spectra. We first investigate the case of the string network with equal string
tensions, and find that the effect of Y-junctions to smooth out kink sharpness
dominates that of the enhancement of the kink number by a small reconnection

  Here we quantify the contribution of phonon assisted heat transfer between
apolar solids using lattice dynamics combined with ab-initio calculations. We
clearly demonstrate that phonons dominate heat transfer for subnanometre gaps.
Strikingly, we conclude that even in the situation where the gap is filled with

phonon heat transfer compared to previous works and bring forward a methodology

filament in active region (AR) 11112 on 2010 October 18. The filament was
composed of two parts, the eastern part (EP) and western part (WP). We focus on
longitudinal oscillations of the EP, which were enhanced by two homologous
C-class flares in the same AR. The C1.3 flare was confined without a CME. Both
EP and WP of the filament were slightly disturbed and survived the flare. After
5 hrs, eruption of the WP generated a C2.6 flare and a narrow, jet-like CME.
Three oscillating threads (thd$_a$, thd$_b$, thd$_c$) are obviously identified
in the EP and their oscillations are naturally divided into three phases by the
two flares. The initial amplitude ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of
$\sim$14 Mm. The period ranges from 34 to 73 minutes with a mean value of
$\sim$53 minutes. The curvature radii of the magnetic dips are estimated to be
29 to 133 Mm with a mean value of $\sim$74 Mm. The damping times ranges from
$\sim$62 to $\sim$96 minutes with a mean value of $\sim$82 minutes. The value
of $\tau/P$ is between 1.2 and 1.8. For thd$_a$ in the EP, the amplitudes were
enhanced by the two flares from 6.1 Mm to 6.8 Mm after the C1.3 flare and
further to 21.4 Mm after the C2.6 flare. The period variation as a result of
perturbation from the flares was within 20\%. The attenuation became faster
after the C2.6 flare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
large-amplitude, longitudinal filament oscillations enhanced by flares.
Numerical simulations reproduce the oscillations of thd$_a$ very well. The
simulated amplitudes and periods are close to the observed values, while the
damping time in the last phase is longer, implying additional mechanisms should
be taken into account apart from radiative loss.

in realizing cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications.
Due to the line-of-sight (LoS)-dominant air-ground channels, the UAV
generates/suffers much stronger interference to/from cellular base stations
(BSs) over a much larger region in its uplink/downlink communication, as
compared to the terrestrial users. As a result, conventional inter-cell
interference coordination (ICIC) techniques catered for terrestrial networks
become ineffective in mitigating the more severe UAV-induced interference. To
deal with this new challenge, this letter introduces a cognitive radio based
solution by treating the UAV and terrestrial users as secondary and primary
users in the network, respectively. In particular, the LoS channels with
terrestrial BSs/users endow the UAV with a powerful spectrum sensing capability
for detecting the terrestrial signals over a much larger region than its
serving BS. By exploiting this unique feature, we propose a new
UAV-sensing-assisted ICIC design for both the UAV downlink and uplink
communications. Specifically, the UAV senses its received interference and the
transmissions of terrestrial users in the downlink and uplink, respectively,
over the resource blocks (RBs) available at its serving BS to assist its RB
allocation to the UAV for avoiding the interference with co-channel terrestrial
communications. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed UAV-assisted
ICIC outperforms the conventional terrestrial ICIC by engaging the neighboring
BSs for cooperation only.

fundamentally change computational science and engineering through breakthrough
performances on challenging problems. However, reliability and trustworthiness
of such techniques is becoming a major concern. In inverse problems in imaging,
the focus of this paper, there is increasing empirical evidence that methods
may suffer from hallucinations, i.e., false, but realistic-looking artifacts;
instability, i.e., sensitivity to perturbations in the data; and unpredictable
generalization, i.e., excellent performance on some images, but significant
deterioration on others. This paper presents a theoretical foundation for these
phenomena. We give a mathematical framework describing how and when such
effects arise in arbitrary reconstruction methods, not just AI-inspired
techniques. Several of our results take the form of 'no free lunch' theorems.
Specifically, we show that (i) methods that overperform on a single image can
wrongly transfer details from one image to another, creating a hallucination,
(ii) methods that overperform on two or more images can hallucinate or be
unstable, (iii) optimizing the accuracy-stability trade-off is generally
difficult, (iv) hallucinations and instabilities, if they occur, are not rare
events, and may be encouraged by standard training, (v) it may be impossible to
construct optimal reconstruction maps for certain problems, (vi) standard
methods to improve reliability (e.g., regularization or adversarial training)
may themselves lead to unstable problems. Our results trace these effects to
the kernel of the forwards operator. They assert that such effects can be
avoided only if information about the kernel is encoded into the reconstruction
procedure. Based on this, this work aims to spur research into new ways to
develop robust and reliable AI-inspired methods for inverse problems in

The observed non-linear l-dependence of the spectral blue shifts evidences the

which is well accounted for by our analysis and computational simulation. Even
more excitingly, the twisted light excitation is shown to make excitonic

direct comparison of different development stages and design decisions, and
even minor modifications may dramatically affect the results. While existing
development tools provide visualizations for gaining general insight into
performance and structural aspects of the source code, they neglect the central
importance of result images unique to graphical algorithms. In this paper, we
present a novel approach that enables visualization programmers to
simultaneously explore the evolution of their algorithm during the development
phase together with its corresponding visual outcomes by providing an
automatically updating meta visualization. Our interactive system allows for
the direct comparison of all development states on both the visual and the
source code level, by providing easy to use navigation and comparison tools.
The on-the-fly construction of difference images, source code differences, and
a visual representation of the source code structure further enhance the user's
insight into the states' interconnected changes over time. Our solution is
accessible via a web-based interface that provides GPU-accelerated live
execution of C++ and GLSL code, as well as supporting a domain-specific
programming language for scientific visualization.

  Interleaving","8 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How do people decide how long to continue in a task, when to switch, and to
which other task? Understanding the mechanisms that underpin task interleaving
is a long-standing goal in the cognitive sciences. Prior work suggests greedy
heuristics and a policy maximizing the marginal rate of return. However, it is
unclear how such a strategy would allow for adaptation to everyday environments
that offer multiple tasks with complex switch costs and delayed rewards. Here
we develop a hierarchical model of supervisory control driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). The supervisory level learns to switch using task-specific
approximate utility estimates, which are computed on the lower level. A
hierarchically optimal value function decomposition can be learned from
experience, even in conditions with multiple tasks and arbitrary and uncertain
reward and cost structures. The model reproduces known empirical effects of
task interleaving. It yields better predictions of individual-level data than a
myopic baseline in a six-task problem (N=211). The results support hierarchical
RL as a plausible model of task interleaving.

approximating opponents' policies, which can recover agents' policies that can
regenerate similar interactions. Consequently, we develop a Decentralized

  stochastic biochemical models",,,,,"q-bio.QM q-bio.MN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The inherent behavioral variability exhibited by stochastic biochemical
systems makes it a challenging task for human experts to manually analyze them.
Computational modeling of such systems helps in investigating and predicting
the behaviors of the underlying biochemical processes but at the same time
introduces the presence of several unknown parameters. A key challenge faced in
this scenario is to determine the values of these unknown parameters against
known behavioral specifications. The solutions that have been presented so far
estimate the parameters of a given model against a single specification whereas
a correct model is expected to satisfy all the behavioral specifications when
instantiated with a single set of parameter values. We present a new method,
BioMETA, to address this problem such that a single set of parameter values
causes a parameterized stochastic biochemical model to satisfy all the given
probabilistic temporal logic behavioral specifications simultaneously. Our
method is based on combining a multiple hypothesis testing based statistical
model checking technique with simulated annealing search to look for a single
set of parameter values so that the given parameterized model satisfies
multiple probabilistic behavioral specifications. We study two stochastic
rule-based models of biochemical receptors, namely, Fc$\epsilon$RI and T-cell
as our benchmarks to evaluate the usefulness of the presented method. Our
experimental results successfully estimate $26$ parameters of Fc$\epsilon$RI
and $29$ parameters of T-cell receptor model against three probabilistic
temporal logic behavioral specifications each.

knowledge gained from previous tasks to solving related tasks. Learning a
universal value function (Schaul et al., 2015), which generalizes over goals
and states, has previously been shown to be useful for transfer. However,
successor features are believed to be more suitable than values for transfer
(Dayan, 1993; Barreto et al.,2017), even though they cannot directly generalize
to new goals. In this paper, we propose (1) Universal Successor Features (USFs)
to capture the underlying dynamics of the environment while allowing
generalization to unseen goals and (2) a flexible end-to-end model of USFs that
can be trained by interacting with the environment. We show that learning USFs
is compatible with any RL algorithm that learns state values using a temporal
difference method. Our experiments in a simple gridworld and with two MuJoCo
environments show that USFs can greatly accelerate training when learning
multiple tasks and can effectively transfer knowledge to new tasks.

Refinement-Risk Cycle focuses on attack analysis and security refinement

formal security refinement for system specifications. This formal process is
built practically as an extension to the Isabelle Infrastructure framework with
attack trees. We define a formal notion of refinement on infrastructure models.
Thanks to the formal foundation of Kripke structures and branching time
temporal logic in the Isabelle Infrastructure framework, these stepwise
transformations can be interleaved with attack tree analysis thus providing a
fully formal security engineering framework. The process is illustrated on an
IoT healthcare case study introducing GDPR requirements and blockchain.
