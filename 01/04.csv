  Process Switching","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1904.11456",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the synthesis of mode switching protocols for a class of
discrete-time switched linear systems in which the mode jumps are governed by
Markov decision processes (MDPs). We call such systems MDP-JLS for brevity.
Each state of the MDP corresponds to a mode in the switched system. The
probabilistic state transitions in the MDP represent the mode transitions. We
focus on finding a policy that selects the switching actions at each mode such
that the switched system that follows these actions is guaranteed to be stable.
Given a policy in the MDP, the considered MDP-JLS reduces to a Markov jump
linear system (MJLS). {We consider both mean-square stability and stability
with probability one. For mean-square stability, we leverage existing stability
conditions for MJLSs and propose efficient semidefinite programming
formulations to find a stabilizing policy in the MDP. For stability with
probability one, we derive new sufficient conditions and compute a stabilizing
policy using linear programming. We also extend the policy synthesis results to
MDP-JLS with uncertain mode transition probabilities.

fundamental process in magnetized plasmas. It is associated with energy release
in regions of magnetic field annihilation, but this is only one facet of this
process. Astrophysical flows normally have very large Reynolds numbers and are
expected to be turbulent, in agreement with observations. In strong turbulence
magnetic lines constantly reconnect everywhere at all scales, making magnetic
reconnection an intrinsic part of turbulent cascade. We note that this is
inconsistent with the usual practice of regarding magnetic lines as persistent
dynamical elements. A number of theoretical, numerical, and observational
studies, starting with Lazarian & Vishniac (1999), demonstrated that 3D
turbulence makes magnetic reconnection fast and that these two processes are
intrinsically connected. We discuss the dramatic violation of the textbook
concept of magnetic flux-freezing in the presence of turbulence and demonstrate
that in the presence of turbulence the plasma effects are subdominant to
turbulence as far as the magnetic reconnection is concerned. This justifies an
MHD-like treatment of magnetic reconnection at scales much larger than the
relevant plasma scales. We discuss numerical and observational evidences
supporting the turbulent reconnection model. In particular, we show that
tearing reconnection is suppressed in 3D and, unlike the 2D case, the 3D
reconnection induces turbulence that makes reconnection independent of
resistivity. We show that turbulent reconnection dramatically affects the key
astrophysical processes, e.g., star formation, turbulent dynamo, acceleration
of cosmic rays. We provide criticism of the concept of ""reconnection-mediated
turbulence"" and explain why turbulent reconnection is very different from
enhanced turbulent resistivity and hyper-resistivity, and why the latter has
fatal conceptual flaws.

technology that can add a wide range of new capabilities to the current network

UAVs, they can be deployed as temporary base stations (BSs) for on-demand
situations like BS overloading or natural disasters. In this work, a UAV-based
communication system with radio frequency (RF) access links to the mobile users
(MUs) and a free-space optical (FSO) backhaul link to the ground station (GS)
is considered. In particular, the RF and FSO channels in this network depend on
the UAV's positioning and (in)stability. The relative position of the UAV with
respect to the MUs impacts the likelihood of a line-of-sight (LOS) connection
in the RF link and the instability of the hovering UAV affects the quality of
the FSO channel. Thus, taking these effects into account, we analyze the

Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed analytical derivations

fluctuations caused by the UAV's instability. Our simulations also show that
the ergodic sum rate of both BA and non-BA UAV-based relays can be enhanced
considerably by optimizing the positioning of the UAV. We further study the

This theory is inspired by Stahl--Totik regularity for orthogonal polynomials,

in terms of the potential theoretic Green function with a pole at $\infty$,
logarithmic capacity, and the equilibrium measure for the support of the
measure, notions which do not extend to the case of unbounded spectra. For any
half-line Schr\""odinger operator with a bounded potential (in a locally $L^1$

condition, and moreover, that the Martin function at $\infty$ obeys the
two-term asymptotic expansion $\sqrt{-z} + \frac{a}{2\sqrt{-z}} + o(\frac
1{\sqrt{-z}})$ as $z \to -\infty$. The constant $a$ in that expansion plays the
role of a renormalized Robin constant suited for Schr\""odinger operators and
enters a universal inequality $a \le \liminf_{x\to\infty} \frac 1x \int_0^x

their high performance, wide field-of-view (FOV) unreachable from traditional
telescope optics, and modest cost. The machining and assembly tolerances for
commercially available optical systems cause a slight misalignment (tilt)
between the lens and CCD, resulting in PSF degradation. We have built an
automated alignment system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing 4
degrees of freedom - 2 tilt axes, a separation axis (the distance between the
CCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by turning
the lens focusing ring which moves the optical elements relative to one
another) in a compact and low-cost package. The Robotilters remove tilt and
optimize focus at the sub 10 micron level, are completely automated, take 2
hours to run, and remain stable for multiple years once aligned. The
Robotilters were built for the Evryscope telescope (a 780 MPix 22-camera array
with an 8150 sq.deg. field of view and continuous 2-minute cadence) designed to
detect short timescale events across extremely large sky areas simultaneously.
Variance in quality across the image field, especially the corners and edges
compared to the center, is a significant challenge in wide-field astronomical
surveys like the Evryscope. The individual star PSFs (which typically extend
only a few pixels) are highly susceptible to slight increases in optical
aberrations in this situation. The Robotilter solution resulted in a limiting
magnitude improvement of .5 mag in the center of the image and 1.0 mag in the
corners for typical Evryscope cameras, with less distorted and smaller PSFs
(half the extent in the corners and edges in many cases). In this paper we
describe the Robotilter mechanical and software design, camera alignment
results, long term stability, and image improvement.

performance of many efficient algorithms for the solution of discretized PDEs,

Fourier analysis is that it can be used to minimize an estimate of the spectral
radius of a stationary iteration, or the condition number of a preconditioned
system, in terms of a symbol representation of the algorithm. In practice, this
is a ""minimax"" problem, minimizing with respect to solver parameters the
appropriate measure of work, which involves maximizing over the Fourier
frequency. Often, several algorithmic parameters may be determined by local
Fourier analysis in order to obtain efficient algorithms. Analytical solutions
to minimax problems are rarely possible beyond simple problems; the status quo
in local Fourier analysis involves grid sampling, which is prohibitively
expensive in high dimensions. In this paper, we propose and explore
optimization algorithms to solve these problems efficiently. Several examples,
with known and unknown analytical solutions, are presented to show the

arrive in random order. Once we observe an item we need to irrevocably decide
whether or not to accept it. The set of selected elements should form an
independent set of the matroid. The goal is to maximize the total sum of the
values assigned to these elements.
  We introduce a version of this problem motivated by the shortlist model in
[Agrawal et al.]. In this setting, the algorithm is allowed to choose a subset
of items as part of a shortlist, possibly more than $k=rk(\mathcal{M})$ items.
Then, after seeing the entire input, the algorithm can choose an independent
subset from the shortlist. Furthermore we generalize the objective function to
any monotone submodular function. Is there an online algorithm achieve a
constant competitive ratio using a shortlist of size $O(k)$? We design an
algorithm that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ competitive
ratio for any constant $\epsilon>0$, using a shortlist of size $O(k)$. This is
especially surprising considering that the best known competitive ratio for the
matroid secretary problem is $O(\log \log k)$.
  An important application of our algorithm is for the random order streaming
of submodular functions. We show that our algorithm can be implemented in the
streaming setting using $O(k)$ memory. It achieves a
$\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^2-\epsilon-O(1/k))$ approximation. The previously best known
approximation ratio for streaming submodular maximization under matroid

synthetic RM observations through the ICM of a galaxy cluster drawn from an MHD

uncertainties. Despite the simplicity of some assumptions, and unknown physical
parameters, we are able to extract an approximate magnitude of the central
magnetic field within an apparently irreducible uncertain factor approximately
3. Principal, largely irreducible, uncertainties come from the unknown depth

coherence lengths from area-constrained polarization sampling, and the unknown
scaling between ICM electron density and magnetic field strength. The

molecular beam epitaxy to grow thin films of topological insulator Bi2Te3 on a
cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x, and study the surface of Bi2Te3 using low-temperature
scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. In few unit-cell thick Bi2Te3
films, we find a V-shaped gap-like feature at the Fermi energy in dI/dV
spectra. By reducing the coverage of Bi2Te3 films to create nanoscale islands,
we discover that this spectral feature dramatically evolves into a much larger
hard gap, which can be understood as a Coulomb blockade gap. This conclusion is
supported by the evolution of dI/dV spectra with the lateral size of Bi2Te3
islands, as well as by topographic measurements that show an additional barrier
separating Bi2Te3 and Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x. We conclude that the prominent gap-like
feature in dI/dV spectra in Bi2Te3 films is not a proximity-induced
superconducting gap. Instead, it can be explained by Coulomb blockade effects,
which take into account additional resistive and capacitive coupling at the
interface. Our experiments provide a fresh insight into the tunneling
measurements of complex heterostructures with buried interfaces.

intelligent behavior from selfish individual agents. Agents' behavior is
modeled using our proposed selfish algorithm ($SA$) with three learning
mechanisms: reinforced learning ($SAL$), trust ($SAT$) and connection ($SAC$).
Each of these mechanisms provides a distinctly different way an agent can
increase the individual benefit accrued through playing the prisoner's dilemma
game ($PDG$) with other agents. The $SA$ provides a generalization of the
self-organized temporal criticality ($SOTC$) model and shows that
self-interested individuals can simultaneously produce maximum social benefit
from their decisions. The mechanisms in the $SA$ are self-tuned by the internal
dynamics and without having a pre-established network structure. Our results
demonstrate emergence of mutual cooperation, emergence of dynamic networks, and
adaptation and resilience of social systems after perturbations. The
implications and applications of the $SA$ are discussed.

further the theories of stellar moves and cellular maps. We prove that the
domination closure of selection maps contains the class of face-preserving
simplicial maps that are cellular on each face of the $n$-simplex and is
contained in the class of simplicial, face-preserving near-homeomorphisms.
Under the PL-Poincar\'e conjecture, this gives a characterization of the

interactions between elastic multipoles that depend on particle shape,
topology, chirality, boundary conditions and induced topological defects. Here,
we describe a nematic colloidal system consisting of mesostructures of gold
capable of inducing elastic multipoles of different order. Elastic monopoles
are formed by relatively large asymmetric mesoflower particles, for which
gravity and elastic torque balancing yields monopole-type interactions.
High-order multipoles are instead formed by smaller mesoflowers with a myriad
of shapes corresponding to multipoles of different orders, consistent with our
computer simulations based on free energy minimization. We reveal unexpected
many-body interactions in this colloidal system, ranging from de-mixing of
elastic monopoles to a zoo of unusual colloidal crystals formed by high-order
multipoles like hexadecapoles. Our findings show that gold mesoflowers may
serve as a designer toolkit for engineering colloidal interaction and
self-assembly, potentially exceeding that in atomic and molecular systems.

provides an immunity of the skyrmion spin texture to moderate external magnetic

critical requirements for enhancing the mobile broadband services and user
experience. Long-term evolution (LTE) networks have adopted discontinuous
reception (DRX) as the baseline solution for prolonged battery lifetime.
However, in every DRX cycle, the mobile device baseband processing unit
monitors and decodes the control signaling, and thus all instances without any
actual data allocation leads to unnecessary energy consumption. This fact
together with the long start-up and power-down times can prevent adopting
frequent wake-up instants, which in turn leads to considerable latency. In this
work,a novel wake-up scheme is described and studied, to tackle the trade-off
between latency and battery lifetime in future 5G networks, seeking thus to
facilitate an always-available experience, rather than always-on. Analytical
and simulation-based results show that the proposed scheme is a promising
approach to control the user plane latency and energy consumption, when the
device is operating in the power saving mode. The aim of this article is to
describe the overall wake-up system operating principle and the associated
signaling methods,receiver processing solutions and essential implementation
aspects. Additionally, the advantages compared to DRX-based systems are shown
and demonstrated, through the analysis of the system energy-efficiency and
latency characteristics, with special emphasis on future 5G-grade mobile
devices

where Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are shown to converge to a Gaussian

results do not apply to architectures that require one or more of the hidden
layers to remain narrow. In this paper, we consider the wide limit of BNNs
where some hidden layers, called ""bottlenecks"", are held at finite width. The
result is a composition of GPs that we term a ""bottleneck neural network
Gaussian process"" (bottleneck NNGP). Although intuitive, the subtlety of the
proof is in showing that the wide limit of a composition of networks is in fact
the composition of the limiting GPs. We also analyze theoretically a
single-bottleneck NNGP, finding that the bottleneck induces dependence between
the outputs of a multi-output network that persists through extreme
post-bottleneck depths, and prevents the kernel of the network from losing
discriminative power at extreme post-bottleneck depths.

Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACT) is difficult because of high level of
charged cosmic ray background and small field-of-view. We show that such a
measurement is nevertheless possible in the energy band 10-100 TeV. The minimal
charged particle background for IACTs is achieved in event selections used for
the analyses of the cosmic ray electrons. Tight cuts on the event quality in
these event selections allow to achieve the background level sufficiently low
to allow the measurements of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray flux above 10 TeV.
We calculate the sensitivities of different types of IACT arrays for the
Galactic diffuse emission measurements and compare them with the diffuse
gamma-ray flux from different parts of the sky measured by the Fermi Large Area
Telescope below 3 TeV and with the astrophysical neutrino signal measured by
IceCube telescope. We show that deep exposure of existing IACT systems is
sufficient for detection of the diffuse flux from all the Galactic Plane up to
Galactic latitude |b|~ degrees. Medium Size Telescope array of CTA will be able
to detect the diffuse flux up 30 degree Galactic latitude. Its sensitivity will
be sufficient for detection of the gamma-ray counterpart of the Galactic
component of the IceCube astrophysical neutrino signal above 10 TeV. We also
propose that a dedicated IACT system composed of small but wide field-of-view
telescopes could be used for mapping the 10-100 TeV the diffuse gamma-ray

(GBM) data for gamma-ray transients coincident with the compact binary
coalescences observed by the gravitational-wave (GW) detectors Advanced LIGO
and Advanced Virgo during their first and second observing runs. In particular,
we perform follow-up for both confirmed events and low significance candidates
reported in the LIGO/Virgo catalog GWTC-1. We search for temporal coincidences
between these GW signals and GBM triggered gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We also use
the GBM Untargeted and Targeted subthreshold searches to find coincident
gamma-rays below the on-board triggering threshold. This work implements a
refined statistical approach by incorporating GW astrophysical source
probabilities and GBM visibilities of LIGO/Virgo sky localizations to search
for cumulative signatures of coincident subthreshold gamma-rays. All search
methods recover the short gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A occurring ~1.7 s after
the binary neutron star merger GW170817. We also present results from a new
search seeking GBM counterparts to LIGO single-interferometer triggers. This
search finds a candidate joint event, but given the nature of the GBM signal
and localization, as well as the high joint false alarm rate of $1.1 \times
10^{-6}$ Hz, we do not consider it an astrophysical association. We find no
additional coincidences.

play a critical role in the weak r process, becoming the main mechanism to
drive nuclear matter towards heavier elements. In this paper we summarize the
sensitivity of network-calculated abundances to the astrophysical conditions,
and to uncertainties in the ($\alpha,n$) reaction rates. A list of few
($\alpha,n$) reactions were identified to dominate the uncertainty in the

to establish the corresponding limit theory, as well as the equivalence between
different formulations, including the strong, weak and relaxed formulation. In
contrast to the strong formulation, where the problem is formulated on a fixed
probability space equipped with two Brownian filtrations, the weak formulation
is obtained by considering a more general probability space with two
filtrations satisfying an $(H)$-hypothesis type condition from the theory of
enlargement of filtrations. When the common noise is uncontrolled, our relaxed
formulation is obtained by considering a suitable controlled martingale
problem. As for classical optimal control problems, we prove that the set of
all relaxed controls is the closure of the set of all strong controls, when
considered as probability measures on the canonical space. Consequently, we
obtain the equivalence of the different formulations of the control problem,
under additional mild regularity conditions on the reward functions. This is
also a crucial technical step to prove the limit theory of the McKean-Vlasov
control problem, that is to say proving that it consists in the limit of a
large population control problem with common noise.

in statistical physics and computer science. High quality solutions of NP-hard
combinatorial optimization problems can be encoded into low energy states of
spin-glass systems. In general, evaluating the relevant physical and
computational properties of such models is difficult due to critical slowing
down near a phase transition. Ideally, one could use recent advances in deep
learning for characterizing the low-energy properties of these complex systems.
Unfortunately, many of the most promising machine learning approaches are only
valid for distributions over continuous variables and thus cannot be directly
applied to discrete spin-glass models. To this end, we develop a continuous
probability density theory for spin-glass systems with arbitrary dimensions,
interactions, and local fields. We show how our formulation geometrically
encodes key physical and computational properties of the spin-glass in an
instance-wise fashion without the need for quenched disorder averaging. We show
that our approach is beyond the mean-field theory and identify a transition
from a convex to non-convex energy landscape as the temperature is lowered past
a critical temperature. We apply our formalism to a number of spin-glass models
including the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model, spins on random
Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, and random restricted Boltzmann machines.

reactions and intracrustal differentiation on magma chemistry across mid-ocean
ridges, intraplate settings and subduction zones using experimental studies and
natural data. We compare melting behaviors of pyroxenites and peridotites and
their relative contributions to magmas as functions of composition, mantle
potential temperatures and lithospheric thickness. We also discuss the fate of
chemically distinct melts derived from heterogeneities as they travel through a
peridotitic mantle. Using nearly 60,000 natural major element compositions of
volcanic rocks, melt inclusions, and crystalline cumulates, we assess broad
petrogenetic trends in as large of a global dataset as possible. Consistent
with previous studies, major element chemistry of mid-ocean ridge basalts
(MORBs) and their cumulates favor a first-order control of intracrustal
crystal-liquid segregation, while trace element studies emphasize the role of
melt-rock reactions, highlighting the decoupling between the two. Ocean island
basalts (OIB) show a larger compositional variability than MORB, partly
attributed to large variations of pyroxenite proportions in the mantle source.
However, the estimated proportions vary considerably with heterogeneity
composition, melting model and thermal structure of the mantle. For arcs, we
highlight current views on the role of the downgoing slab into the source of
primary arc magmas, and the role of the overriding lithosphere as a magmatic
chemical filter and as the repository of voluminous arc cumulates. Our approach
of simultaneously looking at a large database of volcanic + deep crustal rocks
across diverse tectonic settings underscores the challenge of deciphering the
source signal versus intracrustal/lithospheric processes.

interferometry (VLBI) data for a complete VLBI-flux-density limited sample of
active galactic nuclei (AGN). We address the problem of the origin of
astrophysical neutrinos with energies above 200 TeV in a statistical manner. It
is found that AGN positionally associated with IceCube events have typically
stronger parsec-scale cores than the rest of the sample. The post-trial
probability of a chance coincidence is 0.2%. We select the four strongest AGN
as highly probable associations: 3C 279, NRAO 530, PKS 1741-038, and PKS
2145+067. Moreover, we find an increase of radio emission at frequencies above
10 GHz around neutrino arrival times for several other VLBI-selected AGN on the
basis of RATAN-600 monitoring. The most pronounced example of such behavior is
PKS 1502+106. We conclude that AGN with bright Doppler-boosted jets constitute
an important population of neutrino sources. High-energy neutrinos are produced
in their central parsec-scale regions, probably in proton-photon interactions
at or around the accretion disk. Radio-bright AGN that are likely associated
with neutrinos have very diverse gamma-ray properties suggesting that
gamma-rays and neutrinos may be produced in different regions of AGN and not
directly related. A small viewing angle of the jet-disk axis is, however,
required to detect either of them.

merger the last 4 Gyr, 8 Gyr, or 12 Gyr compared to analogs that have not
experienced a 4:1 merger in the same time frame. The subset of analogs that
have had a 4:1 merger within the last 4 Gyr are also similar to AD measurements
of stars in the disk of M31, providing evidence that M31 may in fact have
recently merged with a galaxy nearly one fourth of its mass. Further work using
high resolution zoom in simulations is required to explore the contribution of
internal heating to AD.

The neutron stars can be substituded by more massive black holes as well.
Hence, the topic of gamma-ray bursts (mainly the topic of short ones) and the
topic of massive binaries, are strongly connected.
  In this contribution, the redshifts of GRBs are studied. The surprising

develop effective numerical methods in a variety of practical matching

bilateral quasi birth-and-death (QBD) process which has its own interest. Based
on this, we provide a detailed analysis for both the bilateral QBD process and
the double-ended queue, including the system stability, the queue size

any arriving customers. Furthermore, we develop three effective algorithms for
computing the performance measures (i.e., the probabilities of stationary queue

of the double-ended queue with non-Poisson inputs. Finally, we use some
numerical examples in tabular and graphical to illustrate how the performance
measures are influenced by some key system parameters. We believe that the

distinct from their bulk counterparts, it is often difficult to predict what
properties will emerge. The complex energy landscape of the synthesis process
is also strongly influenced by non-equilibrium growth conditions imposed by the
substrate, as well as the kinetics of thin film crystallization and
fluctuations in process variables, all of which can lead to significant
deviations from targeted outcomes. High-resolution structural and chemical

breakup of exo-asteroids. Understanding the physical and orbital history of
this debris would enable us to self-consistently link planetary system
formation and fate. One major debris reservoir is generated by YORP-induced
rotational fission during the giant branch phases of stellar evolution, where
the stellar luminosity can exceed the Sun's by four orders of magnitude. Here,
we determine the efficacy of the giant branch YORP effect for asteroids with
nonzero internal strength, and model post-fission evolution by imposing simple
analytic fragmentation prescriptions. We find that even the highest realistic
internal strengths cannot prevent the widespread fragmentation of asteroids and
the production of a debris field over 100 au in size. We compute the number of
successive fission events as they occur in progressively smaller time intervals
as the star ascends the giant branches, providing a way to generate size
distributions of asteroid fragments. The results are highly insensitive to
progenitor stellar mass. We also conclude that the ease with which giant branch
YORP breakup can generate binary asteroid subsystems is strongly dependent on
internal strength. Formed binary subsystems in turn could be short-lived due to
the resulting luminosity-enhanced BYORP effect.

jets that can successfully break out of the surrounding ejecta. At the same
time, the association with a kilonova provided unprecedented information
regarding the physical properties (such as masses and velocities) of the
different ejecta constituents. Combining this knowledge with the observed
luminosities and durations of cosmological sGRBs detected by the Burst Alert
Telescope (BAT) onboard the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, we revisit the
breakout conditions of sGRB jets. Assuming self-collimation of sGRB jets does
not play a critical role, we find that the time interval between the binary
merger and the launching of a typical sGRB jet is $\lesssim0.1$~s. We also show
that for a fraction of at least $\sim 30\%$ of sGRBs, the usually adopted
assumption of static ejecta is inconsistent with observations, even if the
polar ejecta mass is an order of magnitude smaller than the one in GRB 170817.

suggest that the observed delay of $\sim 1.$7~s in GW 170817 /GRB 170817

However, characterizing the transition between the atomic and the molecular
interstellar medium (ISM) is a difficult observational task. Here we address
cloud formation processes by combining HSIA with molecular line data. One
scenario proposed by numerical simulations is that the column density
probability density functions (N-PDF) evolves from a log-normal shape at early
times to a power-law-like shape at later times. In this paper, we study the
cold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38a (d=3.4 kpc,
length$\sim230$ pc). We identify an extended HISA feature, which is partly
correlated with the 13CO emission. The peak velocities of the HISA and 13CO
observations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity
offset of approximately 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found on the western side. The sonic
Mach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large
fraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at
subsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM is on the
order of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density of molecular
hydrogen is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI
emission (WNM+CNM), and 13CO (molecular component) are well described by
log-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the
main driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows
a power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We
suggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the
filament. The eastern subregion seems to be forming a molecular cloud out of
the atomic gas, whereas the western subregion already shows high column density
peaks, active star formation and evidence of related feedback processes.

embedded inside complicated enclosures which lack any type of (geometric or
hidden) symmetry, such as complex networks, buildings, or vessels, where the
hypersensitive nature of multiple interference paths challenges the viability
of WFS protocols. We demonstrate the success of a new and general WFS scheme,
based on coherent perfect absorption (CPA) electromagnetic protocols, by
utilizing a network of coupled transmission lines with complex connectivity
that enforces the absence of geometric symmetries. Our platform allows for
control of the local losses inside the network and of the violation of
time-reversal symmetry via a magnetic field; thus establishing CPA beyond its
initial concept as the time-reversal of a laser cavity, while offering an
opportunity for better insight into CPA formation via the implementation of
semiclassical tools.

most similar pairs of genes (reciprocal best hits) as an approximation for
evolutionary most closely related pairs of genes (reciprocal best matches).
This approximation of best matches by best hits becomes exact for ultrametric
dissimilarities, i.e., under the Molecular Clock Hypothesis. It fails, however,
whenever there are large lineage specific rate variations among paralogous
genes. In practice, this introduces a high level of noise into the input data
for best-hit-based orthology detection methods. If additive distances between
genes are known, then evolutionary most closely related pairs can be identified
by considering certain quartets of genes provided that in each quartet the
outgroup relative to the remaining three genes is known. \emph{A priori}
knowledge of underlying species phylogeny greatly facilitates the
identification of the required outgroup. Although the workflow remains a
heuristic since the correct outgroup cannot be determined reliably in all
cases, simulations with lineage specific biases and rate asymmetries show that
nearly perfect results can be achieved. In a realistic setting, where distances
data have to be estimated from sequence data and hence are noisy, it is still
possible to obtain highly accurate sets of best matches. Improvements of
tree-free orthology assessment methods can be expected from a combination of
the accurate inference of best matches reported here and recent mathematical
advances in the understanding of (reciprocal) best match graphs and orthology
relations.

For 29 alloy/interstitial combinations the formation of stable alloys with

induces a tetragonal distortion with substantial uniaxial MAE for realistic N

power-law tails due to dynamics that resembles preferential attachment models.
In the model we study, a population is partitioned into sites, with each site
labeled by a uniquely-assigned real number in the interval $[0,1]$ known as
fitness. The population size is a discrete-time transient birth-and-death
process with probability $p$ of birth and $1-p$ of death. The fitness is
assigned at birth according to the following rule: the new member of the

existing site with probability proportional to the site's size. At each death
event, a member from the site with the lowest fitness is killed. The number of

instability, which was considered as a potential source of the generation of
the high energy ions in scrape-off layer (SOL) during FW injection in tokamaks,
is derived analytically for arbitrary values of the FW electric field and
wavelengths of the unstable IC perturbations. The comprehensive numerical
analysis of the dispersion equation for three wave system which contains the IC
mode $\varphi_{i}\left(\mathbf{k}_{i}, \omega\right)$ and its harmonics
$\varphi_{i}\left(\mathbf{k}_{i}, \omega-\omega_{0}\right)$, $\varphi_{i}
\left(\mathbf{k}_{i}, \omega-2\omega_{0}\right)$, where $\omega_{0}$ is FW
frequency, is performed. It reveals that the parametric IC instability for this
wave system has the maximum growth rate for the IC waves with wavelength
comparable with the thermal ion Larmor radius. It is found that the inverse
electron Landau damping plays essential role in the development of this
instability. The possible mechanism of the saturation of this instability is
the scattering of ions by the ensemble of the IC waves with random phases,
which limits the development of the instability on the high level. The
anomalous heating rates of ions resulted from the interactions of ions with
parametric IC turbulence is determined employing the developed quasilinear
theory for the IC quasimode decay instability. The derived results reveals,
that the experimentally observed anisotropic heating of cold SOL ions may be
caused by the parametric IC turbulence in SOL. However, the IC parametric
turbulence is unlikely to be responsible for the experimentally observed bursts

vibrations of the substrate. As previously evidenced
\cite{Brunet07,Brunet09,Noblin09}, the mechanical vibrations induce drop
deformations which combine axisymmetric and antisymmetric modes. In this paper,
we establish quantitative trends from experiments conducted within a large
range of parameters, namely the amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$ of the forcing,
the liquid viscosity $\eta$ and the angle between the substrate and the forcing
axis $\alpha$. These experiments are carried out on weak-pinning substrates.
For most parameters sets, the averaged velocity $<v>$ grows linearly with $A$.
We extract the mobility, defined as $s=\frac{\Delta <v>}{\Delta A}$. It is
found that $s$ can show a sharp maximal value close to the resonance frequency
of the first axisymmetric mode $f_p$. The value of $s$ tends to be almost
independent on $\eta$ below 50 cSt, while $s$ decreases significantly for
higher $\eta$. Also, it is found that for peculiar sets of parameters,
particularly with $f$ far enough from $f_p$, the drop moves in the reverse
direction. Finally, we draw a relationship between $<v>$ and the averaged
values of the dynamical contact angles at both sides of the drop over one
period of oscillation.

incorrect responses identified were consistent with the item groups described
in previous works. As in the work with the FCI, the network was simplified by
only retaining nodes selected by a substantial number of students. Retaining
nodes selected by 20\% of the students produced communities associated with
only four misconceptions. The incorrect response communities identified for men
and women were substantially different, as was the change in these communities
from pretest to post-test. The 20% threshold was far more restrictive than the
4% threshold applied to the FCI in the prior work which generated similar

were generally associated with common misconceptions producing a far richer set
of incorrect communities than the FCI; this may indicate that the FMCE is a
superior instrument for characterizing the breadth of student misconceptions

individual, are often collected and managed by autonomous data collection
services that may have different privacy policies. Answering many end-users'
legitimate queries requires the integration of data from multiple such
services. However, data integration is often hindered by the lack of a trusted
entity, often called a mediator, with which the services can share their data
and delegate the enforcement of their privacy policies. In this paper, we
propose a flexible privacy-preserving data integration approach for answering
data integration queries without the need for a trusted mediator. In our
approach, services are allowed to enforce their privacy policies locally. The
mediator is considered to be untrusted, and only has access to encrypted
information to allow it to link data subjects across the different services.
Services, by virtue of a new privacy requirement, dubbed k-Protection, limiting
privacy leaks, cannot infer information about the data held by each other.
End-users, in turn, have access to privacy-sanitized data only. We evaluated
our approach using an example and a real dataset from the healthcare
application domain. The results are promising from both the privacy
preservation and the performance perspectives.

engines by bounding the maximal amount of mechanical energy produced compared
to the amount of heat required. While this was accomplished early on, by Carnot
and Clausius, the more practical problem to quantify limits of power that can
be delivered, remained elusive due to the fact that quasistatic processes
require infinitely slow cycling, resulting in a vanishing power output. Recent
insights, drawn from stochastic models, appear to bridge the gap between theory
and practice in that they lead to physically meaningful expressions for the
dissipation cost in operating a thermodynamic engine over a finite time window.
Building on this framework of {\em stochastic thermodynamics} we derive bounds
on the maximal power that can be drawn by cycling an overdamped ensemble of
particles via a time-varying potential while alternating contact with heat
baths of different temperature ($T_c$ cold, and $T_h$ hot). Specifically,
assuming a suitable bound $M$ on the spatial gradient of the controlling
potential, we show that the maximal achievable power is bounded by
$\frac{M}{8}(\frac{T_h}{T_c}-1)$. Moreover, we show that this bound can be
reached to within a factor of $(\frac{T_h}{T_c}-1)/(\frac{T_h}{T_c}+1)$ by
operating the cyclic thermodynamic process with a quadratic potential.

distribution of the EGB is well described as a power-law with a spectral index
approximately equal to 2.3, and an exponential cutoff, that is consistent with
being the effect of absorption of high energy photons assuming an emission that
is an unbroken power-law spectrum. The observations of the Fermi telescope have
also resolved the EGB, determining that most of it is formed by the sum of the
contributions of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) of the blazar class. The spectra
of the individual AGN sources have a broad range of spectral shapes, and the
brightest and most precisely measured sources have curved spectra that can be
fitted with the ""log-parabola"" (or log-normal) form. It might appear surprising
that the sum of contributions with different spectral shapes generate a
spectrum that has a simple power-law form. We suggest that this fact reveals
some important properties for the ensemble of the extragalactic sources, and
indicates that the blazar high energy emission can be considered as a ""critical
phenomenon"". A curved log--parabola (log-normal) form is also required to fit
the spectra of many Galactic gamma-ray sources, including the emission from the
brightest supernova remnants (SNR), and an intriguing possibility is that also
the Galactic cosmic rays are injected in interstellar space by their sources
not with a single universal power-law spectrum, as predicted by the commonly
accepted models, but instead with a broad range of spectral shapes.

The different resolutions are modeled as different views of the data in a

calibrate the model inverse temperature to the specific conditions present in

theoretically predicted distributions of surface displacement to match the
experimental measurements with surprising detail. Prompted by the presence of
surface slope in the TKdV Hamiltonian, we present new experimental measurements
on surface slope statistics and compare them to model predictions. Analysis of
some deterministic trajectories of TKdV elucidates the experimental length and
time scales required for the statistical transition to a skewed state. Finally,
the theory predicts a peculiar relationship between the outgoing displacement
skewness and the change in slope variance, specifically how their ratio depends

gender were not a factor in referencing. Importantly, we show that this
overcitation of men and undercitation of women is driven largely by the
citation practices of men, and is increasing over time as the field becomes
more diverse. We develop a co-authorship network to assess homophily in
researchers' social networks, and we find that men tend to overcite men even
when their social networks are representative. We discuss possible mechanisms
and consider how individual researchers might address these findings in their
own practices.

the role of DNA chain length on their self-assembly. We find that the
increasing chain length for a given particle size decreases the propensity to
form ordered crystalline assemblies, and instead, disordered structures start
to form when the chain length exceeds a certain threshold, which is consistent
with the previous experiments. Further analysis of the simulation data suggests
weakening interparticle interactions with increasing chain length, thereby
shifting the suitable assembly conditions to lower temperatures at which
assembly dynamics are unfavorable. This highlights a complex interplay between
thermodynamics and dynamics, which we suggest can be modulated by changing the
system parameters such as DNA grafting density, resulting in successful
crystallization of particles with longer DNA chain lengths. Our results
highlight the power of computational modeling in elucidating the fundamental
design principles and guiding the assembly of nanoparticles to form complex

relying mainly on visual examination. Here we present an automated semantic
segmentation method called ""Multiscale Encoder-Decoder Network (MED-Net)"" that
provides pixel-wise labeling into classes of patterns in a quantitative manner.
The novelty in our approach is the modeling of textural patterns at multiple
scales. This mimics the procedure for examining pathology images, which
routinely starts with low magnification (low resolution, large field of view)
followed by closer inspection of suspicious areas with higher magnification
(higher resolution, smaller fields of view). We trained and tested our model on
non-overlapping partitions of 117 reflectance confocal microscopy (RCM) mosaics
of melanocytic lesions, an extensive dataset for this application, collected at
four clinics in the US, and two in Italy. With patient-wise cross-validation,
we achieved pixel-wise mean sensitivity and specificity of $70\pm11\%$ and
$95\pm2\%$, respectively, with $0.71\pm0.09$ Dice coefficient over six classes.
In the scenario, we partitioned the data clinic-wise and tested the
generalizability of the model over multiple clinics. In this setting, we
achieved pixel-wise mean sensitivity and specificity of $74\%$ and $95\%$,

items among a population of $n$ items, where $d$ is usually much smaller than
$n$. The outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has
at least $u$ defective items, negative if it has up to $\ell$ defective items,
where $0\leq\ell<u$, and arbitrary otherwise. This is called threshold group
testing. The parameter $g=u-\ell-1$ is called \textit{the gap}. In this paper,
we focus on the case $g>0$, i.e., threshold group testing with a gap. Note that
the results presented here are also applicable to the case $g = 0$; however,
the results are not as efficient as those in related work. Currently, a few
reported studies have investigated test designs and decoding algorithms for
identifying defective items. Most of the previous studies have not been
feasible because there are numerous constraints on their problem settings or
the decoding complexities of their proposed schemes are relatively large.
Therefore, it is compulsory to reduce the number of tests as well as the
decoding complexity, i.e., the time for identifying the defective items, for
achieving practical schemes.
  The work presented here makes five contributions. The first is a more
accurate theorem for a non-adaptive algorithm for threshold group testing
proposed by Chen and Fu. The second is an improvement in the construction of
disjunct matrices, which are the main tools for tackling (threshold) group
testing and other tasks such as constructing cover-free families or learning
hidden graphs. The third and fourth contributions are a reduced exact upper
bound on the number of tests and a reduced asymptotic bound on the decoding
time for identifying defective items in a noisy setting on test outcomes. The
fifth contribution is a simulation on the number of tests of the resulting
improvements for previous work and the proposed theorems.

Here, we quantitatively map the strain present in rhodium@platinum (core@shell)

transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and the recently developed technique of
4D-STEM nanobeam electron diffraction. We demonstrate that 4D-STEM combined
with data pre-conditioning allows for quantitative lattice strain mapping with
sub-picometer precision without the influence of scan distortions. When
combined with multivariate curve resolution, 4D-STEM allows us to distinguish
the nanocube core from the shell and to quantify the unit cell size as a
function of distance from the core-shell interface. Our results demonstrate
that 4D-STEM has significant precision and accuracy advantages in strain
metrology of catalyst materials compared to aberration-corrected STEM imaging
and is beneficial for extracting information about the evolution of strain in
catalyst nanoparticles.

Emulating the strategy of the human neuromuscular system may aid the control of

investigated the potential for using the winding filament model (WFM) of muscle
to predict the net muscle moment of the ankle. The long-term goal is to use
this model to improve ankle control of a commercial powered exoskeleton. The
innovation aspects of this study are: First, there have been no commercialized
active ankle exoskeletons available in the market. All the available
exoskeletons have passive ankle joints, which cannot mimic human movement,
especially in normal and fast walking [1]. Second, the Winding Filament Model
Controller (WFMC) is the first control strategy based on a muscle model that
does not use an electromyographic (EMG) signal as an input. The activation,
which is calculated from EMG, is a crucial input parameter for almost all of
the control strategies based on muscle modeling. However, the winding filament
muscle model can predict muscle force by using muscle length as the primary
input, and the activation input signal could be either a square wave [33] or a
simple bell shape function like our study. This is one of the most important
benefits of the WFMC strategy, since it makes this bioinspired strategy
applicable for all patient populations, even those with impaired muscle
activities or without muscle activities (e.g. stroke, spinal cord injury,
Parkinson disease, etc.). Third, the WFMC is adaptive to different tasks like
walking at different speeds, as well as walking over the incline and over
stairs.

The evolution and mass transfer between these O stars determines the spins of
their progeny BH. These will be measurable with future gravitational wave
detectors, incentivizing the measurement of the spins of O stars in binaries.
We previously measured the spins of O stars in Galactic Wolf-Rayet (WR) + O
binaries. Here we measure the vsini of four LMC and two SMC O stars in WR + O
binaries to determine whether lower metallicity might affect the spin rates. We
find that the O stars in Galactic and Magellanic WR + O binaries display
average vsini = 258 +/- 18 km/s and 270 +/- 15 km/s, respectively. Two LMC O
stars measured on successive nights show significant line width variability,
possibly due to differing orbital phases exhibiting different parts of the O
stars illuminated differently by their WR companions. Despite this variability,
the vsini are highly super-synchronous but distinctly subcritical for the O
stars in all these binaries; thus we conclude that an efficient mechanism for
shedding angular momentum from O stars in WR + O binaries must exist. This
mechanism, probably related to Roche lobe overflow-created dynamo magnetic
fields, prevents nearly 100% breakup spin rates, as expected when RLOF
operates, as it must, in these stars. A Spruit-Tayler dynamo and O star wind
might be that mechanism.

the discrete objective function can be calculated exactly, at a computational
cost of solving two Schr\""odinger systems, independently of the number of

functions based on B-splines with built-in carrier waves is also introduced.
The carrier waves are used to specify the frequency spectra of the control

approach allows the number of control parameters to be independent of, and
significantly smaller than, the number of time steps for integrating

unsigned social networks. The existence of negative links piques research
interests in investigating whether properties and principles of signed networks
differ from those of unsigned networks, and mandates dedicated efforts on link
analysis for signed social networks. Recent findings suggest that properties of
signed networks substantially differ from those of unsigned networks and
negative links can be of significant help in signed link analysis in
complementary ways. In this article, we center our discussion on a challenging
problem of signed link analysis. Signed link analysis faces the problem of data
sparsity, i.e. only a small percentage of signed links are given. This problem
can even get worse when negative links are much sparser than positive ones as
users are inclined more towards positive disposition rather than negative. We
investigate how we can take advantage of other sources of information for

arrives. This paper formulates and analyzes a distributed variant of the
classical Krasulina's method (D-Krasulina) that can keep up with the high
streaming rate of data by distributing the computational load across multiple
processing nodes. The analysis shows that---under appropriate
conditions---D-Krasulina converges to the principal eigenvector in an
order-wise optimal manner; i.e., after receiving $M$ samples across all nodes,
its estimation error can be $O(1/M)$. In order to reduce the network
communication overhead, the paper also develops and analyzes a mini-batch
extension of D-Krasulina, which is termed DM-Krasulina. The analysis of
DM-Krasulina shows that it can also achieve order-optimal estimation error
rates under appropriate conditions, even when some samples have to be discarded
within the network due to communication latency. Finally, experiments are
performed over synthetic and real-world data to validate the convergence
behaviors of D-Krasulina and DM-Krasulina in high-rate streaming settings.

can be predicted via variational or material-force-based phase field fracture
models, these models often assume that the underlying elastic response of the
material is non-polar and yet a length scale parameter must be introduced to
enable the sharp cracks represented by a regularized implicit function.
However, many materials with internal microstructures that contain surface
tension, micro-cracks, micro-fracture, inclusion, cavity or those of
particulate nature often exhibit size-dependent behaviors in both the
path-independent and path-dependent regimes. This paper is intended to
introduce a unified treatment that captures the size effect of the materials in
both elastic and damaged states. By introducing a cohesive micropolar phase
field fracture theory, along with the computational model and validation
exercises, we explore the interacting size-dependent elastic deformation and
fracture mechanisms exhibits in materials of complex microstructures. To
achieve this goal, we introduce the distinctive degradation functions of the
force-stress-strain and couple-stress-micro-rotation energy-conjugated pairs
for a given regularization profile such that the macroscopic size-dependent
responses of the micropolar continua is insensitive to the length scale
parameter of the regularized interface. Then, we apply the variational
principle to derive governing equations from the micropolar stored energy and
dissipative functionals. Numerical examples are introduced to demonstrate the
proper way to identify material parameters and the capacity of the new
formulation to simulate complex crack patterns in the quasi-static regime.

that the BNS merger rate within a galaxy at a given epoch depends primarily on
the galaxy's star-formation history as well as the underlying merger time-delay
distribution of the binary systems. The stellar history of a galaxy, meanwhile,
depends on the cosmological evolution of the galaxy through time, and is tied
to the growth of structure in the Universe. We study the hosts of BNS mergers
in the context of structure formation by populating the Universe Machine
simulations with gravitational-wave events~ according to a simple time-delay
model. We find that different time-delay distributions predict different
properties of the associated host galaxies, including the distributions of
stellar mass, star-formation rate, halo mass, and local and large-scale
clustering of hosts. BNSs that merge today with short delay times prefer to be
in hosts that have high star-formation rates, while those with long delay times
live in dense regions within massive halos that have low star formation. We
show that with ${\mathcal O}(10)$ events from current gravitational-wave
detector networks, it is possible to make preliminary distinctions between
formation channels which trace stellar mass, halo mass, or star-formation rate.
We also find that strategies to follow up gravitational-wave events with

maximization for multi-user wireless systems, including multiple access and
broadcast systems. Every time slot an access point observes the current channel
states for each user and opportunistically selects a vector of transmission
rates. Channel state vectors are assumed to be independent and identically
distributed with an unknown probability distribution. The goal is to learn to
make decisions over time that maximize a concave utility function of the
running time average transmission rate of each user. Recently it was shown that
a stochastic Frank-Wolfe algorithm converges to utility-optimality with an
error of $O(\log(T)/T)$, where $T$ is the time the algorithm has been running.
An existing $\Omega(1/T)$ converse is known. The current paper improves the
converse to $\Omega(\log(T)/T)$, which matches the known achievability result.
It does this by constructing a particular (simple) system for which no
algorithm can achieve a better performance. The proof uses a novel reduction of
the opportunistic scheduling problem to a problem of estimating a Bernoulli
probability $p$ from independent and identically distributed samples. Along the
way we refine a regret bound for Bernoulli estimation to show that, for any
sequence of estimators, the set of values $p \in [0,1]$ under which the
estimators perform poorly has measure at least $1/8$.

radiation-driven outflows along the surface of the disc; significant levels of
Poynting-Robertson (PR) drag, leading to enhanced accretion; and prominent
heating in the disc, which increases the height, while lowering the density and
optical depth. The PR drag causes the inner edge of the disc to retreat from
the neutron star surface toward larger radii and then recover on the timescale

applied to investigate density fluctuations around the ground state

especially on the transverse dynamics along the plate surface. Consequently, we
find a crossover scale above which the transverse density dynamics appears
frozen and below which diffusive behavior of counterions can be observed on the

dynamical crossover that is similar to the Wigner-Seitz radius used in

The variations of the band gap under triaxial and biaxial strains are

However, domain-adversarial learning only aligns feature distributions between

On the other hand, self-training utilizes the model predictions to enhance the
discrimination of target features, but it is unable to explicitly align domain

propose a novel method called Adversarial-Learned Loss for Domain Adaptation

matrix, which is learned through an adversarial manner in ALDA, to reduce the
gap and align the feature distributions. Finally, a new loss function is
auto-constructed from the learned confusion matrix, which serves as the loss
for unlabeled target samples. Our ALDA outperforms state-of-the-art approaches

hence speed up the inference of deep networks. Existing pruning methods either
train from scratch with sparsity constraints or minimize the reconstruction
error between the feature maps of the pre-trained models and the compressed
ones. Both strategies suffer from some limitations: the former kind is
computationally expensive and difficult to converge, while the latter kind
optimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative power of
channels. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective method called
discrimination-aware channel pruning (DCP) to choose the channels that actually
contribute to the discriminative power. Note that a channel often consists of a
set of kernels. Besides the redundancy in channels, some kernels in a channel
may also be redundant and fail to contribute to the discriminative power of the
network, resulting in kernel level redundancy. To solve this, we propose a
discrimination-aware kernel pruning (DKP) method to further compress deep
networks by removing redundant kernels. To prevent DCP/DKP from selecting
redundant channels/kernels, we propose a new adaptive stopping condition, which
helps to automatically determine the number of selected channels/kernels and
often results in more compact models with better performance. Extensive
experiments on both image classification and face recognition demonstrate the
effectiveness of our methods. For example, on ILSVRC-12, the resultant
ResNet-50 model with 30% reduction of channels even outperforms the baseline

technique for studying the retinal structure and function in the living eye.
However, the raw retinal images are usually of poor contrast and the
interpretation of such images requires image deconvolution. Different from
standard deconvolution problems where the point spread function (PSF) is
completely known, the PSF in these retinal imaging problems is only partially
known which leads to the more complicated myopic (mildly blind) deconvolution
problem. In this paper, we propose an efficient numerical scheme for solving
this myopic deconvolution problem with total variational (TV) regularization.
First, we apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to
tackle the TV regularizer. Specifically, we reformulate the TV problem as an
equivalent equality constrained problem where the objective function is
separable, and then minimize the augmented Lagrangian function by alternating
between two (separated) blocks of unknowns to obtain the solution. Due to the
structure of the retinal images, the subproblems with respect to the fidelity
term appearing within each ADMM iteration are tightly coupled and a variation
of the Linearize And Project (LAP) method is designed to solve these
subproblems efficiently. The proposed method is called the ADMM-LAP method.
Theoretically, we establish the subsequence convergence of the ADMM-LAP method

bilayer cuprate superconductors are investigated within the kinetic-energy
driven superconductivity. It is shown that the quasiparticle excitation
spectrum is split into its bonding and antibonding components due to the
presence of the bilayer coupling, with each component that is independent.
However, in the underdoped and optimally doped regimes, although the bonding
and antibonding electron Fermi surface (EFS) contours deriving from the bonding
and antibonding layers are truncated to form the bonding and antibonding Fermi
arcs, almost all spectral weights in the bonding and antibonding Fermi arcs are
reduced to the tips of the bonding and antibonding Fermi arcs, which in this
case coincide with the bonding and antibonding hot spots. These hot spots
connected by the scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i} $ construct an octet
scattering model, and then the enhancement of the quasiparticle scattering
processes with the scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ is confirmed via the
result of the autocorrelation of the ARPES spectral intensities. Moreover, the
peak-dip-hump (PDH) structure developed in each component of the quasiparticle
excitation spectrum along the corresponding EFS is directly related with the
peak structure in the quasiparticle scattering rate except for at around the
hot spots, where the PDH structure is caused mainly by the bilayer coupling.
Although the kink in the quasiparticle dispersion is present all around EFS,
when the momentum moves away from the node to the antinode, the kink energy
smoothly decreases, while the dispersion kink becomes more pronounced, and in
particular, near the cut close to the antinode, develops into a break
separating of the fasting dispersing high-energy part of the quasiparticle
excitation spectrum from the slower dispersing low-energy part.

with annealed randomness, and the modified one, with quenched randomness. In
the original model, each voter changes its opinion with a certain probability
$\epsilon$ if the group of influence is not unanimous. In contrast, the
modified version introduces two types of voters that act in a deterministic way
in case of disagreement in the influence group: the fraction $\epsilon$ of
voters always change their current opinion, whereas the rest of them always
maintain it. Although both concepts of randomness lead to the same average
number of opinion changes in the system on the microscopic level, they cause
qualitatively distinct results on the macroscopic level. We focus on the
mean-field description of these models. Our approach relies on the stability
analysis by the linearization technique developed within dynamical system
theory. This approach allows us to derive complete, exact phase diagrams for
both models. The results obtained in this paper indicate that quenched
randomness promotes continuous phase transitions to a greater extent, whereas
annealed randomness favors discontinuous ones. The quenched model also creates
combinations of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions unobserved in
the annealed model, in which the up-down symmetry may be spontaneously broken
inside or outside the hysteresis loop. The analytical results are confirmed by
Monte Carlo simulations carried out on a complete graph.

changing the center of mass location and value, the nonlinearity of the

problem. A nonlinear MPC predicts the dynamics of the system and solves the
control problem efficiently, but requires the exact information of the system
models. Since model uncertainties are unavoidable, the time-delay control (TDC)
method is used to cancel the unknown dynamics and unexpected disturbances. When
the TDC method is applied, the results show that the maximum required torque
for engines is reduced by 7%. And the maximum displacement of the robot has
dropped by 44% around the balance axis. In other words, robot stability has
increased by 78%. Due to the cost of implementing control in practice, this
research runs the HIL simulation for the first time. The use of this simulation
helps in implementing the control algorithms without approximation, and also
the system response can be discussed in a more realistic way.

alignment at interfaces that can be exploited for particle assembly. These
patterns emerge from the competition between bulk and surface energies, tunable

cholesteric double emulsions to assemble colloidal particles through a
pathway-dependent process. Particles can be repositioned from a
surface-mediated to an elasticity-mediated state through dynamically thinning
the cholesteric shell at a rate comparable to that of colloidal adsorption. By
tuning the balance between surface and bulk energies with the system geometry,
colloidal assemblies on the cholesteric interface can be molded by the
underlying elastic field to form linear aggregates. The transition of adsorbed
particles from surface regions with homeotropic anchoring to defect regions is
accompanied by a reduction in particle mobility. The arrested assemblies
subsequently map out and stabilize topological defects. These results
demonstrate the kinetic arrest of interfacial particles within definable
patterns by regulating the energetic frustration within cholesterics. This work
highlights the importance of kinetic pathways for particle assembly in liquid
crystals, of relevance to optical and energy applications.

potential in the original literature is not uniquely defined, we propose a
procedure to define a non-local potential from NBS wave functions in terms of
the derivative expansion. We then demonstrate how this definition works by
using quantum mechanics with a separable potential. Secondly we discuss an
issue of Hermiticity of the HAL QCD potential. Since the NBS wav functions are
not orthogonal to each other in general, the HAL QCD potential is necessary to
be non-Hermitian. We consider the next-to-leading order potential, which can be
made Hermitian exactly by the change of variables. In general we can also make
the higher order HAL QCD potential Hermitian order by order in the derivative
expansion. An explicit example on how the procedure works is given for lattice
QCD calculations. Finally we discuss how we can extract the HAL QCD potential
from the NBS wave function in the boosted system. An explicit formula for this

approximate model to simulate the so-called convective dilution process, where
a thin, superficial hydrogen radiative layer is gradually eroded by the
underlying and more massive convective helium envelope, thus transforming a DA
white dwarf into a DB star. We show that this convective dilution process is
able to account for the large increase in the number of DB white dwarfs below
Teff ~ 20,000 K, but that the residual hydrogen abundances expected from this
process are still orders of magnitude lower than those observed in DBA white
dwarfs. Scenarios involving the accretion of hydrogen from the interstellar
medium or other external bodies have often been invoked to explain these
overabundances of hydrogen. In this paper, we describe a new paradigm where
hydrogen, initially diluted within the thick stellar envelope, is still present
and slowly diffusing upward in the deeper layers of a Teff ~ 20,000 K white
dwarf. When the convective dilution process occurs, the bottom of the mixed
H/He convection zone sinks deep into the star, resulting in large amounts of
hydrogen being dredged-up to the stellar surface, a phenomenon similar to that
invoked in the context of DQ white dwarfs.

plight of traffic congestion is the cause of waste of time, capital, and health

improve this situation, when inadequate space and limited budget is available,
it is not practical. Optimization of signalized intersections for optimal use
of the network capacity is proposed as a useful solution to resolve an
important part of the problems developed at intersections. In this paper, with
the aim of assessing the algorithms proposed for controlling signalized

Intersection Fuzzy-Real Control (SIFRC) has been designed and implemented.

pre-time, fuzzy, real-time, and fuzzy-real. The results indicated better
performance of the fuzzy-real method compared to the fixed time method up to

achieving the optimal response in the fuzzy-real method has been 11 times as

bodies of simple and well-defined geometry interacting across a medium. Direct
measurement of their surface interaction can be interpreted to reveal
fundamental physics in confinement, i.e. independent of the particular
geometry. However real solids are deformable - they can change shape due to
their mutual interaction - and this can influence force measurements. These
aspects are frequently not considered, and remain poorly understood. We have
performed experiments in a dry atmosphere and across an ionic liquid with a
Surface Force Balance (SFB), combining measurement of the surface interactions
and simultaneous in-situ characterization of the geometry. First we find that,
whilst the variation of the contact radius with the force across dry nitrogen
can be interpreted by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model, for the (ionic)
liquid it is well described only by the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model.
Secondly, we find that mica does not only bend but also experiences a
compression. By performing experiments with substantially thicker mica than
usual we were able to investigate this with high precision, and find
compression of order 1 nm with 7 um mica. These findings imply that, in some
cases structural forces measured across nanoconfined liquids must be
interpreted as a convolution of the surface forces across the liquid and the
mechanical response of the confining solids. We discuss the influence of mica
thickness, and propose a scaling criterion to distinguish situations where the
solid deformation is negligible and when it is dominant.

To this end, we use the Gauss-Bonnet theorem of a two-dimensional surface
defined by a generalized Jacobi metric. The spacetime is asymptotically
non-flat due to the existence of a bumblebee vector field. Thus the deflection
angle is modified and can be divided into three parts: the surface integral of
the Gaussian curvature, the path integral of a geodesic curvature of the
particle ray and the change in the coordinate angle. In addition, we also
obtain the same results by defining the deflection angle. The effects of the
Lorentz breaking constant on the gravitational lensing are analyzed. In
particular, we correct a mistake in the previous literature. Furthermore, we

area consuming stochastic number generators (SNGs) in these circuits can
diminish their overall gain in area, particularly if several SNGs are required.
We propose area-efficient SNGs by sharing the permuted output of one linear
feedback shift register (LFSR) among several SNGs. With no hardware overhead,
the proposed architecture generates stochastic bit streams with minimum
stochastic computing correlation (SCC). Compared to the circular shifting
approach presented in prior work, our approach produces stochastic bit streams
with 67% less average SCC when a 10-bit LFSR is shared between two SNGs. To
generalize our approach, we propose an algorithm to find a set of m
permutations (n>m>2) with minimum pairwise SCC, for an n-bit LFSR. The search
space for finding permutations with exact minimum SCC grows rapidly when n
increases and it is intractable to perform a search algorithm using accurately
calculated pairwise SCC values, for n>9. We propose a similarity function that
can be used in the proposed search algorithm to quickly find a set of
permutations with SCC values close to the minimum one. We evaluated our
approach for several applications. The results show that, compared to prior
work, it achieves lower MSE with the same (or even lower) area. Additionally,
based on simulation results, we show that replacing the comparator component of
an SNG circuit with a weighted binary generator can reduce SCC.

attractive $O(1/k^2)$ iteration complexity of {the mABCD} method for the dual

prove the robustness with respect to the mesh size $h$ for the mABCD method by

purpose of this paper is two-folded. We examine the question of existence of
polynomial integral of billiard magnetic flow. We succeed to reduce this
question to algebraic geometry test on existence of polynomial integral, which
shows polynomial non-integrability for all but finitely many values of the
magnitude. In the second part of the paper we construct examples of magnetic
billiards which have the so called $\delta$-Gutkin property, meaning that any
Larmor circle entering the domain with angle $\delta$ exits the domain with the
same angle $\delta$. For ordinary Birkhoff billiard in the plane such examples
were introduced by E. Gutkin and are very explicit. Our construction of Gutkin
magnetic billiards relies on beautiful examples by F.Wegner of the so called
Zindler curves, which are related to the problem of floating bodies in
equilibrium, which goes back to S.Ulam. We prove that Gutkin magnetic billiard
can be obtained as a parallel curve to a Wegner curve. Wegner curves can be
written by elliptic functions in polar coordinates so the construction of
magnetic Gutkin billiard is rather explicit but much more complicated.

landmass, but image enrichment relies on automating key tasks like change
detection or feature searches. For example, to extract text annotations from
raw pixels requires two dependent machine learning models, one to analyze the
overhead image and the other to generate a descriptive caption. We evaluate
seven models on the previously largest benchmark for satellite image captions.
We extend the labeled image samples five-fold, then augment, correct and prune
the vocabulary to approach a rough min-max (minimum word, maximum description).
This outcome compares favorably to previous work with large pre-trained image
models but offers a hundred-fold reduction in model size without sacrificing
overall accuracy (when measured with log entropy loss). These smaller models
provide new deployment opportunities, particularly when pushed to edge
processors, on-board satellites, or distributed ground stations. To quantify a
caption's descriptiveness, we introduce a novel multi-class confusion or error
matrix to score both human-labeled test data and never-labeled images that
include bounding box detection but lack full sentence captions. This work
suggests future captioning strategies, particularly ones that can enrich the
class coverage beyond land use applications and that lessen color-centered and
adjacency adjectives (""green"", ""near"", ""between"", etc.). Many modern language
transformers present novel and exploitable models with world knowledge gleaned
from training from their vast online corpus. One interesting, but easy example
might learn the word association between wind and waves, thus enriching a beach
scene with more than just color descriptions that otherwise might be accessed
from raw pixels without text annotation.

distributed ledger technologies (DLT) and applicability of these technologies
for different purposes in real estate, property rights and public registries.
Blockchain, which is distinguished from permissioned systems as the technology
of the immutable ledger that does not require authorities, is a new word in
governance. However, this technology has some principal features that can
restrain its implementation at the state level, and thus require further
research and development. The application of blockchain requires a proper
architecture of overlaid technologies to support changes of outdated and
mistaken data, address issues of digital identity and privacy, legal compliance
and enforceability of smart contracts and scalability of the ledger. This paper
shows the constraints of the technology's properties which were not explained
before in the context of title rights and land registration even though
technological limits are known in more specific technical sources. Along with
the known benefits this meant to help to avoid misinterpretation of some DLT
features by non-technical people. A multidisciplinary approach in analysing the
technology and laws helped to better understand what can and cannot be
beneficial for public registries and the protection of property rights. The
presented outcomes can be laid down as requirements for the technical protocols

seven groups: 1) Non-desired effects, 2) Liability, 3) Unknown consequences, 4)
Relation people-robots, 5) Concentration of power and wealth, 6) Intentional
bad uses, and 7) AI for weapons and warfare. The challenges should be dealt
with in different ways depending on their origin; some have technological
solutions, while others require ethical, societal, or political answers.
Depending on the origin, different stakeholders might need to act. Whatever the
identified stakeholder, not treating those issues will lead to uncertainty and
unforeseen consequences with potentially large negative societal impact,
hurting especially the most vulnerable groups of societies. Technology is
helping to take better decisions, and AI is promoting data-driven decisions in

modelling of functioning data from a 32 kWe dish-Stirling solar plant installed
at a facility test site on the University of Palermo campus, in Southern Italy.
The proposed model, based on real monitored data, the energy balance of the
collector and the partial load efficiency of the Stirling engine, can be used
easily to simulate the annual energy production of such systems, making use of
the solar radiation database, with the aim of encouraging a greater
commercialisation of this technology. Introducing further simplifying
assumptions based on our experimental data, the model can be linearised
providing a new analytical expression of the parameters that characterise the
widely used Stine empirical model. The model was calibrated against data
corresponding to the collector with clean mirrors and used to predict the net
electric production of the dish-Stirling accurately. A numerical method for
assessing the daily level of mirror soiling without the use of direct
reflectivity measures was also defined. The proposed methodology was used to
evaluate the history of mirror soiling for the observation period, which shows
a strong correlation with the recorded sequence of rains and dust depositions.
The results of this study emphasise how desert dust transport events, frequent
