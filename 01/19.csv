universe, with equation-of-state $w=1/3$, consists of two components:
helicity-2 gravitons and massless scalar acoustic waves. On physical grounds,
we would expect the homogeneous solution of the Weyl tensor components to be a
good approximation to its inhomogeneous counterparts, whenever the observer is
located well in the far zone of an isolated astrophysical source of
cosmological gravitational radiation. We show explicitly that these homogeneous
and inhomogeneous solutions both receive contributions from the gauge-invariant
tensor {\it and} the two Bardeen (acoustic) scalars. Comparison of these Weyl
tensor computations thus allows us to not only identify, in the high frequency
limit, the corresponding gravitational tensor and scalar radiation; but also
their oscillatory polarization patterns.

this problem theoretically with effective blockade models where the

cannot be termed as complete and accurate. Higher-order-logic theorem proving
is a formal verification method that has been recently proposed to overcome
these limitations for the modeling and the Laplace transform based analysis of

higher-order logic, the analysis generally requires a significant amount of
user guidance in the manual proof process. In order to facilitate industrial
engineers to formally analyze the linear analog circuits based on the Laplace

operating state and to establish stability margins. However, power system
operators often have limited information about the actual values for power
system component parameters. Even when a model is available, its operating
parameters and control settings are time-dependent and subject to real-time
identification. Ideally, these parameters should be identified from measurement
data, such as phasor measurement unit (PMU) signals. However, it is challenging
to do this from the ambient measurements in the absence of transient dynamics
since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for such signals is not necessarily
large. In this paper, we design a Bayesian framework for on-line identification
of power system component parameters based on ambient PMU data, which has
reliable performance for SNR as low as five and for certain parameters can give
good estimations even for unit SNR. We support the framework with a robust and
time-efficient numerical method. We illustrate the approach efficiency on a

acting in the Hilbert space of square integrable sections of the bundle $K^2$

  We discuss two natural definitions of the determinant of the operator

self-adjoint extension of the operator (initially defined on smooth sections of
$K^2$ vanishing near the zeroes of $\Omega$), the second one is an analog of
Eskin-Kontsevich-Zorich (EKZ) regularization of the determinant of the conical
Laplacian acting in the trivial bundle. In contrast to the situation of
operators acting in the trivial bundle, for operators acting in $K^2$ these two
regularizations turn out to be essentially different. Considering the
regularized determinant of $\Delta^{(2)}_{|\Omega|}$ as a functional on the
moduli space $Q_g(1, \dots, 1)$ of quadratic differentials with simple zeroes
on compact Riemann surfaces of genus $g$, we derive explicit expressions for
this functional for the both regularizations. The expression for the EKZ

intercritical temperature range (i.e. between the AC1 and AC3 temperatures).
Both the peak temperature and soaking time were varied, and their effect on the
size, the fraction of individual microstructural constituents and their tensile
mechanical response were investigated. It is shown that the increasing peak
temperature and soaking time promote austenite formation and recrystallization
processes in the ferritic matrix. The highest nanohardness is shown by
martensitic grains, while recovered ferrite demonstrated slightly higher
nanohardness compared to recrystallized ferrite. The applied heat treatment
parameters have strong effect on the nanohardness of martensite, whereas
nanohardness of ferrite microconstituents is not sensitive to variation of the
peak temperature and soaking time. The non-recrystallized ferrite is harder
than its recrystallized counterpart due to the higher dislocation density of
the former. Increasing peak temperatures promote strengthening in the material
at the expense of its ductility mainly due to increased martensite fraction.
The steel demonstrates enhanced strain hardening ability independently of the
peak temperature. Analysis of the experimental results showed that the
industrial processing window of +- 10 oC may lead to some heterogeneity of the
local microstructure in the ultrafast heat treated sheets. However, the latter
should not have any negative effect on the overall mechanical behavior of the
ultrafast heat treated steel sheets on the macro-scale.

clustering (SSC) with pairwise (must-link or cannot-link) constraints. In
contrast to existing approaches, we decompose SSC into two simpler
classification tasks/stages: the first stage uses a pair of Siamese neural
networks to label the unlabeled pairs of points as must-link or cannot-link;
the second stage uses the fully pairwise-labeled dataset produced by the first
stage in a supervised neural-network-based clustering method. The proposed
approach, S3C2 (Semi-Supervised Siamese Classifiers for Clustering), is
motivated by the observation that binary classification (such as assigning
pairwise relations) is usually easier than multi-class clustering with partial
supervision. On the other hand, being classification-based, our method solves
only well-defined classification problems, rather than less well specified
clustering tasks. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the
high performance of the proposed method.

Building on the strong light confinement achieved in this novel platform, we
further investigate the coupling of single semiconductor quantum dots to the

applying an external environmental pressure during training, which adversely
impacts its ability to get higher rewards. As such, we deviate from the
classical paradigm of sparse rewards and add a uniformly sampled reward value
to the baseline reward to show that (1) sample efficiency of the training
process can be correlated to the adversity experienced during training, (2) it
is possible to achieve higher performance in less time and with less resources,
(3) we can reduce the performance variability experienced seed over seed, (4)
there is a maximum point after which more pressure will not generate better
results, and (5) that random positive incentives have an adverse effect when
using a negative reward strategy, making an agent under those conditions learn
poorly and more slowly. These results have been shown to be valid for Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients using Hindsight Experience Replay in a well
known Mujoco environment, but we argue that they could be generalized to other

typically rely on intrusive direct power measurement, either by implanting
meters in the power outlet or tapping into the power cable, thus jeopardizing
the stealthiness of attacks. In this paper, we propose NoDE (Noise for Data
Exfiltration), a new system for stealthy data exfiltration from enterprise
desktop computers. Specifically, NoDE achieves data exfiltration over a
building's power network by exploiting high-frequency voltage ripples (i.e.,
switching noises) generated by power factor correction circuits built into
today's computers. Located at a distance and even from a different room, the
receiver can non-intrusively measure the voltage of a power outlet to capture
the high-frequency switching noises for online information decoding without
supervised training/learning. To evaluate NoDE, we run experiments on seven
different computers from top-vendors and using top brand power supply units.
Our results show that for a single transmitter, NoDE achieves a rate of up to
28.48 bits/second with a distance of 90 feet (27.4 meters) without the line of
sight, demonstrating a practically stealthy threat. Based on the orthogonality
of switching noise frequencies of different computers, we also demonstrate
simultaneous data exfiltration from four computers using only one receiver.
Finally, we present a few possible defenses, such as installing noise filters,
and discuss their limitations.

genes sampled from several species, enabling useful predictions about phenomena
such as the discordance between the gene tree and the species phylogeny due to
incomplete lineage sorting. Conversely, knowledge of large collections of gene
trees can inform us about several aspects of the species phylogeny, such as its
topology and ancestral population sizes. A fundamental open problem in this
context is how to efficiently compute the probability of a gene tree topology,
given the species phylogeny. Although a number of algorithms for this task have
been proposed, they either produce approximate results, or, when they are
exact, they do not scale to large data sets. In this paper, we present some
progress towards exact and efficient computation of the probability of a gene
tree topology. We provide a new algorithm that, given a species tree and the
number of genes sampled for each species, calculates the probability that the
gene tree topology will be concordant with the species tree. Moreover, we
provide an algorithm that computes the probability of any specific gene tree
topology concordant with the species tree. Both algorithms run in polynomial
time and have been implemented in Python. Experiments show that they are able
to analyse data sets where thousands of genes are sampled, in a matter of
minutes to hours.

hydrodynamic simulations fail to describe the negative value of the
four-particle cumulant $c_2^v\{4\}$ as measured in experiments. Further
investigations show that the non-linear response between the elliptic flow
$v_2$ and the initial eccentricity $\varepsilon_2$ becomes significant in the
small p-p systems. This leads to a large deviation from linear eccentricity
scaling and generates additional flow fluctuations, which results in a positive
$c_2^v\{4\}$ even with a negative $c_2^\varepsilon\{4\}$ from the initial
state. We also presented the first hydrodynamic calculations of multi-particle
mixed harmonic azimuthal correlations in p-p collisions, such as normalized
asymmetric cumulant $nac_n\{3\}$, normalized Symmetric-Cumulant,

and machine learning. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the most common
approach for determining the parameters of a MLR model in big data scenarios.
However, SGD has slow sub-linear rates of convergence. A way to improve these
rates of convergence is to use manifold optimization. Along this line,
stochastic natural gradient descent (SNGD), proposed by Amari, was proven to be
Fisher efficient when it converged. However, SNGD is not guaranteed to converge
and it is computationally too expensive for MLR models with a large number of
parameters.
  Here, we propose a stochastic optimization method for MLR based on manifold
optimization concepts which (i) has per-iteration computational complexity is
linear in the number of parameters and (ii) can be proven to converge.
  To achieve (i) we establish that the family of joint distributions for MLR is
a dually flat manifold and we use that to speed up calculations.
S\'anchez-L\'opez and Cerquides have recently introduced convergent stochastic
natural gradient descent (CSNGD), a variant of SNGD whose convergence is
guaranteed. To obtain (ii) our algorithm uses the fundamental idea from CSNGD,
thus relying on an independent sequence to build a bounded approximation of the
natural gradient. We call the resulting algorithm dual stochastic natural
gradient descent (DNSGD). By generalizing a result from Sunehag et al., we
prove that DSNGD converges. Furthermore, we prove that the computational
complexity of DSNGD iterations are linear on the number of variables of the
model.

these hot spots connected by the scattering wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$

modeling proceeded from the 1-dimension autocorrelation of time series

functions degenerated to autocorrelation coefficients. This paper develops
2-dimensional spatial autocorrelation functions based on the Moran index using
the relative staircase function as a weight function to yield a spatial weight
matrix with a displacement parameter. The displacement bears analogy with time
lag of time series analysis. Based on the spatial displacement parameter, two
types of spatial autocorrelation functions are constructed for 2-dimensional
spatial analysis. Then the partial spatial autocorrelation functions are
derived by Yule-Walker recursive equation. The spatial autocorrelation
functions are generalized to the autocorrelation functions based on Geary's
coefficient and Getis' index. As an example, the new analytical framework was
applied to the spatial autocorrelation modeling of Chinese cities. A conclusion
can be reached that it is an effective method to build an autocorrelation
function based on the relative step function. The spatial autocorrelation
functions can be employed to reveal deep geographical information and perform
spatial dynamic analysis, and lay the foundation for the scaling analysis of
spatial correlation.

establish criteria for inclusion of nonholonomic (velocity-dependent)

criteria include the Ostrogradsky theorem as a special case, and can detect not

interatomic potential also accurately describe the structural properties of

Furthermore, the developed DNN interatomic potential predicts the formation

the future space-borne gravitational wave detectors. In such kind of systems,
the compact objects usually orbit around the central supermassive black holes
with complicated trajectories. Usually, the trajectory is approximated as
geodesic of a test-particle in Kerr space-time, and the orbital evolution are
simulated with the help of adiabatic approximation. However, this omits the
influence of the compact object on the back ground. In the present paper,
employing effective-one-body formalism, we analytically calculate out the
trajectories of a compact object around a massive Kerr black hole in
equatorial-eccentric orbit, and express the fundamental orbital frequencies in
explicit forms. Our formalism include the first-order corrections of mass-ratio
in the conservative orbital motion. Furthermore, we insert the mass-ratio
related terms in the first post-Newtonian energy fluxes. By calculating the
gravitational waves from the Teukolsky equations, we quantitatively reveal the
influence of the mass of the compact object on the data analysis. We find that
the shrinking of geodesic motion by taking the small objects as test particles
may be not appropriate for the detection of EMRIs.

Such invariant depends on coefficients that are related to solutions of an

regularity of the solutions at each time. In this form, after applying the
factorization method to the quantum invariant, rather than the Hamiltonian, one
manages to introduce the time parameter into the transformation, leading to
factorized operators which are the constants of motion of the new
time-dependent potentials. Under the appropriate limit, the initial quantum
invariant reduces to the stationary singular oscillator Hamiltonian, in such

in parallel, we can significantly lower the amount of communication and
computation, reduce the overhead on each node's storage, as well as enhance the
throughput of the distributed ledger. Existing sharding-based protocols still
suffer from several serious drawbacks. The first thing is that all non-faulty
nodes must connect well with each other, which demands a huge number of
communication channels in the network. Moreover, previous protocols have faced
great loss in efficiency in the case where the honesty of each committee's
leader is in question. At the same time, no explicit incentive is provided for
nodes to actively participate in the protocol.

communicating with other committees, to reduce the amortized complexity of
communication, computation, and storage on all nodes. We introduce a novel
semi-commitment scheme between committees and a recovery procedure to prevent
the system from crashing even when leaders of committees are malicious. To add
incentive for the network, we use the concept of reputation, which measures
each node's trusty computing power. As nodes with a higher reputation receive
more rewards, there is an encouragement for nodes with strong computing ability
to work honestly to gain reputation. In this way, we strike out a new path to
establish scalability, security, and incentive for the sharding-based

order to maximize social welfare. A seller starts with a set of identical
items, and each arriving buyer wants any one item, and has a valuation drawn
i.i.d. from a known distribution. Each item, however, disappears after an a
priori unknown amount of time that we term the horizon for that item. The
seller knows the (possibly different) distribution of the horizon for each
item, but not its realization till the item actually disappears. As with the
classic prophet inequalities, the goal is to design an online pricing scheme
that competes with the prophet that knows the horizon and extracts full social
surplus (or welfare).
  Our main results are for the setting where items have independent horizon
distributions satisfying the monotone-hazard-rate (MHR) condition. Here, for
any number of items, we achieve a constant-competitive bound via a conceptually
simple policy that balances the rate at which buyers are accepted with the rate
at which items are removed from the system. We implement this policy via a
novel technique of matching via probabilistically simulating departures of the
items at future times. Moreover, for a single item and MHR horizon distribution
with mean $\mu$, we show a tight result: There is a fixed pricing scheme that
has competitive ratio at most $2 - 1/\mu$, and this is the best achievable in
this class.
  We further show that our results are best possible. First, we show that the
competitive ratio is unbounded without the MHR assumption even for one item.
Further, even when the horizon distributions are i.i.d. MHR and the number of
items becomes large, the competitive ratio of any policy is lower bounded by a
constant greater than $1$, which is in sharp contrast to the setting with
identical deterministic horizons.

human operator is presented with trajectories from a replay buffer and then
provides feedback on states and actions in the trajectory. In order to
generalize feedback signals provided by the human operator to previously unseen

ensemble of neural networks with a shared network architecture to represent
model uncertainty and the confidence of the neural network in its output. The
output of the feedback neural network is converted to a shaping reward that is
augmented to the reward provided by the environment. We evaluate our approach
on the Bowling and Skiing Atari games in the arcade learning environment.
Although human experts have been able to achieve high scores in these

difficult to realize large efficiency gains compared to learning tasks
independently. The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared

groups, including compounds with the B20 or $\beta$-Mn structures, are known to
host long-period chiral spin textures such as skyrmion lattices. These spin
textures are stabilized by a competition between ferromagnetic exchange and
antisymmetric Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) exchange, which is enhanced by the
spin-orbit coupling associated with high-atomic-number elements. For real-world
application, it is desirable to find materials that can host compact skyrmion
lattices at readily accessible temperatures. Here, we report on the crystal
chemistry and magnetic phase diagrams of a family of compounds with the filled
$\beta$-Mn structure, FePd$_{1-x}$Pt$_x$Mo$_3$N with $T_C$ ranging from 175 K
to 240 K. DC and AC magnetization measurements reveal magnetic phase diagrams
consistent with the formation of a skyrmion pocket just below $T_C$. The
magnitudes of ferromagnetic and DM exchanges are determined from the phase
diagrams, demonstrating that the introduction of increasing amounts of Pt can
be used to increase spin-orbit coupling in order to control the expected
skyrmion lattice parameter between 140 nm and 65 nm while simultaneously

simplest setting of $3$-cliques (triangles) has been the center of much recent
research. Getting the count of $k$-cliques for larger $k$ is algorithmically
challenging, due to the exponential blowup in the search space of large
cliques. But a number of recent applications (especially for community
detection or clustering) use larger clique counts. Moreover, one often desires
\textit{local} counts, the number of $k$-cliques per vertex/edge.
  Our main result is Pivoter, an algorithm that exactly counts the number of
$k$-cliques, \textit{for all values of $k$}. It is surprisingly effective in
practice, and is able to get clique counts of graphs that were beyond the reach
of previous work. For example, Pivoter gets all clique counts in a social
network with a 100M edges within two hours on a commodity machine. Previous
parallel algorithms do not terminate in days. Pivoter can also feasibly get
local per-vertex and per-edge $k$-clique counts (for all $k$) for many public
data sets with tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first algorithm that achieves such results.
  The main insight is the construction of a Succinct Clique Tree (SCT) that
stores a compressed unique representation of all cliques in an input graph. It
is built using a technique called \textit{pivoting}, a classic approach by
Bron-Kerbosch to reduce the recursion tree of backtracking algorithms for
maximal cliques. Remarkably, the SCT can be built without actually enumerating
all cliques, and provides a succinct data structure from which exact clique
statistics ($k$-clique counts, local counts) can be read off efficiently.

traditional method, a novel tripartite phase unwrapping method is proposed to
avoid the jump errors on the boundary of code words, which are mainly caused by
the defocusing of the projector and the motion of the tested object.
Subsequently, the time-overlapping coding strategy is presented to greatly
increase the coding efficiency, decreasing the projected number in each group,
e.g. from 7 (3 + 4) to 4 (3 + 1) for one restored 3D frame. Combination of two
proposed techniques allows to reconstruct a pixel-wise and unambiguous 3D
geometry of dynamic scenes with strong noise using every 4 projected patterns.
The presented techniques preserve the high anti-noise ability of
Gray-coded-based method while overcoming the drawbacks of jump errors and low

achieve the robust and high-efficiency 3D shape measurement of high-speed
dynamic scenes even polluted by strong noise.

assembles the information from three inference processes over the hierarchy:
direct inference (directly predicting each part of a human body using image
information), bottom-up inference (assembling knowledge from constituent
parts), and top-down inference (leveraging context from parent nodes). The
bottom-up and top-down inferences explicitly model the compositional and
decompositional relations in human bodies, respectively. In addition, the
fusion of multi-source information is conditioned on the inputs, i.e., by
estimating and considering the confidence of the sources. The whole model is
end-to-end differentiable, explicitly modeling information flows and
structures. Our approach is extensively evaluated on four popular datasets,
outperforming the state-of-the-arts in all cases, with a fast processing speed

capture and mine much richer and higher-order relations between video frames,
thus enabling a more complete understanding of video content and more accurate

superconductor-half-metal-Ising superconductor junctions. By solving the
Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, the Josephson currents contributed by the
discrete Andreev levels and the continuous spectrum are obtained. For very
short junctions, because the direct tunneling of the Cooper pair dominates the
Josephson current, the current-phase difference relation is independent of the
magnetization direction, which is the same as the conventional
superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junctions. On the other hand, when
the length of the half-metal is similar to or greater than the superconducting
coherence length, the spin-triplet Josephson effect occurs and dominates the
Josephson current. In this case, the current-phase difference relations show
the strong magnetoanisotropic behaviors with the period \pi. When the
magnetization direction points to the $\pm$ z directions, the current is zero
regardless of the phase difference. However, the current has a large value when
the magnetization direction is parallel to the junction plane, which leads to a
perfect switch effect of the Josephson current. Furthermore, we find that the
long junctions can host both the 0 state and \pi state, and the $0$-$\pi$
transitions can be achieved with the change of the magnetization direction. The
physical origins of the switch effect and $0$-$\pi$ transitions are interpreted
from the perspectives of the spin-triplet Andreev reflection, the Ising pairing
order parameter and the Ginzburg-Landau type of free energy. In addition, the
influences of the chemical potential, the magnetization magnitude, and the
strength of the Ising spin-orbit coupling on the switch effect and $0$-$\pi$
transitions are also investigated. Furthermore, the two-dimensional Josephson
junctions are also investigated and we show that the spin-triplet Josephson

As the human faces are highly structured and share unified facial components
(e.g., eyes and mouths), such semantic information provides a strong prior for
restoration. We incorporate face semantic labels as input priors and propose an
adaptive structural loss to regularize facial local structures within an
end-to-end deep convolutional neural network. Specifically, we first use a
coarse deblurring network to reduce the motion blur on the input face image. We
then adopt a parsing network to extract the semantic features from the coarse
deblurred image. Finally, the fine deblurring network utilizes the semantic
information to restore a clear face image. We train the network with perceptual
and adversarial losses to generate photo-realistic results. The proposed method
restores sharp images with more accurate facial features and details.
Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed face
deblurring algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods in
terms of restoration quality, face recognition and execution speed.

use large volumes of training data. Currently, many document analysis systems

SlideImages, a dataset for the task of classifying educational illustrations.
SlideImages contains training data collected from various sources, e.g.,
Wikimedia Commons and the AI2D dataset, and test data collected from
educational slides. We have reserved all the actual educational images as a

generalize well to new educational images, and potentially other domains.

(Zero-DCE), which formulates light enhancement as a task of image-specific
curve estimation with a deep network. Our method trains a lightweight deep
network, DCE-Net, to estimate pixel-wise and high-order curves for dynamic
range adjustment of a given image. The curve estimation is specially designed,
considering pixel value range, monotonicity, and differentiability. Zero-DCE is
appealing in its relaxed assumption on reference images, i.e., it does not
require any paired or unpaired data during training. This is achieved through a
set of carefully formulated non-reference loss functions, which implicitly
measure the enhancement quality and drive the learning of the network. Our
method is efficient as image enhancement can be achieved by an intuitive and
simple nonlinear curve mapping. Despite its simplicity, we show that it
generalizes well to diverse lighting conditions. Extensive experiments on
various benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of our method over
state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Furthermore, the
potential benefits of our Zero-DCE to face detection in the dark are discussed.

designing a path planner that computes paths which minimize the off-track of

lower bounds on the maximal leakage to the adversary, which are inspired by the

motivated misalignment axion like particle materialized in terms of a canonical
scalar field minimally coupled with gravity, and we study the cosmological
phenomenology of the model, emphasizing mainly on the late-time era. The main
result of the paper is that inflation and the dark energy era may be realized
in a geometric way by an $F(R)$ gravity, while the axion is the dark matter
constituent of the Universe. The $F(R)$ gravity model consists of an $R^2$
term, which as we show dominates the evolution during the early time, thus
producing a viable inflationary phenomenology, and a power law term $\sim
R^{\delta}$ with $\delta\ll 1 $ and positive, which eventually controls the
late-time era. The axion field remains frozen during the inflationary era,
which is an effect known for misalignment axions, but as the Universe expands,
the axion starts to oscillate, and its energy density scales eventually as we
show, as $\rho_a\sim a^{-3}$. After appropriately rewriting the gravitational
equations in terms of the redshift $z$, we study in detail the late-time
phenomenology of the model, and we compare the results with the $\Lambda$CDM
model and the latest Planck 2018 data. As we show, the model for small
redshifts $0<z<5$ is phenomenologically similar to the $\Lambda$CDM model,
however at large redshifts and deeply in the matter domination era, the results
are different from those of the $\Lambda$CDM model due to the dark energy
oscillations. For the late-time study we investigate the behavior of several
well-known statefinder quantities, like the deceleration parameter, the jerk
and $Om(z)$, and we demonstrate that the statefinders which contain lower

the magnetic anisotropy with different easy-plane and local-easy-axis. We

constraint of memory consumption. Therefore many modified normalization

obtain a stationary solution. Simulation results demonstrate that under the aid

  Computing Systems (POMACS) 2020 (SIGMETRICS)",,,,"cs.DS cs.PF","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we consider the following dynamic fair allocation problem:
Given a sequence of job arrivals and departures, the goal is to maintain an
approximately fair allocation of the resource against a target fair allocation
policy, while minimizing the total number of disruptions, which is the number
of times the allocation of any job is changed. We consider a rich class of fair
allocation policies that significantly generalize those considered in previous
work.
  We first consider the models where jobs only arrive, or jobs only depart. We
present tight upper and lower bounds for the number of disruptions required to
maintain a constant approximate fair allocation every time step. In particular,
for the canonical case where jobs have weights and the resource allocation is
proportional to the job's weight, we show that maintaining a constant
approximate fair allocation requires $\Theta(\log^* n)$ disruptions per job,
almost matching the bounds in prior work for the unit weight case. For the more
general setting where the allocation policy only decreases the allocation to a
job when new jobs arrive, we show that maintaining a constant approximate fair
allocation requires $\Theta(\log n)$ disruptions per job. We then consider the
model where jobs can both arrive and depart. We first show strong lower bounds
on the number of disruptions required to maintain constant approximate fairness
for arbitrary instances. In contrast we then show that there there is an
algorithm that can maintain constant approximate fairness with $O(1)$ expected
disruptions per job if the weights of the jobs are independent of the jobs
arrival and departure order. We finally show how our results can be extended to
the setting with multiple resources.

can be improved by continuously monitoring the vertical density structure of
mesospheric sodium along the line of sight. We demonstrate that sodium density
profiles can be retrieved by amplitude modulation of continuous wave (CW)
lasers. In an experiment conducted at the Large Zenith Telescope (LZT), ESO's
Wendelstein Raman-fibre laser was amplitude-modulated with a pseudo-random
binary sequence and profiles were obtained by cross-correlation of the
modulation pattern with the observed return signal from the laser guide star.
For comparison, high-resolution profiles were obtained simultaneously using the
lidar system of the LZT. The profiles obtained by the two techniques show noise
contamination, but were found to agree to within the measurement error. As a
further check, a comparison was also made between several lidar profiles and
those obtained by simultaneous observations using a remote telescope to image
the laser plume from the side. The modulated CW lidar technique could be
implemented by diverting a small fraction of the returned laser light to a
photon counting detector. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations
indicate that, for 50 per cent modulation strength, the sodium centroid
altitude could be retrieved every 5 s from a single laser guide star, with an
accuracy which would induce a corresponding wavefront error of 50 nm for the
ELT and less than 30 nm for the TMT and GMT. If multiple laser guide stars are
employed, the required modulation amplitude will be smaller.

independent Gaussian random parameters, which enables the polynomial chaos
expansion (PCE) of the system dynamic response to be calculated via an adaptive
sparse probabilistic collocation method. Finally, the probability distribution
and the high-order moments of the system dynamic response and performance index
are accurately and efficiently quantified. The proposed nonintrusive method is
based on commercial simulation software such as PSS/E with carefully designed

non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and relaying, depending on whether or not
the GU and UAV are served simultaneously. Under the assumption of the system
operating with infinite blocklength (IBL) codes, the IBL throughputs of both
the GU and the UAV are derived under the two schemes. More importantly, we also
consider the scenario in which data packets are transmitted via finite
blocklength (FBL) codes, i.e., data transmission to both the UAV and the GU is
performed under low-latency and high reliability constraints. In this setting,
the FBL throughputs are characterized again considering the two schemes of NOMA
and relaying. Following the IBL and FBL throughput characterizations, optimal
resource allocation designs are subsequently proposed to maximize the UAV
throughput while guaranteeing the throughput of the cellular user.Moreover, we
prove that the relaying scheme is able to provide transmission service to the
UAV while improving the GU's performance, and that the relaying scheme
potentially offers a higher throughput to the UAV in the FBL regime than in the
IBL regime. On the other hand, the NOMA scheme provides a higher UAV throughput
(than relaying) by slightly sacrificing the GU's performance.

loading on yielding in amorphous solids is investigated using molecular

was rapidly cooled well below the glass transition temperature and then
subjected to oscillatory shear deformation. It was shown that periodic loading
at strain amplitudes above the critical value first induces structural
relaxation via irreversible displacements of clusters of atoms during a number
of transient cycles, followed by an increase in potential energy due to the
formation of a system-spanning shear band. Upon approaching the critical strain
amplitude from above, the number of transient cycles required to reach the
yielding transition increases. Interestingly, it was found that when the shear
orientation is periodically alternated in two or three dimensions, the number
of transient cycles is reduced but the critical strain amplitude remains the
same as in the case of periodic shear along a single plane. After the yielding
transition, the material outside the shear band continues strain-induced
relaxation, except when the shear orientation is alternated in three dimensions
and the glass is deformed along the shear band with the imposed strain
amplitude every third cycle.

individually induced by the R\""{o}ntgen term and the recoil effect can be
simply added and result in the total correction to the decay rate. Moreover, it
is shown that the R\""{o}ntgen term gives positive correction, while the recoil
effect induces negative correction. Our work paves the way towards the future
studies of the light-matter interaction for the moving particle in quantum
optics.

  Engineering. Western University. London, Canada, February 18, 2020",,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A decade long thrive of cryptocurrency has shown its potential as a source of
alternative-finance and the security and the robustness of the underpinning
blockchain technology.
  However, most cryptocurrencies fail to show inimitability and their meanings
in the real world. As a result, they usually start off as favourites but
quickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market.
  The blockchain society attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with
real values by employing smart contracts and link it with computation resources
and the digital-productivity that have value and demands in the real world. But
their attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of
practical applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high
performance and decentralisation (universal joinability). The emerging of
blockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible solution to address
this dilemma.
  In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding that will
build an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation
resources as well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the
price of resources and the compensation for maintaining a system based on those
behaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the amount of computation
resources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange
between computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example
which, through financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous
participants, also incents/discourages participation dynamically.

to effectively detect and prevent malicious network behaviours. The abnormal
network activities threaten users' privacy and potentially damage the function
and infrastructure of the whole network. To address this problem, the network
intrusion detection system (NIDS) has been used. By continuously monitoring
network activities, the system can timely identify attacks and prompt
counter-attack actions. NIDS has been evolving over years. The
current-generation NIDS incorporates machine learning (ML) as the core
technology in order to improve the detection performance on novel attacks.
However, the high detection rate achieved by a traditional ML-based detection
method is often accompanied by large false-alarms, which greatly affects its
overall performance. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network, Pelican,
that is built upon specially-designed residual blocks. We evaluated Pelican on
two network traffic datasets, NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15. Our experiments show that
Pelican can achieve a high attack detection performance while keeping a much
low false alarm rate when compared with a set of up-to-date machine learning
based designs.

been dramatically improved through using machine learning methods. This paper
proposes novel machine learning models for intelligent road inspection. The
traditional road inspection systems based on the pavement condition index (PCI)
are often associated with the critical safety, energy and cost issues.
Alternatively, the proposed models utilize surface deflection data from falling
weight deflectometer (FWD) tests to predict the PCI. Machine learning methods
are the single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and radial basis function (RBF)
neural networks as well as their hybrids, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt (MLP-LM),
scaled conjugate gradient (MLP-SCG), imperialist competitive (RBF-ICA), and
genetic algorithms (RBF-GA). Furthermore, the committee machine intelligent
systems (CMIS) method was adopted to combine the results and improve the
accuracy of the modeling. The results of the analysis have been verified
through using four criteria of average percent relative error (APRE), average
absolute percent relative error (AAPRE), root mean square error (RMSE), and
standard error (SD). The CMIS model outperforms other models with the promising
results of APRE=2.3303, AAPRE=11.6768, RMSE=12.0056, and SD=0.0210.

weakly supervised studies typically assume that there is only one kind of weak
supervision in data. In many applications, however, raw data usually contains
more than one kind of weak supervision at the same time. For example, in user
experience enhancement from Didi, one of the largest online ride-sharing
platforms, the ride comment data contains severe label noise (due to the
subjective factors of passengers) and severe label distribution bias (due to
the sampling bias). We call such a problem as ""compound weakly supervised
learning"". In this paper, we propose the CWSL method to address this problem
based on Didi ride-sharing comment data. Specifically, an instance reweighting
strategy is employed to cope with severe label noise in comment data, where the
weights for harmful noisy instances are small. Robust criteria like AUC rather
than accuracy and the validation performance are optimized for the correction
of biased data label. Alternating optimization and stochastic gradient methods
accelerate the optimization on large-scale data. Experiments on Didi
ride-sharing comment data clearly validate the effectiveness. We hope this work
may shed some light on applying weakly supervised learning to complex real
situations.

aluminum (AlMn) films, which are common superconducting materials used to make
transition edge sensors (TES). We developed a multi-energy ion-implantation
technique to make AlMn films. Compared with frequently used sputtering
techniques, ion-implantation provides more precise and reliable control of the
Mn doping concentration in the AlMn films.The ion implantation also enables us
to quantitatively analyze the superconducting transition temperature curve as a
function of the Mn doping concentration. We found that Mn dopants act as
magnetic impurities and suppression of superconductivity is counteracted by the
antiferromagnetic Ruderman Kittel Kasuya Yosida interaction among Mn dopants.
The RKKY interaction can be tuned through defect engineering in the
ion-implantation process and through post-implantation annealing.

rumors are fundamental processes occurring in real-life networks. In many
practical cases, one can observe when nodes become infected, but the underlying
network, over which a contagion or information propagates, is hidden. Inferring
properties of the underlying network is important since these properties can be
used for constraining infections, forecasting, viral marketing, and so on.
Moreover, for many applications, it is sufficient to recover only coarse
high-level properties of this network rather than all its edges. This article
conducts a systematic and extensive analysis of the following problem: Given
only the infection times, find communities of highly interconnected nodes. This
task significantly differs from the well-studied community detection problem
since we do not observe a graph to be clustered. We carry out a thorough
comparison between existing and new approaches on several large datasets and
cover methodological challenges specific to this problem. One of the main
conclusions is that the most stable performance and the most significant
improvement on the current state-of-the-art are achieved by our proposed simple
heuristic approaches agnostic to a particular graph structure and epidemic
model. We also show that some well-known community detection algorithms can be
enhanced by including edge weights based on the cascade data.
