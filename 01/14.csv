correlation function of light emitted from a single molecule. We observe
spectra with a zero-phonon-line together with several additional sharp peaks,
broad phonon sidebands, and a strongly temperature dependent homogeneous

and a thermal phonon bath, which we include non-perturbatively, and is able
capture all observed features. For resonant driving we measure Rabi
oscillations that become increasingly damped with temperature, which our model

it may break the time reversal symmetry needed to maintain the topological
insulator character. Mn dopants in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ represent one of the most
studied examples here. However, there is a lot of open questions regarding
their magnetic ordering. In the experimental literature different Curie
temperatures or no ferromagnetic order at all are reported for comparable Mn
concentrations. This suggests that magnetic ordering phenomena are complex and
highly susceptible to different growth parameters, which are known to affect
material defect concentrations. So far theory focused on Mn dopants in one
possible position, and neglected relaxation effects as well as native defects.
We have used ab initio methods to calculate the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ electronic
structure influenced by magnetic Mn dopants, and exchange interactions between
them. We have considered two possible Mn positions, the substitutional and
interstitial one, and also native defects. We have found a sizable relaxation
of atoms around Mn, which affects significantly magnetic interactions.
Surprisingly, very strong interactions correspond to a specific position of Mn
atoms separated by van der Waals gap. Based on the calculated data we performed
spin dynamics simulations to examine systematically the resulting magnetic
order for various defect contents. We have found under which conditions the
experimentally measured Curie temperatures ${T_{\rm{C}}}$ can be reproduced,
noticing that interstitial Mn atoms appear to be important here. Our theory
predicts the change of ${T_{\rm{C}}}$ with a shift of Fermi level, which opens
the way to tune the system magnetic properties by selective doping.

The main issue raises when the Fermi level shifts deep into the bulk conduction

strategies to reduce the residual doping in Bi-based topological insulators.
Flakes of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.7}$Se$_{1.3}$ are grown

explore the role of the substrate in this process and present the optimal

improvement, we show that the vapor phase deposited flakes still suffer from
structural disorder which leads to the residual n-type doping of the bulk.
Using magneto-measurements we show that exfoliated flakes have better
electrical properties and are thus more promising for the probing of surface

large spin-orbit (SO) coupling arising from a broken inversion symmetry due to
an external electric field. There exist parametrized multiband models that can
describe accurately this effect. However, simplified single band models are
highly desirable to study geometries of recent experimental interest, since
they may allow to incorporate the effects of the low dimensionality and the
nanowire electrostatic environment at a reduced computational cost. Commonly
used conduction band approximations, valid for bulk materials, greatly
underestimate the SO coupling in Zinc-blende crystal structures and
overestimate it for Wurtzite ones when applied to finite cross-section wires,
where confinement effects turn out to play an important role. We demonstrate
here that an effective equation for the linear Rashba SO coupling of the
semiconductor conduction band can reproduce the behavior of more sophisticated
eight-band k$\cdot$p model calculations. This is achieved by adjusting a single
effective parameter that depends on the nanowire crystal structure and its
chemical composition. We further compare our results to the Rashba coupling
extracted from magnetoconductance measurements in several experiments on InAs
and InSb nanowires, finding excellent agreement. This approach may be relevant
in systems where Rashba coupling is known to play a major role, such as in
spintronic devices or Majorana nanowires.

their human partners will behave. Some of today's robots model humans as if
they were also robots, and assume users are always optimal. Other robots
account for human limitations, and relax this assumption so that the human is
noisily rational. Both of these models make sense when the human receives
deterministic rewards: i.e., gaining either $100 or $130 with certainty. But in
real world scenarios, rewards are rarely deterministic. Instead, we must make
choices subject to risk and uncertainty--and in these settings, humans exhibit
a cognitive bias towards suboptimal behavior. For example, when deciding
between gaining $100 with certainty or $130 only 80% of the time, people tend
to make the risk-averse choice--even though it leads to a lower expected gain!
In this paper, we adopt a well-known Risk-Aware human model from behavioral
economics called Cumulative Prospect Theory and enable robots to leverage this
model during human-robot interaction (HRI). In our user studies, we offer
supporting evidence that the Risk-Aware model more accurately predicts
suboptimal human behavior. We find that this increased modeling accuracy
results in safer and more efficient human-robot collaboration. Overall, we
extend existing rational human models so that collaborative robots can
anticipate and plan around suboptimal human behavior during HRI.

hydrodynamical properties of outflows. We assess the impact of energy
injection, wind opacity, magnetic field strength and the mass of the host
galaxy on flow velocity, temperature, density and pressure profiles. For an
M82-like wind, a thermally-dominated driving mechanism is found to deliver the
fastest and hottest wind. Radiation-driven winds in typical starburst-galaxy
configurations are unable to attain the higher flow velocities and temperatures
associated with thermal and cosmic ray-driven systems, leading to higher wind
densities which would be more susceptible to cooling and fragmentation at lower
altitudes. High opacity winds are more sensitive to radiative driving, but
terminal flow velocities are still lower than those achieved by other driving
mechanisms at realistic opacities. We demonstrate that variations in the
outflow magnetic field can influence its coupling with cosmic rays, where
stronger fields enable greater streaming but less driving near the base of the
flow, instead with cosmic rays redirecting their driving impact to higher
altitudes. The gravitational potential is less important in M82-like wind
configurations, and substantial variations in the flow profiles only emerge at
high altitude in massive haloes. This model offers a more generalised approach

manuscript we introduce the SciML software ecosystem as a tool for mixing the

learning approaches. We describe a mathematical object, which we denote
universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting
the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically
discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled
through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the
software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints.
This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training
mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and
compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.

apparent motion of Sgr A* is -6.411 +/- 0.008 mas/yr along the Galactic plane
and -0.219 +/- 0.007 mas/yr toward the North Galactic Pole. This apparent
motion can almost entirely be attributed to the effects of the Sun's orbit
about the Galactic center. Removing these effects yields residuals of -0.58 +/-
2.23 km/s in the direction of Galactic rotation and -0.85 +/- 0.75 km/s toward
the North Galactic Pole. A maximum-likelihood analysis of the motion, both in
the Galactic plane and perpendicular to it, expected for a massive object
within the Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that the radiative source,
Sgr A*, contains more than about 25% of the gravitational mass of 4 x 10^6 Msun
deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A* is comparable to its
Schwarzschild radius, and the implied mass density of >4 x 10^23 Msun/pc^-3
very close to that expected for a black hole, providing overwhelming evidence
that it is indeed a super-massive black hole. Finally, the existence of

approximately 0.003 and 0.1 pc from Sgr A*are excluded.

  Predictions of Thin-Film-Based Nanostructures",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As one simple metamaterial, nanopatterns are often fabricated across a thin
film so that the thermal transport can be manipulated. The etched sidewalls for
these nanostructures are usually rough due to surface defects introduced during
the nanofabrication, whereas the top and bottom film surfaces are smoother. In
existing analytical models, the contrast between these surfaces has not been
addressed and all boundaries are assumed to be diffusive for phonon reflection.
In this paper, a new two-step approach to address this issue is proposed for
phonon transport modeling of general thin-film-based structures. In this
approach, the effective in-plane phonon mean free paths ({\Lambda}_Film) are
first modified from the bulk phonon MFPs to account for the influence of the
top/bottom film surfaces, with possibly enhanced probability of specular phonon
reflection at cryogenic temperatures. This {\Lambda}_Film is further modified
to include the scattering by etched sidewalls with almost completely diffusive
phonon scattering. Such a two-step phonon mean free path modification yields
almost identical results as frequency-dependent phonon Monte Carlo simulations
for etched nanowires and representative nanoporous thin films. This simple yet
accurate analytical model can be applied to general thin-film-based
nanostructures to combine the phonon size effects along orthogonal directions.

novel real-time capable machine learning-based method for depth map fusion.
Similar to the seminal depth map fusion approach by Curless and Levoy, we only
update a local group of voxels to ensure real-time capability. Instead of a
simple linear fusion of depth information, we propose a neural network that
predicts non-linear updates to better account for typical fusion errors. Our
network is composed of a 2D depth routing network and a 3D depth fusion network
which efficiently handle sensor-specific noise and outliers. This is especially
useful for surface edges and thin objects for which the original approach
suffers from thickening artifacts. Our method outperforms the traditional
fusion approach and related learned approaches on both synthetic and real data.
We demonstrate the performance of our method in reconstructing fine geometric
details from noise and outlier contaminated data on various scenes.

if its parallel transports preserve the Finslerian length of tangent vectors.
Generalized Berwald manifolds are Finsler manifolds equipped with a compatible
linear connection. Since the compatibility to the Finslerian metric does not
imply the unicity of the linear connection in general, the first step of
checking the existence of compatible linear connections on a Finsler manifold
is to choose the best one to look for. A reasonable choice is introduced in
\cite{V14} called the extremal compatible linear connection, which has torsion
of minimal norm at each point.
  Randers metrics are special Finsler metrics that can be written as the sum of
a Riemannian metric and a 1-form (they are ""translates"" of Riemannian metrics).
In this paper, we investigate the compatibility equations for a linear
connection to a Randers metric. Since a compatible linear connection is
uniquely determined by its torsion, we transform the compatibility equations by
taking the torsion components as variables. We determine when these equations
have solutions, i.e. when the Randers space becomes a generalized Berwald space
admitting a compatible linear connection. Describing all of them, we can select
the extremal connection with the norm minimizing property. As a consequence, we
obtain the characterization theorem in \cite{Vin1}: a Randers space is a
non-Riemannian generalized Berwald space if and only if the norm of the
perturbating term with respect to the Riemannian part of the metric is a
positive constant.

which minimize the sum power consumption of the base stations (BSs), for both
fully- and partially-connected hybrid precoding (FHP and PHP, respectively)
schemes, for single-carrier and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing
systems. We reformulate the analog precoding part as an equal-gain transmission
problem, which only depends on the channel information, and the digital
precoding part as a relaxed convex semidefinite program subject to per-user
quality-of-service constraints that gives the optimal sum power consumption in
terms of the BS silence strategy. In order to reduce the complexity of the
hybrid precoding algorithm with optimal BS silence strategy, we propose a
sub-optimal hybrid precoding algorithm that iteratively put BSs with small
power into the silent mode. The simulation results show that, depending on the
parameter settings, the power consumption of the PHP may be dominated by the RF
transmit power and it may result in a larger power consumption than the FHP.
For the cases with 2 BSs and 4 users, implementation of the FHP and the PHP in
cooperative networks reduces the required RF transmit power, compared to the
case in a non-cooperative network, by 71% and 56%, respectively.

synchronizing the gauge-invariant phase difference among the junctions, so as
to achieve coherent strong emission. Previous optical imaging techniques have
indirectly suggested that the hotspot temperature can go higher than the
superconductor critical temperature. However, such optical approaches often
disturb the local temperature profile and are too slow for device applications.

precisely quantify the local temperature profile. This is achieved by
fabricating a series of micro ""sensor"" junctions on top of an ""emitter""

current applied to the emitter. This fully electronic on-chip design could
enable efficient close-loop control of hotspots in BSCCO junctions and

scale independent, since they consider all time scales as equally important.
However, in real data one is typically less interested in the smallest time
scales and a more adaptive approach is needed. Therefore, in the first part of
this Chapter we describe recently introduced generalizations of the three
measures, that gradually disregard differences in smaller time-scales. Besides
similarity, another very relevant property of spike trains is the temporal
order of spikes. In the second part of this chapter we address this property
and describe a very recently proposed algorithm, which quantifies the
directionality within a set of spike train. This multivariate approach sorts
multiple spike trains from leader to follower and quantifies the consistency of
the propagation patterns. Finally, all measures described in this chapter are

In this work, the Southern Sky is scanned for possible excesses of spatial
clustering, and the positions of preselected candidate sources are
investigated. In addition, special focus is given to the region around the
Galactic Centre, whereby a dedicated search at the location of SgrA* is
performed, and to the location of the supernova remnant RXJ 1713.7-3946. No
significant evidence for cosmic neutrino sources is found and upper limits on

relatively few training examples and short training time? We present a theory
towards explaining this in terms of Hierarchical Learning. We refer
hierarchical learning as the learner learns to represent a complicated target
function by decomposing it into a sequence of simpler functions to reduce
sample and time complexity. We formally analyze how multi-layer neural networks
can perform such hierarchical learning efficiently and automatically by
applying SGD.
  On the conceptual side, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the FIRST
theory result indicating how deep neural networks can still be sample and time
efficient using SGD on certain hierarchical learning tasks, when NO KNOWN
existing algorithm is efficient. We establish a new principle called ""backward
feature correction"", where training higher-level layers in the network can
improve the features of lower-level ones. We believe this is the key to
understand the deep learning process in multi-layer neural networks.
  On the technical side, we show for regression and even binary classification,
for every input dimension $d>0$, there is a concept class of degree $\omega(1)$
polynomials so that, using $\omega(1)$-layer neural networks as learners, SGD
can learn any function from this class in $\mathsf{poly}(d)$ time and sample
complexity to any $\frac{1}{\mathsf{poly}(d)}$ error, through learning to
represent it as a composition of $\omega(1)$ layers of quadratic functions. In
contrast, we do not know any other simple algorithm (including layer-wise
training or applying kernel method sequentially) that can learn this concept
class in $\mathsf{poly}(d)$ time even to any $d^{-0.01}$ error. As a side
result, we prove $d^{\omega(1)}$ lower bounds for several non-hierarchical
learners, including any kernel methods, neural tangent or neural compositional
kernels.

up and down electrons (or quasiparticles) carry different heat currents. This
mode occurs only when spin up and down energy distribution functions are
non-identical, most simply when the two spins have different effective
temperatures, and can be excited by spin-polarised current injection into the
system. While evidence for spin-dependent heat transport has been observed in a
normal metal, these measurements averaged over the distribution function of the
electrons. By performing spectroscopy of quasiparticle populations in a
mescoscopic superconductor, we reveal distribution functions which are strongly
out-of-equilibrium, i.e. non-Fermi-Dirac. In addition, unlike in normal metals,
the spin energy mode in superconductors is associated with a charge imbalance
(different numbers of hole- and electron-like quasiparticles) at the
superconducting gap edge, in finite Zeeman magnetic fields. Our spectroscopic
technique allows us to observe this charge imbalance and thus unambiguously
identify the spin energy mode. Our results agree well with theory and
contribute to laying the foundation for spin caloritronics with
superconductors.

space or configuration space. This assignment picks up nontrivialities when
whichever combination of constraints and the quantum apply.
  For Finite Theories, weak observables equations are inhomogeneous-linear
first-order PDE systems. Their general solution thus splits into complementary
function plus particular integral: strong and nontrivially-weak observables
respectively. We provide a PDE analysis for each of these. In the case of
single observables equations - corresponding to single constraints - the Flow
Method readily applies. Finding all the observables requires free
characteristic problems. For systems, this method can be applied sequentially,
due to integrability conferred by Frobenius' Theorem. In each case, the first
part of this approach is Lie's Integral Theory of Geometrical Invariants, or
the physical counterpart thereof. The second part finds the function space
thereover, giving the entire space of (local) observables.
  We also outline the Field Theory counterpart. Here one has functional
differential equations. Banach (or tame Fr\'{e}chet) Calculus is however
sufficiently standard for the Flow Method and free characteristic problems to
still apply. These calculi support the Lie-theoretic combination of machinery

Negative statements are useful to overcome limitations of question answering

to informative summaries of entities. Due to the abundance of such invalid

differentiable, sparse alternative to maximum a posteriori (MAP) and marginal
inference. SparseMAP returns a combination of a small number of structures, a
desirable property in some downstream applications. However, SparseMAP requires
a tractable MAP inference oracle. This excludes, e.g., loopy graphical models
or factor graphs with logic constraints, which generally require approximate
inference. In this paper, we introduce LP-SparseMAP, an extension of SparseMAP
that addresses this limitation via a local polytope relaxation. LP-SparseMAP
uses the flexible and powerful domain specific language of factor graphs for
defining and backpropagating through arbitrary hidden structure, supporting
coarse decompositions, hard logic constraints, and higher-order correlations.
We derive the forward and backward algorithms needed for using LP-SparseMAP as
a hidden or output layer. Experiments in three structured prediction tasks show
benefits compared to SparseMAP and Structured SVM.

and possibly exposure variability over random sampling, {even though} the
auxiliary variable is not of scientific interest. {For analysis,} we propose a
generalized linear model based approach using a sequence of two offsetted

response and covariate data using an offsetted logistic regression model. The
offset hinges on the (assumed) known ratio of sampling probabilities for
different values of the auxiliary variable. Results from the auxiliary model
are used to estimate observation-specific probabilities of being sampled
conditional on the response and covariates, and these probabilities are then
used to account for bias in the second, target population model. We provide
asymptotic standard errors accounting for uncertainty in the estimation of the
auxiliary model, and perform simulation studies demonstrating substantial bias
reduction, correct coverage probability, and improved design efficiency over
simple random sampling designs. We illustrate the approaches with two examples.

step in Radiation Therapy (RT) planning. Recently, deep learning based methods
for OAR delineation have been proposed and applied in clinical practice for
separate regions of the human body (head and neck, thorax, and abdomen).
However, there are few researches regarding the end-to-end whole-body OARs
delineation because the existing datasets are mostly partially or incompletely
annotated for such task. In this paper, our proposed end-to-end convolutional
neural network model, called \textbf{AttentionAnatomy}, can be jointly trained
with three partially annotated datasets, segmenting OARs from whole body. Our
main contributions are: 1) an attention module implicitly guided by body region
label to modulate the segmentation branch output; 2) a prediction
re-calibration operation, exploiting prior information of the input images, to
handle partial-annotation(HPA) problem; 3) a new hybrid loss function combining
batch Dice loss and spatially balanced focal loss to alleviate the organ size
imbalance problem. Experimental results of our proposed framework presented
significant improvements in both S{\o}rensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) and 95\%
Hausdorff distance compared to the baseline model.

societies -- must communicate efficiently to function properly: e.g., allowing
electrochemical signals to travel quickly among functionally connected neuronal
areas in the human brain, or allowing for fast navigation of humans and goods
in complex transportation landscapes. The coexistence of different types of
relationships among the units, entailing a multilayer represention in which
types are considered as networks encoded by layers, plays an important role in
the quality of information exchange among them. While altering the structure of
such systems -- e.g., by physically adding (or removing) units, connections or
layers -- might be costly, coupling the dynamics of subset(s) of layers in a
way that reduces the number of redundant diffusion pathways across the
multilayer system, can potentially accelerate the overall information flow. To
this aim, we introduce a framework for functional reducibility which allow us
to enhance transport phenomena in multilayer systems by coupling layers
together with respect to dynamics rather than structure. Mathematically, the
optimal configuration is obtained by maximizing the deviation of system's
entropy from the limit of free and non-interacting layers. Our results provide
a transparent procedure to reduce diffusion time and optimize non-compact

that the absorbing material is rather young, likely ejected in the recent past

consequence of the role of low mass galaxies in the early evolution of the
circum-galactic and intergalactic media.

Rather than relying on an inductive definition of parsing, we use abstract

properties including soundness and completeness are maintained. The correctness
properties are embedded in the types of the operations so that the proofs can

Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model, which assumes people approximately
optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their
exponentiated reward. While this model has been successful in a variety of
robotics domains, its roots lie in econometrics, and in modeling decisions
among different discrete options, each with its own utility or reward. In
contrast, human trajectories lie in a continuous space, with continuous-valued
features that influence the reward function. We propose that it is time to
rethink the Boltzmann model, and design it from the ground up to operate over
such trajectory spaces. We introduce a model that explicitly accounts for
distances between trajectories, rather than only their rewards. Rather than
each trajectory affecting the decision independently, similar trajectories now
affect the decision together. We start by showing that our model better
explains human behavior in a user study. We then analyze the implications this
has for robot inference, first in toy environments where we have ground truth
and find more accurate inference, and finally for a 7DOF robot arm learning

the evolution of a merger remnant of massive binary neutron stars or low-mass

previous studies of other groups: 15-30% of the disk mass is ejected from the
system with the average velocity of $\sim $5-10% of the speed of light for the
plausible profile of the disk as merger remnants. In addition, we find that for
the not extremely high viscous coefficient case, the neutron richness of the
ejecta does not become very high, because weak interaction processes enhance
the electron fraction during the viscous expansion of the disk before the onset
of the mass ejection, resulting in the suppression of the lanthanide synthesis.
For high-mass disks, the viscous expansion timescale is increased by a
longer-term neutrino emission, and hence, the electron fraction of the ejecta
becomes even higher. We also confirm that the mass distribution of the electron
fraction depends strongly on the magnitude of the given viscous coefficient.
This demonstrates that a first-principle magnetohydrodynamics simulation is
necessary for black hole-disk systems with sufficient grid resolution and with
sufficiently long timescale (longer than seconds) to clarify the
nucleosynthesis and electromagnetic signals from them.

to reach $\approx$ 300 gravitational radii, with only one poorly constrained
parameter (the magnetic field in the stellar winds). Even for winds with
relatively weak magnetic fields (e.g., plasma $\beta$ $\sim$ $10^6$), flux
freezing/compression in the inflowing gas amplifies the field to $\beta$ $\sim$
few well before it reaches the event horizon. Overall, the dynamics, accretion
rate, and spherically averaged flow profiles (e.g., density, velocity) in our
MHD simulations are remarkably similar to analogous hydrodynamic simulations.
We attribute this to the broad distribution of angular momentum provided by the
stellar winds, which sources accretion even absent much angular momentum
transport. We find that the magneto-rotational instability is not important
because of i) strong magnetic fields that are amplified by flux
freezing/compression, and ii) the rapid inflow/outflow times of the gas and
inefficient radiative cooling preclude circularization. The primary effect of
magnetic fields is that they drive a polar outflow that is absent in
hydrodynamics. The dynamical state of the accretion flow found in our
simulations is unlike the rotationally supported tori used as initial
conditions in horizon scale simulations, which could have implications for
models being used to interpret Event Horizon Telescope and GRAVITY observations

cosmological, large box, magneto-hydrodynamical simulation suite. The PM sample
spans a wide range of merger and galaxy properties ($M_\star$, $\mu$,
$f_\mathrm{gas}$). We demonstrate that star forming (SF) PMs exhibit enhanced
star formation rates (SFRs) on average by a factor of $\sim 2$, while the
passive PMs show no statistical enhancement. We find that the SFR enhancements:
(1) show no dependence on redshift, (2) anti-correlate with the PM's stellar
mass, and (3) correlate with the gas fraction of the PM's progenitors. However,
SF PMs show stronger enhancements which may indicate other processes being at
play (e.g., gas phase, feedback efficiency). Although the SFR enhancement
correlates mildly with the merger mass ratio, the more abundant minor mergers
($0.1 \le \mu < 0.3 $) still contribute $\sim 50\%$ of the total SFR
enhancement. By tracing the PM sample forward in time, we find that galaxy
mergers can drive significant SFR enhancements which decay over $\sim 0.5$ Gyr
independent of the merger mass ratio, although the decay timescale is dependent
on the simulation resolution. The strongest merger-driven starburst galaxies
evolve to be passive/quenched on faster timescales than their controls.

the merger of a low-mass black hole and a neutron star. Although tidal
disruption occurs for such a low-mass black hole as is generally expected, the
masses of the dynamical ejecta are limited to <~10^{-3}M_sun, which is
consistent with previous work in the literature. The remnant disk could be as
massive as 0.05--0.1M_sun, and the disk outflow of ~0.01--0.03M_sun is likely
to be driven by viscous or magnetohydrodynamic effects. The disk outflow may
not be neutron-rich enough to synthesize an abundance of lanthanide elements,
even in the absence of strong neutrino emitter, if the ejection is driven on
the viscous time scale of >~0.3s. If this is the case, the opacity of the disk
outflow is kept moderate, and a kilonova/macronova at the distance of GW190425
reaches a detectable brightness of 20--21mag at 1day after merger for most
viewing angles. If some disk activity ejects the mass within ~0.1s, instead,
lanthanide-rich outflows would be launched and the detection of emission
becomes challenging. Future possible detections of kilonovae/macronovae from
GW190425-like systems will disfavor the prompt collapse of binary neutron stars

orbited by a companion a few per cent the mass of the sun. It has been
suggested that the pulsar's rotationally powered $\gamma$-ray luminosity
gradually evaporates the companion, eventually leaving behind an isolated
millisecond pulsar. The evaporation efficiency is determined by the temperature
$T_{\rm ch}\propto F^{2/3}$ to which the outflow is heated by the flux $F$ on a
dynamical time-scale. Evaporation is most efficient for companions that fill
their Roche lobes. In this case, the outflow is dominated by a cap around the
L1 point with an angle $\theta_g\sim (T_{\rm ch}/T_g)^{1/2}$, and the
evaporation time is $t_{\rm evap}=0.46(T_{\rm ch}/T_g)^{-2}\textrm{ Gyr}$,
where $T_g>T_{\rm ch}$ is the companion's virial temperature. We apply our
model to the observed black widow population, which has increased substantially
over the last decade, considering each system's orbital period, companion mass,
and pulsar spin-down power. While the original (Fruchter et al. 1988) black
widow evaporates its companion on a few Gyr time-scale, direct evaporation on
its own is too weak to explain the overall population. We propose instead that
the evaporative wind couples to the companion's magnetic field, removes angular
momentum from the binary, and maintains stable Roche-lobe overflow. While a
stronger wind carries more mass, it also reduces the Alfv\'en radius, making
this indirect magnetic braking mechanism less dependent on the flux $t_{\rm
mag}\propto t_{\rm evap}^{1/3}$. This reduces the scatter in evolution times of
observed systems, thus better explaining the combined black widow and isolated
millisecond pulsar populations.

main-sequence stars that exhibit emission-line dominated spectra. For a given
metallicity Z, stars exceeding a certain initial mass M_single(Z) can reach the
WR phase through intrinsic mass-loss (single-star channel). Stars of lower
masses can reach the WR phase via binary mass transfer (binary channel). It is
commonly assumed that the binary channel dominates the formation of WR stars in
environments with low Z such as the SMC and LMC. However, their reported WR
binary fractions of 30-40% are comparable to that of the Galaxy. Here, we
explain this apparent contradiction by considering the minimum initial mass
M_spec(Z) needed for the stripped product to appear as a WR star. We calibrate
M_spec(Z) using the lowest-luminosity WR stars in the Clouds and the Galaxy. A
range of M_single(Z) values are explored using various evolution codes. We
estimate the additional contribution of the binary channel by considering the
interval [M_spec(Z), M_single(Z)], which characterises the initial-mass range
in which binaries can form additional WR stars.
  Results: The WR-phenomenon ceases below luminosities of logL = 4.9, 5.25, and
5.6 [Lsun] in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC, which translates to He-star masses of
7.5, 11, 17 Msun and initial masses of M_spec = 18, 23, 37 Msun. Stripped stars
with lower initial masses in the respective galaxies would tend to not appear
as WR stars. M_single lies in the range 20-30, 30-60, and > 40 Msun for the
Galaxy, LMC, and SMC. We find that that the additional contribution of the
binary channel is a non-trivial function of Z that cannot be conclusively
claimed to be monotonically increasing with decreasing Z. Hence, one should not
a-priori expect that binary interactions become increasingly important in
forming WR stars at low Z, or that the WR binary fraction grows with decreasing
Z.

environmental effects on galaxy evolution. In particular, we exploit the
susceptibility of dust to external processes to assess the influence of dense
environment on star-forming galaxies. We have selected cluster Abell 1758 from
the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS). Its complex dynamical state is
an ideal test-bench to track dust removal and destruction in galaxies due to
merger and accretion shocks. We present a systematic panchromatic study (from
0.15 $\rm \mu$m with GALEX to 500 $\rm \mu$m with Herschel) of
spectroscopically confirmed star-forming cluster galaxies at intermediate
redshift. We observe that the main subclusters (A1758N and A1758S) belong to
two separate large-scale structures, with no overlapping galaxy members.
Star-forming cluster members are distributed preferentially outside cluster
central regions, and are not grouped in substructures. Rather, these galaxies
are being funneled towards the main subclusters along separate accretion
filaments. Additionally, we present the first study of dust-to-stellar (DTS)
mass ratio used as indicator for local environmental influence on galaxy
evolution. Star-forming cluster members show lower mean values (32% at 2.4$\rm
\sigma$) of DTS mass ratio and lower levels of infrared emission from birth
clouds with respect to coeval star-forming field galaxies. This picture is
consistent with the majority of star-forming cluster members infalling in
isolation. Upon accretion, star-formation is observed to decrease and warm dust
is destroyed due to heating from the intracluster medium radiation,
ram-pressure stripping and merger shocks.

exploit photometric information over 23 bands, from the UV to the far-IR, from
the publicly available DustPedia database to build spatially resolved maps of
stellar mass and star formation rates on sub-galactic scales of 0.5-1.5 kpc, by
performing a spectral energy distribution fitting procedure that accounts for
both the observed and the obscured star formation processes, over a wide range
of internal galaxy environments (bulges, spiral arms, outskirts). With more
than 30 thousands physical cells, we have derived a definition of the local
spatially resolved MS per unit area for disks,
$\log(\Sigma_{SFR})$=0.82log$(\Sigma_{*})$-8.69. This is consistent with the
bulk of recent results based on optical IFU, using the H$\alpha$ line emission
as a SFR tracer. Our work extends the analysis at lower sensitivities in both
M$_{\star}$ and SFR surface densities, up to a factor $\sim$ 10. The self
consistency of the MS relation over different spatial scales, from sub-galactic
to galactic, as well as with a rescaled correlation obtained for high redshift
galaxies, clearly proves its universality.

evolution of the early universe. To understand how these stars affected their
metal-enriched descendants, the details of how, why and where Pop III formation
takes place needs to be determined. One of the processes that is assumed to
greatly affect the formation of Pop III stars is the presence of a Lyman-Werner
(LW) radiation background, that destroys H$_2$, a necessary coolant in the
creation of Pop III stars. Self-shielding can alleviate the effect the LW
background has on the H$_2$ within haloes. In this work, we perform a
cosmological simulation to study the birthplaces of Pop III stars, using the
adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo. We investigate the distribution of host
halo masses and its relationship to the LW background intensity. Compared to
previous work, haloes form Pop III stars at much lower masses, up to a factor
of a few, due to the inclusion of H$_2$ self-shielding. We see no relationship
between the LW intensity and host halo mass. Most haloes form multiple Pop III
stars, with a median number of four, up to a maximum of 16, at the instance of
Pop III formation. Our results suggest that Pop III star formation may be less
affected by LW radiation feedback than previously thought and that Pop III
multiple systems are common.

(AGB) stars. We run a grid of 70 3D hydrodynamics simulations of a
progressively accelerating wind propagating in the Roche potential formed by a
mass-loosing evolved star in orbit with a main sequence companion. We resolve
the flow structure both in the immediate vicinity of the secondary, where bow
shocks, outflows and wind-captured disks form, and up to 40 orbital
separations, where spiral arms, arcs and equatorial density enhancements
develop. When the companion is deeply engulfed in the wind, the lower terminal
wind speeds and more progressive wind acceleration around oxygen-rich AGB stars
make them more prone than carbon-rich AGB stars to display more disturbed
outflows, a disk-like structure around the companion and a wind concentrated in
the orbital plane. In these configurations, a large fraction of the wind is
captured by the companion which leads to a significant shrinking of the orbit
over the mass-loss timescale, if the donor star is at least a few times more
massive than its companion. Provided the companion has a mass of at least a
tenth of the mass of the donor star, it can compress the wind in the orbital
plane up to large distances. Our grid of models covers a wide scope of
configurations function of the dust chemical content, the terminal wind speed
relative to the orbital speed, the extension of the dust condensation region

Reducing MRI scan time is beneficial for both patient experience and cost
considerations. Accelerated MRI scan may be achieved by acquiring less amount
of k-space data (down-sampling in the k-space). However, this leads to lower
resolution and aliasing artifacts for the reconstructed images. There are many
existing approaches for attempting to reconstruct high-quality images from
down-sampled k-space data, with varying complexity and performance. In recent
years, deep-learning approaches have been proposed for this task, and promising
results have been reported. Still, the problem remains challenging especially
because of the high fidelity requirement in most medical applications employing
reconstructed MRI images. In this work, we propose a deep-learning approach,
aiming at reconstructing high-quality images from accelerated MRI acquisition.
Specifically, we use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn the
differences between the aliased images and the original images, employing a
U-Net-like architecture. Further, a micro-architecture termed Residual Dense
Block (RDB) is introduced for learning a better feature representation than the
plain U-Net. Considering the peculiarity of the down-sampled k-space data, we
introduce a new term to the loss function in learning, which effectively
employs the given k-space data during training to provide additional
regularization on the update of the network weights. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we compare it with other state-of-the-art methods. In both visual
inspection and evaluation using standard metrics, the proposed approach is able
to deliver improved performance, demonstrating its potential for providing an

auspicious as this approach is, it brings forth many challenges: from data
security to time latency issues with data computation as well as delivery to

bring data processing and storage close to end-users; however, it minimizes the
time latency issue but still suffers from data security challenges. For
instance, when a fog node providing services to end users is compromised, the
users' data security can be violated. Thus, this paper proposes a secure and
fine-grained data access control scheme by integrating the CP-ABE algorithm and
blockchain concept to prevent fog nodes from violating end users' data security
in a situation where a compromised fog node is being ousted. We also classify
the fog nodes into fog federations, based on their attributes such as services
and locations, to minimize the time latency and communication overhead between
fog nodes and cloud server. Further, the exploitation and integration of the
blockchain concept and the CP-ABE algorithm enables fog nodes in the same fog
federation to perform the authorization process in a distributed manner. In
addition, to solve time latency and communication overhead problems, we equip
every fog node with an off-chain database to store most frequently accessed
data files for specific time, and with an on-chain access control policies
table (On-chain Files Tracking Table) which must be protected from being
tampered by malicious (rogue) fog nodes. Therefore, blockchain plays a vital
role here as it is tamper-proof by nature. We demonstrate our scheme's
efficiency and feasibility by designing algorithms and conducting a security
analysis. The provided analysis shows that the proposed scheme is efficient and

gamma-rays and X-rays during the flaring period. The gamma-ray light curve for
all the flares are binned in one-day time bins and a day scale variability is
observed. Variability time constrains the size and location of the emission
region to 2.1$\times$10$^{16}$ cm and 4.4$\times$10$^{17}$ cm, respectively.
The fractional variability reveals that the source is more than 100\% variable
in gamma-rays and it decreases towards the lower energy. A cross-correlation
study of the emission from different wavebands is done using the \textit{DCF}
method, which shows a strong correlation between them without any time lags.
The zero time lag between different wavebands suggest their co-spatial origin.
This is the first time 3C 279 has shown a strong correlation between gamma-rays

adopted to model the multiwavelength SEDs by using the publicly available code
GAMERA. The study reveals that a higher jet power in electrons is required to
explain the gamma-ray flux during the flaring state, as much as, ten times of

Submitted version",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  By classical results of Herglotz and F. Riesz, any bounded analytic function
in the complex unit disk has a unique inner-outer factorization. Here, a
bounded analytic function is called \emph{inner} or \emph{outer} if
multiplication by this function defines an isometry or has dense range,
respectively, as a linear operator on the Hardy Space, $H^2$, of analytic
functions in the complex unit disk with square-summable Taylor series. This
factorization can be further refined; any inner function $\theta$ decomposes
uniquely as the product of a \emph{Blaschke inner} function and a
\emph{singular inner} function, where the Blaschke inner contains all the
vanishing information of $\theta$, and the singular inner factor has no zeroes
in the unit disk.
  We prove an exact analog of this factorization in the context of the full
Fock space, identified as the \emph{Non-commutative Hardy Space} of analytic

Scuti, 2300 $\gamma$ Doradus and 114 roAp candidates. It is found that a

greater than 2.5 d$^{-1}$ and predicted by models, does not exist. Instead,
high frequencies are to be found over the whole B-star range, eventually
merging with $\delta$ Scuti stars. The cool B stars pulsating in high
frequencies are the Maia variables. It is shown that Maia variables are not
rapidly-rotating $\beta$ Cephei or SPB stars. In the region where $\beta$
Cephei variables are found, the proportion of pulsating stars is larger and
amplitudes are higher and a considerable fraction pulsate in a single mode and
low rotation rate. There is no distinct SPB instability region. Stars pulsating
sole in low frequencies are found among all B stars. At most, only one-third of
B stars appear to pulsate. These results, as well as the fact that a large

generating fine aerosol droplets of a few microns from liquids of viscosity up
to 1000 centipoise. It was originally developed for producing medical aerosols
in inhalation therapy, and now has become an important component as pneumatic
atomizer in the Aerosol Jet(R) direct-write system for additive manufacturing.
Qualitative descriptions of its working mechanism were given in the literature
as an expanding high-speed gas jet creates a negative pressure to syphon liquid
into the jet stream, where the liquid is subsequently blown into sheets,
filaments, and eventually droplets. But quantitative analysis and in-depth
understanding have been lacking until rather recently. In this work, we present
a logical description of the working mechanism of Collison nebulizer based on
OpenFOAM(R) CFD analysis of compressible jet flow in the jet expansion channel.
The positive-feedback liquid aspiration mechanism becomes clear by examining
the CFD results as the jet expansion channel geometry is varied. As a
consequence, the output mist density can be rather insensitive to the liquid
viscosity, which is illustrated by a set of experiments with the Collison-type
pneumatic atomizer in an Aerosol Jet(R) direct-write system. Thus, an intrinsic
self-regulation mechanism is elegantly incorporated in the Collison nebulizer
design. As intuitively expected, experimental data also supports the notion of
the existence of an upper limit for liquid holdup in the limited space of jet
expansion channel; therefore, the output mist density cannot increase
indefinitely by increasing the atomization gas flow rate.

recently accreted planetary bodies. In some cases, the compositions observed
suggest the accretion of material dominantly from the core (or the mantle) of a
differentiated planetary body. Collisions between differentiated
exoplanetesimals produce such fragments. In this work, we take advantage of the
large numbers of white dwarfs where at least one siderophile (core-loving) and
one lithophile (rock-loving) species have been detected to assess how commonly
exoplanetesimals differentiate. We utilise N-body simulations that track the
fate of core and mantle material during the collisional evolution of planetary
systems to show that most remnants of differentiated planetesimals retain core
fractions similar to their parents, whilst some are extremely core-rich or
mantle-rich. Comparison with the white dwarf data for calcium and iron
indicates that the data are consistent with a model in which $66^{+4}_{-6}\%$
have accreted the remnants of differentiated planetesimals, whilst
$31^{+5}_{-5}\%$ have Ca/Fe abundances altered by the effects of heating
(although the former can be as high as $100\%$, if heating is ignored). These
conclusions assume pollution by a single body and that collisional evolution
retains similar features across diverse planetary systems. These results imply
that both collisions and differentiation are key processes in exoplanetary
systems. We highlight the need for a larger sample of polluted white dwarfs
with precisely determined metal abundances to better understand the process of
differentiation in exoplanetary systems.

detection of a compact object binary merger, GW190425, with a total mass of
$3.4^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$ M$_{\odot}$, and individual component masses in the range
of about 1.1 to 2.5 $M_{\odot}$. If the constituent compact objects are neutron
stars, then the total mass is five standard deviations higher than the mean of
$2.66\pm 0.12$ M$_{\odot}$ for Galactic binary neutron stars (BNSs). LVC
suggests such massive BNS systems are born from a fast-merging channel, and
therefore, their non-detection in the Galaxy to be due to a selection effect.
However, we are unable to reconcile the inferred formation efficiency from the
reported merger rate, $\mathcal{R}_{\rm GW190425}=460^{+1050}_{-390}$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$, with predictions from our own study for fast-merging BNS systems.
Moreover, the comparable merger rates of GW190425, and GW170817 are possibly in
tension with our results for two reasons: (i) more massive systems are expected
to have a lower formation rate, and (ii) fast merging channels should
constitute $\lesssim 10\%$ of the total BNS systems if case BB unstable mass
transfer is permitted to take place as a formation pathway. We argue that to
account for the high merger rate of GW190425 as a BNS system requires: (i)
revisiting our understanding of NS formation in supernova explosions, or (ii):
that more massive NSs need to be preferentially born with either very weak or
very high magnetic fields so that they would be undetectable in the radio
surveys. Perhaps massive NSs detected in NS-white dwarf binaries are our clues
to the formation path of GW190425 systems.

different levels of emotional valence and arousal were required to take over
control from automated driving, and their takeover time and quality were

time. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating how emotional
valence and arousal affect takeover performance. The benefits of positive
emotions carry over from manual driving to conditionally automated driving

Game of the Goose, involving characters with unique attributes, event squares,
and random event cards. The objective of the game is to reach the camping
before any other player does. We develop a Monte Carlo simulation model that
automatically plays the game and enables analyzing its key characteristics. We
assess the game on various metrics relevant to each playability. Numerical
analysis shows that, on average, the game takes between 69 and 123 rounds to
complete, depending on the number of players. However, durations over one hour
(translated to human play time) occur over 25% of the games, which might reduce
the quality of the gaming experience. Furthermore, we show that two characters
are about 30% likely to win than the other three, primarily due to being
exposed to fewer random events. We argue that the richer narrative of
role-playing games may extend the duration for which the game remains
enjoyable, such that the metrics cannot directly be compared to those of the
traditional Game-of-the-Goose. Based on our analysis, we provide several
suggestions to improve the game balance with only slight modifications. In a
broader sense, we demonstrate that a basic Monte Carlo simulation suffices to

the unique capabilities made possible with the x-ray free electron lasers. It
enables characterization of atomic scale structural dynamics that dictates the
macroscopic properties of various disordered material systems. Central to the
experimental concept are x-ray optics that are capable of splitting individual
coherent femtosecond x-ray pulse into two distinct pulses, introduce an
adjustable time delay between them, and then recombine the two pulses at the
sample position such that they generate two coherent scattering patterns in
rapid succession. Recent developments in such optics showed that, while true
'amplitude splitting' optics at hard x-ray wavelengths remains a technical
challenge, wavefront and wavelength splitting are both feasible, able to
deliver two micron sized focused beams to the sample with sufficient relative
stability. Here, we however show that the conventional approach to speckle
visibility spectroscopy using these beam splitting techniques can be
problematic, even leading to a decoupling of speckle visibility and material
dynamics. In response, we discuss the details of the experimental approaches
and data analysis protocols for addressing issues caused by subtle beam
dissimilarities for both wavefront and wavelength splitting setups. We also
show that in some scattering geometries, the Q-space mismatch can be resolved
by using two beams of slightly different incidence angle and slightly different
wavelengths at the same time. Instead of measuring the visibility of weak
speckle patterns, the time correlation in sample structure is encoded in the
'side band' of the spatial autocorrelation of the summed speckle patterns, and
can be retrieved straightforwardly from the experimental data. We demonstrate
this with a numerical simulation.

an optimal policy and interact with an environment in sequential decision
making problems. The goodness of a policy is measured by its value function
starting from some initial state. The focus of this paper is to construct
confidence intervals (CIs) for a policy's value in infinite horizon settings
where the number of decision points diverges to infinity. We propose to model
the action-value state function (Q-function) associated with a policy based on
series/sieve method to derive its confidence interval. When the target policy
depends on the observed data as well, we propose a SequentiAl Value Evaluation
(SAVE) method to recursively update the estimated policy and its value
estimator. As long as either the number of trajectories or the number of
decision points diverges to infinity, we show that the proposed CI achieves
nominal coverage even in cases where the optimal policy is not unique.
Simulation studies are conducted to back up our theoretical findings. We apply
the proposed method to a dataset from mobile health studies and find that
reinforcement learning algorithms could help improve patient's health status. A

placed arbitrarily on the nodes of a graph, to work collaboratively to explore
the graph such that each node is eventually visited by at least one robot. One
important requirement of exploration is the {\em termination} condition, i.e.,
the robots must know that exploration is completed. The problem of live
exploration of a dynamic ring using mobile robots was recently introduced in
[Di Luna et al., ICDCS 2016]. In it, they proposed multiple algorithms to solve
exploration in fully synchronous and semi-synchronous settings with various
guarantees when $2$ robots were involved. They also provided guarantees that
with certain assumptions, exploration of the ring using two robots was
impossible. An important question left open was how the presence of $3$ robots
would affect the results. In this paper, we try to settle this question in a
fully synchronous setting and also show how to extend our results to a
semi-synchronous setting.
  In particular, we present algorithms for exploration with explicit
termination using $3$ robots in conjunction with either (i) unique IDs of the
robots and edge crossing detection capability (i.e., two robots moving in
opposite directions through an edge in the same round can detect each other),
or (ii) access to randomness. The time complexity of our deterministic
algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We also provide complementary
impossibility results showing that there does not exist any explicit
termination algorithm for $2$ robots. The theoretical analysis and
comprehensive simulations of our algorithm show the effectiveness and
efficiency of the algorithm in dynamic rings. We also present an algorithm to
achieve exploration with partial termination using $3$ robots in the
semi-synchronous setting.

Introduction, we partition data into mutually exclusive subsets, one that
contains a subset of the ground-truth labels and another that contains the
remaining data attached to a pseudo-label. Throughout the training process, we
recursively reveal unseen ground-truth labels in fixed increments until all the
labels are known to the model. In the second phase, Adaptive Compensation, we
optimize the loss function using altered target vectors of previously

smoother distribution to help models learn better. On evaluating across three

irradiation between $10^1-10^2$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and a total escape rate
in the order of $10^8$ g s$^{-1}$. The inferred escape rate suggests that the
planet will lose only a small fraction (< 1%) of its mass and retain its
volatile-rich atmosphere during its lifetime. More observations are needed to
rule out stellar variability effects, confirm the in-transit absorption and
better assess the atmospheric escape and high-energy environment of K2-18 b.

settings is of central importance to traffic engineers and city planners. In
this work, we propose a methodology to leverage coarse-grained and aggregated
travel time data to estimate the street-level travel times of a given
metropolitan area. Our main focus is to estimate travel times along the
arterial road segments where relevant data are often unavailable. The central
idea of our approach is to leverage easy-to-obtain, aggregated data sets with
broad spatial coverage, such as the data published by Uber Movement, as the
fabric over which other expensive, fine-grained datasets, such as loop counter
and probe data, can be overlaid. Our proposed methodology uses a graph
representation of the road network and combines several techniques such as
graph-based routing, trip sampling, graph sparsification, and least-squares
optimization to estimate the street-level travel times. Using sampled trips and
weighted shortest-path routing, we iteratively solve constrained least-squares
problems to obtain the travel time estimates. We demonstrate our method on the
Los Angeles metropolitan-area street network, where aggregated travel time data
is available for trips between traffic analysis zones. Additionally, we present
techniques to scale our approach via a novel graph pseudo-sparsification
technique.

regularizers of the empirical risk loss. Physics-informed neural networks is an
example of this philosophy in which the outputs of deep neural networks are
constrained to approximately satisfy a given set of partial differential
equations. In this work we review recent advances in scientific machine
learning with a specific focus on the effectiveness of physics-informed neural

physics from noisy data. We will also identify and analyze a fundamental mode
of failure of such approaches that is related to numerical stiffness leading to
unbalanced back-propagated gradients during model training. To address this
limitation we present a learning rate annealing algorithm that utilizes
gradient statistics during model training to balance the interplay between
different terms in composite loss functions. We also propose a novel neural

by radiologists. The paper aims to provide an efficient and accurate detection
system for small lung nodules while keeping good performance for large nodules.
Methods: We propose a multi-planar detection system using convolutional neural
networks. The 2-D convolutional neural network model, U-net++, was trained by
axial, coronal, and sagittal slices for the candidate detection task. All
possible nodule candidates from the three different planes are combined. For
false positive reduction, we apply 3-D multi-scale dense convolutional neural
networks to efficiently remove false positive candidates. We use the public
LIDC-IDRI dataset which includes 888 CT scans with 1186 nodules annotated by
four radiologists. Results: After ten-fold cross-validation, our proposed
system achieves a sensitivity of 94.2% with 1.0 false positive/scan and a
sensitivity of 96.0% with 2.0 false positives/scan. Although it is difficult to
detect small nodules (i.e. < 6 mm), our designed CAD system reaches a
sensitivity of 93.4% (95.0%) of these small nodules at an overall false
positive rate of 1.0 (2.0) false positives/scan. At the nodule candidate
detection stage, results show that a multi-planar method is capable to detect
more nodules compared to using a single plane. Conclusion: Our approach
achieves good performance not only for small nodules, but also for large
lesions on this dataset. This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of
our developed CAD system for lung nodule detection. Significance: The proposed
system could provide support for radiologists on early detection of lung
cancer.

parabolic TDEs, is steeper for marginally eccentric TDEs, and is flatter for
marginally hyperbolic TDEs. The mass fallback rates of the marginally eccentric
TDEs are much larger than the parabolic TDE case, while those of marginally

classical Stereo Vision techniques and deep learning approaches. The
stereoscopic module is composed of two separate modules: one that accelerates
the neural network we trained and one that accelerates the front-end part. The
system is completely passive and does not require any structured light to
obtain very compelling accuracy. With respect to the previous Stereo Vision
solutions offered by the industries we offer a major improvement is robustness
to noise. This is mainly possible due to the deep learning part of the chosen
architecture. We submitted our result to Middlebury dataset challenge. It
currently ranks as the best System on Chip solution. The system has been
developed for low latency applications which require better than real time

$\Xi_{cc}^{++}, \Xi_{cc}^+$ and $\Omega_{cc}^+$ are studied in this work. To
estimate the nonfactorizable contributions, we work in the pole model for the
$P$-wave amplitudes and current algebra for $S$-wave ones. For the
$\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to \Xi_c^+\pi^+$ mode, we find a large destructive interference
between factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions for both $S$- and
$P$-wave amplitudes. Our prediction of $\sim 0.70\%$ for its branching fraction
is smaller than the earlier estimates in which nonfactorizable effects were not
considered, but agrees nicely with the result based on an entirely different
approach, namely, the covariant confined quark model. On the contrary, a large
constructive interference was found in the $P$-wave amplitude by Dhir and
Sharma, leading to a branching fraction of order $(7-16)\%$. Using the current
results for the absolute branching fractions of $(\Lambda_c^+,\Xi_c^+)\to p
K^-\pi^+$ and the LHCb measurement of $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+$ relative
to $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Lambda_c^+ K^- \pi^+\pi^+$, we obtain
$\B(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+)_{\rm expt}\approx (1.83\pm1.01)\%$ after
employing the latest prediction of
$\B(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Sigma_c^{++}\overline{K}^{*0})$. Our prediction of
$\mathcal{B}(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_c^+\pi^+)\approx 0.7\%$ is thus consistent
with the experimental value but in the lower end. It is important to pin down
the branching fraction of this mode in future study. Factorizable and
nonfactorizable $S$-wave amplitudes interfere constructively in
$\Xi_{cc}^+\to\Xi_c^0\pi^+$. Its large branching fraction of order 4\% may
enable experimentalists to search for the $\Xi_{cc}^+$ through this mode. That
is, the $\Xi_{cc}^+$ is reconstructed through the $\Xi_{cc}^+\to\Xi_c^0\pi^+$
followed by the decay chain $\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+\to p\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+$.

We obtain correlated pilots using a user capacity-achieving pilot sequence

sequences based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements
for all the legitimate users. The pilot design is capable of achieving the SINR
requirements for all users even in the presence of PC. However, this design has
some intrinsic limitations and vulnerabilities, such as a known pilot sequence
and the non-zero cross-correlation among different pilot sequences. We reveal
that such vulnerabilities may be exploited by an active attacker to increase PC
in the network. Motivated by this, we analyze the correlated pilot design for
vulnerabilities that can be exploited by an active attacker. Based on this
analysis, we develop an effective active attack strategy in the massive MIMO

capacity region of the network is significantly reduced in the presence of the

$(\hat{p}_1, \dots, \hat{p}_n)$ is a closest approximation to the target

relative amplitude variations using analytical and numerical tools. When the
forcing is internal the phase variation displays a random walk behaviour and a
red noise power spectrum with a ragged erratic appearance. We determine the
dependence of the root mean square phase and relative amplitude variations
($\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ and $\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$, respectively) on the
amplitude of the stochastic perturbations, the damping constant $\eta$, and the
total observation time $t_{\rm obs}$ for this case, under the assumption that
the relative amplitude variations remain small, showing that $\sigma_{\Delta

$\sigma_{\Delta A/A}$ for $t_{\rm obs} \gg \eta^{-1}$. In the case of an
external forcing the phase and relative amplitude variations remain of the same
order, independent of the observing time. In the case of an internal forcing,
we find that $\sigma_{\Delta \varphi}$ does not depend on $\eta$. Hence, the
damping time cannot be inferred from fitting the power of the signal, as done
for solar-like pulsators, but the amplitude of the stochastic perturbations may
be constrained from the observations. Our results imply that, given sufficient
time, the variation of the phase associated to the stochastic perturbations in
internally driven classical pulsators will become sufficiently large to be

the UAVs with their neighbors via multi-hops, allowing tracking the target by a
local Bayesian estimator running at each agent. Since not all the paths are
equal in terms of information gathering point-of-view, the UAVs plan their own
trajectory by minimizing the posterior covariance matrix of the target state
under UAV kinematic and anti-collision constraints. Our results show how a
dynamic network of radars attains better localization results compared to a

circuits accumulate evidence towards a decision. Fitting models of
decision-making theory to neural activity helps answer this question, but
current approaches limit the number of these models that we can fit to neural
data. Here we propose a unifying framework for modeling neural activity during
decision-making tasks. The framework includes the canonical drift-diffusion
model and enables extensions such as multi-dimensional accumulators, variable
and collapsing boundaries, and discrete jumps. Our framework is based on
constraining the parameters of recurrent state-space models, for which we
introduce a scalable variational Laplace-EM inference algorithm. We applied the
modeling approach to spiking responses recorded from monkey parietal cortex
during two decision-making tasks. We found that a two-dimensional accumulator
better captured the trial-averaged responses of a set of parietal neurons than
a single accumulator model. Next, we identified a variable lower boundary in
the responses of an LIP neuron during a random dot motion task.

survive under distortions, while requiring the encoded image to have little or

methods achieved impressive results in both visual quality and message payload

Brezzi-Douglas-Marini mixed finite element spaces for the poroelastic stress

continuous piecewise linear or bilinear rotation. A vertex quadrature rule is
applied to the velocity, stress, and stress-rotation bilinear forms, which

belonging to the disk population (-1 < [Fe/H] < 0.5), which may provide
important observational constraint on the nucleosynthesis history of K in the
galactic disk. Special attention was paid to clarifying the observed behaviors
of [K/Fe] in terms of [Fe/H] along with stellar age, and to checking whether
giants and dwarfs yield consistent results with each other. The following
results were obtained. (1) A slightly increasing tendency of [K/Fe] with a
decrease in [Fe/H] (d[K/Fe]/d[Fe/H] ~ -0.1 to -0.15; a shallower slope than
reported by previous studies) was confirmed for FGK dwarfs, though thick-disk
stars tend to show larger [K/Fe] deviating from this gradient. (2) Almost
similar characteristics was observed also for apparently bright field giants
locating in the solar neighborhood (such as like dwarfs). (3) However, the
[K/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation for more distant {\it Kepler} giants shows larger
scatter and is systematically higher (by <~0.1dex) than that of dwarfs,
implying that chemical evolution of K is rather diversified depending on the
position in the Galaxy. (4) Regarding the age-dependence, a marginal trend of
increasing [K/Fe] with age is recognized for dwarfs, while any systematic
tendency is not observed for Kepler giants. These consequences may suggest that
evolution of [K/Fe] with time in the galactic disk does exist but proceeded
more gradually than previously thought, and its condition is appreciably
location-dependent.

equivalent widths dispersion of saturated lines tend to increase with the
effective Lande factor, suggesting an influence of magnetic field. Our power
spectrum analysis applied to the time-sequence data of V I/Fe II line-strength
ratio and T_eff could not confirm the 6.4 d period reported by previous
studies. We suspect that surface inhomogeneities of \xi Boo A at the time of

complex (e.g., intricate aggregate of spots and faculae).

a new theoretical protocol to construct a universal $(n+1)$-qubit Toffoli gate
sphere based on the Rydberg blockade mechanism, by constraining the behavior of
one central target atom with $n$ surrounding control atoms. Its merit lies in
the use of only five $\pi$ pulses independent of the control atom number $n$
which leads to the overall gate time as fast as $\sim$125$n$s and the average
fidelity closing to 0.999. The maximal filling number of control atoms can be
up to $n=46$, determined by the spherical diameter which is equal to the
blockade radius, as well as by the nearest neighbor spacing between two
trapped-atom lattices. Taking $n=2,3,4$ as examples we comparably show the gate
performance with experimentally accessible parameters, and confirm that the
gate errors mainly attribute to the imperfect blockade strength, the
spontaneous atomic loss and the imperfect ground-state preparation. In contrast
to an one-dimensional-array configuration it is remarkable that the spherical
atomic sample preserves a high-fidelity output against the increasing of $n$,
shedding light on the study of scalable quantum simulation and entanglement

velocity ratios, $r=1$ and $r=2$, using highly resolved large eddy simulations

previously observed but unexplained phenomenon of negative turbulent
diffusivity. We identify two distinct types of counter gradient transport,
prevalent in different regions: the first, throughout the windward shear layer,
is caused by cross-gradient transport; the second, close to the wall right
after injection, is caused by non-local effects. Then, we propose a deep
learning approach for modelling the turbulent scalar flux by adapting the
tensor basis neural network previously developed to model Reynolds stresses
(Ling et al. 2016a). This approach uses a deep neural network with embedded
coordinate frame invariance to predict a tensorial turbulent diffusivity that
is not explicitly available in the high fidelity data used for training. After
ensuring analytically that the matrix diffusivity leads to a stable solution
for the advection diffusion equation, we apply this approach in the inclined
jets in crossflow under study. The results show significant improvement
compared to a simple model, particularly where cross-gradient effects play an
important role in turbulent mixing. The model proposed herein is not limited to
jets in crossflow; it can be used in any turbulent flow where the Reynolds
averaged transport of a scalar is considered.

investigate the shape and parameters of the instability time distributions
(ITDs) for ensembles of shadow trajectories that are initially perturbed from
one another near machine precision. We find that in the limit where instability
times are long compared to the Lyapunov (chaotic) timescale, ITDs approach
remarkably similar lognormal distributions with standard deviations ~0.43 $\pm$
0.16 dex, despite the instability times varying across our sample from
$10^4-10^8$ orbits. We find excellent agreement between these predictions,
derived from ~450 closely packed configurations of three planets, and a much
wider validation set of ~10,000 integrations, as well as on ~20,000 previously

closely related with the neutral inclusion, and its equivalent formulation in
terms of Newtonian potentials. The main body of this paper consists of reviews

metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) family has been widely studied only for the

the centrosymmetric of the crystal. Based on first-principles calculations, we
show that significant spin splitting can be induced in the ML 1T-TMDCs by
introducing the line defect. Taking the ML PtSe2 as a representative example,
we considered the most stable form of the line defects, namely Se-vacancy line
defect (Se-VLD). We find that large spin splitting is observed in the defect
states of the Se-VLD, exhibiting a highly unidirectional spin configuration in
the momentum space. This peculiar spin configuration may yield the so-called
persistent spin textures (PST), a specific spin structure resulting in
protection against spin-decoherence and supporting an extraordinarily long spin
lifetime. Moreover, by using k.p perturbation theory supplemented with symmetry
analysis, we clarified that the emerging of the spin splitting maintaining the
PST in the defect states is originated from the inversion symmetry breaking
together with one-dimensional nature of the Se-VLD engineered ML PtSe2. Our
findings pave a possible way to induce the significant spin splitting in the ML
1T-TMDCs, which could be highly important for designing spintronic devices.

involve divergence free vector fields supported on collections of essentially
linked magnetic tubes. Justification of Moffatt's examples requires the strong
convergence of a minimizing sequence. What is proven in the current note is
that there is a gap between the global minimum ({\em Woltjer's minimizer}) and
the minimum over the weak $L^2$ closure of the class of vector fields obtained
from a topologically non-trivial field by energy-decreasing diffeomorphisms. In
the context of Taylor's conjecture, our result shows that the Woltjer's

estimation and inference for a low-rank matrix from noisy observations: (1) how
to estimate an unknown eigenvector when the eigen-gap (i.e. the spacing between
the associated eigenvalue and the rest of the spectrum) is particularly small;
(2) how to perform estimation and inference on linear functionals of an
eigenvector -- a sort of ""fine-grained"" statistical reasoning that goes far
beyond the usual $\ell_2$ analysis. We investigate how to address these
challenges in a setting where the unknown $n\times n$ matrix is symmetric and
the additive noise matrix contains independent (and non-symmetric) entries.
Based on eigen-decomposition of the asymmetric data matrix, we propose
estimation and uncertainty quantification procedures for an unknown
eigenvector, which further allow us to reason about linear functionals of an
unknown eigenvector. The proposed procedures and the accompanying theory enjoy
several important features: (1) distribution-free (i.e. prior knowledge about
the noise distributions is not needed); (2) adaptive to heteroscedastic noise;
(3) minimax optimal under Gaussian noise. Along the way, we establish optimal
procedures to construct confidence intervals for the unknown eigenvalues. All
this is guaranteed even in the presence of a small eigen-gap (up to
$O(\sqrt{n/\mathrm{poly}\log (n)})$ times smaller than the requirement in prior

characteristics compared with subsonic and supersonic cases. Although a lot of
research has been carried out in this field, the underlying mechanisms of these
complex phenomena are not clearly understood yet, resulting in a challenge in
the design and use of modern aircraft. This review summarizes the recent
investigations on nonclassical transonic aeroelastic problems, including
transonic buzz, reduction of transonic buffet onset, transonic buffeting
response and frequency lock-in phenomenon in transonic buffet flow. After
introducing the research methods in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelastic
problems, the dynamical characteristics as well as the physical mechanisms of
these phenomena are discussed from the perspective of the fluid mode. In the
framework of the ROM (reduced order model) -based model, the dominant fluid
mode (or the eigenvalue) and its coupling process with the structural model can
be clearly captured. The flow nonlinearity was believed to be the cause of the
complexity of transonic aeroelasticity. In fact, this review indicates that the
complexity lies in the decrease of the flow stability in the transonic regime.
In this condition, the fluid mode becomes a principal part of the coupling
process, which results in the instability of the fluid mode itself or the
structural mode, and thus, it is the root cause of different transonic
aeroelastic phenomena.

reduced, but remains a large fraction of the unmodified case, and the

attracted extensive attention in similarity retrieval across the heterogeneous

account: (1) most current CMH methods transform real-valued data points into
discrete compact binary codes under the binary constraints, limiting the
capability of representation for original data on account of abundant loss of
information and producing suboptimal hash codes; (2) the discrete binary
constraint learning model is hard to solve, where the retrieval performance may
greatly reduce by relaxing the binary constraints for large quantization error;
(3) handling the learning problem of CMH in a symmetric framework, leading to
difficult and complex optimization objective. To address above challenges, in
this paper, a novel Asymmetric Correlation Quantization Hashing (ACQH) method
is proposed. Specifically, ACQH learns the projection matrixs of heterogeneous
modalities data points for transforming query into a low-dimensional
real-valued vector in latent semantic space and constructs the stacked
compositional quantization embedding in a coarse-to-fine manner for indicating
database points by a series of learnt real-valued codeword in the codebook with
the help of pointwise label information regression simultaneously. Besides, the

granulation play an important role in creating small-scale magnetic structures,
as well as in energy injection into the upper atmosphere. The turbulent nature
of granulation can be studied using spectral line profiles, especially line
broadening, which contains information on the flow field smaller than the
spatial resolution of an instrument. Moreover, the Doppler velocity gradient
along a line-of-sight (LOS) causes line broadening as well. However, the
quantitative relationship between velocity gradient and line broadening has not
been understood well. In this study, we perform bisector analyses using the
spectral profiles obtained using the Spectro-Polarimeter of the Hinode/Solar
Optical Telescope to investigate the relationship of line broadening and
bisector velocities with the granulation flows. The results indicate that line
broadening has a positive correlation with the Doppler velocity gradients along
the LOS. We found excessive line broadening in fading granules, that cannot be
explained only by the LOS velocity gradient, although the velocity gradient is
enhanced in the process of fading. If this excessive line broadening is
attributed to small-scale turbulent motions, the averaged turbulent velocity is
obtained as 0.9 km/s.

reaching X9.3 class and accompanied with a coronal mass ejection. Why these two
X-class flares occurred in the same position with similar magnetic
configurations, but one is eruptive while the other is not? Here we track the
coronal magnetic field evolution via nonlinear force-free field extrapolations
from a time sequence of vector magnetograms with high cadence. A detailed
analysis of the magnetic field shows that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) forms and
grows gradually before the first flare, and shortly afterwards, the MFR's
growth is significantly enhanced with a much faster rise in height, from far
below the threshold of torus instability to above it, while the magnetic twist
only increases mildly. Combining EUV observations and the magnetic field
extrapolation, we found that overlying the MFR is a null-point magnetic
topology, where recurrent brightening is seen after the first flare. We thus
suggest a scenario to interpret the occurrence of the two flares. The first
flare occurred since the MFR reached a high enough height to activate the null
point, and its continuous expansion forces the null-point reconnection
recurrently. Such reconnection weakens the overlying field, allowing the MFR to
rise faster, which eventually crosses the threshold of torus instability and
triggers the second, eruptive flare.

regression. Most existing approaches replace an outlier-prone Gaussian
likelihood with a non-Gaussian likelihood induced from a heavy tail
distribution, such as the Laplace distribution and Student-t distribution.
However, the use of a non-Gaussian likelihood would incur the need for a
computationally expensive Bayesian approximate computation in the posterior
inferences. The proposed approach models an outlier as a noisy and biased
observation of an unknown regression function, and accordingly, the likelihood
contains bias terms to explain the degree of deviations from the regression
function. We entail how the biases can be estimated accurately with other
hyperparameters by a regularized maximum likelihood estimation. Conditioned on
the bias estimates, the robust GP regression can be reduced to a standard GP
regression problem with analytical forms of the predictive mean and variance
estimates. Therefore, the proposed approach is simple and very computationally
attractive. It also gives a very robust and accurate GP estimate for many
tested scenarios. For the numerical evaluation, we perform a comprehensive
simulation study to evaluate the proposed approach with the comparison to the
existing robust GP approaches under various simulated scenarios of different
outlier proportions and different noise levels. The approach is applied to data
from two measurement systems, where the predictors are based on robust
environmental parameter measurements and the response variables utilize more
complex chemical sensing methods that contain a certain percentage of outliers.
The utility of the measurement systems and value of the environmental data are
improved through the computationally efficient GP regression and bias model.

wave source (particle) through periodically interacting with the local wave
field it generates during the droplet-bath impact. By virtue of such
particle-wave duality, the macroscopic hydrodynamic system imitates enigmatic
behaviors of the quantum realm. Here we show that it is possible to create an
integrated pilot-wave field to better prescribe the droplet trajectories, via
amplified bath capillarity. This is demonstrated with a liquid metal
droplet-bath system in which the local wave field generated by droplet bouncing
is superposed by the global wave field induced by bath meniscus oscillation.
The resulting dual pilot-wave configuration enables a class of directional
chasing motions of two bound dissimilar droplets (heterodimers) in multilevel
hydrodynamic traps (orbits), featuring two quantized regime parameters, namely
the interdroplet binding level and the orbit level. We investigate the dynamics
of the vibrating liquid metal bath, with its level-split ring wave field and
its peculiar vortex field being highlighted. We also rationalize the exotic
droplet motions by considering the interdroplet particle-wave interactions
mediated by the integrated pilot-wave field. It is revealed that a temporal
bouncing phase shift between the two droplets in the heterodimers, due to size
mismatch, gives rise to their horizontal propulsion, while their spatial
binding regime exclusively determines the collective chasing direction. It is
further evidenced that the horizontal in-orbit chasing motion is directly
related to vertical droplet bouncing. Our findings unveil the integrated
pilot-wave field as a trail towards improved droplet guiding, thereby extending
the hydrodynamic particle-wave analogy to optical systems and beyond.

show that the observational constraints on the parameters of the $\Lambda CDM$

constraints on the transition redshift ($z_{t}$) of a universe dominated by
matter for a universe dominated by the cosmological constant. Using this

between individual velocity and body orientation: the velocity direction is
typically orthogonal with respect to the shoulder line. We make the reasonable
assumption that this approximation, although instantaneously slightly
imperfect, is correct on average. This enables us to use velocity data as
training labels for a highly-accurate point-estimator of individual
orientation, that we can train with no dedicated annotation labor. We discuss
the measurement accuracy and show the error scaling, both on synthetic and
real-life data: we show that our method is capable of estimating orientation
with an error as low as 7.5 degrees. This tool opens up new possibilities in
the studies of human crowd dynamics where orientation is key. By analyzing the
dynamics of body rotation in real-life conditions, we show that the
instantaneous velocity direction can be described by the combination of
orientation and a random delay, where randomness is provided by an
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process centered on an average delay of 100ms. Quantifying

achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996{\deg}C, MAE of 1.539{\deg}C,

the DBN model reduces the MAE values by 1.340{\deg}C, 0.387{\deg}C and

and non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity which has emerged from a number
of different research directions. Recently, this theory has been applied to the
so-called Planck star model -- a particular model of stellar collapse in which
non-perturbative quantum gravity effects play a predominant role. However,
several obstacles have impeded progress in the investigation of this scenario.
These obstacles range from conceptual issues, such as the question how to
extract physical predictions from a background independent theory of quantum
gravity, to computational problems due to a lack of systematic methods to
evaluate CLQG transition amplitudes. This thesis addresses these problems
directly. It contains an analysis of the Planck star model within the framework
of CLQG, including a clarifying discussion on relevant conceptual issues.
Moreover, a new approximation method for CLQG transition amplitudes is
developed. This method allows to systematically study amplitudes in the
semi-classical regime of the theory and it sheds new light on the so-called
cosine problem.

satellite galaxies. While these accreted stellar populations can be
forensically identified as kinematically distinct structures within the Galaxy,
it is difficult in general to precisely date the age at which any one merger
occurred. Recent results have revealed a population of stars that were accreted
via the collision of a dwarf galaxy, called \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus, leading to
a substantial pollution of the chemical and dynamical properties of the Milky
Way. Here, we identify the very bright, naked-eye star $\nu$\,Indi as a probe
of the age of the early in situ population of the Galaxy. We combine
asteroseismic, spectroscopic, astrometric, and kinematic observations to show
that this metal-poor, alpha-element-rich star was an indigenous member of the
halo, and we measure its age to be $11.0 \pm 0.7$ (stat) $\pm 0.8$ (sys)$\,\rm

heated by the \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus collision. Its age implies that the
earliest the merger could have begun was 11.6 and 13.2 Gyr ago at 68 and 95%
confidence, respectively. Input from computations based on hierarchical

macroscopic structures observed in aggregates on planar, porous walls. We
systematically analyze the parameter regimes where the different morphological

We show that the motile ring propels almost ballistically due to the force
applied by the active particles when they form a localized cluster, whereas it
moves diffusively when the active particles form a continuous cluster. This
property demonstrates the possibility of extracting useful work from a system
of ABPs, even without artificially breaking the rotational symmetry.

pitch-angle dependent transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs), focusing
on 3 - 36 MeV protons. By considering observers located at various positions in
the heliosphere, we investigate how drifts may alter the measured
intensity-time profiles and energy spectra. We focus on the decay phase of
solar energetic proton events during which a temporal invariant spectrum and
disappearing spatial intensity gradients are often observed; a phenomenon known
as the 'reservoir effect' or the 'SEP flood'. We study the effects of drifts by
solving the focused transport equation for nominal Parker solar wind
configurations and for a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generated solar wind
containing a corotating interaction region (CIR). The latter configuration
contains a magnetic bottle structure, with one bottleneck at the Sun and the
other at the CIR. It is illustrated that observers magnetically connected close
to the edges of the particle injection site can experience, as a result of
drifts, a sudden drop in the intensities occurring at different times for
different energies such that no SEP flood phenomenon is established. In the
magnetic bottle, this effect is enhanced due to the presence of magnetic field
gradients strengthening the nominal particle drifts. We also show that
interplanetary cross-field diffusion may mitigate these effects of drifts. We
conclude that particle drifts can in some cases substantially modify the decay
phase of SEP events, especially if the solar wind contains compression regions
or shock waves where the drifts are enhanced. This is, for example, the case
for our CIR solar wind configuration generated with a 3D MHD model, where the
effect of drifts is strong. A similar decay rate in different energy channels
and for different observers requires thus the mitigation of the effect of
drifts.

original block Gibbs sampler so that the precision matrix never fails to be

definiteness. As we have shown in the Monte Carlo experiments, this
modification not only stabilizes the sampling procedure but also significantly
improves the performance of the parameter estimation and graphical structure

From the complete model coupling mass transport and hydrodynamics, we first use
a standard Taylor-like approach to derive a one dimensional non-linear

solute mass transport at long time scales, dispersing solutes in a steadily

the Planckian time ($\tau_P=\hbar/k_BT$). We present a study of electric
resistivity, Seebeck coefficient and inelastic neutron scattering extended to
very high temperatures, which deepens the puzzle. Metallic resistivity persists
up to 900 K and is accompanied by a large Seebeck coefficient whose magnitude
(as well as its temperature and doping dependence) indicates that carriers are
becoming heavier with rising temperature. Combining this with neutron
scattering data, we find that between 500 K and 900 K, the Bohr radius and the
electron wave-length become comparable to each other and twice the lattice
parameter. According to our results, between 100 K and 500 K, metallicity is
partially driven by temperature-induced amplification of the carrier mass. We
contrast this mass amplification of non-degenerate electrons with the
better-known case of heavy degenerate electrons. Above 500 K, the
mean-free-path continues to shrink with warming in spite of becoming shorter
than both the interatomic distance and the thermal wavelength of the electrons.
The latter saturates to twice the lattice parameter. Available theories of

considering a two-layer model, a mixture grain-fluid layer and an upper fluid
layer, to allow the exchange of fluid between them. In the present work the
approximation of the mixture layer is improved including normal variations of
the velocities and concentrations of the two phases thanks to the multilayer
approach. In the model presented here dilatancy effects induce in particular a
non-hydrostatic pressure for both phases related to the excess pore fluid
pressure. We identified here one of the main numerical difficulty of solving
two-phase shallow debris flows models: the strongly non-linear behaviour and
abrupt changes of the excess pore fluid pressure when starting from
non-equilibrium conditions. We propose a simplified approach to approximate the
excess pore fluid pressure in the simple case of uniform flows. Our method
makes it possible to introduce two or three layers in the normal directions
with a reasonable approximation. Analytical solutions for uniform grain-fluid
flows over inclined planes, with and without side wall friction, are calculated
and compared to the proposed model. In the numerical results, we observe that
the proposed model with a two layer description of the mixture accurately
represents the velocity measured at the surface of the mixture in the
laboratory experiments. This is obviously poorly represented by the
depth-averaged velocity in single-layer models. Our numerical results show a
significant impact of the parameters involved in dilatancy law, in particular
on the calculation of the time evolution of the excess pore fluid pressure.

for multi-band superconductors. This imposes quantitative constraints on the
gap anisotropies for each of the possible pairing candidate states. We conclude
that the most likely pairing candidate is an unconventional $A_{1g}^{+-}$
state. While we cannot exclude the conventional $A_{1g}^{++}$ and the triplet
$A_{1u}$, we demonstrate that these states require additional assumptions about
the orbital structure of the disorder potential to be consistent with our
experimental results, e.g., a ratio of inter- to intra-band scattering for the
singlet state significantly larger than one. Due to the generality of our
theoretical framework, we think that it will also be useful for irradiation

variety of machine learning tasks, often with large and computation-heavy
models. Inducing sparseness as a way to reduce the memory and computation
footprint of these models has seen significant research attention in recent
years. In this paper, we present a new method for \emph{dynamic sparseness},
whereby part of the computations are omitted dynamically, based on the input.
For efficiency, we combined the idea of dynamic sparseness with block-wise
matrix-vector multiplications. In contrast to static sparseness, which
permanently zeroes out selected positions in weight matrices, our method
preserves the full network capabilities by potentially accessing any trained
weights. Yet, matrix vector multiplications are accelerated by omitting a
pre-defined fraction of weight blocks from the matrix, based on the input.
Experimental results on the task of language modeling, using recurrent and
quasi-recurrent models, show that the proposed method can outperform a
magnitude-based static sparseness baseline. In addition, our method achieves

photoconductivity (CPC), which completely differs from any previously observed
photoelectric phenomenon. In normal photoconductivity, the recombination of
electron-hole pairs takes place at the end of their lifetime, causing a release
of heat; in contrast, infinite-lifetime photocarriers can be generated in CPC
devices without a thermal loss. The photoelectric conversion and storage are
completely self-excited during the charging process. The ratio between currents
in full- and empty-energy states below the critical temperature reaches as high

distilling ensembles into a single compact model, reducing the computational

behavior. Most existing distillation formulations summarize the ensemble by
capturing its average predictions. As a result, the diversity of the ensemble
predictions, stemming from each member, is lost. Thus, the distilled model
cannot provide a measure of uncertainty comparable to that of the original
ensemble. To retain more faithfully the diversity of the ensemble, we propose a
distillation method based on a single multi-headed neural network, which we
refer to as Hydra. The shared body network learns a joint feature
representation that enables each head to capture the predictive behavior of
each ensemble member. We demonstrate that with a slight increase in parameter
count, Hydra improves distillation performance on classification and regression
settings while capturing the uncertainty behavior of the original ensemble over
both in-domain and out-of-distribution tasks.

namely parent Strongly-Connected-Component (parent SCC), parent node, and
contractions. The results show that for particular type of networks (e.g. the

Finally, the results are applied to a hyper-massive neutron star, as an

is how to infer these fingerprints when there is limited network activity
traces. This research proposes the novel model construct that learns to infer
the network behaviorial fingerprint of specific IoT based on limited network
activity traces using a One-Card Time Series Meta-Learner called DeepNetPrint.
Our research also demonstrates the application of DeepNetPrint to identify IoT
devices that performs comparatively well against leading supervised learning
models. Our solution would enable cyber investigator to identify specific IoT
of interest while overcoming the constraints of having only limited network
traces of the IoT.

a massive cluster: $M_{200}\sim 1-2\times 10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$. The results of
our study disagree with the picture of an unimodal, relaxed cluster as
suggested by previous studies based on the gravitational lensing analysis and
support the view of a perturbed dynamics proposed by recent works based on
Chandra X-ray data. The first strong evidence of a dynamically disturbed
cluster comes from the peculiarity of the BCG velocity with respect to the
first moment of the velocity distribution of member galaxies. Moreover, several
statistical tests employed to study the cluster galaxies kinematics find
significant evidence of substructure, being Abell 1703 composed by at least two
or three subclumps probably caught after the core-core passage. In this
observational scenario, the suspected existence of a radio halo in the centre
of this cluster is not surprising and well agrees with the theoretical models

the nanometer scale and overcome the diffraction limit in single molecule
fluorescence analysis. However, unwanted adhesion of the fluorescent molecules
on the ZMW surface can severely hamper the experiments. Therefore a proper
surface passivation is required for ZMWs, but information is currently lacking
on both the nature of the adhesion phenomenon and the optimization of the
different passivation protocols. Here we monitor the influence of the
fluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 546 and 647, Atto 550 and 647N) on the
non-specific adhesion of double stranded DNA molecule. We show that the
nonspecific adhesion of DNA double strands onto the ZMW surface is directly
mediated by the organic fluorescent dye being used, as Atto 550 and Atto 647N
show a pronounced tendency to adhere to the ZMW while the Alexa Fluor 546 and
647 are remarkably free of this effect. Despite the small size of the
fluorescent label, the surface charge and hydrophobicity of the dye appear to
play a key role in promoting the DNA affinity for the ZMW surface. Next,
different surface passivation methods (bovine serum albumin BSA, polyethylene
glycol PEG, polyvinylphosphonic acid PVPA) are quantitatively benchmarked by
fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to determine the most efficient
approaches to prevent the adsorption of Atto 647N labeled DNA. Protocols using
PVPA and PEG-silane of 1000 Da molar mass are found to drastically avoid the
non-specific adsorption into ZMWs. Optimizing both the choice of the
fluorescent dye and the surface passivation protocol are highly significant to
expand the use of ZMWs for single molecule fluorescence applications.

synchrotron emission. This emission originates from relativistic electrons in
the ionized intracluster medium (ICM). An important question is how these
synchrotron emitting relativistic electrons are accelerated. Our aim is to
search for diffuse emission in the Frontier Fields clusters Abell S1063 and
Abell 370 and characterize its properties. While these clusters are very
massive and well studied at some other wavelengths, no diffuse emission has
been reported for these clusters so far. We obtained 325 MHz Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) and 1--4 GHz Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations
of Abell S1063 and Abell 370. We complement these data with Chandra and
XMM-Newton X-ray observations. In our sensitive images, we discover radio halos
in both clusters. In Abell S1063, a giant radio halo is found with a size of
$\sim 1.2$ Mpc. The integrated spectral index between 325 MHz and 1.5 GHz is
$-0.94\pm0.08$ and it steepens to $-1.77 \pm 0.20$ between 1.5 and 3.0 GHz.
This spectral steepening provides support for the turbulent re-acceleration
model for radio halo formation. Abell 370 hosts a faint radio halo mostly
centred on the southern part of this binary merging cluster, with a size of
$\sim 500-700$ kpc. The spectral index between 325 MHz and 1.5 GHz is
$-1.10\pm0.09$. Both radio halos follow the known scaling relation between the
cluster mass proxy $Y_{500}$ and radio power, consistent with the idea that
they are related to ongoing cluster merger events.

Furthermore, the icosahedral-like structures are dominant at all temperatures

not grow when the temperature decreases. It was also ascertained that the

distribution of uncertainty is unknown. We propose a novel model predictive
control (MPC) method for limiting the risk of unsafety even when the true
distribution of the obstacles' movements deviates, within an ambiguity set,
from the empirical distribution obtained using a limited amount of sample data.
By choosing the ambiguity set as a statistical ball with its radius measured by
the Wasserstein metric, we achieve a probabilistic guarantee of the
out-of-sample risk, evaluated using new sample data generated independently of
the training data. To resolve the infinite-dimensionality issue inherent in the
distributionally robust MPC problem, we reformulate it as a finite-dimensional
nonlinear program using modern distributionally robust optimization techniques
based on the Kantorovich duality principle. To find a globally optimal solution
in the case of affine dynamics and output equations, a spatial branch-and-bound
algorithm is designed using McCormick relaxation. The performance of the
proposed method is demonstrated and analyzed through simulation studies using a
nonlinear car-like vehicle model and a linearized quadrotor model.

fundamental topics in many areas. In this paper, we consider discrete-event
systems (DESs) modeled by finite-state automata (FSAs). There exist results for
decentralized versions of the latter problem but there is almost no result for
a decentralized version of the former problem. We propose a decentralized
version of strong detectability called co-detectability which implies that once
a system satisfies this property, for each generated infinite-length event
sequence, at least one local observer can determine the current and subsequent
states after a common observation time delay. We prove that the problem of
verifying co-detectability of FSAs is coNP-hard. Moreover, we use a unified
concurrent-composition method to give PSPACE verification algorithms for
co-detectability, co-diagnosability, and co-predictability of FSAs, without any
assumption or modifying the FSAs under consideration, where co-diagnosability
is firstly studied by [Debouk & Lafortune & Teneketzis 2000], while
co-predictability is firstly studied by [Kumar \& Takai 2010]. By our proposed
unified method, one can see that in order to verify co-detectability, more
technical difficulties will be met compared to verifying the other two
properties, because in co-detectability, generated outputs are counted, but in
the latter two properties, only occurrences of events are counted. For example,
when one output was generated, any number of unobservable events could have
occurred. The PSPACE-hardness of verifying co-diagnosability is already known
in the literature. In this paper, we prove the PSPACE-hardness of verifying
co-predictability.

the free-moving evader moves faster than the pursuers. Most of the existing

into the capture domain, how to balance between forming an encirclement and
approaching the faster evader, and what conditions make the capture possible.
In this paper, a distributed pursuit algorithm is proposed to enable pursuers
to form an encirclement and approach the faster evader. An algorithm that
balances between forming an encirclement and approaching the faster evader is
proposed. Moreover, sufficient capture conditions are derived based on the
initial spatial distribution and the speed ratios of the pursuers and the

between entities by abstracting entities as vertices, and relationships as
edges connecting vertices in a graph. Beyond the presence or absence of
relationships, a network may contain additional information that can be
attributed to the entities and their relationships. Attaching these additional
attribute data to the corresponding vertices and edges yields an attributed
graph. Moreover, in the majority of real-world applications, such as online
social networks, financial networks and transactional networks, relationships
between entities evolve over time.
  Change detection in dynamic attributed networks is an important problem in
many areas, such as fraud detection, cyber intrusion detection and health care
monitoring. It is a challenging problem because it involves a time sequence of
attributed graphs, each of which is usually very large and can contain many
attributes attached to the vertices and edges, resulting in a complex, high
dimensional mathematical object.
  In this survey we provide an overview of some of the existing change
detection methods that utilize attribute information. We categorize these
methods based on the levels of structure in the graph that are exploited to
detect changes. These levels are vertices, edges, subgraphs, communities and
the overall graph. We focus our attention on the strengths and weaknesses of
these methods, including performance and scalability. Finally we discuss some
publicly available dynamic network datasets and give a brief overview of
simulation models to generate synthetic dynamic attributed networks.

importance to both combustion theory and industry safety. In this study, the
propagating mechanism of Chapman-Jouguet (C-J) deflagration is studied.
Firstly, three models are put forth to decouple the C-J detonation front. These
three models are (a) to introduce an expansion parameter into the
one-dimensional energy equation, (b) to increase the activation energy of the
chemical reaction model and (c) to decouple the shock wave from the flame front
by artificial method. The C-J deflagration is obtained after the C-J detonation
is decoupled by one-dimensional numerical simulations with different models,
chemical reaction kinetics and numerical schemes. Secondly, the propagating
mechanism of C-J deflagration is discussed. For the C-J deflagration with a
propagating velocity of about 1/2 C-J detonation, the static temperature behind
the leading shock wave is too low to ignite the combustion. But, the total
temperature of the flow induced by the leading shock wave is high enough to
ignite the mixture. The induced flow is slowed down by the rarefaction waves
form the wall and its static temperature increases. The flame and the leading
shock wave propagate with almost the same velocity and the double-discontinuity
structure of the flow field keeps stable. The propagating velocity equals to
the sound speed of the combustion products, which is about 1/2 C-J detonation
velocity.

organisation over a constant-temperature tropical sea surface. This setup can
give rise to cloud clusters over timescales of weeks. In reality, sea surface
temperatures do oscillate diurnally, affecting the atmospheric state. Over
land, surface temperatures vary more strongly, and rain rate is significantly
influenced. Here, we carry out a substantial suite of cloud-resolving numerical
experiments, and find that even weak surface temperature oscillations enable
qualitatively different dynamics to emerge: the spatial distribution of
rainfall is only homogeneous during the first day. Already on the second day,
the rain field is firmly structured. In later days, the clustering becomes
stronger and alternates from day-to-day. We show that these features are robust
to changes in resolution, domain size, and surface temperature, but can be
removed by a reduction of the amplitude of oscillation, suggesting a transition
to a clustered state. Maximal clustering occurs at a scale of
$\mathbf{l_{max}\approx 180\;km}$, a scale we relate to the emergence of
mesoscale convective systems. At $\mathbf{l_{max}}$ rainfall is strongly
enhanced and far exceeds the rainfall expected at random. We explain the
transition to clustering using simple conceptual modelling. Our results may
help clarify how continental extremes build up and how cloud clustering over
the tropical ocean could emerge much faster than through conventional
self-aggregation alone.

introduction of these ODEs means that the Volterra integral can be removed from
the governing equation. The two types of internal variable are distinguished by
whether the unknown appears in the Volterra integral, or whether its time
derivative appears; we call the resulting problems the displacement and
velocity forms. We define fully discrete formulations for each of these forms
by using continuous Galerkin finite element approximations in space and an
implicit `Crank-Nicolson' type of finite difference method in time. We prove
stability and a priori bounds, and (using the FEniCS environment,
https://fenicsproject.org/) give some numerical results. These bounds do not
require Gr\""onwall's inequality and so can be regarded to be of high quality,
allowing confidence in long time integration without an a priori exponential
build up of error. As far as we are aware this is the first time that these two
formulations have been described together with accompanying proofs of such high
quality stability and error bounds. The extension of the results to
vector-valued viscoelasticity problems is straightforward and summarised at the
end. The numerical results are reproducible by acquiring the python sources
from https://github.com/Yongseok7717, or by running a custom built docker
container (instructions are given).

the Rabi coupling strength. These phases are characterized using the momentum
distribution, the transverse spin polarization and the superfluid fraction. The
critical point of the transition is estimated in an analytical framework. The

on the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm employed by an energy harvesting sensor
where the distributions before and after the change are assumed to be known. In
a slotted discrete-time model, the sensor, exclusively powered by randomly
available harvested energy, obtains a sample and computes the log-likelihood
ratio of the two distributions if it has enough energy to sense and process a
sample. If it does not have enough energy in a given slot, it waits until it
harvests enough energy to perform the task in a future time slot. We derive
asymptotic expressions for the expected detection delay (when a change actually
occurs), and the asymptotic tail distribution of the run-length to a false
alarm (when a change never happens). We show that when the average harvested
energy ($\bar H$) is greater than or equal to the energy required to sense and
process a sample ($E_s$), standard existing asymptotic results for the CUSUM
test apply since the energy storage level at the sensor is greater than $E_s$
after a sufficiently long time. However, when the $\bar H < E_s$, the energy
storage level can be modelled by a positive Harris recurrent Markov chain with
a unique stationary distribution. Using asymptotic results from Markov random
walk theory and associated nonlinear Markov renewal theory, we establish
asymptotic expressions for the expected detection delay and asymptotic
exponentiality of the tail distribution of the run-length to a false alarm in

learning models using geographically dispersed data collected by local
entities. It includes local computation and synchronization steps. To reduce
the communication overhead and improve the overall efficiency of FL, gradient
sparsification (GS) can be applied, where instead of the full gradient, only a
small subset of important elements of the gradient is communicated. Existing
work on GS uses a fixed degree of gradient sparsity for i.i.d.-distributed data
within a datacenter. In this paper, we consider adaptive degree of sparsity and
non-i.i.d. local datasets. We first present a fairness-aware GS method which
ensures that different clients provide a similar amount of updates. Then, with
the goal of minimizing the overall training time, we propose a novel online
learning formulation and algorithm for automatically determining the
near-optimal communication and computation trade-off that is controlled by the
degree of gradient sparsity. The online learning algorithm uses an estimated
sign of the derivative of the objective function, which gives a regret bound
that is asymptotically equal to the case where exact derivative is available.
Experiments with real datasets confirm the benefits of our proposed approaches,

Several semantics for such instances have been proposed and include open (OWA),
closed (CWA), and open-closed (OCWA) world. For all these semantics important
questions are: whether one incomplete instance semantically implies another;
when two are semantically equivalent; and whether a smaller or smallest
semantically equivalent instance exists. For OWA and CWA these questions are
fully answered. For several variants of OCWA, however, they remain open. In
this work we adress these questions for Closed Powerset semantics and the OCWA
semantics of Libkin and Sirangelo, 2011. We define a new OCWA semantics, called
OCWA*, in terms of homomorphic covers that subsumes both semantics, and
characterize semantic implication and equivalence in terms of such covers. This
characterization yields a guess-and-check algorithm to decide equivalence, and
shows that the problem is NP-complete. For the minimization problem we show
that for several common notions of minimality there is in general no unique
minimal equivalent instance for Closed Powerset semantics, and consequently not
for the more expressive OCWA* either. However, for Closed Powerset semantics we
show that one can find, for any incomplete database, a unique finite set of its
subinstances which are subinstances (up to renaming of nulls) of all instances
semantically equivalent to the original incomplete one. We study properties of
this set, and extend the analysis to OCWA*.

considered indicators. Theoretical analysis in idealized estuaries suggests
that shallower estuaries are more sensitive to SLR. Numerical results for the
Neretva River Estuary showed that SLR may increase salt-wedge intrusion length,
volume, and corrective river inflow. However, the results are highly non-linear
because of the channel geometry, especially for lower river inflows. A
theoretical assessment of channel bed slope impacts on limiting a potential
intrusion is therefore additionally discussed. This findings emphasize the need
to use several different indicators when assessing SLR impacts.

the Apollon laser in France, will help understanding and designing future

evolutions of fidelity, entanglement, and quantum coherence. When the initial

their fidelity evolutions both scale as $\mathcal O(1/N)$, which is the same as
the case of a fully polarized bath. However, when the central spin is maximally
entangled with one of the bath spins, the amplitude scaling of its fidelity
evolution declines from $\mathcal O(1/N)$ to $\mathcal O(1/N^2)$. That implies
appropriate initial system-bath entanglement is contributive to suppress
central spin decoherence. In addition, with the help of system-bath
entanglement, we realize quantum coherence-enhanced dynamics for the central

They all use the same definition of safety. Liveness is especially important in
practice despite well-known theoretical impossibility results. However, many
different liveness properties and assumptions have been stated, and there are
no systematic comparisons for better understanding of these properties.
  This paper systematically studies and compares different liveness properties
stated for over 30 prominent consensus algorithms and variants. We introduce a
precise high-level language and formally specify these properties in the
language. We then create a hierarchy of liveness properties combining two
hierarchies of the assumptions used and a hierarchy of the assertions made, and
compare the strengths and weaknesses of algorithms that ensure these
properties. Our formal specifications and systematic comparisons led to the
discovery of a range of problems in various stated liveness properties, from
too weak assumptions for which no liveness assertions can hold, to too strong
assumptions making it trivial to achieve the assertions. We also developed TLA+
specifications of these liveness properties, and we use model checking of
execution steps to illustrate liveness patterns for Paxos.

order parameters and entanglement entropies are calculated. When opposite edge
potentials are added to the two ends of the chain, the inversion symmetry is
explicitly broken, and the regular bulk phases appear. On the other hand,
simple open boundary conditions often exhibit non-degenerate ground states with
a domain wall in the middle of the chain, which induces a sign-flip of an order
parameter. Such a domain wall can lead to an algebraic behavior of the
off-diagonals of the single particle density matrix. We show that this

which does not diverge as the system size increases. Therefore, it is not an
indication of a superfluid phase. We confirm this picture by analytical

hours, by storing some content at the user's local cache memory, even without
knowledge of user's later demands. Maddah-Ali and Niesen proposed a two-phase
(placement phase and delivery phase) coded caching strategy for broadcast
channels with cache-aided users. This paper investigates the same model under
the constraint that content is placed uncoded within the caches, that is, when
bits of the files are simply copied within the caches. When the cache contents
are uncoded and the users' demands are revealed, the caching problem can be
connected to an index coding problem. This paper focuses on deriving
fundamental performance limits for the caching problem by using tools for the
index coding problem that were either known or are newly developed in this
work. First, a converse bound for the caching problem under the constraint of
uncoded cache placement is proposed based on the ""acyclic index coding converse
bound"". This converse bound is proved to be achievable by the Maddah-Ali and
Niesen's scheme when the number of files is not less than the number of users,
and by a newly derived index coding achievable scheme otherwise. The proposed
index coding achievable scheme is based on distributed source coding and
strictly improves on the widely used ""composite (index) coding"" achievable
bound and its improvements, and is of independent interest. An important
consequence of the findings of this paper is that advancements on the coded
caching problem posed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen are thus only possible by
considering strategies with coded placement phase. A recent work by Yu et al.
has however shown that coded cache placement can at most half the network load

an electron donor. It is often rationalized by a region of the positive
electrostatic potential on the halogen atom, so-called $\sigma$-hole. The
X-bond strength increases with the atomic number of the halogen involved, thus
for heavier halogens, relativistic effects become of concern. This poses a
challenge for the quantum chemical description of X-bonded complexes. To
quantify scalar relativistic effects (SREs) on the interaction energies and
$\sigma$-hole properties, we have performed highly accurate coupled-cluster
calculations at the complete basis set limit of several X-bonded complexes and
their halogenated monomers. The SREs turned to be comparable in magnitude to
the effect of basis set. The nonrelativistic calculations typically
underestimate the attraction by up to 5% or 23% for brominated and iodinated
complexes, respectively. Counter-intuitively, the electron densities at the
bond critical points are larger for SRE-free calculations than for the
relativistic ones. SREs yield smaller, flatter, and more positive
$\sigma$-holes. Finally, we highlight the importance of diffuse functions in
the basis sets and provide quantitative arguments for using basis sets with
pseudopotentials as an affordable alternative to a more rigorous
Douglas-Kroll-Hess relativistic theory.

which aims at predicting students' knowledge state is becoming a critical and
fundamental task in personalized education. Traditionally, existing methods are
domain-specified. However, there are a larger number of domains (e.g.,
subjects, schools) in the real world and the lacking of data in some domains,
how to utilize the knowledge and information in other domains to help train a
knowledge tracing model for target domains is increasingly important. We refer
to this problem as domain adaptation for knowledge tracing (DAKT) which
contains two aspects: (1) how to achieve great knowledge tracing performance in
each domain. (2) how to transfer good performed knowledge tracing model between
domains. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptable framework,
namely adaptable knowledge tracing (AKT) to address the DAKT problem.
Specifically, for the first aspect, we incorporate the educational
characteristics (e.g., slip, guess, question texts) based on the deep knowledge
tracing (DKT) to obtain a good performed knowledge tracing model. For the
second aspect, we propose and adopt three domain adaptation processes. First,
we pre-train an auto-encoder to select useful source instances for target model
training. Second, we minimize the domain-specific knowledge state distribution
discrepancy under maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) measurement to achieve domain
adaptation. Third, we adopt fine-tuning to deal with the problem that the
output dimension of source and target domain are different to make the model
suitable for target domains. Extensive experimental results on two private
datasets and seven public datasets clearly prove the effectiveness of AKT for
great knowledge tracing performance and its superior transferable ability.

the local detailed balance, it has been found that the some physical observable

system's response to the perturbation given at intermediate stages of the PQ.
The response at the final stage reveals the persistent memory, and we show that
this persistence is a direct consequence of the martingale process behind. Not
only the mean response, the shape of the probability distribution at the stage
of perturbation is also memorized. Using the hidden martingale process we can
predict the final bimodal distribution from the early-stage unimodal
distribution in the regime where the unfrozen spins are paramagnetic. We
propose a viewpoint that the martingale property is a stochastic conservation
law which is supported behind by some stochastic invariance.

presence of cisplatin in the target (CIS model). The simulation results showed
that the dose escalation can be caused by photon-capture therapy (PCT). There

increase from 60 to 250 kV and increase of depth of target reduces the effect

that the advantage of geometric gates over dynamical gates depends crucially on
the evolution loop for the construction of the geometric phase. Under
appropriate evolution loops, both the geometric single-qubit gates and the CNOT
gate can outperform their dynamical counterparts for both systematic and
detuning noises. We also perform randomized benchmarking using noise amplitudes
consistent with experiments in silicon. For the static noise model, the
averaged fidelities of geometric gates are around 99.90\% or above, while for
the time-dependent $1/f$-type noise, the fidelities are around 99.98\% when

the exponent $\alpha$ of the $1/f$ noise, and the ratio can be as high as 4

more complex systems in a quantitative way. To be more specific, we illustrate
and prove that thermal noise due to finite, possibly even just infinitesimally
low, temperature $T$ will destroy the entanglement beyond a critical separation
distance $r_{\mathrm{crit}}$($T$) entirely. Our analysis is comprehensive in
the sense that we simultaneously discuss both total correlation and
entanglement in the particle picture as well as in the orbital/mode picture.
Our results reveal a conceptually new characterization of static and dynamical
correlation in ground states by relating them to the (non)robustness of
correlation with respect to thermal noise.

scale can also be investigated in double beta decay (DBD). For example, by
comparing the theoretical predictions with a precise analysis of the summed
energy spectra of electrons in $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay, one can constrain the
$\mathring{a}_{of}^{(3)}$ coefficient that governs the time-like component of
the Lorentz invariance violating operator that appears in the Standard Model
extension theory. In this work, we perform calculations of the phase space
factors and summed energy spectra of electrons as well as of their deviations
due to LIV necessary in such experimental investigations. The Fermi functions
needed in the calculation are built up with exact electron wave functions
obtained by numerically solving the Dirac equation in a realistic Coulomb-type
potential with the inclusion of the finite nuclear size and screening effects.
We compared our results with those used in previous LIV investigations that
were obtained with approximate (analytical) Fermi functions and found
differences of up to $30\%$ for heavier nuclei. Our work includes eight
experimentally interesting nuclei. Next, we estimate and discuss the
uncertainties of our calculations associated with uncertainties in Q-values
measurements and the differences raised from the inclusion of the kinematic
terms in the formalism. Finally, we provide the ratio between the standard
phase space factors and their LIV deviations and the energies where the LIV
effects are expected to be maximal. We expect our study to be useful in the
current LIV investigations in $2\nu\beta\beta$ decay and to lead to improved
constraints on the $\mathring{a}_{of}^{(3)}$ coefficient.

et al. In addition to our previous work, we provide important properties of the
independence (i.e., the network's stoichiometric subspace is the direct sum of
the subnetworks' stoichiometric subspaces) and the incidence-independence
(i.e., the image of the network's incidence map is the direct sum of the
incidence maps' images of the subnetworks) of these decompositions. Feinberg
established the essential relationship between independent decompositions and
the set of positive equilibria of a network, which we call the Feinberg
Decomposition Theorem (FDT). Moreover, Farinas et al. recently documented its
version for incidence-independence. Fundamental decomposition divides the
network into subnetworks of deficiency either 0 or 1 only. Hence, available
results for lower deficiency networks, such as the Deficiency Zero Theorem
(DZT), can be used. These justify the study of independent fundamental
decompositions. A MATLAB program which (i) computes the subnetworks of a CRN
under the fundamental decomposition and (ii) is useful for determining whether
the decomposition is independent and incidence-independent is also created.
Finally, we provide the following solution for determining multistationarity of
CRNs with the following steps: (1) the use of the program, (2) the application
of available results for CRNs with deficiency 0 or 1 (e.g., DZT), and (3) the
use of FDT. We illustrate the solution by showing that the generalization of a
subnetwork of Schmitz's carbon cycle model by Hernandez et al., endowed with

significant interest from different stakeholders as part of future intelligent

However, many of these services have stringent performance requirements,
particularly in terms of the delay/latency. Multi-access/mobile edge computing
(MEC) has been proposed as a potential solution for such services by bringing
them closer to vehicles. Yet, this introduces a new set of challenges such as
where to place these V2X services, especially given the limit computation
resources available at edge nodes. To that end, this work formulates the
problem of optimal V2X service placement (OVSP) in a hybrid core/edge
environment as a binary integer linear programming problem. To the best of our
knowledge, no previous work considered the V2X service placement problem while
taking into consideration the computational resource availability at the nodes.
Moreover, a low-complexity greedy-based heuristic algorithm named ""Greedy V2X
Service Placement Algorithm"" (G-VSPA) was developed to solve this problem.
Simulation results show that the OVSP model successfully guarantees and
maintains the QoS requirements of all the different V2X services. Additionally,
it is observed that the proposed G-VSPA algorithm achieves close to optimal
performance while having lower complexity.

several areas of quantum information and computation. Of particular interest in
most of these applications, is the minimum time beyond which the instantaneous
probability distribution of the quantum walk remains close to this limiting
distribution, known as the \emph{quantum mixing time}. However this quantity is
only known for a handful of specific networks. In this letter, we prove an
upper bound on the quantum mixing time for \emph{almost all networks}, i.e.\
the fraction of networks for which our bound holds, goes to one in the
asymptotic limit. To this end, using several results in random matrix theory,
we find the quantum mixing time of Erd\""os-Renyi random networks: networks of
$n$ nodes where each edge exists with probability $p$ independently. For
example for dense random networks, where $p$ is a constant, we show that the
quantum mixing time is $\mathcal{O}\left(n^{3/2 + o(1)}\right)$. Besides
opening avenues for the analytical study of quantum dynamics on random
networks, our work could find applications beyond quantum information
processing. Owing to the universality of Wigner random matrices, our results on
the spectral properties of random graphs hold for general classes of random
matrices that are ubiquitous in several areas of physics. In particular, our
results could lead to novel insights into the equilibration times of isolated

This immutability property is important in scenarios where auditability is

default, does not provide capabilities to efficiently query the stored data. In
this investigation, we show that it is possible to efficiently run complex
audit queries over the access log data stored on blockchains by using
additional key-value stores. This paper specifically reports on the approach we
designed for the blockchain track of iDASH Privacy & Security Workshop 2018
competition.Particularly, we implemented our solution and compared its loading
and query-response performance with SQLite, a commonly used relational
database, using the data provided by the iDASH 2018 organizers. Depending on
the query type and the data size, the run time difference between blockchain
based query-response and SQLite based query-response ranged from 0.2 seconds to
6 seconds. A deeper inspection revealed that range queries were the bottleneck
of our solution which, nevertheless, scales up linearly. Concretely, this
investigation demonstrates that blockchain-based systems can provide reasonable
query-response times to complex queries even if they only use simple key-value
stores to manage their data. Consequently, we show that blockchains may be
useful for maintaining data with auditability and immutability requirements

to know the properties of physical systems. In particular, I discuss some
aspects of this relationist and contextualist conception of reality by
comparing, in their apparent diversity, Bohr holistic and Rovelli relationist
interpretation of the formalism, that deep down share a unifying metaphysics of
dispositions and propensities. Both interpretations are based on the widely
shared fact that quantum mechanics does not describe previously definite
quantities. In the final part I show that, as a consequence of a relationist

the universe must be described from within by dividing it into two arbitrary
parts. This is in fact the only way in which any two systems can exchange

due to the outsourcing of sensitive data onto a third party. In addition, the
complexity of the cloud model results in a large number of heterogeneous
security controls that must be consistently managed. Hence, no matter how
strongly the cloud model is secured, organizations continue suffering from lack
of trust on CC and remain uncertain about its security risk consequences.
Traditional risk management frameworks do not consider the impact of CC
security risks on the business objectives of the organizations. In this paper,
we propose a novel Cloud Security Risk Management Framework (CSRMF) that helps
organizations adopting CC identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate security
risks in their Cloud platforms. Unlike traditional risk management frameworks,
CSRMF is driven by the business objectives of the organizations. It allows any
organization adopting CC to be aware of cloud security risks and align their
low-level management decisions according to high-level business objectives. In
essence, it is designed to address impacts of cloud-specific security risks
into business objectives in a given organization. Consequently, organizations
are able to conduct a cost-value analysis regarding the adoption of CC
technology and gain an adequate level of confidence in Cloud technology. On the
other hand, Cloud Service Providers (CSP) are able to improve productivity and
profitability by managing cloud-related risks. The proposed framework has been
validated and evaluated through a use-case scenario.

This force can sustain the rotational motion of self-gravitating neutrino
triads or electron/positron-neutrino pairs, and thus lead to the self driven
generation of mass, i.e. of hadrons and bosons, the masses of which can be
computed with an astonishing precision of 1\% without any adjustable

provide services effectively to their residents and visitors. In this context,
smart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of the city
transport facilities as well as sustainable mobility within the urban
environment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations
at different scales, ranging from a trip of a few blocks within a city to a
journey across cities or further. At the same time, goods need to be timely
delivered considering the needs of both the users and the businesses. While
most of the mobility and delivery solutions can cover significant distances and
multiple requests, they suffer when the requests come from the growing
neighborhoods and hard-to-reach areas such as city centers, corporate
headquarters, and hospitals. In the last few years, several cities indicated
interest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the ""last-mile"" mobility
services. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using
fewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be
thought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow
streets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to serve
critical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reducing noise and
pollution. The goal of this article is to present an innovative vision on the
introduction of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key
pillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility.
Through a set of real application scenarios, we present our view, and we
discuss a set of challenges, opportunities, and social implications that this
way to reimage the mobility of the future introduces.

  large-scale cohorts from the EHR for oncology research","Word count: Abstract, 254; text, 3934 Keywords: electronic health
  record; machine learning; cancer; real-world evidence",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Objective Electronic health records (EHRs) are a promising source of data for
health outcomes research in oncology. A challenge in using EHR data is that
selecting cohorts of patients often requires information in unstructured parts
of the record. Machine learning has been used to address this, but even
high-performing algorithms may select patients in a non-random manner and bias
the resulting cohort. To improve the efficiency of cohort selection while
measuring potential bias, we introduce a technique called Model-Assisted Cohort
Selection (MACS) with Bias Analysis and apply it to the selection of metastatic
breast cancer (mBC) patients. Materials and Methods We trained a model on
17,263 patients using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) and
logistic regression. We used a test set of 17,292 patients to measure algorithm
performance and perform Bias Analysis. We compared the cohort generated by MACS
to the cohort that would have been generated without MACS as reference
standard, first by comparing distributions of an extensive set of clinical and
demographic variables and then by comparing the results of two analyses
addressing existing example research questions. Results Our algorithm had an
area under the curve (AUC) of 0.976, a sensitivity of 96.0%, and an abstraction
efficiency gain of 77.9%. During Bias Analysis, we found no large differences
in baseline characteristics and no differences in the example analyses.
Conclusion MACS with bias analysis can significantly improve the efficiency of
cohort selection on EHR data while instilling confidence that outcomes research
performed on the resulting cohort will not be biased.

switching scheme using VCMA, where the magnetic anisotropy is eliminated during
the voltage pulse, the magnetic anisotropy is enhanced to induce precession
around the axis close to the easy axis. After turning off the voltage
proximately at a half of precession period, the magnetization relaxes to the
opposite equilibrium direction. We perform numerical simulations and show that
the pulse duration of the proposed switching scheme is as short as a few tens
of pico seconds. Such a short pulse duration is beneficial for low power
consumption because of the reduction of energy loss by Joule heating.

electrochemical behaviour of lithium-ion batteries as they are charged and
discharged. It reviews the models developed by Newman and co-workers, both in
the cases of dilute and moderately-concentrated electrolytes and indicates the
modelling assumptions required for their development. Particular attention is
paid to the interface conditions imposed between the electrolyte and the active
electrode material; necessary conditions are derived for one of these, the
Butler-Volmer relation, in order to ensure physically realistic solutions.
Insight into the origin of the differences between various models found in the
literature is revealed by considering formulations obtained by using different
measures of the electric potential. Materials commonly used for electrodes in
lithium ion batteries are considered and the various mathematical models used
to describe lithium transport in them discussed. The problem of up-scaling from
models of behaviour at the single electrode particle scale to the cell scale is
addressed using homogenisation techniques resulting in the pseudo 2D model
commonly used to describe charge transport and discharge behaviour in
lithium-ion cells. Numerical solution to this model is discussed and
illustrative results for a common device are computed.

crosslink cells by irradiation with ultrashort UV laser pulses
(L-crosslinking). To use this technique coupled to Chromatin
ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) in a high throughput context, a pre-screening fast
method needs to be implemented to set up suitable irradiation conditions of the
cell sample for efficient L-crosslinking with no final and long ChIP analysis.
Here a fast method is reported where living human cells have been first
transfected with a vector coding for Estrogen Receptor {\alpha} (ER{\alpha}),
linked to Green Florescent protein (ER{\alpha}-GFP), so that the well-known
interaction between the Estrogen Receptor Elements (ERE) region of the cell DNA
and the ER{\alpha} protein can be detected by studying the fluorometric
response of the irradiated cells. The damage induced to cells by UV irradiation
is characterized by looking at DNA integrity, proteins stability and cellular
viability. A second novel approach is presented to analyze or re-visit DNA and
RNA sequences and their molecular configurations. This approach is based on
methods derived from Chern-Simons super-gravity adapted to describe mutations
in DNA/RNA strings, as well as interactions between nucleic acids. As a
preliminary case we analyze the KRAS human gene sequence and some of its
mutations. Interestingly, our model shows how the Chern-Simons current are
