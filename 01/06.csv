these days due to the advancement in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
Moreover, recent research such as the few-shot learning can create highly
realistic personalized fake images with only a few images. Therefore, the
threat of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as
propagating fake images and videos becomes prevalent. And detecting these
machine-generated fake images has been quite challenging than ever. In this
work, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based
classifier architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet),
which is capable of detecting many of the new fake face image generation
models, and can be easily combined with existing image classification networks
and finetuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods, our
approach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for
fine-tuning to effectively detect fake images. The core of our approach is to
introduce an image-based self-attention module called Fine-Tune Transformer
that uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer. This module is
added to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new
sets of feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on
the GANsbased dataset (Progressive Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset
(Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution of 64x64 that
complicates detection. Our FDFtNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90.29% in
detecting fake images generated from the GANs-based dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art.

leads to unexpected phenomena, such as different efficiencies of the same
system for different tasks, that cannot be explained in the frame of classical
computing paradigm. The simple non-technical (but considering the temporal
behavior of the components) model, introduced here, enables us to set up a
frame and formalism, needed to explain those unexpected experiences around
supercomputing. Introducing temporal behavior into computer science also
explains why only the extreme scale computing enabled us to reveal the
experienced limitations. The paper shows, that degradation of efficiency of
parallelized sequential systems is a natural consequence of the classical
computing paradigm, instead of being an engineering imperfectness. The
workload, that supercomputers run, is much responsible for wasting energy, as
well as limiting the size and type of tasks. Case studies provide insight, how
different contributions compete for dominating the resulting payload
performance of a computing system, and how enhancing the interconnection
technology made computing+communication to dominate in defining the efficiency
of supercomputers. Our model also enables to derive predictions about
supercomputer performance limitations for the near future, as well as it
provides hints for enhancing supercomputer components. Phenomena experienced in
large-scale computing show interesting parallels with phenomena experienced in
science, more than a century ago, and through their studying a modern science
was developed.

Brane models is by integrating, in the action, its zero mode solutions over the
extra dimensions. If this is finite, the field is said to be localized.
However, the zero mode solutions must also satisfy the Einstein equations. With
this in mind, we obtain stringent constraints on a general energy-momentum
tensor by analyzing the Einstein's equations. These {\it consistency
conditions} must be satisfied for any Braneworld model. We apply it for some
fields of the Standard Model. For a free massless scalar field, the zero-mode
localization is consistent only if the field does not depend on the extra
dimensions. About the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ field with Yukawa-like interactions,
we find a very specific relation between Yukawa function and the warp factor.
As a consequence, the spinor field localization becomes inconsistent for most
of the models studied in the literature. For the free vector field case we find
that, independent of the braneworld or the number of extra dimensions, the
zero-mode do not satisfy the consistency conditions. Finally, we consider the
mechanisms proposed to localize this field. We find that a few survive, and
even for these, the consistency conditions fix the free parameters or the
possible class of solutions allowed.

finitely generated P-closed sets correspond to lists of finite-dimensional

amplitudes of high energy processes is insufficient and that the
next-to-leading logarithmic effects are very large and lead to instability of

established resummation procedure we study in detail the preasymptotic effects
which occur in the solution to the resummed BFKL equation when the energy is
not very large. We find that in addition to the well known reduction of the
intercept, which governs the energy dependence of the gluon Green's function,
resummation leads to the delay of the onset of its small $x$ growth. Moreover
the gluon Green's function develops a dip or a plateau in wide range of
rapidities, which increases for large scales. The preasymptotic region in the
gluon Green's function extends to about $8$ units in rapidity for the
transverse scales of the order of $30-100 \; {\rm GeV} $. To visualize the
expected behavior of physical processes with two equal hard scales we calculate
the cross section of the process $\gamma^{*}+\gamma^{*}\to X$ to be probed at
future very high-energy electron-positron colliders. We find that at
$\gamma^*\gamma^*$ energies below $100 \; \rm GeV$ the BFKL Pomeron leads to
smaller value of the cross section than the Born approximation, and only starts
to dominate at energies about $100 \; \rm GeV$. This pattern is significantly
different from the one which we find using LL approximation. We also analyze
the transverse momentum contributions to the cross section for different
virtualities of the photons and find that the dominant contributions to the
integral over the transverse momenta comes from lower values than the the
external scales in the process under consideration.

limitations including high latency. This prevents their use in important
scenarios such as retail payments, where merchants should approve payments
fast. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this problem by moving
transactions off the chain. However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own
problems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and
thus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very
large operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains
require trusted validators.
  In this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients,
like merchants, to safely accept fast payments. In Snappy, all payments are on
the chain, while small customer collaterals and moderate merchant collaterals
act as payment guarantees. Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as
statekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using
majority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can
recover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a
colluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of
previous solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many
merchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and
validators do not have to be trusted. Our Ethereum prototype shows that safe,
fast (<2 seconds) and cheap payments are possible on existing blockchains.

by construction, manifestly conformally invariant. We first show that a choice
of asymptotic shear amounts to a choice of linear differential operator of
order two on the bundle of scales of null-infinity. We refer to these operators
as Poincar\'e operators. We then show that Poincar\'e operators are in
one-to-one correspondence with a particular class of tractor connections which
we call ""null-normal"" (they generalise the normal tractor connection of
conformal geometry). The tractor curvature encodes the presence of
gravitational waves and the non-uniqueness of flat null-normal tractor
connections correspond to the ""degeneracy of gravity vacua"" that has been
extensively discussed in the literature. This work thus brings back the
investigation of the radiative phase space of gravity to the study of (Cartan)
connections and associated bundles. This should allow, in particular, to
proliferate invariants of the phase space.

and last mode transportation. The model is macroscopic with volumes of demands
and supplies along with flows of vehicles. We propose a one-shot problem for
transportation of demand to or from a hub within a fixed time window, assuming
the knowledge of the demand and supply configurations. We present a unified
optimization framework that is applicable for both operator profit maximization
and social welfare maximization. The latter goal is useful for applications
such as disaster response. The decision variables in the optimization problem
are routing and allocations of the vehicles for different services.
  With K.K.T. analysis we propose an offline method for reducing the problem
size. Further, we also analyze the problem of maximizing profits by optimally
locating the supply for a given total supply and present a closed form
expression of the maximum profits that can be earned over all supply
configurations for a given demand configuration. We also show an equivalence
between optimal supply location in the first mode problem and the last mode
problem. We present a model for pricing based on the cost and travel time of
the best alternate transportation and present necessary conditions for the
feeder service to be viable. We illustrate the results through simulations and
also compare the proposed model with a traditional vehicle routing problem.
Through simulations, we also compare with the microscopic version of the
problem with the decision variables being integers. We demonstrate that the
route reduction algorithm proposed for the macroscopic formulation is still
useful for computing nearly optimal solutions to the microscopic problem with
much improved computational efficiency.

  Image Retrieval via Deep Graph Diffusion Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion has shown great success in improving accuracy of unsupervised image
retrieval systems by utilizing high-order structures of image manifold.
However, existing diffusion methods suffer from three major limitations: 1)
they usually rely on local structures without considering global manifold
information; 2) they focus on improving pair-wise similarities within existing
images input output transductively while lacking flexibility to learn
representations for novel unseen instances inductively; 3) they fail to scale
to large datasets due to prohibitive memory consumption and computational
burden due to intrinsic high-order operations on the whole graph. In this
paper, to address these limitations, we propose a novel method, Graph Diffusion
Networks (GRAD-Net), that adopts graph neural networks (GNNs), a novel variant
of deep learning algorithms on irregular graphs. GRAD-Net learns semantic
representations by exploiting both local and global structures of image
manifold in an unsupervised fashion. By utilizing sparse coding techniques,
GRAD-Net not only preserves global information on the image manifold, but also
enables scalable training and efficient querying. Experiments on several large
benchmark datasets demonstrate effectiveness of our method over
state-of-the-art diffusion algorithms for unsupervised image retrieval.

time algorithm for checking if a given set of integers contains three distinct
elements that sum up to zero. A closely related problem is to check if a given
set of integers contains distinct $x_1, x_2, x_3$ such that $x_1+x_2=2x_3$.
This can be reduced to 3-SUM in almost-linear time, but surprisingly a reverse
reduction establishing 3-SUM hardness was not known.
  We provide such a reduction, thus resolving an open question of Erickson. In
fact, we consider a more general problem called 3-LDT parameterized by integer
parameters $\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3$ and $t$. In this problem, we need to
check if a given set of integers contains distinct elements $x_1, x_2, x_3$
such that $\alpha_1 x_1+\alpha_2 x_2 +\alpha_3 x_3 = t$. For some combinations
of the parameters, every instance of this problem is a NO-instance or there
exists a simple almost-linear time algorithm. We call such variants trivial. We
prove that all non-trivial variants of 3-LDT are equivalent under subquadratic
reductions. Our main technical contribution is an efficient deterministic
procedure based on the famous Behrend's construction that partitions a given
set of integers into few subsets that avoid a chosen linear equation.

Learning (GPLL). Compared to the traditional Partial Label Learning (PLL)
problem, GPLL relaxes the supervision assumption from instance-level -- a label
set partially labels an instance -- to group-level: 1) a label set partially
labels a group of instances, where the within-group instance-label link
annotations are missing, and 2) cross-group links are allowed -- instances in a
group may be partially linked to the label set from another group. Such
ambiguous group-level supervision is more practical in real-world scenarios as
additional annotation on the instance-level is no longer required, e.g.,
face-naming in videos where the group consists of faces in a frame, labeled by
a name set in the corresponding caption. In this paper, we propose a novel
graph convolutional network (GCN) called Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder
(DB-GAE) to tackle the label ambiguity challenge of GPLL. First, we exploit the
cross-group correlations to represent the instance groups as dual bipartite
graphs: within-group and cross-group, which reciprocally complements each other
to resolve the linking ambiguities. Second, we design a GCN autoencoder to
encode and decode them, where the decodings are considered as the refined
results. It is worth noting that DB-GAE is self-supervised and transductive, as
it only uses the group-level supervision without a separate offline training
stage. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DB-GAE
significantly outperforms the best baseline over absolute 0.159 F1-score and
24.8% accuracy. We further offer analysis on various levels of label

mechanism appears necessary in some planets. We explore the possibility that
these planets families have different core mass and find a continuum in the

back reaction of the CFT on the classical black hole geometry, localized on the

This may result in the black hole horizon becoming partially reflective, thus
giving rise to echoes in the ringdown signal in gravitational wave
observations. In this paper, we investigate the existence of such echoes in the

  Pattern Analysis","CVPR 2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.CY cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The success of deep learning in visual recognition tasks has driven
advancements in multiple fields of research. Particularly, increasing attention
has been drawn towards its application in agriculture. Nevertheless, while
visual pattern recognition on farmlands carries enormous economic values,
little progress has been made to merge computer vision and crop sciences due to
the lack of suitable agricultural image datasets. Meanwhile, problems in
agriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic
segmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely
large-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not
present in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more
challenging than many other aerial image datasets. To encourage research in
computer vision for agriculture, we present Agriculture-Vision: a large-scale
aerial farmland image dataset for semantic segmentation of agricultural
patterns. We collected 94,986 high-quality aerial images from 3,432 farmlands
across the US, where each image consists of RGB and Near-infrared (NIR)
channels with resolution as high as 10 cm per pixel. We annotate nine types of
field anomaly patterns that are most important to farmers. As a pilot study of
aerial agricultural semantic segmentation, we perform comprehensive experiments
using popular semantic segmentation models; we also propose an effective model
designed for aerial agricultural pattern recognition. Our experiments
demonstrate several challenges Agriculture-Vision poses to both the computer
vision and agriculture communities. Future versions of this dataset will
include even more aerial images, anomaly patterns and image channels. More

piecewise linear maps of triangulated domains satisfying a discrete-harmonic

target domain is essential for ensuring invertibility. We extend these
characterizations, in both the continuous and discrete cases, by replacing
convexity with a less restrictive condition. In the continuous case,
Alessandrini and Nesi provide a characterization of invertible harmonic maps
into non-convex domains with a smooth boundary by adding additional conditions
on orientation preservation along the boundary. We extend their results by
defining a condition on the normal derivatives along the boundary, which we
call the cone condition; this condition is tractable and geometrically
intuitive, encoding a weak notion of local invertibility. The cone condition
enables us to extend Alessandrini and Nesi to the case of harmonic maps into
non-convex domains with a piecewise-smooth boundary. In the discrete case, we
use an analog of the cone condition to characterize invertible
discrete-harmonic piecewise-linear maps of triangulations. This gives an analog
of our continuous results and characterizes invertible discrete-harmonic maps

(PEG)-based hydrogels - broadly used in 3D cell cultures and whose mechanical
properties can be tuned to resemble those of different biological tissues - are
investigated by means of rheological measurements performed at different length
scales. When compared with literature values, the outcomes of this work reveal
that conventional bulk rheology measurements may overestimate the stiffness of
hydrogels by up to an order of magnitude. It is demonstrated that this apparent
stiffening is caused by an induced 'tensional state' of the gel network, due to
the application of a compressional normal force during measurements. Moreover,
it is shown that the actual stiffness of the hydrogels is instead accurately
determined by means of passive-video-particle-tracking (PVPT) microrheology
measurements, which are inherently performed at cells length scales and in
absence of any externally applied force. These results underpin a methodology

low-resolution images, up to 512 pixels in size. One pixel in the image
corresponds to a one millimeter piece of tissue. In order to accurately segment
tumors and make treatment plans, doctors need CT scans of higher resolution.
The same problem appears in MRI. In this paper, we propose an approach for the
single-image super-resolution of 3D CT or MRI scans. Our method is based on
deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) composed of 10 convolutional layers
and an intermediate upscaling layer that is placed after the first 6
convolutional layers. Our first CNN, which increases the resolution on two axes
(width and height), is followed by a second CNN, which increases the resolution
on the third axis (depth). Different from other methods, we compute the loss
with respect to the ground-truth high-resolution output right after the
upscaling layer, in addition to computing the loss after the last convolutional
layer. The intermediate loss forces our network to produce a better output,
closer to the ground-truth. A widely-used approach to obtain sharp results is
to add Gaussian blur using a fixed standard deviation. In order to avoid
overfitting to a fixed standard deviation, we apply Gaussian smoothing with
various standard deviations, unlike other approaches. We evaluate our method in
the context of 2D and 3D super-resolution of CT and MRI scans from two
databases, comparing it to relevant related works from the literature and
baselines based on various interpolation schemes, using 2x and 4x scaling
factors. The empirical results show that our approach attains superior results
to all other methods. Moreover, our human annotation study reveals that both
doctors and regular annotators chose our method in favor of Lanczos
interpolation in 97.55% cases for 2x upscaling factor and in 96.69% cases for
4x upscaling factor.

continues to grow in size. By discovering a lower-dimensional representation
(embedding) of the structure of a dataset, manifold learning algorithms can
substantially reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much
information as possible. However, state-of-the-art manifold learning algorithms
are opaque in how they perform this transformation. Understanding the way in
which the embedding relates to the original high-dimensional space is critical
in exploratory data analysis. We previously proposed a Genetic Programming
method that performed manifold learning by evolving mappings that are
transparent and interpretable. This method required the dimensionality of the
embedding to be known a priori, which makes it hard to use when little is known
about a dataset. In this paper, we substantially extend our previous work, by
introducing a multi-objective approach that automatically balances the
competing objectives of manifold quality and dimensionality. Our proposed
approach is competitive with a range of baseline and state-of-the-art manifold
learning methods, while also providing a range (front) of solutions that give
different trade-offs between quality and dimensionality. Furthermore, the
learned models are shown to often be simple and efficient, utilising only a
small number of features in an interpretable manner.

for decades since their initial discovery, the cause of these signals remains
unknown, as no model has been able to accurately predict all of their spectral
and timing properties. Separately, X-ray reverberation lags have been detected
in AGN and stellar-mass black hole binaries, and reverberation may be expected
to occur in neutron star systems as well, producing lags of the same amplitude
as the lags measured of the kHz QPOs. Furthermore, the detection of a
relativistically reflected Fe K line in the time-averaged spectra of many
neutron star systems provides an additional motivation for testing
reverberation. While it has been shown that the lag-energy properties of the
lower kHz QPOs are unlikely to be produced by X-ray reverberation, the upper
kHz QPOs have not yet been explored. We therefore model the upper kHz QPO
lag-energy spectra using relativistic ray-tracing functions and apply them to
archival RXTE data on 4U 1728-34 where upper kHz QPOs have been detected. By
modeling the time-averaged spectra in which upper kHz QPOs had been
significantly detected, we determine the reflected flux fraction across all
energies and produce a model for the lag-energy spectra from X-ray
reverberation. We explore the dependence of the modeled lag properties on
several different types of reflection models, but are unable to successfully
reproduce the measured lags of 4U 1728-34. We conclude that reverberation alone
does not explain the measured time lags detected in upper kHz QPOs.

Transit spectroscopy can potentially enable the detection of molecular
signatures from such worlds, providing an indication of the presence of an
atmosphere and its chemical composition, including gases potentially indicative
of a biosphere. Such planets around nearby M-dwarf stars - such as TRAPPIST-1 -
provide relatively good signal, high signal/noise, and frequent transits for
follow-up spectroscopy. However, even with these advantages, transit
spectroscopy of terrestrial planets in the HZ of nearby M-stars will still be a
challenge. Herein, we examine the potential for future space observatories to
conduct such observations, using a Global Climate Model (GCM), a photochemical
model, and a radiative transfer suite to simulate modern-Earth-like atmospheric
boundary conditions on TRAPPIST-1e. The detectability of biosignatures on such
an atmosphere via transmission spectroscopy is modeled for JWST, LUVOIR, HabEx,
and Origins. We show that for any of these observatories, only CO2 would be
detectable at the 3 sigma level in transmission spectroscopy, when clouds are
included in our simulations. This is because the impacts of clouds on scale
height strongly limits the detectability of molecules in the atmosphere.
Synergies between space- and ground-based spectroscopy may be essential in
order to overcome these difficulties.

enough trust on the AVs , particularly when they are confused about an AV's
intention in a interaction. This study seeks to evaluate if pedestrians clearly
understand the driving intentions of AVs in interactions and presents
experimental research on the relationship between gaze behaviors of pedestrians
and their understanding of the intentions of the AV. The hypothesis
investigated in this study was that the less the pedestrian understands the
driving intentions of the AV, the longer the duration of their gazing behavior
will be. A pedestrian--vehicle interaction experiment was designed to verify
the proposed hypothesis. A robotic wheelchair was used as the manual driving
vehicle (MV) and AV for interacting with pedestrians while pedestrians' gaze
data and their subjective evaluation of the driving intentions were recorded.
The experimental results supported our hypothesis as there was a negative
correlation between the pedestrians' gaze duration on the AV and their
understanding of the driving intentions of the AV. Moreover, the gaze duration
of most of the pedestrians on the MV was shorter than that on an AV. Therefore,
we conclude with two recommendations to designers of external human-machine

AV, the driving intentions of the AV should be provided; (2) if the pedestrian
still gazes at the AV after the AV displays its driving intentions, the AV
should provide clearer information about its driving intentions.

as well as to new applications where power efficiency is of uttermost
importance. To address the efficiency problems, in this article we present a
novel photo-conductive switch that is based on a 3-dimensional design. In
contrast to conventional planar designs, our photo-conductive switch
drastically enhances the overall efficiency by maximising the laser absorption
within the device, while at the same time optimising the carrier collection
efficiency at the electrodes. To maximise the optical absorption we take
advantage of photonic and plasmonic modes that are excited in our device due to
a periodic array of nanopillars, whereas the collection efficiency is optimised
by converting each nanopillar into a single nano-photo-conductive switch. Our
numerical calculations show a 50-fold increase in the overall generated current
and a 5-fold bandwidth increase compared to traditional interdigitated planar
photo-conductive switches. This opens up a wealth of new possibilities in
quantum science and technology where efficient low power devices are
indispensable.

general-purpose parallel computing that has successfully been employed for
distributed training of machine learning models. A prevalent shortcoming of the
BSP is that it requires workers to wait for the straggler at every iteration.
To ameliorate this shortcoming of classic BSP, we propose ELASTICBSP a model
that aims to relax its strict synchronization requirement. The proposed model
offers more flexibility and adaptability during the training phase, without
sacrificing on the accuracy of the trained model. We also propose an efficient
method that materializes the model, named ZIPLINE. The algorithm is tunable and
can effectively balance the trade-off between quality of convergence and
iteration throughput, in order to accommodate different environments or
applications. A thorough experimental evaluation demonstrates that our proposed
ELASTICBSP model converges faster and to a higher accuracy than the classic
BSP. It also achieves comparable (if not higher) accuracy than the other
sensible synchronization models.

for 3D scene understanding. Due to the complex structure, point sets are
distributed off balance and diversely, which appears as both category imbalance

non-dominant cases during the learning process, resulting in unsatisfactory
performance. Although re-weighting can reduce the influence of the
well-classified examples, they cannot handle the non-dominant patterns during
the dynamic training. In this paper, we propose a memory-augmented network to
learn and memorize the representative prototypes that cover diverse samples
universally. Specifically, a memory module is introduced to alleviate the
forgetting issue by recording the patterns seen in mini-batch training. The
learned memory items consistently reflect the interpretable and meaningful
information for both dominant and non-dominant categories and cases. The
distorted observations and rare cases can thus be augmented by retrieving the
stored prototypes, leading to better performances and generalization.
Exhaustive experiments on the benchmarks, i.e. S3DIS and ScanNetV2, reflect the
superiority of our method on both effectiveness and efficiency. Not only the

defined by the concentration of surfactant and the voltage applied to the
electrodes. Based on the trajectory of the microparticles in the electric
field, a newly developed physical model in which the surfactant was adsorbed on
the microparticles allowed the microparticles to be charged by contact with the
electrodes, with either positive or negative charges, while the non-adsorbed

in the black holes, and may still exist in the strong gravity regimes close to
these black holes.
  In this paper, we try to probe this conformal invariance by looking into the
wave absorption and scattering by the nonsingular static spherical black holes.
  The partial and total absorption cross section, as well as the differential
scattering cross section, are presented for black holes with different choices
of conformal parameters.
  Although the photon trajectories are unchanged from the Schwarzschild case
since the spacetimes are conformally related, the wave optics are affected by
the conformal parameters.
  As a result, the absorption of waves generally increases with the conformal
parameters, while the shadow of the black holes remains the same as the
Schwarzschild case.
  Moreover, the peaks in the oscillatory pattern of scattering shift towards
smaller observing angles as the conformal parameters grows, while the widths of
the glory peaks do not show sensitive dependence.
  The unique signature of the wave absorption and scattering by the nonsingular
static spherical black holes in conformal gravity thus can serve to distinguish
themselves from the Schwarzschild in the low frequency regime, and from other
spherical black holes of alternative gravities in the high frequency limit and
glory peaks.

reasonable predictions of the star formation rate-stellar mass relation, from
high redshift to the present time. We analyse the stellar mass and
environmental quenching efficiencies and their dependence on stellar mass, halo
mass (taken as a proxy for the environment) and redshift. Our analysis shows
that the two quenching efficiencies are redshift, stellar and halo mass
dependent, and that the halo mass is also a good proxy for the environment. The
environmental quenching increases with decreasing redshift and is inefficient
below $\log M_* \sim 9.5$, reaches the maximum value at $\log M_* \sim 10.5$,
and decreases again, becoming poorly efficient at very high stellar mass ($\log
M_* \gtrsim 11.5$). Central and satellites galaxies are mass quenched
differently: for the former, the quenching efficiency depends very weakly on
redshift, but strongly on stellar mass; for the latter, it strongly depends on
both stellar mass and redshift in the range $10\lesssim \log M_* \lesssim 11$.
According to the most recent observational results, we find that the two
quenching efficiencies are not separable: intermediate mass galaxies are
environmental quenched faster, as well as intermediate/massive galaxies in more
massive haloes. At stellar masses lower than $\log M_* \lesssim 9.5$ both
quenching mechanisms become inefficient, independently of the redshift.

dynamics of gene regulation in single cells. These models usually involve
several parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are
not directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian
inference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these
parameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their
uncertainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems
such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on classical Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which
in turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation
(CME). We propose an alternative approach based on a multifidelity extension of
the Sequential Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sampler. This
algorithm is built upon Sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian
inference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved
subproblems that gradually increase model fidelity and the influence of the
observed data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a
well-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate
master equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the
appropriate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criteria that
seeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior
from each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias. This novel
sampling scheme is tested with high performance computing resources using
biologically relevant problems.

topologically flat while its static counterpart does not support the existence
of topology and flatness together. By redefining the flatness accordingly in
the context of non-equilibrium dynamics and correctly justifying it using the
Floquet joint density of states, one indeed obtains a better control of the
desired result when the input parameter space composed of temporal window
associated with the step Hamiltonian and flux becomes larger than the static
parameter space consisting of magnetic flux only. Interestingly, we find the
generation of flux current. We systematically analyse the work done and flux
current in the asymptotic limit as a function of input parameters to show that
topology and flatness both share a close connection to the flux current and
work done, respectively. We finally extend our investigation to the aperiodic
array of step Hamiltonian, where we find that the heating up problem can be
significantly reduced if the initial state is substantially flat as initial the
large degeneracy of states prevents the system from absorbing energy easily
from the aperiodic driving. We additionally show that the heating can be
reduced if the values of the magnetic flux in the step Hamiltonian are small,
the duration of these flux are unequal and on the initial flatness of the band.

synchronously with the released power peak and T-coupling reveals itself up to
a frequency of about 10 kHz. For the studied switching structure configuration,
the RTC value varies over a wide range from 4 to 45 mkm, depending on the

more promising from the practical viewpoint. In the case of a ""weak"" coupling,
synchronization is accompanied by attraction effect and decrease of the main
spectra harmonics width. In the case of a ""strong"" coupling, the number of
effects increases, synchronization can occur on subharmonics resulting in
multilevel stable synchronization of two oscillators. An advanced algorithm for
synchronization efficiency and subharmonic ratio calculation is proposed. It is
shown that of the two oscillators the leading one is that with a higher main
frequency, and, in addition, the frequency stabilization effect is observed.
Also, in the case of a strong thermal coupling, the limit of the supply current

years. It aims to learn task-independent, low-dimensional, and continuous
vectors for nodes preserving both topology and attribute information. Most of
the existing methods, such as random-walk based methods and GCNs, mainly focus
on the local information, i.e., the attributes of the neighbours. Thus, they
have been well studied for assortative networks (i.e., networks with
communities) but ignored disassortative networks (i.e., networks with
multipartite, hubs, and hybrid structures), which are common in the real world.
To enable model both assortative and disassortative networks, we propose a
block-based generative model for attributed network embedding from a
probability perspective. Specifically, the nodes are assigned to several blocks
wherein the nodes in the same block share the similar linkage patterns. These
patterns can define assortative networks containing communities or
disassortative networks with the multipartite, hub, or any hybrid structures.
To preserve the attribute information, we assume that each node has a hidden
embedding related to its assigned block. We use a neural network to
characterize the nonlinearity between node embeddings and node attributes. We
perform extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic attributed networks.
The results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art embedding methods for both clustering and classification

numerical simulations, our scheme outperforms other estimation methods based on
tomography or adaptive measurements, leading to a higher precision in a large
parameter range for estimating established coherence quantifiers of qubit and
qutrit states. We show that our method is accessible with today's technology by

test data of the ""minor"" classes, of which we have insufficient training data.
In this paper, we investigate learning a ConvNet classifier under such a
scenario. We found that a ConvNet significantly over-fits the minor classes,
which is quite opposite to traditional machine learning algorithms that often
under-fit minor classes. We conducted a series of analysis and discovered the
feature deviation phenomenon -- the learned ConvNet generates deviated features
between the training and test data of minor classes -- which explains how
over-fitting happens. To compensate for the effect of feature deviation which
pushes test data toward low decision value regions, we propose to incorporate
class-dependent temperatures (CDT) in training a ConvNet. CDT simulates feature
deviation in the training phase, forcing the ConvNet to enlarge the decision
values for minor-class data so that it can overcome real feature deviation in
the test phase. We validate our approach on benchmark datasets and achieve
promising performance. We hope that our insights can inspire new ways of
thinking in resolving class-imbalanced deep learning.

used is the planar full two-body problem composed of a spherical primary plus a
tri-axial ellipsoid secondary. Compared with classical spin-orbit work, there
are two differences: (1) Influence on the mutual orbit from the secondary's
rotation is considered; (2) Instead of the Hamiltonian approach, the approach
of periodic orbits is adopted. Our studies find: (1) Genealogy of the two
families of periodic orbits is same as that of the families around triangular
libration points in the restricted three-body problem. That is, the long-period
family terminates onto a short-period orbit travelling N times; (2) In the
limiting case where the secondary's mass is negligible, our results can be
reduced to the classical spin-orbit theory, by equating the long-period orbit
with the free libration, and by equating the short-period orbit with the forced
libration caused by orbit eccentricity. However, the two models show obvious
differences when the secondary's mass is non-negligible. (3) By studying the
stability of periodic orbits, for a specific binary asteroid system, we are
able to obtain the maximum libration amplitude of the secondary (which is
usually less than 90 degree), and the maximum mutual orbit eccentricity which
does not break the secondary's synchronous state. We also find the
anti-correlation between the secondary's libration amplitude and the orbit

blindly recognizing the modulation types without handshaking. Thus, it plays an
important role in future intelligent modems. The emerging deep learning (DL)
technique stores intelligence in the network, resulting in superior performance
over traditional approaches. However, conventional DL-based approaches suffer
from heavy training overhead, memory overhead, and computational complexity,
which severely hinder practical applications for resource-limited scenarios,
such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) applications. Furthermore, the overhead of
online retraining under time-varying fading channels has not been studied in
the prior arts. In this work, an accumulated polar feature-based DL with a
channel compensation mechanism is proposed to cope with the aforementioned
issues. Firstly, the simulation results show that learning features from the
polar domain with historical data information can approach near-optimal
performance while reducing training overhead by 99.8 times. Secondly, the
proposed neural network-based channel estimator (NN-CE) can learn the channel
response and compensate for the distorted channel with 13% improvement.
Moreover, in applying this lightweight NN-CE in a time-varying fading channel,
two efficient mechanisms of online retraining are proposed, which can reduce
transmission overhead and retraining overhead by 90% and 76%, respectively.
Finally, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated and compared
with prior arts on a public dataset to demonstrate its great efficiency and
lightness.

enables one to cost effectively customize logical networks over a shared

a novel approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice
Efficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a
constrained resource allocation game, where (i) slices unilaterally optimize
their allocations to best meet their (dynamic) customer loads, while (ii)
constraints are imposed to guarantee that, if they wish so, slices receive a
pre-agreed share of the network resources. The resulting game is a variation of
the well-known Fisher market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for
network resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher
market) prices are constrained for some resources to provide the desired
guarantees. In this way, GREET combines the advantages of a share-based
approach (high efficiency by flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones
(which provide guarantees by assigning a fixed amount of resources). We
characterize the Nash equilibrium, best response dynamics, and propose a
practical slice strategy with provable convergence properties. Extensive

the convexity of the feasible set. Consequently, we propose a variational
Bayes-based method to approximately compute the posterior predictive integral
that ensures tractability and retains the convexity of the feasible set. Under
certain regularity conditions, we also show that the solution set obtained
using variational Bayes converges to the true solution set as the number of
observations tends to infinity. We also provide bounds on the probability of
qualifying a true infeasible point (with respect to the true constraints) as
feasible under the VB approximation for a given number of samples.

for the study of quiescent black holes, the small number of known TDEs and
uncertainties in their emission mechanism have hindered progress towards this
promise. Here present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the
Zwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations.
Our homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22
previously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light
curve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence
features in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, as well as
longer rise times and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the
sample. The Bowen fluorescence mechanism requires a high density which can be
reached at smaller radii, which in turn yields longer diffusion timescales.
Thus, the difference in rise times suggests the pre-peak TDE light curves are
governed not by the fallback timescale, but instead by the diffusion of photons
through the tidal debris. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium
emission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest
luminosities and the lowest rates. We also report, for the first time, the
detection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on day timescales. Based on the fact
the flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity,
we attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise
obscures the inner accretion flow.

the case where the pursuer is faster and more agile than the evader, is
presented. The concept of continuous subsets of the reachable set is introduced
to characterize the time-optimal pursuit-evasion game under feedback
strategies. Using these subsets it is shown that, if initially the pursuer is
distant enough from the evader, then the feedback saddle point strategies for
both the pursuer and the evader are coincident with one of the common tangents
from the minimum radius turning circles of the pursuer to the minimum radius
turning circles of the evader. Using geometry, four feasible tangents are
identified and the feedback min-max strategy for the pursuer and the max-min
strategy for the evader are derived by solving a $2 \times 2$ matrix game at
each instant. Insignificant computational effort is involved in evaluating the
pursuer and evader inputs using the proposed feedback control law and hence it
is suitable for real-time implementation. The proposed law is validated further
by comparing the resulting trajectories with those obtained by solving the
differential game using numerical techniques.

Trap functions of dimension s, the classical (1+1)-EA with standard mutation at
rate 1/s can have expected runtimes exponential in s. In our experiments, a
(1+1)-FEA, the same algorithm but using FFA, exhibits mean runtimes that seem
to scale as $s^2\ln{s}$. Since Jump and Trap are bijective transformations of
OneMax, it behaves identical on all three. On OneMax, LeadingOnes, and Plateau

Only possible solution is to form stars from small ejecta mass, which produces
an inconsistent metallicity distribution function. We conclude that not all the

highly imbalanced classes, geographic diversity, and label noise are addressed.
In this letter, a deep transfer learning method is proposed based on a
similarly annotated optical land cover dataset (NWPU-RESISC45). Besides, a
top-2 smooth loss function with cost-sensitive parameters was introduced to
tackle the label noise and imbalanced classes' problems. The proposed method
shows high efficiency in transferring information from a similarly annotated
remote sensing dataset, a robust performance on highly imbalanced classes, and
is alleviating the over-fitting problem caused by label noise. What's more, the
learned deep model has a good generalization for other SAR-specific tasks, such
as MSTAR target recognition with a state-of-the-art classification accuracy of
99.46%.

greatly reduce computation by maintaining a single copy of weights on the

weight-sharing has no theoretical guarantee and its impact has not been well
studied before. In this paper, we conduct comprehensive experiments to reveal
the impact of weight-sharing: (1) The best-performing models from different

variance; (2) Even with high variance, we can extract valuable information from
training the super-net with shared weights; (3) The interference between child

many scientific disciplines, it is becoming increasingly ubiquitous to conduct
large-scale or online regression to analyze real-world data and unveil

classical batch-based estimation methods that involve the entire dataset are
less attractive or no longer applicable. Instead, recursive estimation methods
such as stochastic gradient descent that process data points sequentially are
more appealing, exhibiting both numerical convenience and memory efficiency. In
this paper, for scalable estimation of large or online survival data, we
propose a stochastic gradient descent method which recursively updates the
estimates in an online manner as data points arrive sequentially in streams.
Theoretical results such as asymptotic normality and estimation efficiency are
established to justify its validity. Furthermore, to quantify the uncertainty

facilitate statistical inference, we develop a scalable resampling strategy
that specifically caters to the large-scale or online setting. Simulation
studies and a real data application are also provided to assess its performance

technologies based on geometric constraints can eliminate phase ambiguity
without projecting any additional fringe patterns, which maximizes the
efficiency of the retrieval of absolute phase. Inspired by the recent success
of deep learning technologies for phase analysis, we demonstrate that deep
learning can be an effective tool that organically unifies the phase retrieval,
geometric constraints, and phase unwrapping steps into a comprehensive
framework. Driven by extensive training dataset, the neutral network can
gradually ""learn"" how to transfer one high-frequency fringe pattern into the
""physically meaningful"", and ""most likely"" absolute phase, instead of ""step by

high-quality phase retrieval and robust phase ambiguity removal can be achieved
based on only single-frame projection. Experimental results demonstrate that
compared with traditional SPU, our method can more efficiently and stably
unwrap the phase of dense fringe images in a larger measurement volume with
fewer camera views. Limitations about the proposed approach are also discussed.

each simulator is limited to one aircraft type, which is inefficient for the

touchscreen instrumentation, cockpit displays require the pilot's attention to
be drawn away from their view out of the window. But by using gesture
recognition interfaces combined with mid-air haptic feedback, we can mitigate
this shortcoming while also adding another dimension to the existing technology
for pilots already familiar with using legacy cockpits, complete with
traditional instrumentation. Meanwhile, simulation environments using augmented

decays $T_{b:\overline{d}}^{-} \to \widetilde{Z}_{bc;\bar{u}\bar{ d}}^{0}M$,

repeats of the unit structure. As the system exhibits oscillatory interlayer
exchange coupling (IEC) with varying Ir layer thickness, we compare the SOT of
films when the Co layers are coupled ferromagnetically and
antiferromagnetically. SOT is evaluated using current induced shift of the
anomalous Hall resistance hysteresis loops. A relatively thick Pt layer,
serving as a seed layer to the multilayer, is used to generate spin current via
the spin Hall effect. In the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling, the SOT is
constant against the applied current density and the corresponding spin torque
efficiency (i.e. the effective spin Hall angle) is $\sim$0.09, in agreement
with previous reports. In contrast, for films with antiferromagnetic coupling,
the SOT increases with the applied current density and eventually saturates.
The SOT at saturation is a factor of $\sim$15 larger than that without the
antiferromagnetic coupling. The spin torque efficiency is $\sim$5 times larger
if we assume the net total magnetization is reduced by a factor of 3 due to the
antiferromagnetic coupling. Model calculations based on the Landau Lifshitz
Gilbert equation show that the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling can
increase the SOT but the degree of enhancement is limited, in this case, to a
factor of 1.2-1.4. We thus consider there are other sources of SOT, possibly at
the interfaces, which may account for the highly efficient SOT in the
uncompensated synthetic anti-ferromagnet (SAF) multilayers.

convergence with tilting' and `contact--EDP convergence with tilting'. Both are
based on the Energy-Dissipation-Principle (EDP) formulation of solutions of
gradient systems, and can be seen as refinements of the Gamma-convergence for
gradient flows first introduced by Sandier and Serfaty. The two new concepts
are constructed in order to avoid the `unnatural' limiting gradient structures
that sometimes arise as limits in EDP-convergence. EDP-convergence with tilting
is a strengthening of EDP-convergence by requiring EDP-convergence for a full
family of `tilted' copies of $(\mathbf Q, \mathcal E_\varepsilon,\mathcal
R_\varepsilon)$. It avoids unnatural limiting gradient structures, but many
interesting systems are non-convergent according to this concept. Contact--EDP
convergence with tilting is a relaxation of EDP convergence with tilting, and
still avoids unnatural limits but applies to a broader class of sequences
$(\mathbf Q, \mathcal E_\varepsilon,\mathcal R_\varepsilon)$. In this paper we
define these concepts, study their properties, and connect them with classical
EDP convergence. We illustrate the different concepts on a number of test

possible to edge-color their (edge) union with $\Delta+2$ colors in such a way

having two parameters for controlling the disorder strength: $D$, which
determines the range of the coefficients of the on-site potentials, and $W$,
which defines the strength of the nearest-neighbor interactions. We fix $W=4$
and investigate how the properties of the system's normal modes change as we
approach its ordered version, i.e. $D\rightarrow 0$. We show that the
probability density distribution of the normal modes' frequencies takes a
`U'-shaped profile as $D$ decreases. Furthermore, we use two quantities for
estimating the modes' spatial extent, the so-called localization volume $V$
(which is related to the mode's second moment) and the mode's participation
number $P$. We show that both quantities scale as $\propto D^{-2}$ when $D$
approaches zero and we numerically verify a proportionality relation between
them as $V/P \approx 2.6$.

coefficients is smaller than the sample size, is a well-studied topic. The
common approach of such tests is to permute residuals after regressing on the
nuisance covariates. Permutation-based tests are valuable in particular because
they can be highly robust to violations of the standard linear model, such as
non-normality and heteroscedasticity. Moreover, in some cases they can be
combined with existing, powerful permutation-based multiple testing methods.
Here, we propose permutation tests for models where the number of nuisance
coefficients exceeds the sample size. The performance of the novel tests is
investigated with simulations. In a wide range of simulation scenarios our
proposed permutation methods provided appropriate type I error rate control,
unlike some competing tests, while having good power.

slightly greater than r^2 then this probability is bounded from below. On the

r^3 then this probability decays logarithmically for all larger balls. These
results represent a finitary refinement of Varopoulos's theorem that a random
walk on a vertex-transitive graph is recurrent if and only if the graph has at
most quadratic volume growth. They also combine to show that there is a gap for
escape probabilities: there exists a universal constant c such that the random
walk on an arbitrary vertex-transitive graph is either recurrent or has a
probability of at least c of escaping to infinity. We also prove versions of
these results for finite graphs, in particular confirming and strengthening a
conjecture of Benjamini and Kozma from 2002. Amongst other things, we also
generlise our results to give a sharp finitary version of the characterisation

  data extraction from Scanned Document Images",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the widespread use of mobile phones and scanners to photograph and
upload documents, the need for extracting the information trapped in
unstructured document images such as retail receipts, insurance claim forms and
financial invoices is becoming more acute. A major hurdle to this objective is
that these images often contain information in the form of tables and
extracting data from tabular sub-images presents a unique set of challenges.
This includes accurate detection of the tabular region within an image, and
subsequently detecting and extracting information from the rows and columns of
the detected table. While some progress has been made in table detection,
extracting the table contents is still a challenge since this involves more
fine grained table structure(rows & columns) recognition. Prior approaches have
attempted to solve the table detection and structure recognition problems
independently using two separate models. In this paper, we propose TableNet: a
novel end-to-end deep learning model for both table detection and structure
recognition. The model exploits the interdependence between the twin tasks of
table detection and table structure recognition to segment out the table and
column regions. This is followed by semantic rule-based row extraction from the
identified tabular sub-regions. The proposed model and extraction approach was
evaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 and Marmot Table datasets
obtaining state of the art results. Additionally, we demonstrate that feeding
additional semantic features further improves model performance and that the
model exhibits transfer learning across datasets. Another contribution of this
paper is to provide additional table structure annotations for the Marmot data,
which currently only has annotations for table detection.

monolithic scintillating gamma detectors are read in time coincidence with a
diamond-based beam hodoscope, in order to build TOF spectra of PG generated in
a heterogeneous target presenting an air cavity of variable thickness. Since
the measurement was carried out at low beam currents ($<$ 1 proton/bunch) it
was possible to reach excellent coincidence time resolutions, of the order of
100 ps ($\sigma$). Our goal is to detect possible deviations of the proton
range with respect to treatment planning within a few intense irradiation spots
at the beginning of the session and then carry on the treatment at standard

these very low resistive scattering rates result from strongly suppressed
backscattering due to special features of the electronic structure, or are a
consequence of highly unusual levels of crystalline perfection. We report the
results of experiments in which high energy electron irradiation was used to
introduce point disorder to the Pd and Pt layers in which the conduction
occurs. We obtain the cross-section for formation of Frenkel pairs in absolute
units, and cross-check our analysis with first principles calculations of the
relevant atomic displacement energies. We observe an increase of resistivity
that is linear in defect density with a slope consistent with scattering in the
unitary limit. Our results enable us to deduce that the as-grown crystals
contain extremely low levels of in-plane defects of approximately $0.001\%$.
This confirms that crystalline perfection is the most important factor in
realizing the long mean free paths, and highlights how unusual these
delafossite metals are in comparison with the vast majority of other
multi-component oxides and alloys. We discuss the implications of our findings

moving memory pressure from external memory to on-chip memory on GPUs. However,
correctly implementing those optimizations while considering the complexity of
the architecture and memory hierarchy of GPUs to achieve high performance is
difficult. We propose AN5D, an automated stencil framework which is capable of
automatically transforming and optimizing stencil patterns in a given C source
code, and generating corresponding CUDA code. Parameter tuning in our framework
is guided by our performance model. Our novel optimization strategy reduces
shared memory and register pressure in comparison to existing implementations,
allowing performance scaling up to a temporal blocking degree of 10. We achieve
the highest performance reported so far for all evaluated stencil benchmarks on
the state-of-the-art Tesla V100 GPU.

surface, whereas the vertical walls in a control sample are not. The resultant
imbalanced polarization profile can then couple to the out-of-plane microwave
fields and induce power dissipation, which is confirmed by the phase-field
modeling. Since the contributions from mobile-carrier conduction and
bound-charge oscillation to the ac conductivity are equivalent in a microwave
circuit, the research on local structural dynamics may open a new avenue to
implement DW nano-devices for RF applications.

exhibit different \ce{^{14}N/^{15}N} values depending on their production
processes, primarily because of the various \ce{N2} dissociation processes
induced by different sources such as ultraviolet radiation, magnetospheric
electrons, and galactic cosmic rays. For \ce{CH3CN}, one photochemical model
predicted a \ce{^{14}N/^{15}N} value as 120--130 in the lower stratosphere.
This is much higher than that for \ce{HCN} and \ce{HC3N}, $\sim$67--94. By
analyzing archival data obtained by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), we successfully detected submillimeter rotational transitions of
\ce{CH3C^{15}N} ($J$ = 19--18) locate at the 338 GHz band in Titan's
atmospheric spectra. By comparing those observations with the simultaneously
observed \ce{CH3CN} ($J$ = 19--18) lines at the 349 GHz band, which probe from
160 to $\sim$400 km altitude, we then derived \ce{^{14}N/^{15}N} in \ce{CH3CN}
as 125$^{+145}_{-44}$. Although the range of the derived value shows
insufficient accuracy due to data quality limitations, the best-fit value
suggests that \ce{^{14}N/^{15}N} for \ce{CH3CN} is higher than values that have
been previously observed and theoretically predicted for \ce{HCN} and
\ce{HC3N}. This may be explained by the different \ce{N2} dissociation sources
according to the altitudes, as suggested by a recent photochemical model.

nonsingular solutions produced by the interplay of nonlinear self-attraction

singularity at the central point, which keeps their integral norm convergent.
Such states are generated by self-repulsion, which should be strong enough,
namely, represented by septimal, quintic, and usual cubic terms in the
framework of the one-, two-, and three-dimensional (1D, 2D, and 3D) nonlinear
Schroedinger equations (NLSEs), respectively. Although such solutions seem
counterintuitive, we demonstrate that they admit a straightforward
interpretation as a result of screening of an additionally introduced
attractive delta-functional potential by the defocusing nonlinearity. The
strength (""bare charge"") of the attractive potential is infinite in 1D, finite
in 2D, and vanishingly small in 3D. Analytical asymptotics of the singular
solitons at small and large distances are found, entire shapes of the solitons
being produced in a numerical form. Complete stability of the singular modes is
accurately predicted by the anti-Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion (under the
assumption that it applies to the model), as verified by means of numerical
methods. In 2D, the NLSE with a quintic self-focusing term admits singular
soliton solutions with intrinsic vorticity too, but they are fully unstable. We
also mention that dissipative singular solitons can be produced by the model
with a complex coefficient in front of the nonlinear term.

theoretical prediction. The calculated structural properties were comparable to
those obtained by an experimental group led by Clark and co-workers thus giving
us extra confidence in the accuracy of our DFT computations on
Sr$_3$[C$_2$N]$_2$. We employed the same approach in calculating mechanical and
dynamical stabilities together with the electronic density of states of
Sr$_3$[C$_2$N]$_2$. No imaginary phonon modes were observed and thus implying
dynamical stability. The thirteen elastic constants calculated passed the
stability criteria of a monoclinic system. From the computed Poisson's ratio
($\eta$=0.27) and G/B=0.54, our calculations predict Sr$_3$[C$_2$N]$_2$ being
brittle and not able to withstand high-pressure applications. To analyze the
chemical bonding mechanism, the corresponding total density of states (TDOS)
and partial DOS were plotted. The top of the valence band (VB) mainly consists
of C 2p states N 2p, N 2s and a slight admixture of Sr 5s states. The bottom of
the conduction band (CB) shows a strong hybridization between C 2p, N 2p, N 2s,

Furthermore, performing SR purely in software can be expensive, due to
requirement of a pseudorandom number generator (PRNG), multiple masking and
shifting instructions, and an addition operation. Also, saturation of the
rounded values is included, since rounding is usually followed by saturation,
which is especially important in fixed-point arithmetic due to a narrow dynamic

  Huan Yu",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops a full-state feedback controller that damps out
oscillations in traffic density and traffic velocity whose dynamical behavior
is governed by the linearized two-class Aw-Rascle (AR) model. Thereby, the
traffic is considered to be in the congested regime and subdivided in two
classes whereas each class represents vehicles with the same size and driver's
behavior. The macroscopic second-order two-class AR model consists of four
first order hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) and introduces a
concept of area occupancy to depict the mixed density of two-class vehicles in
the traffic. Moreover, the linearized model equations show heterodirectional
behavior with both positive and negative characteristic speeds in the congested
regime. The control objective is to achieve convergence to a constant
equilibrium in finite time. The control input is realized by ramp metering
acting at the outlet of the considered track section. The backstepping method
is employed to design full-state feedback for the $4\times 4$ hyperbolic PDEs.
The performance of the full-state feedback controller is verified by
simulation.

precision unification of the gauge couplings consistent with the current limits

pseudo-Dirac dark matter which in turn evades the existing constraints from the
direct detection experiments. Bino mass scale is required to be $\gtrsim

analyze these perturbations and show that they generalize well under both

validate that there exist some perturbation thresholds over which the Im2Im

Intertwined nature of the dynamics of nodes in such network makes it difficult

the network, a property known as reflexivity. In this article, a novel
methodology is proposed which combines vector autoregression model with an
unique identification restrictions obtained from the topological structure of
the network to uniquely characterize cascades. In particular, we show that
planarity of the network allows us to statistically estimate a dynamical
process consistent with the observed network and thereby uniquely identify a
path for shock propagation from any chosen epicenter to all other nodes in the

rise to a detailed picture of the effect of feedback loops in transmitting

assimilation is used to optimally combine a surrogate model with sparse noisy

""low-and-slow"" attack patterns and frequent use of zero-day exploits. We
present UNICORN, an anomaly-based APT detector that effectively leverages data
provenance analysis. From modeling to detection, UNICORN tailors its design
specifically for the unique characteristics of APTs. Through extensive yet
time-efficient graph analysis, UNICORN explores provenance graphs that provide
rich contextual and historical information to identify stealthy anomalous
activities without pre-defined attack signatures. Using a graph sketching
technique, it summarizes long-running system execution with space efficiency to
combat slow-acting attacks that take place over a long time span. UNICORN
further improves its detection capability using a novel modeling approach to
understand long-term behavior as the system evolves. Our evaluation shows that
UNICORN outperforms an existing state-of-the-art APT detection system and
detects real-life APT scenarios with high accuracy.

  Adaptation on Person Re-identification","Accepted in International Conference on Learning Representations
  (ICLR 2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Person re-identification (re-ID) aims at identifying the same persons' images
across different cameras. However, domain diversities between different
datasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one
dataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods
for person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by
optimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target
domain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable
label noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo
labels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving
feature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects
of noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the
target domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching
(MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined
hard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative
training manner. In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the
classification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal
performances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot
work with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft
softmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet
labels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance. The proposed
MMT framework achieves considerable improvements of 14.4%, 18.2%, 13.1% and
16.4% mAP on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT and Duke-to-MSMT

the observed energy spectrum and composition of UHECRs differs from the one
outside of the Milky Way, due to the suppression or the amplification of the
UHECR flux from certain directions by the Galactic magnetic field. In this
work, we investigate this effect for the case of a dipole and a quadrupole
anisotropy, respectively, for the widely-used JF12 magnetic field model. We
investigate boundaries on the maximal amplitude of the observed anisotropy and
the maximal charge number of UHECRs. Furthermore, the flux modification is
discussed in the light of the Auger data on the recent dipole and also the
chemical composition. We find that this modification effect yields a
modification of the observed flux of up to $\sim 10\%$ for the investigated

chemical composition of UHECRs as suggested by the 'EPOS-LHC' model.

spatial dependence structure is known in advance and is represented by a
deterministic spatial weights matrix. Contrary to classical approaches, we
investigate the estimation of sparse spatial dependence structures for regular
lattice data. In particular, an adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator (lasso) is used to select and estimate the individual connections of
the spatial weights matrix. To recover the spatial dependence structure, we
propose cross-sectional resampling, assuming that the random process is
exchangeable. The estimation procedure is based on a two-step approach to
circumvent simultaneity issues that typically arise from endogenous spatial
autoregressive dependencies. The two-step adaptive lasso approach with
cross-sectional resampling is verified using Monte Carlo simulations.
Eventually, we apply the procedure to model nitrogen dioxide ($\mathrm{NO_2}$)

enhancement (SE) systems. However, two problems remain unsolved, which are
closely related to model generalizability to noisy conditions: (1) mismatched
noisy condition during testing, i.e., the performance is generally sub-optimal
when models are tested with unseen noise types that are not involved in the
training data; (2) local focus on specific noisy conditions, i.e., models
trained using multiple types of noises cannot optimally remove a specific noise
type even though the noise type has been involved in the training data. These
problems are common in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
denoising autoencoder with a multi-branched encoder (termed DAEME) model to
deal with these two problems. In the DAEME model, two stages are involved:
training and testing. In the training stage, we build multiple component models
to form a multi-branched encoder based on a decision tree (DSDT). The DSDT is
built based on prior knowledge of speech and noisy conditions (the speaker,
environment, and signal factors are considered in this paper), where each
component of the multi-branched encoder performs a particular mapping from
noisy to clean speech along the branch in the DSDT. Finally, a decoder is
trained on top of the multi-branched encoder. In the testing stage, noisy
speech is first processed by each component model. The multiple outputs from
these models are then integrated into the decoder to determine the final
enhanced speech. Experimental results show that DAEME is superior to several
baseline models in terms of objective evaluation metrics, automatic speech
recognition results, and quality in subjective human listening tests.

a promising PAPR reduction technique that is distortionless, has good PAPR
reducing capability, and can be easily adapted in OFDM-IM systems. In SLM for
OFDM-IM systems, the phase sequences rotate the OFDM-IM block in the frequency

for ill-defined non-Gaussian measures. We make this argument rigorous by
introducing a white-noise-type auxiliary field, through which the functional
integral is expressed in terms of propagators of heat equations driven by
time-dependent periodic random potentials and can, in turn, be expressed as a
gas of interacting Brownian loops and paths. When the gas is confined by an
external trapping potential, we control the decay of the reduced density
matrices using excursion probabilities of Brownian bridges.

image (HSI) and a high-resolution multispectral image (MSI) to obtain a
high-resolution HSI (HR-HSI). In this paper, we propose a new model, named
coupled tensor ring factorization (CTRF), for HSR. The proposed CTRF approach
simultaneously learns high spectral resolution core tensor from the HSI and
high spatial resolution core tensors from the MSI, and reconstructs the HR-HSI
via tensor ring (TR) representation (Figure~\ref{fig:framework}). The CTRF
model can separately exploit the low-rank property of each class (Section
\ref{sec:analysis}), which has been never explored in the previous coupled
tensor model. Meanwhile, it inherits the simple representation of coupled
matrix/CP factorization and flexible low-rank exploration of coupled Tucker
factorization.
  Guided by Theorem~\ref{th:1}, we further propose a spectral nuclear norm
regularization to explore the global spectral low-rank property.
  The experiments have demonstrated the advantage of the proposed nuclear norm
regularized CTRF (NCTRF) as compared to previous matrix/tensor and deep

generally be performed prior to performing tasks such as simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Within this context, the current trend is to
carry out simultaneous calibration of odometry and sensor without the use of
any additional hardware. Building upon the existing simultaneous calibration

handle robots operating in 2D with arbitrary or unknown motion models but also
handle outliers in an automated manner. We first propose an algorithm based on
the alternating minimization framework applicable to two-wheel differential

require no manual intervention and seamlessly handle outliers that arise due to
both systematic and non-systematic errors. Finally, we put forward a novel

40,000x40,000 pixels) of an entire pathological tissue slide, which consists of
cancer and non-cancer portions. One difficulty arises from the high cost
associated with annotating tumor regions in WSIs. Furthermore, both global and

magnifications of the image. In addition, the image features should be stably

models have a limited generalization ability under the scale and location
mismatch between objects, as only few samples from target classes are provided.
Therefore, the lack of a mechanism to match the scale and location between
pairs of compared images leads to the performance degradation. The importance
of image contents varies across coarse-to-fine scales depending on the object
and its class label, e.g., generic objects and scenes rely on their global
appearance while fine-grained objects rely more on their localized visual
patterns. In this paper, we study the impact of scale and location mismatch in
the few-shot learning scenario, and propose a novel Spatially-aware Matching
(SM) scheme to effectively perform matching across multiple scales and
locations, and learn image relations by giving the highest weights to the best
matching pairs. The SM is trained to activate the most related locations and
scales between support and query data. We apply and evaluate SM on various

Furthermore, we leverage an auxiliary self-supervisory discriminator to

Finally, we develop a novel transformer-based pipeline to exploit self- and

plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy under Ni-flux limited growth conditions.
Single crystalline growth with a cube-on-cube epitaxial relationship was
confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements for all used growth conditions and
substrates except MgO(111). A detailed growth series on MgO(100) was prepared
using substrate temperatures ranging from 20 {\deg}C to 900 {\deg}C to
investigate the influence on the layer characteristics. Energy-dispersive X-ray
spectroscopy indicated close-to-stoichiometric layers with an oxygen content of
~47 at. % and ~50 at. % grown under low and high O-flux, respectively. All NiO
layers had a root-mean-square surface roughness below 1 nm, measured by atomic
force microscopy, except for rougher layers grown at 900 {\deg}C or using
molecular oxygen. Growth at 900 {\deg}C led to a significant diffusion of Mg
from the substrate into the film. The relative intensity of the quasi-forbidden
one-phonon Raman peak is introduced as a gauge of the crystal quality,
indicating the highest layer quality for growth at low oxygen flux and high
growth temperature, likely due to the resulting high adatom diffusion length
during growth. The optical and electrical properties were investigated by
spectroscopic ellipsometry and resistance measurements, respectively. All NiO
layers were transparent with an optical bandgap around 3.6 eV and
semi-insulating at room temperature. However, changes upon exposure to reducing
or oxidizing gases of the resistance of a representative layer at elevated
temperature were able to confirm p-type conductivity, highlighting their
suitability as a model system for research on oxide-based gas sensing.

from pixels to 3D object parameters. Such an approach works well when
supervision is available, but in problems like human pose and shape estimation,
it is difficult to obtain natural images with 3D ground truth. To go one step
further, we propose a new architecture that facilitates unsupervised, or
lightly supervised, learning. The idea is to break the problem into a series of
transformations between increasingly abstract representations. Each step
involves a cycle designed to be learnable without annotated training data, and
the chain of cycles delivers the final solution. Specifically, we use 2D body
part segments as an intermediate representation that contains enough
information to be lifted to 3D, and at the same time is simple enough to be
learned in an unsupervised way. We demonstrate the method by learning 3D human
pose and shape from un-paired and un-annotated images. We also explore varying
amounts of paired data and show that cycling greatly alleviates the need for
paired data. While we present results for modeling humans, our formulation is
general and can be applied to other vision problems.

problems. One can use the resulting multiscale solver both as a
CPR-preconditioner in fully implicit simulators or as an efficient approximate
iterative linear solver in a sequential setting. The latter approach has been
successful implemented in a commercial simulator. Recently, we have shown that
you can obtain significantly faster convergence if you instead of using a
single pair of prolongation-restriction operators apply a sequence of such
operators, where some of the operators adapt to faults, fractures, facies, or
other geobodies. Herein, we present how you can accelerate the convergence even
further, if you also include additional basis functions that capture local
changes in the pressure.

variations of the seed photon flux in young binary systems or the pump rate

variability of four maser transitions of three different species in
G107.298+5.639 to constrain the dominant mechanism of periodic flares. Light
curves of the 6.7 GHz methanol and 22.2 GHz water vapour maser were obtained
with the Torun 32m radio telescope over 39 and 34 cycles, respectively. The
target was also monitored at the 1.6 GHz hydroxyl transitions with the
Nan\c{c}ay radio telescope over 13 cycles. All these maser lines were imaged
using VLBI arrays. The study confirms alternating flares of the methanol and
water masers with a period of 34.4d and reveals the synchronised behaviour of
the methanol and hydroxyl masers in this source. The observed spatial
distribution of the methanol maser cloudlets and the measured time delays of
the flares of individual features imply a ring-like structure of radius 240au
and thickness 30au. Internal proper motions indicate that the velocity of
methanol cloudlets is dominated by a disc-wind component of about 5km/s. The
methanol emission detected during only one VLBI observation is located in a
region about 550au from a central star, which also exhibits OH maser flares.
The erratic appearance of methanol features can be related to a powering object
of relatively low luminosity which, during some variability cycles, can excite
molecules only in the nearest part of the disc. A careful analysis of the maser
and infrared light curves reveal a strong correlation between the 6.7 GHz line
and the infrared flux densities supporting a radiative pumping of the maser.
The synchronised behaviour of the hydroxyl and methanol transitions indicates a
common pumping mechanism for the periodic flares of G107.298+5.639.

Add experiments on MS COCO",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a novel contour-based approach named deep snake for
real-time instance segmentation. Unlike some recent methods that directly
regress the coordinates of the object boundary points from an image, deep snake
uses a neural network to iteratively deform an initial contour to match the
object boundary, which implements the classic idea of snake algorithms with a
learning-based approach. For structured feature learning on the contour, we
propose to use circular convolution in deep snake, which better exploits the
cycle-graph structure of a contour compared against generic graph convolution.
Based on deep snake, we develop a two-stage pipeline for instance segmentation:
initial contour proposal and contour deformation, which can handle errors in
object localization. Experiments show that the proposed approach achieves
competitive performances on the Cityscapes, KINS, SBD and COCO datasets while
being efficient for real-time applications with a speed of 32.3 fps for
512$\times$512 images on a 1080Ti GPU. The code is available at

black-oil problems in reservoir simulation. The method requires repeated
linearization of large nonlinear systems and produces ill-condi\-tioned linear
systems. We present a strategy to reduce computational time that relies on two
key ideas: (\textit{i}) a sequential formulation that decouples flow and
transport into separate subproblems, and (\textit{ii}) a highly efficient
Gauss--Seidel solver for the transport problems. This solver uses intercell
fluxes to reorder the grid cells according to their upstream neighbors, and
groups cells that are mutually dependent because of counter-current flow into
local clusters. The cells and local clusters can then be solved in sequence,
starting from the inflow and moving gradually downstream, since each new cell
or local cluster will only depend on upstream neighbors that have already been
computed. Altogether, this gives optimal localization and control of the
nonlinear solution process.
  This method has been successfully applied to real-field problems using the
standard first-order finite volume discretization. Here, we extend the idea to
first-order dG methods on fully unstructured grids. We also demonstrate proof
of concept for the reordering idea by applying it to the full simulation model
of the Norne oil field, using a prototype variant of the open-source OPM Flow
simulator.

ion-neutral reactions and dissociative recombination might play an important
role in controlling molecular growth in outer CSEs. The aim of this work is to
provide experimental insights into pathways of photochemistry-driven molecular
growth within outer CSEs to draw a more complete picture of the chemical
processes occurring within these molecule-rich environments. A simplified CSE
environment was therefore reproduced in the laboratory through gas-phase
experiments exposing relevant gas mixtures to an Extreme UltraViolet (EUV)
photon source. This photochemical reactor should ultimately allow us to
investigate chemical processes and their resulting products occurring under
conditions akin to outer CSEs. We used a recently developed EUV lamp coupled to
the APSIS photochemical cell to irradiate CSE relevant gas mixtures of H$_2$,
CO and N$_2$, at one wavelength, 73.6 nm. The detection and identification of
chemical species in the photochemical reactor was achieved through in-situ mass
spectrometry analysis of neutral and cationic molecules. We find that exposing
CO-N$_2$-H$_2$ gas mixtures to EUV photons at 73.6 nm induces photochemical
reactions that yield the formation of complex, neutral and ionic species. Our
work shows that N$_2$H$^+$ can be formed through photochemistry along with
highly oxygenated ion molecules like HCO$^+$ in CSE environments. We also
observe neutral N-rich organic species including triazole and aromatic

full suppression of the macroscopic response of the superconducting condensate.
However, it reveals surprisingly weak signatures of the 3d Cu-CDW at high
magnetic fields. At 30 Tesla there is only a weak reduction of the spectral
weight of the Drude-response (by about 3%) that is accompanied by an
enhancement of two narrow electronic modes around 90 and 240 cm-1, that are
interpreted in terms of pinned phase modes of the CDW along the a- and
b-direction, respectively, and of the so-called mid-infrared (MIR) band. The
pinned phased modes and the MIR band are strong features already without

This independence forces the network to have completely balanced final states.
However, there exists evidence indicating that real networks are partially
balanced raising the question of what is the mechanism preventing the system to
be perfectly balanced. Our suggestion is to consider a quartic interaction
which dissolves the triad's independence. We use mean field method to study
thermal behavior of such systems where the temperature is a parameter that
allows the stochastic behavior of agents. We show that under a certain
temperature, the symmetry between balanced and imbalanced triads will
spontaneously break and we have a discrete phase transition. As consequence
stability arises where either similar balanced or imbalanced triads dominate,
hence the system obtains two new imbalanced stable states. In this model, the
critical temperature depends on the second power of the number of nodes, which
was a linear dependence in thermal balance theory. Our simulations are in good

matrix to its eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of its principal submatrices in
which the jth row and column have been removed. We show that one-dimensional
arrays of coupled resonators, described by square matrices with real
eigenvalues, provide simple physical systems where this formula can be applied
in practice. The subsystems consist of arrays with the jth resonator removed,
and thus can be realized physically. From their spectra alone, the oscillation
modes of the full system can be obtained. This principle of successive single
resonator deletions is demonstrated in two experiments of coupled
radiofrequency resonator arrays with greater-than-nearest neighbor couplings,
in which the spectra are measured with a network analyzer. Both the Hermitian
as well as a non-Hermitian case are covered in the experiments. In both cases
the experimental eigenvector estimates agree well with numerical simulations if
certain consistency conditions imposed by system symmetries are taken into
account. In the Hermitian case, these estimates are obtained from resonance
spectra alone without knowledge of the system parameters. It remains an
interesting problem of physical relevance to find conditions under which the
full non-Hermitian eigenvector set can be obtained from the spectra alone.

accordingly transportation systems largely influence the performance of the

approach for solving the real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) in the field
of logistics. The work consists of two basic units: (i) an innovative
multi-step algorithm for successful and entirely feasible solving of the VRP
problems in logistics, (ii) an adaptive approach for adjusting and setting up
parameters and constants of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm
combines several data transformation approaches, heuristics and Tabu search.
Moreover, as the performance of the algorithm depends on the set of control
parameters and constants, a predictive model that adaptively adjusts these
parameters and constants according to historical data is proposed. A comparison
of the acquired results has been made using the Decision Support System with
predictive models: Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Support Vector Machine
(SVM). The algorithm, along with the control parameters, which using the
prediction method were acquired, was incorporated into a web-based enterprise

benchmark instances and validated over real benchmark instances as well. The
successful feasibility of the given routes, in a real environment, is also

reduce their consumption of some staple goods. This can lead to health issues

consumers can, to prevent these negative consequences, buy insurance to secure
sufficient consumption of a staple good if they lose part of their income. We
develop a two-period/two-good principal-agent problem with adverse selection
and endogenous reservation utility to model insurance with in-kind benefits.
This model allows us to obtain semi-explicit solutions for the insurance
contract and is applied to the context of fuel poverty. For this application,
our model allows to conclude that, even in the least efficient scenario from
the households point of view, i.e., when the insurance is provided by a
monopoly, this mechanism decreases significantly the risk of fuel poverty of
households by ensuring them a sufficient consumption of energy. The
effectiveness of in-kind insurance is highlighted through a comparison with

is frequency-dependent and is usually used for estimating the projected number
density of electrons along the line of sight, called the dispersion measure.
The dense and clumpy distribution of plasma can cause refractive deflections of
radio signals, analogous to lensing effects. Similar to gravitational lensing,
there are two contributions to the time delay effect in plasma lensing: a
geometric delay, due to increased path length of the signal, and a dispersive
delay due to the change of speed of light in a plasma medium. We show the delay
time for two models of the plasma distribution, and point out that the
estimated dispersion measure can be biased. Since the contribution of the
geometric effect can be comparable to that of the dispersive delay, the bias in
the measured dispersion measure can be dramatically large if plasma lensing
effects are not taken into account when signals propagate through a
high-density gradient clump of plasma.

(HR) frames with plausible and temporally consistent details from their
low-resolution (LR) counterparts. The key challenge for video SR lies in the
effective exploitation of temporal dependency between consecutive frames.
Existing deep learning based methods commonly estimate optical flows between LR
frames to provide temporal dependency. However, the resolution conflict between
LR optical flows and HR outputs hinders the recovery of fine details. In this
paper, we propose an end-to-end video SR network to super-resolve both optical
flows and images. Optical flow SR from LR frames provides accurate temporal
dependency and ultimately improves video SR performance. Specifically, we first
propose an optical flow reconstruction network (OFRnet) to infer HR optical
flows in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then, motion compensation is performed using
HR optical flows to encode temporal dependency. Finally, compensated LR inputs
are fed to a super-resolution network (SRnet) to generate SR results. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of HR optical
flows for SR performance improvement. Comparative results on the Vid4 and
DAVIS-10 datasets show that our network achieves the state-of-the-art
performance.

dissipative solution itself relies on an inequality instead of an equality, but
is described by functions instead of parametrized measures. These solutions
exist globally and fulfill the weak-strong uniqueness property. Additionally,
we generalize the relative energy inequality to solutions fulfilling different
nonhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions and incorporate the influence of a
temporarily constant electromagnetic field. Relying on this generalized energy
inequality, we investigate the long-time behavior and show that all solutions
converge for the large time limit to a certain steady state.

widely demonstrated (e.g., adversarial example attacks). Traditional attacks
perform unstructured pixel-wise perturbation to fool the classifier. An
alternative approach is to have perturbations in the latent space. However,
such perturbations are hard to control due to the lack of interpretability and
disentanglement. In this paper, we propose a more practical adversarial attack
by designing structured perturbation with semantic meanings. Our proposed
technique manipulates the semantic attributes of images via the disentangled
latent codes. The intuition behind our technique is that images in similar
domains have some commonly shared but theme-independent semantic attributes,
e.g. thickness of lines in handwritten digits, that can be bidirectionally
mapped to disentangled latent codes. We generate adversarial perturbation by
manipulating a single or a combination of these latent codes and propose two
unsupervised semantic manipulation approaches: vector-based disentangled
representation and feature map-based disentangled representation, in terms of
the complexity of the latent codes and smoothness of the reconstructed images.
We conduct extensive experimental evaluations on real-world image data to
demonstrate the power of our attacks for black-box classifiers. We further
demonstrate the existence of a universal, image-agnostic semantic adversarial
example.

response of superconducting thin-film resonators. We explain how most, if not
all, of the complex phenomena commonly seen can be described by a model in
which the underlying resonance is a single-pole Lorentzian, but whose centre
frequency and quality factor change as external parameters, such as readout
power and frequency, are varied. What is seen during a vector-network-analyser
measurement is series of samples taken from an ideal Lorentzian that is
shifting and spreading as the readout frequency is changed. According to this
model, it is perfectly proper to refer to, and measure, the resonant frequency
and quality factor of the underlying resonance, even though the swept-frequency
curves appear highly distorted and hysteretic. In those cases where the
resonance curve is highly distorted, the specific shape of the trajectory in
the Argand plane gives valuable insights into the second-order physical
processes present. We discuss the formulation and consequences of this approach
in the case of non-linear kinetic inductance, two-level-system loss,
quasiparticle generation, and a generic model based on a power-law form. The
generic model captures the key features of specific dissipative
non-linearities, but additionally leads to insights into how general
dissipative processes create characteristic forms in the Argand plane. We
provide detailed formulations in each case, and indicate how they lead to the
wide variety of phenomena commonly seen in experimental data. We also explain
how the properties of the underlying resonance can be extracted from this data.
Overall, our paper provides a self-contained compendium of behaviour that will
help practitioners interpret and determine important parameters from distorted
swept-frequency measurements.

it optimizes the selection of test cases given the required amount of testing
time reduction while ensuring the coverage of failures. In the second step,
selected test cases are optimally scheduled to maximize the efficiency of

  Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA'2020)",,"10.1145/3373087.3375306",,"cs.DC cs.CV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have fueled a growing
demand for DNN chips. However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1)
mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large
design space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing
elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is
needed to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition,
which would require different hardware IPs to meet the application
specifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require
cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we
propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both
FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning
frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset.
Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip
Predictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can
accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and
area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration,
technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which
can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP
selection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design
via the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to
achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip
Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when
validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC).
Furthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up
to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art
accelerators.

design and a bio-inspired sea urchin robot. The ""spines"" of the sea urchin
robot consist of fourteen telescopic actuators equally distributed over it's
spherical body. The telescopic actuation system integrates linked 3D printed
rack articulations that are locked in all axes if the pinion moves the links in
a forward direction, creating a solid and rigid rack. Thus, the robot is able
to propel and move by extending its spines. On the other hand, if the pinion
moves the rigid articulations backward, these are unlocked and can be folded in
a minimal space, enabling the bionic sea urchin robot to hide its spines inside
its constrained spherical-body and be able to roll. Simulations and experiments
are presented from both, the sea urchin robotic prototype and different scales

that lack hydrological information to build physical models. Although these
former methods can forecast river stages using only past water levels and
rainfall data, they cannot handle previously unexperienced water levels easily,
and require a large amount of data to build accurate models. Here, we focus on
phase-space reconstruction approaches, and develop a practical data-driven
forecasting method to overcome the existing problems. The proposed method can
handle the unexperienced water levels and provide forecasts using only a small
number of water rise events. We apply the method to data from actual rivers,
and it achieved the best forecast performance among existing methods, including
a physical runoff model, a data-driven multi-layer perceptron, and a
conventional method based on phase-space reconstruction. In addition, the
proposed method also forecasted the exceedance of the evacuation warning level
6 h earlier for steep rivers. Given its performance and maintainability, the
proposed method can be applied to many actual rivers for early evacuation.

material, which undergoes a transition from a low-temperature insulating phase
to a high-temperature metallic phase around a temperature of 340 K. In this
work, we study Casimir forces between a nanoplate (gold or Teflon) and a
layered structure containing a VO$_2$ film. It is found that stable Casimir
suspensions of nanoplates can be realized in a liquid environment, and the
equilibrium distances are determined, not only by the layer thicknesses but
also by the matter phases of VO$_2$. Under proper designs, a switch from
quantum trapping of the gold nanoplate (""on"" state) to its release (""off""
state) as a result of the metal-to-insulator transition of VO$_2$, is revealed.
On the other hand, the quantum trapping and release of a Teflon nanoplate is
