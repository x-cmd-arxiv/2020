allowed quantitative studies of atomic structure and minute details of
electronic and vibrational structure on the level of individual atomic units.
These microscopic descriptors in turn can be associated with the local symmetry
breaking phenomena, representing stochastic manifestation of underpinning
generative physical model. Here, we explore the reconstruction of exchange
integrals in the Hamiltonian for the lattice model with two competing
interactions from the observations of the microscopic degrees of freedom and
establish the uncertainties and reliability of such analysis in a broad
parameter-temperature space. As an ancillary task, we develop a machine
learning approach based on histogram clustering to predict phase diagrams
efficiently using a reduced descriptor space. We further demonstrate that
reconstruction is possible well above the phase transition and in the regions
of the parameter space when the macroscopic ground state of the system is
poorly defined due to frustrated interactions. This suggests that this approach
can be applied to the traditionally complex problems of condensed matter
physics such as ferroelectric relaxors and morphotropic phase boundary systems,
spin and cluster glasses, quantum systems once the local descriptors linked to
the relevant physical behaviors are known.

fitting the experimental data with a Gaussian-like magnetooptic profile taking
the structural roughness at the interface into account, we can extract the
magnetic moment of the spin-polarized layer. Comparing the obtained moments to

framework consists of two iteration steps. It first employs an RBF-based
Bayesian surrogate model to approximate the true function, where the parameters
of the RBFs can be adaptively estimated and updated each time a new point is
explored. Then it utilizes a model-guided selection criterion to identify a new
point from a candidate set for function evaluation. The selection criterion
adopted here is a sample version of the expected improvement (EI) criterion. We
conduct simulation studies with standard test functions, which show that the

to make a point of allowing time to be defined on a metric graph or network
where on the branching points coupling conditions are imposed such that time

setting and allows for more freedom in the modeling of coupled and interacting
systems of evolution equations, but it also provides a unified framework for
initial value and time-periodic problems. For these time-graph Cauchy problems
questions of well-posedness and regularity of solutions for parabolic problems
are studied along with the question of which time-graph Cauchy problems cannot

Based on two different approaches - an application of the Kalton-Weis theorem
on the sum of closed operators and an explicit computation of a Green's

further study some qualitative properties of solutions. While we mainly focus

nonrelativistic regime, which applies on large galactic scales, scalar clouds
form solitons with a finite core. Close to the center of galaxies, where a
supermassive Black Hole (BH) resides, we analyze the scalar field distribution
and the fate of the dark matter soliton when subject to the BH gravitational
attraction. We show that the scalar field profile around such a central BH can
be described by new oscillatory solutions of a modified Klein-Gordon equation,
which generalize the harmonic oscillations of free scalar dark matter in a flat
environment and the Jacobi elliptic functions of the $\phi^4$ model. Moreover,
we find that, depending on the form of the K-essence kinetic term, regular
solutions can be constructed or not, which connect the relativistic ingoing
wavelike profile of the scalar field at the BH horizon to the nearly static
nonrelativistic soliton at large distance. These profiles have a constant flux
and represent the slow infall of scalar matter into the BH. We show that this
regular behavior is only possible for K-essence functions that satisfy the
usual conditions for the absence of ghosts and gradient instabilities, together
with a new restriction on the growth of the kinetic function $K(X)$ for large

application fields, including robotics, augmented reality (AR) and 3D scanning.
They are low-cost, low-power and low-size alternatives to traditional range
sensors such as LiDAR. Moreover, unlike RGB cameras, RGB-D sensors provide the
additional depth information that removes the need of frame-by-frame
triangulation for 3D scene reconstruction. These merits have made them very
popular in mobile robotics and AR, where it is of great interest to estimate
ego-motion and 3D scene structure. Such spatial understanding can enable robots
to navigate autonomously without collisions and allow users to insert virtual
entities consistent with the image stream. In this chapter, we review common
formulations of odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (known by
its acronym SLAM) using RGB-D stream input. The two topics are closely related,
as the former aims to track the incremental camera motion with respect to a
local map of the scene, and the latter to jointly estimate the camera
trajectory and the global map with consistency. In both cases, the standard
approaches minimize a cost function using nonlinear optimization techniques.
This chapter consists of three main parts: In the first part, we introduce the
basic concept of odometry and SLAM and motivate the use of RGB-D sensors. We
also give mathematical preliminaries relevant to most odometry and SLAM
algorithms. In the second part, we detail the three main components of SLAM
systems: camera pose tracking, scene mapping and loop closing. For each
component, we describe different approaches proposed in the literature. In the
final part, we provide a brief discussion on advanced research topics with the
references to the state-of-the-art.

surface deposition and binding to only one gold electrode in a nanogap device.
Temperature dependent conductivity measurements on SCO molecule containing
electromigrated gold break junctions show voltage independent telegraphic-like
switching between two resistance states at temperature below 200 K. The
transition temperature is very different from the transition temperature of 83
K that occurs in a bulk film of the same material. This indicates that the
bulk, co-operative SCO phenomenon is no longer preserved for a single molecule
and that the surface interaction drastically increases the temperature of the
SCO phenomenon. Another key finding of this work is that some devices show
switching between multiple resistance levels. We propose that in this case, two
SCO molecules are present within the nanogap with both participating in the
electronic transport and switching.

classification in the presence of discrete binary classes. Classifier learning
in the presence of overlapping class distributions is a challenging problem in
machine learning. Overlapping classes are described by the presence of
ambiguous areas in the feature space with a high density of points belonging to
both classes. This often occurs in real-world datasets, one such example is
numeric data denoting properties of particle decays derived from high-energy
accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A significant body of
research targeting the class overlap problem use ensemble classifiers to boost
the performance of algorithms by using them iteratively in multiple stages or
using multiple copies of the same model on different subsets of the input
training data. The former is called boosting and the latter is called bagging.
The algorithm proposed in this thesis targets a challenging classification
problem in high energy physics - that of improving the statistical significance
of the Higgs discovery. The underlying dataset used to train the algorithm is
experimental data built from the official ATLAS full-detector simulation with
Higgs events (signal) mixed with different background events (background) that
closely mimic the statistical properties of the signal generating class
overlap. The algorithm proposed is a variant of the classical boosted decision
tree which is known to be one of the most successful analysis techniques in
experimental physics. The algorithm utilizes a unified framework that combines
two meta-learning techniques - bagging and boosting. The results show that this
combination only works in the presence of a randomization trick in the base
learners.

Cities (vertices) represent the collection of all firms in that location and

integration among cities in the trade network, which is consistent with the
high degree of specialization found across Brazilian cities. We are able to
identify which cities have a dominant role in the entire supply chain process
using centrality network measures. We find that the trade network has a
disassortative mixing pattern, which is consistent with the power-law shape of
the firm size distribution in Brazil. After the Brazilian recession in 2014, we
find that the disassortativity becomes even stronger as a result of the death

firms. Our results suggest that recessions have a large impact on the trade
network with meaningful and heterogeneous economic consequences across
municipalities. We run econometric exercises and find that courts efficiency

reducing contractual frictions as it increases economic transactions between

importance in the fields of biology and medicine, but particularly challenging
when imaging non-flat living samples such as the human retina. Indeed,
high-resolution is normally achieved with adaptive optics (AO) and scanning
methods, which considerably reduce the useful FOV and increase the system
complexity. An alternative technique is time-domain Full-Field Optical
Coherence Tomography (FF-OCT), which has already shown its potential for
in-vivo high-resolution retinal imaging. Here, we introduce curved-field
FF-OCT, capable of matching the coherence gate geometry to the sample
curvature, thus achieving a larger FOV than previously possible. Using this
instrument, we obtained high-resolution images of living human photoreceptors
close to the foveal center without AO and with a 1 mm x 1 mm FOV in a single
shot. This novel advance enables the extraction of photoreceptor-based
biomarkers with ease and spatiotemporal monitoring of individual
photoreceptors. We compare our findings with AO-assisted ophthalmoscopes,
highlighting the potential of FF-OCT, as a relatively simple, compact and
low-cost system, to become a routine clinical imaging technique.

  Training","Accepted for SPIE Medical Imaging 2020",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) techniques have gained rapid popularity
among surgeons since they offer significant clinical benefits including reduced
recovery time and diminished post-operative adverse effects. However,
conventional endoscopic systems output monocular video which compromises depth
perception, spatial orientation and field of view. Suturing is one of the most
complex tasks performed under these circumstances. Key components of this tasks
are the interplay between needle holder and the surgical needle. Reliable 3D
localization of needle and instruments in real time could be used to augment
the scene with additional parameters that describe their quantitative geometric
relation, e.g. the relation between the estimated needle plane and its rotation
center and the instrument. This could contribute towards standardization and
training of basic skills and operative techniques, enhance overall surgical
performance, and reduce the risk of complications. The paper proposes an
Augmented Reality environment with quantitative and qualitative visual
representations to enhance laparoscopic training outcomes performed on a
silicone pad. This is enabled by a multi-task supervised deep neural network
which performs multi-class segmentation and depth map prediction. Scarcity of
labels has been conquered by creating a virtual environment which resembles the
surgical training scenario to generate dense depth maps and segmentation maps.
The proposed convolutional neural network was tested on real surgical training
scenarios and showed to be robust to occlusion of the needle. The network
achieves a dice score of 0.67 for surgical needle segmentation, 0.81 for needle
holder instrument segmentation and a mean absolute error of 6.5 mm for depth
estimation.

with a strong Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is interesting for the
observation of magnetic phenomena at grain boundaries and interfaces. One such
material is sputter-deposited B20 FeGe on Si, which has been actively
investigated as the basis for low-power, high-density magnetic memory
technology in a scalable material platform. Although conventional Lorentz
electron microscopy provides the requisite spatial resolution to probe chiral
magnetic textures in single-crystal FeGe, probing the magnetism of sputtered
B20 FeGe is more challenging because the sub-micron crystal grains add
confounding contrast. We address the challenge of disentangling magnetic and
grain contrast by applying 4-dimensional Lorentz scanning transmission electron
microscopy using an electron microscope pixel array detector. Supported by
analytical and numerical models, we find that the most important parameter for
imaging magnetic materials with polycrystalline grains is the ability for the
detector to sustain large electron doses, where having a high-dynamic range
detector becomes extremely important. Despite the small grain size in sputtered
B20 FeGe on Si, using this approach we are still able to observe helicity
switching of skyrmions and magnetic helices across two adjacent grains as they
thread through neighboring grains. We reproduce this effect using micromagnetic
simulations by assuming that the grains have distinct orientation and magnetic
chirality and find that magnetic helicity couples to crystal chirality. Our
methodology for imaging magnetic textures is applicable to other thin-film
magnets used for spintronics and memory applications, where an understanding of
how magnetic order is accommodated in polycrystalline materials is important.

propagates distilled task information from lower to higher scales via a feature

representation, in the sense of Nakajima, of a comet-shaped quiver. We identify
these representations with rigid geometric figures, namely pairs of polygons:
one in the Lie algebra of a compact group and the other in its
complexification. To such data, we associate an explicit meromorphic Higgs

comet, thereby embedding the Nakajima quiver variety into a Hitchin system on a
punctured genus-$g$ Riemann surface (generally with positive codimension). We
show that, under certain assumptions on flag types, the space of generalized
hyperpolygons admits the structure of a completely integrable Hamiltonian
system of Gelfand-Tsetlin type, inherited from the reduction of partial flag
varieties. In the case where all flags are complete, we present the
Hamiltonians explictly. We also remark upon the discretization of the Hitchin
equations given by hyperpolygons, the construction of triple branes (in the

as an additional nuisance parameter. Using the Pantheon supernova data, a lower
bound $\ge 12\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ on the cosmic age, and a Gaussian prior $H_0 =

too young to accommodate observed old stars with age $\gtrsim

Parameterization based on the cosmic Age (PAge), which is {\it not} directly

recognizing existence, properties, and spatial relationships of entities, a
significant portion of questions pose challenges that correspond to reasoning
tasks - tasks that can only be answered through a synthesis of perception and
knowledge about the world, logic and / or reasoning. Analyzing performance
across this distinction allows us to notice when existing VQA models have
consistency issues; they answer the reasoning questions correctly but fail on
associated low-level perception questions. For example, in Figure 1, models
answer the complex reasoning question ""Is the banana ripe enough to eat?""
correctly, but fail on the associated perception question ""Are the bananas
mostly green or yellow?"" indicating that the model likely answered the
reasoning question correctly but for the wrong reason. We quantify the extent
to which this phenomenon occurs by creating a new Reasoning split of the VQA
dataset and collecting VQA-introspect, a new dataset1 which consists of 238K
new perception questions which serve as sub questions corresponding to the set
of perceptual tasks needed to effectively answer the complex reasoning
questions in the Reasoning split. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art
VQA models have comparable performance in answering perception and reasoning
questions, but suffer from consistency problems. To address this shortcoming,
we propose an approach called Sub-Question Importance-aware Network Tuning
(SQuINT), which encourages the model to attend to the same parts of the image
when answering the reasoning question and the perception sub question. We show
that SQuINT improves model consistency by ~5%, also marginally improving
performance on the Reasoning questions in VQA, while also displaying better
attention maps.

phase of solar flares, which is known as EUV late phase (ELP). Stereotypically
ELP is associated with two separated sets of flaring loops with distinct sizes,
and it has been debated whether ELP is caused by additional heating or extended
plasma cooling in the longer loop system. Here we carry out a survey of 55
M-and-above GOES-class flares with ELP during 2010--2014. Based on the
flare-ribbon morphology, these flares are categorized as circular-ribbon (19
events), two-ribbon (23 events), and complex-ribbon (13 events) flares. Among
them, 22 events (40%) are associated with coronal mass ejections, while the
rest are confined. An extreme ELP, with the late-phase peak exceeding the
main-phase peak, is found in 48% of two-ribbon flares, 37% of circular-ribbon
flares, and 31% of complex-ribbon flares, suggesting that additional heating is
more likely present during ELP in two-ribbon than in circular-ribbon flares.
Overall, cooling may be the dominant factor causing the delay of the ELP peak
relative to the main-phase peak, because the loop system responsible for the
ELP emission is generally larger than, and well separated from, that
responsible for the main-phase emission. All but one of the circular-ribbon
flares can be well explained by a composite ""dome-plate"" quasi-separatrix layer
(QSL). Only half of these show a magnetic null point, with its fan and spine
embedded in the dome and plate, respectively. The dome-plate QSL, therefore, is

problems among various domains by using reinforcement learning (RL), which
allows machines or agents to learn from interactions with environments rather
than explicit supervision. As the end of Moore's law seems to be imminent,
emerging technologies that enable high performance neuromorphic hardware
systems are attracting increasing attention. Namely, neuromorphic architectures
that leverage memristors, the programmable and nonvolatile two-terminal
devices, as synaptic weights in hardware neural networks, are candidates of
choice to realize such highly energy-efficient and complex nervous systems.
However, one of the challenges for memristive hardware with integrated learning
capabilities is prohibitively large number of write cycles that might be
required during learning process, and this situation is even exacerbated under
RL situations. In this work we propose a memristive neuromorphic hardware
implementation for the actor-critic algorithm in RL. By introducing a two-fold
training procedure (i.e., ex-situ pre-training and in-situ re-training) and
several training techniques, the number of weight updates can be significantly
reduced and thus it will be suitable for efficient in-situ learning
implementations. As a case study, we consider the task of balancing an inverted
pendulum, a classical problem in both RL and control theory. We believe that
this study shows the promise of using memristor-based hardware neural networks
for handling complex tasks through in-situ reinforcement learning.

solution for such businesses. But the increasing number of malicious attacks,
both internal and external, as well as buggy software on third-party servers is
causing clients to lose their trust in these external infrastructures. While
small enterprises cannot avoid using external infrastructures, they need the
right set of protocols to manage their data on untrusted infrastructures. In
this paper, we propose TFCommit, a novel atomic commitment protocol that
executes transactions on data stored across multiple untrusted servers. To our
knowledge, TFCommit is the first atomic commitment protocol to execute
transactions in an untrusted environment without using expensive Byzantine
replication. Using TFCommit, we propose an auditable data management system,
Fides, residing completely on untrustworthy infrastructure. As an auditable

occurring on untrusted servers using tamper-resistant logs with the support of

studied in discrete geometry and mechanics, and has applications in material
science, engineering and biological sciences. A bar-and-joint framework is a
pair $(G,p)$ of graph $G$ together with a map $p$ of the vertices of $G$ into
the Euclidean plane. We view the edges of $(G, p)$ as bars and the vertices as
universal joints. The vertices can move continuously as long as the distances
between pairs of adjacent vertices are preserved. The framework is rigid if any
such motion preserves the distances between all pairs of vertices. In 1970,
Laman obtained a combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs in the
Euclidean plane. In 1982, Lov\'asz and Yemini discovered a new characterization
and proved that every $6$-connected graph is rigid. Combined with a
characterization of global rigidity, their proof actually implies that every
6-connected graph is globally rigid. Consequently, if Fiedler's algebraic
connectivity is greater than 5, then $G$ is globally rigid. In this paper, we
improve this bound and show that for a graph $G$ with minimum degree
$\delta\geq 6$, if its algebraic connectivity is greater than
$2+\frac{1}{\delta -1}$, then $G$ is rigid and if its algebraic connectivity is
greater than $2+\frac{2}{\delta -1}$, then $G$ is globally rigid. Our results
imply that every connected regular Ramanujan graph with degree at least $8$ is
globally rigid. We also prove a more general result giving a sufficient
spectral condition for the existence of $k$ edge-disjoint spanning rigid
subgraphs. The same condition implies that a graph contains $k$ edge-disjoint
spanning $2$-connected subgraphs. This result extends previous spectral
conditions for packing edge-disjoint spanning trees.

applications in many fields. Recently, a novel notion of ""dense"" (""sparse"")
tree, and in particular spanning tree (DST and SST respectively), is introduced
as the structure that have a large (small) number of subtrees, or small (large)
sum of distances between vertices. We show that finding DST and SST reduces to
solving the discrete optimization problems. New and efficient approaches to
find such spanning trees is achieved by imposing certain conditions on the
vertex degrees which are then used to define an objective function that is
minimized over all spanning trees of the graph under consideration. Solving
this minimization problem exactly may be prohibitively time consuming for large
graphs. Hence, we propose to use genetic algorithm (GA) which is one of well
known metaheuristics methods to solve DST and SST approximately. As far as we
are aware this is the first time GA has been used in this context. We also
demonstrate on a number of applications that GA approach is well suited for
these types of problems both in computational efficiency and accuracy of the
approximate solution. Furthermore, we improve the efficiency of the proposed
method by using Kruskal's algorithm in combination with GA.
  The application of our methods to several practical large graphs and networks
is presented. Computational results show that they perform faster than
previously proposed heuristic methods and produce more accurate solutions.
Furthermore, the new feature of the proposed approach is that it can be applied
recursively to sub-trees or spanning trees with additional constraints in order
to further investigate the graphical properties of the graph and/or network.
The application of this methodology on the gene network of a cancer cell led to
isolating key genes in a network that were not obvious from previous studies.

fitting with resorting to a few weakly annotated (WA) data points, which has
been sparsely studied so far. In weak annotating, most of the manual
annotations are supposed to be correct yet inevitably mixed with incorrect
ones. The WA data can be naturally obtained in an interactive way for specific
tasks, for example, in the case of homography estimation, one can easily
annotate points on the same plane/object with a single label by observing the
image. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method to make full use of the WA
data to boost the multi-model fitting performance. Specifically, a graph for
model proposal sampling is first constructed using the WA data, given the prior
that the WA data annotated with the same weak label has a high probability of
being assigned to the same model. By incorporating this prior knowledge into
the calculation of edge probabilities, vertices (i.e., data points) lie on/near
the latent model are likely to connect together and further form a
subset/cluster for effective proposals generation. With the proposals
generated, the $\alpha$-expansion is adopted for labeling, and our method in

transformation which is biorthogonal to the discrete Fourier transform of the

within the frequency domain. We show that the difference between the Gaussian

to define two new frequency domain quasi-likelihoods criteria. We show that
these new criteria can yield a better approximation of the spectral divergence

Most existing learning-based dehazing methods are not fully end-to-end, which
still follow the traditional dehazing procedure: first estimate the medium
transmission and the atmospheric light, then recover the haze-free image based
on the atmospheric scattering model. However, in practice, due to lack of
priors and constraints, it is hard to precisely estimate these intermediate
parameters. Inaccurate estimation further degrades the performance of dehazing,
resulting in artifacts, color distortion and insufficient haze removal. To
address this, we propose a fully end-to-end Generative Adversarial Networks
with Fusion-discriminator (FD-GAN) for image dehazing. With the proposed
Fusion-discriminator which takes frequency information as additional priors,
our model can generator more natural and realistic dehazed images with less

the other region is located further south and is less disturbed by the massive
star clusters. We found that the region at the center of the nebula is forming
less but more massive cores than the region located in the south, suggesting
that the level of stellar feedback effectively influence the fragmentation
process in clumps. Lines such as HCN, HCO$^{+}$ and SiO show abundant and
complex gas distributions in both regions, confirming the presence of
ionization and shock fronts. Jeans analysis suggests that the observed core
masses in the region less affected by the massive stars are consistent with
thermal fragmentation, but turbulent Jeans fragmentation might explain the high
masses of the cores identified in the region in the center of Carina.
Consistently, two different analyses in the HCO$^{+}$ line provided evidence
for a higher level of turbulence in the gas more affected by the stellar
feedback. The gas column density probability functions, N-PDFs, show log-normal

explore some of the key characteristics of the single kink both in its standing
wave and in its traveling wave form. A point of emphasis is the study of
kink-antikink collisions, exploring the critical velocity for single-bounce
(and separation) and infinite-bounce (where the kink and antikink trap each
other) windows. The relevant phenomenology turns out to be dramatically
different than that of the corresponding nonlinear Klein-Gordon (i.e.,
$\phi^4$) model. Our computations show that for small initial velocities, the
kink and antikink reflect nearly elastically without colliding. For an
intermediate interval of velocities, the two waves trap each other, while for
large speeds a single inelastic collision between them takes place. Lastly, we
briefly touch upon the use of collective coordinates (CC) method and their
predictions of the relevant phenomenology. When one degree of freedom is used
in the CC approach, the results match well the numerical ones for small values
of initial velocity. However, for bigger values of initial velocity, it is
inferred that more degrees of freedom need to be self-consistently included in

non-typical multidimensional mechanism design problems and agents' social

incentive-compatibility (IC) means it is best for every agent to honestly

SO2, as well as warm gas (~50K) traced by CH3OH, SO2, 34SO, OCS, CH3CN lines. A
comparison of molecular abundances between LMC and Galactic hot cores suggests
that organic molecules (e.g., CH3OH, a classical hot core tracer) show a large

into an organic-poor hot core. Our astrochemical simulations suggest that
different grain temperature during the initial ice-forming stage would

scales with the LMC's metallicity. Nitrogen-bearing molecules are generally

chemical compositions of hot cores do not always simply scale with the

practical abilities of logistic regression. In this study, we show that

the PWL model with RNA-seq data to predict PAM50 intrinsic subtypes and applied
it to the 41/50 genes of PAM50 through the subtype prediction task. Second, we
developed a deep enrichment analysis method to reveal the relationships between
the PAM50 subtypes and the copy numbers of breast cancer. Our findings showed
that the PWL model utilized genes relevant to the cell cycle-related pathways.

anisotropy from the change in magnetic geometry caused by an
anisotropy-modified current profile. The remappings iterate the
anisotropy-modified current profile to produce the same $q$ profile with
matched thermal energy. The analysis is a step toward equilibria that are
kinetically self-consistent for a prescribed scenario. We find characteristic
detachment of flux surfaces from pressure surfaces, and an outboard (inboard)
shift of peak density for $T_{\parallel}>T_\perp$ ( $T_{\parallel}<T_\perp$).
Differences in the poloidal current profile are evident, albeit not as
pronounced as for the spherical tokamak. We find that the incompressional
continuum is largely unchanged in the presence of anisotropy, and the mode
structure of gap modes is largely unchanged. The compressional branch however
exhibits significant differences in the continuum. We report on the implication

splits into two components (namely AzTEC2-A and AzTEC2-B) for which we detect
[C$\,$II] and $^{12}$CO(5$\to$4) line emission, implying a redshift of
$4.626\pm0.001$ ($4.633\pm0.001$) for AzTEC2-A (AzTEC2-B) and ruling out

With the infrared-derived star formation rate of AzTEC2-A ($1920\pm100

they both will consume their current gas reservoir within $(30-200)\,$Myr. We

elevated gas accretion rate from the cosmic web might be the main driver of the
intense levels of star formation in AzTEC2-A, which might be further enhanced
by gravitational torques induced by its minor companion (AzTEC2-B). These
results strengthen the picture whereby the population of single-dish selected

monotone line search (SCP$_{ls}$) in [46] for a class of difference-of-convex
(DC) optimization problems with multiple smooth inequality constraints. The
SCP$_{ls}$ is a representative variant of moving-ball-approximation-type
algorithms [6,10,13,54] for constrained optimization problems. We analyze the
convergence rate of the sequence generated by SCP$_{ls}$ in both nonconvex and
convex settings by imposing suitable Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) assumptions.
Specifically, in the nonconvex settings, we assume that a special potential
function related to the objective and the constraints is a KL function, while
in the convex settings we impose KL assumptions directly on the extended
objective function (i.e., sum of the objective and the indicator function of
the constraint set). A relationship between these two different KL assumptions
is established in the convex settings under additional differentiability
assumptions. We also discuss how to deduce the KL exponent of the extended
objective function from its Lagrangian in the convex settings, under additional
assumptions on the constraint functions. Thanks to this result, the extended
objectives of some constrained optimization models such as minimizing $\ell_1$
subject to logistic/Poisson loss are found to be KL functions with exponent
$\frac12$ under mild assumptions. To illustrate how our results can be applied,
we consider SCP$_{ls}$ for minimizing $\ell_{1-2}$ [60] subject to residual
error measured by $\ell_2$ norm/Lorentzian norm [21]. We first discuss how the
various conditions required in our analysis can be verified, and then perform

long-standing problem since 1970s. This paper will show that an irregular LQ
control (deterministic) is solvable (for arbitrary initial value) if and only
if the LQ cost can be rewritten as a regular one by changing the terminal cost
$x'(T)Hx(T)$ to $x'(T)[H+P_1(T)]x(T)$, while the optimal controller can achieve
$P_1(T)x(T)=0$ at the same time. In other words, the irregular controller (if
exists) needs to do two things at the same time, one thing is to minimize the
cost and the other is to achieve the terminal constraint $P_1(T)x(T)=0$, which
clarifies the essential difference of irregular LQ from the standard LQ control
where the controller is to minimize the cost only.

classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) approach provides the framework for a

sealed bid auction mechanisms for spectrum allocation which are computationally
tractable and hence applicable for allocating spectrum by performing auctions
in short durations as per the dynamic load variations of the network. We
establish that the proposed algorithm is strategy-proof for uniform demand.
Furthermore, for non-uniform demand we propose an algorithm that satisfies weak

also establish finite-time convergence based on our approach. Finally, we
develop a variant of our algorithm that is provably robust to worst-case
adversarial attacks, provided the sequence of graphs is sufficiently connected
over time. The key to our approach is the notion of a ""freshness-index"" that
keeps track of the age-of-information being diffused across the network. Such

equatorial oscillation of stratospheric temperature, reminiscent of the Earth's
Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO), as well as anomalously high temperatures
under Saturn's rings. To better understand these predominant features of
Saturn's atmospheric circulation in the stratosphere, we have extended towards
higher altitudes the DYNAMICO-Saturn global climate model (GCM), already used
in a previous publication to study the tropospheric dynamics, jets formation
and planetary-scale waves activity. Firstly, we study the higher model top
impact on the tropospheric zonal jets and kinetic energy distribution. Raising
the model top prevents energy and enstrophy accumulation at tropopause levels.
The reference GCM simulation with 1/2$^{\circ}$ latitude/longitude resolution
and a raised model top exhibits a QBO-like oscillation produced by resolved
planetary-scale waves. However, the period is more irregular and the downward
propagation faster than observations. Furthermore, compared to the CIRS
observation retrievals, the modeled QBO-like oscillation underestimates by half
both the amplitude of temperature anomalies at the equator and the vertical
characteristic length of this equatorial oscillation. This QBO-like oscillation
is mainly driven by westward-propagating waves; a significant lack of eastward
wave-forcing explains a fluctuating eastward phase of the QBO-like oscillation.
At 20$^{\circ}$N and 20$^{\circ}$S latitudes, the DYNAMICO-Saturn GCM exhibits
several strong seasonal eastward jets, alternatively in the northern and
southern hemisphere. These jets are correlated with the rings' shadowing. Using
a GCM simulation without rings' shadowing, we show its impact on Saturn's
stratospheric dynamics. Both residual-mean circulation and eddy forcing are
impacted by rings' shadowing.

magneto-optical phenomena that is unique to the two-dimensional (2D) limit.
Here, we report the direct observation of 2D magnons through magneto-Raman
spectroscopy with optical selection rules that are strictly determined by the
honeycomb lattice and magnetic states of atomically thin CrI$_3$. In
monolayers, we observe an acoustic magnon mode of ~0.3 meV with
cross-circularly polarized selection rules locked to the magnetization
direction. These unique selection rules arise from the discrete conservation of
angular momentum of photons and magnons dictated by threefold rotational
symmetry in a rotational analogue to Umklapp scattering. In bilayers, by tuning
between the layered antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic-like states, we observe
the switching of two magnon modes. The bilayer structure also enables Raman
activity from the optical magnon mode at ~17 meV (~4.2 THz) that is otherwise
Raman-silent in the monolayer. From these measurements, we quantitatively
extract the spin wave gap, magnetic anisotropy, intralayer and interlayer

crucial step, due to the tensorial nature of the intermediate representations

Although traditional automated event detection techniques generally are
successful in detecting events from continuous data, its detection success is
challenged in cases of lower signal-to-noise ratios. The data stream coming
from these networks has initiated specific interest in neural networks for
automated classification and interpretation. Here, we explore the feasibility
of neural networks in detecting the occurrence of seismic events. For this
purpose, a three-layered feedforward neural network was trained using public
data of a seismic event in the GGF obtained from the Royal Netherlands
Meteorological Institute (KNMI) data portal. The first arrival times and
duration of earthquake waveforms determined by KNMI for a subset of the station
data, were used to detect the arrival times and event duration for the other
uninterpreted station data. Subsequently various attributes were used as input
for the neural network, that were based on different short term averaging/long
term averaging (STA/LTA) and frequency sub-band settings. Using these input
data, the network's parameters were iteratively improved to maximize its
capability in successfully discriminating seismic events from noise and
determine the event duration. Results show an increase of 65 % in accurately
detecting seismic events and determining their duration as compared to the
reference method. This clears the way for improved interpretation of signal
waveforms and automated seismic event classification in the Groningen area.

shape models and compute the volumes for 13 main belt asteroids that were
selected from those targets for which Gaia will provide the mass with an
accuracy of better than 10%. We used the genetic Shaping Asteroids with Genetic
Evolution (SAGE) algorithm to fit disk-integrated, dense photometric
lightcurves and obtain detailed asteroid shape models. These models were scaled
by fitting them to available stellar occultation and/or thermal infrared
observations. We determine the spin and shape models for 13 main belt asteroids
using the SAGE algorithm. Occultation fitting enables us to confirm main shape
features and the spin state, while thermophysical modeling leads to more
precise diameters as well as estimates of thermal inertia values. We calculated
the volume of our sample of main-belt asteroids for which the Gaia satellite
will provide precise mass determinations. From our volumes, it will then be
possible to more accurately compute the bulk density, which is a fundamental

using a sequence of i.i.d. random mutation probabilities. For any distribution
of the sequence, the weak convergence of fitness distributions to the globally

magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) numerical simulations, the fast collisional magnetic
reconnection regime that is supported by the formation of plasmoid chains when
the Lundquist number $S$ exceeds a critical value (at magnetic Prandtl number,
$P_m = 1$). A recently developed characteristic-Galerkin finite-element code,
FINMHD, that is specifically designed for this aim in a reduced visco-resistive
MHD framework, is employed. Contrary to previous studies, a different initial
setup of two repelling current channels is chosen in order to form two
quasi-singular current layers on an Alfv\'enic time scale as a consequence of
the tilt instability. If $S < 5 \times 10^3$, a subsequent stationary
reconnection process is obtained with a rate scaling as $S^{-1/2}$ as predicted
by the classical Sweet-Parker model. Otherwise, a stochastic time-dependent
reconnection regime occurs, with a fast time-averaged rate independent of $S$
and having a normalized value of $0.014$. The latter regime is triggered by the
formation of two chains of plasmoids disrupting the current sheets with a
sudden super-Alfv\'enic growth following a quiescent phase, in agreement with
the general theory of the plasmoid instability proposed by Comisso et al.
[Phys. Plasmas 23, 100702 (2016)]. Moreover, the non-monotonic dependence of
the plasmoid growth rate with $S$ following an asymptotically decreasing
logarithmic law in the infinite $S$-limit is confirmed. We also closely compare
our results to those obtained during the development of the coalescence
instability setup in order to assess the generality of the mechanism. Finally,
we briefly discuss the relevance of our results to explain the flaring activity

of bars in galaxies with significant gas content focusing on the phenomenon of
the buckling instability. The galaxies are initially composed of a spherical
dark matter halo and only stellar, or stellar and gaseous, disks with
parameters that are similar to the Milky Way and are evolved for 10 Gyr. We
consider different values of the gas fraction $f =0-0.3$ and in order to
isolate the effect of the gas, we kept the fraction constant during the
evolution by not allowing the gas to cool and form stars. The stellar bars that
form in simulations with higher gas fractions are weaker and shorter, and they
do not form at all for gas fractions that are higher than 0.3. The bar with a
gas fraction of 0.1 forms sooner due to initial perturbations in the gas, but
despite the longer evolution, it does not become stronger than the one in the
collisionless case at the end of evolution. The bars in the gas component are
weaker; they reach their maximum strength around 4 Gyr and later decline to
transform into spheroidal shapes. The distortion of the stellar bar during the
buckling instability is weaker for higher gas fractions and weakens the bar
less significantly, but it has a similar structure both in terms of radial
profiles and in face-on projections. For $f=0.2,$ the first buckling lasts
significantly longer and the bar does not undergo the secondary buckling event,
while for $f=0.3,$ the buckling does not occur. Despite these differences, all
bars develop boxy/peanut shapes in the stellar and gas component by the end of
the evolution, although their thickness is smaller for higher gas fractions.

Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), are together the most widely
used tools of discrete choice. The MNL model serves as the workhorse model for
a variety of fields, but is also widely criticized, with a large body of
experimental literature claiming to document real-world settings where IIA
fails to hold. Statistical tests of IIA as a modelling assumption have been the
subject of many practical tests focusing on specific deviations from IIA over
the past several decades, but the formal size properties of hypothesis testing
IIA are still not well understood. In this work we replace some of the
ambiguity in this literature with rigorous pessimism, demonstrating that any
general test for IIA with low worst-case error would require a number of
samples exponential in the number of alternatives of the choice problem. A
major benefit of our analysis over previous work is that it lies entirely in
the finite-sample domain, a feature crucial to understanding the behavior of
tests in the common data-poor settings of discrete choice. Our lower bounds are
structure-dependent, and as a potential cause for optimism, we find that if one
restricts the test of IIA to violations that can occur in a specific collection
of choice sets (e.g., pairs), one obtains structure-dependent lower bounds that
are much less pessimistic. Our analysis of this testing problem is unorthodox
in being highly combinatorial, counting Eulerian orientations of cycle
decompositions of a particular bipartite graph constructed from a data set of
choices. By identifying fundamental relationships between the comparison
structure of a given testing problem and its sample efficiency, we hope these
relationships will help lay the groundwork for a rigorous rethinking of the IIA
testing problem as well as other testing problems in discrete choice.

The repulsive Hubbard model on the Penrose lattice is studied as an example, on

phase diagram is obtained. Two remarkable properties of these pairing states
are revealed, due to the combination of the presence of the point-group
symmetry and the lack of translation symmetry on this lattice. Firstly, the
spin and spacial angular momenta of a Cooper pair is de-correlated: for each
pairing symmetry, both spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairings are possible even
in the weak-pairing limit. Secondly, the pairing states belonging to the 2D
irreducible representations of the $D_5$ point group can be
time-reversal-symmetry-breaking topological SCs carrying spontaneous bulk super
current and spontaneous vortices. These two remarkable properties are general
for the SCs on all QCs, and are rare on periodic lattices. Our work starts the

hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, implementing accelerator VM efficiently
is challenging because the area and power constraints make it difficult to
employ the large multi-level TLBs used in general-purpose CPUs. Recent research
proposals advocate a number of restrictions on virtual-to-physical address
mappings in order to reduce the TLB size or increase its reach. However, such
restrictions are unattractive because they forgo many of the original benefits
of traditional VM, such as demand paging and copy-on-write.
  We propose SPARTA, a divide and conquer approach to address translation.
SPARTA splits the address translation into accelerator-side and memory-side
parts. The accelerator-side translation hardware consists of a tiny TLB
covering only the accelerator's cache hierarchy (if any), while the translation
for main memory accesses is performed by shared memory-side TLBs. Performing
the translation for memory accesses on the memory side allows SPARTA to overlap
data fetch with translation, and avoids the replication of TLB entries for data
shared among accelerators. To further improve the performance and efficiency of
the memory-side translation, SPARTA logically partitions the memory space,
delegating translation to small and efficient per-partition translation
hardware. Our evaluation on index-traversal accelerators shows that SPARTA
virtually eliminates translation overhead, reducing it by over 30x on average
(up to 47x) and improving performance by 57%. At the same time, SPARTA requires
minimal accelerator-side translation hardware, reduces the total number of TLB
entries in the system, gracefully scales with memory size, and preserves all
key VM functionalities.

downconversion (SPDC) interaction Hamiltonian possess tripartite entanglement
of a different nature to other paradigmatic three-mode entangled states
generated by the combination of two-mode SPDCs interactions. While two-mode
SPDC generates gaussian states whose entanglement can be characterized by
standard criteria based on two-mode quantum correlations, these criteria fail
to capture the entanglement generated by three-mode SPDC. We use criteria built
from three-mode correlation functions to show that the class of states recently
generated in a superconducting-circuit implementation of three-mode SPDC
ideally have tripartite entanglement, contrary to recent claims in the
literature. These criteria are suitable for triple SPDC but we show that they
fail to detect tripartite entanglement in other states which are known to
possess it, which illustrates the existence of two fundamentally different
notions of tripartite entanglement in three-mode continuous variable systems.

process in an attack-prone environment. Recent attempts to solve this problem
impose stringent redundancy requirements on the measurement and communication
resources of the network. In this paper, we take a step towards alleviating
such strict requirements by exploring two complementary directions: (i) making
a small subset of the nodes immune to attacks, or ""trusted"", and (ii)
incorporating diversity into the network. We define graph-theoretic constructs
that formally capture the notions of redundancy, diversity, and trust. Based on
these constructs, we develop a resilient estimation algorithm and demonstrate
that even relatively sparse networks that either exhibit node-diversity, or
contain a small subset of trusted nodes, can be just as resilient to
adversarial attacks as more dense networks. Finally, given a finite budget for
network design, we focus on characterizing the complexity of (i) selecting a
set of trusted nodes, and (ii) allocating diversity, so as to achieve a desired
level of robustness. We establish that, unfortunately, each of these problems
is NP-complete.

The effective fluctuation process is found to vary, depending on whether
$\delta \searrow 0$ faster than/at the same rate as/slower than $\varepsilon

$\delta,\varepsilon$ are comparable in size; here, the limiting stochastic

the fast sampling. In this regime, our results yield a time-inhomogeneous
Markov process which provides a strong (pathwise) approximation of the original

multiple isotonic regression model. Recently, [HZ19] obtained a pointwise limit
distribution theory for the so-called block max-min and min-max estimators
[FLN17] in this model, but inference remains a difficult problem due to the
nuisance parameter in the limit distribution that involves multiple unknown
partial derivatives of the true regression function.
  In this paper, we show that this difficult nuisance parameter can be
effectively eliminated by taking advantage of information beyond point
estimates in the block max-min and min-max estimators. Formally, let
$\hat{u}(x_0)$ (resp. $\hat{v}(x_0)$) be the maximizing lower-left (resp.
minimizing upper-right) vertex in the block max-min (resp. min-max) estimator,
and $\hat{f}_n$ be the average of the block max-min and min-max estimators. If
all (first-order) partial derivatives of $f_0$ are non-vanishing at $x_0$, then
the following pivotal limit distribution theory holds: $$
\sqrt{n_{\hat{u},\hat{v}}(x_0)}\big(\hat{f}_n(x_0)-f_0(x_0)\big)\rightsquigarrow
\sigma\cdot \mathbb{L}_{1_d}. $$ Here $n_{\hat{u},\hat{v}}(x_0)$ is the number
of design points in the block $[\hat{u}(x_0),\hat{v}(x_0)]$, $\sigma$ is the
standard deviation of the errors, and $\mathbb{L}_{1_d}$ is a universal limit
distribution free of nuisance parameters. This immediately yields confidence
intervals for $f_0(x_0)$ with asymptotically exact confidence level and oracle
length. Notably, the construction of the confidence intervals, even new in the
univariate setting, requires no more efforts than performing an isotonic
regression for once using the block max-min and min-max estimators, and can be
easily adapted to other common monotone models. Extensive simulations are
carried out to support our theory.

between the two ends of a thermoelectric material in order to ensure continuous

there are two main low thermal conductivity mechanisms: the phonon anharmonic
in PbTe and SnSe and phonon scattering resulting from the dynamic disorder in
AgCrSe2 and CuCrSe2, which have been successfully revealed by inelastic neutron
scattering. Using neutron scattering and ab initio calculations, we report here
a mechanism of static local structure distortion combined with
phonon-anharmonic-induced ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in
{\alpha}-MgAgSb. Since the transverse acoustic phonons are almost fully
scattered by the compound's intrinsic distorted rocksalt sublattice, the heat
is mainly transported by the longitudinal acoustic phonons. The ultralow
thermal conductivity in {\alpha}-MgAgSb is attributed to its atomic dynamics
being altered by the structure distortion, which presents a possible
microscopic route to enhance the performance of similar thermoelectric

all domains such as economics, medicine or engineering. In Operation Research
literature, this task has been addressed based on multi-objective optimization
algorithms. However, without learning models for PF, these methods cannot
examine whether a new provided point locates on PF or not. In this paper, we
reconsider the task from Data Mining perspective. A novel projection based
active Gaussian process regression (P- aGPR) method is proposed for efficient
PF modeling. First, P- aGPR chooses a series of projection spaces with
dimensionalities ranking from low to high. Next, in each projection space, a
Gaussian process regression (GPR) model is trained to represent the constraint
that PF should satisfy in that space. Moreover, in order to improve modeling
efficacy and stability, an active learning framework has been developed by
exploiting the uncertainty information obtained in the GPR models. Different
from all existing methods, our proposed P-aGPR method can not only provide a
generative PF model, but also fast examine whether a provided point locates on
PF or not. The numerical results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art
passive learning methods the proposed P-aGPR method can achieve higher modeling
accuracy and stability.

symmetry of general relativity (GR). GR is formulated in generalized reference
frames, which are represented by (anholonomic in general case) affine frame
fields. The general principle of relativity is extended to the requirement of
invariance of the theory with respect to transitions between generalized
reference frames, that is, with respect to the group $GL^g$ of local linear
transformations of affine frame fields. GR is interpreted as the gauge theory
of the gauge group of translations $T^g_M$, and therefore is invariant under
the space-time diffeomorphisms. The groups $GL^g$ and $T^g_M$ are united into
group $S^g_M$, which is their semidirect product and is the complete symmetry
group of the general relativity in an affine frame (GRAF).
  The consequence of $GL^g$-invariance of GRAF is the Palatini equation, which
in the absence of torsion goes into the metricity condition, and vice versa,
that is, is fulfilled identically in the Riemannian space. The consequence of
the $T^g_M$-invariance of GRAF is representation of the Einstein equation in
the superpotential form, that is, in the form of dynamic Maxwell equations (or
Young-Mills equations). Deformation of the group $S^g_M$ leads to
renormalisation of energy-momentum of the gravitation field. At the end we show
that by limiting admissible reference frames (by $GL^g$-gauge fixing) from
GRAF, in addition to Einstein gravity, one can obtain other local equivalent
formulations of GR: general relativity in an orthonormal frame or teleparallel
equivalent of general relativity, dilaton gravity, unimodular gravity, etc.

processing. In edge partitioning, the edge set of a given graph is split into
$k$ equally-sized partitions, such that the replication of vertices across
partitions is minimized. Streaming is a viable approach to partition graphs
that exceed the memory capacities of a single server. The graph is ingested as
a stream of edges, and one edge at a time is immediately and irrevocably
assigned to a partition based on a scoring function. However, streaming
partitioning suffers from the uninformed assignment problem: At the time of
partitioning early edges in the stream, there is no information available about
the rest of the edges. As a consequence, edge assignments are often driven by
balancing considerations, and the achieved replication factor is comparably
high. In this paper, we propose 2PS, a novel two-phase streaming algorithm for
high-quality edge partitioning. In the first phase, vertices are separated into
clusters by a lightweight streaming clustering algorithm. In the second phase,
the graph is re-streamed and edge partitioning is performed while taking into
account the clustering of the vertices from the first phase. Our evaluations
show that 2PS can achieve a replication factor that is comparable to
heavy-weight random access partitioners while inducing orders of magnitude

Town, South Africa). The AFRODITE array equipped with 8 Compton suppressed HPGe
clover detectors was used to record $\gamma$-ray data. For known, intense
$\gamma$-ray lines the previously reported experimental data measured up to
$E_{p}\simeq$ $25$ MeV at the Washington and Orsay tandem accelerators were
extended to higher proton energies. Our experimental data for the last 3
targets are reported here and discussed with respect to previous data and the
Murphy \textit{et al.} compilation [ApJS 183, 142 (2009)], as well as to
predictions of the nuclear reaction code TALYS. The overall agreement between
theory and experiment obtained in first-approach calculations using default
input parameters of TALYS has been appreciably improved by using modified
optical model potential (OMP), deformation, and level density parameters. The
OMP parameters have been extracted from theoretical fits to available
experimental elastic/inelastic nucleon scattering angular distribution data by
means of the coupled-channels reaction code OPTMAN. Experimental data for
several new $\gamma$-ray lines are also reported and discussed. The
astrophysical implications of our results are emphasised.

during the past few years, and the two most prominent approaches are sparse
representation based classification (SRC) and collaborative representation
based classification (CRC). CRC reveals that it is the collaborative
representation rather than the sparsity that makes SRC successful.
Nevertheless, the dense representation of CRC may not be discriminative which
will degrade its performance for classification tasks. To alleviate this
problem to some extent, we propose a new method called sparse and
collaborative-competitive representation based classification (SCCRC) for image
classification. Firstly, the coefficients of the test sample are obtained by
SRC and CCRC, respectively. Then the fused coefficient is derived by
multiplying the coefficients of SRC and CCRC. Finally, the test sample is
designated to the class that has the minimum residual. Experimental results on
several benchmark databases demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed SCCRC. The
source code of SCCRC is accessible at https://github.com/li-zi-qi/SCCRC.

from academia, industry, and governments all around the world. It is considered
a technological breakthrough anticipated to disrupt several application
domains. This has resulted in a plethora of blockchain systems for various
purposes. However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious
shortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be
addressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component
of any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many
ways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the
limitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel
consensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these
algorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain
performs the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus
algorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on
the properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain
consensus algorithms in terms of their scopes. This article fills this gap by
analysing a wide range of consensus algorithms using a comprehensive taxonomy
of properties and by examining the implications of different issues still
prevalent in consensus algorithms in detail. The result of the analysis is
presented in tabular formats, which provides a visual illustration of these
algorithms in a meaningful way. We have also analysed more than hundred top
crypto-currencies belonging to different categories of consensus algorithms to
understand their properties and to implicate different trends in these
crypto-currencies. Finally, we have presented a decision tree of algorithms to
be used as a tool to test the suitability of consensus algorithms under
different criteria.

adaptive receptive field to solve these two challenges. For the illumination
variation, the bilinear attention module can capture second-order statistics to
encode global contexts and semantic dependencies between local pixels. With
them, semantic features in challenging areas can be inferred from their
neighbors and the distinction of various semantics can be boosted. For the
scale variation, our adaptive receptive field module aggregates multi-scale
features and automatically fuses them with different weights. Specifically, it
encodes the semantic relationship between channels to emphasize feature maps
with appropriate scales, changing the receptive field of subsequent
convolutions. The proposed network achieves the best performance 97.47% mean

stabilizer in a group of $n \times n$ matrices over a polynomial ring or a
Laurent polynomial ring of $n$ variables is presented. The stabilizer is
described as an extension of a subgroup of a rather simple structure using the
$(n-1) \times (n-1)$ matrix group of congruence type over the corresponding
ring of $n-1$ variables. In this paper, we consider cases where $n \leq 3.$ For
$n = 2$, the stabilizer is defined as a one-parameter subgroup, and the proof
is carried out by direct calculation. The case $n = 3$ is nontrivial; the
approach mentioned above is applied to it. Corollaries are given to the results
obtained. In particular, we prove that for the stabilizer in the question, it
is not generated by its a finite subset together with the so-called tame
stabilizer of the given column. We are going to study the cases when $n \geq 4$
in a forthcoming paper. Note that a number of key subgroups of the groups of
automorphisms of groups are defined as column stabilizers in matrix groups. For
example, this describes the subgroup IAut($M_r$) of automorphisms that are
identical modulo a commutant of a free metabelian group $M_r$ of rank $r$. This
approach demonstrates the parallelism of theories of groups of automorphisms of
groups and matrix groups that exists for a number of well-known groups. This
allows us to use the results on matrix groups to describe automorphism groups.
In this work, the classical theorems of Suslin, Cohn, as well as Bachmuth and

in the current contribution. In an energy-based setting, dielectric
displacement and strain (or displacement) are the primary independent unknowns.
As an internal variable, the remanent polarization vector is chosen. The model
is then governed by two constitutive functions: the free energy function and
the dissipation function. Choices for both functions are given. As the
dissipation function for rate-independent response is non-differentiable, it is
proposed to regularize the problem. Then, a variational equation can be posed,
which is subsequently discretized using conforming finite elements for each
quantity. We point out which kind of continuity is needed for each field
(displacement, dielectric displacement and remanent polarization) is necessary
to obtain a conforming method, and provide corresponding finite elements. The
elements are chosen such that Gauss' law of zero charges is satisfied exactly.
The discretized variational equations are solved for all unknowns at once in a

stars that are stripped of their hydrogen and helium envelopes sometime before
collapse. SNe Ic present a range of luminosities and spectral properties, from
luminous GRB-SNe with broad-lined spectra to less luminous events with
narrow-line spectra. Modelling SNe\,Ic reveals a wide range of both kinetic
energies, ejecta masses, and $^{56}\text{Ni}$ masses. To explore this diversity
and how it comes about, light curves and spectra are computed from the ejecta
following the explosion of an initially 22 $\text{M}_{\odot}$ progenitor that
was artificially stripped of its hydrogen and helium shells, producing a bare
CO core of $\sim$ 5 $\text{M}_{\odot}$, resulting in an ejected mass of $\sim$
4 $\text{M}_{\odot}$, which is an average value for SNe Ic. Four different
explosion energies are used that cover a range of observed SNe. Finally,
$^{56}\text{Ni}$ and other elements are artificially mixed in the ejecta using
two approximations to determine how element distribution affects light curves
and spectra. The combination of different explosion energy and degree of mixing
produces spectra that roughly replicate the distribution of near-peak
spectroscopic features of SNe Ic. High explosion energies combined with
extensive mixing can produce red, broad-lined spectra, while minimal mixing and
a lower explosion energy produce bluer, narrow-lined spectra.

We first establish the close connection between the resolution and the material

characterization of the spectral structure of the integral operator for a
general bounded domain and derive the pole-pencil decomposition of its

descriptive accuracy at the sacrifice of prediction accuracy. To address these
issues, we propose a hybrid interpretable model that combines a piecewise

explicit feature contributions by piecewise linear approximation to increase
the expressiveness of the model. The other component uses a multi-layer
perceptron to capture feature interactions and implicit nonlinearity, and
increase the prediction performance. Different from the post-hoc approaches,
the interpretability is obtained once the model is learned in the form of
feature shapes. We also provide a variant to explore higher-order interactions

understand the magnitude of the impact induced heating and the initially stored
thermal energy of the accreting Moonlets. The main objective of the present
study is to understand the nature of processes leading to core-mantle
differentiation and the production and cooling of the initial convective magma
ocean. The accretion of Moon was commenced over a timescale of 100 years after
the giant impact event around 30-100 million years in the early solar system.
We studied the dependence of the planetary processes on the impact scenarios,
the initial average temperature of the accreting moonlets and the size of the
protoMoon that accreted rapidly beyond the Roche limit within the initial one
year after the giant impact. The simulations indicate that the accreting
Moonlets should have a minimum initial averaged temperature around 1600 K. The
impacts would provide additional thermal energy. The initial thermal state of
the moonlets depends upon the environment prevailing within the Roche limit
that experienced episodes of extensive vaporization and re-condensation of
silicates. The initial convective magma ocean of depth more than 1000 km is
produced in the majority of simulations along with the global core-mantle
differentiation in case the melt percolation of the molten metal through porous
flow from bulk silicates was not the major mode of core-mantle differentiation.
The possibility of shallow magma oceans cannot be ruled out in the presence of
the porous flow. Our simulations indicate the core-mantle differentiation

key role in such analyses and facilitates feature selection and feature
extraction. Randomized algorithms are efficient tools for handling big data

computational complexity of deterministic algorithms and the communication
among different levels of the memory hierarchy, which is the main bottleneck in
modern computing environments and architectures. In this paper, we review
recent advances in randomization for the computation of Tucker decomposition
and Higher Order SVD (HOSVD). We discuss random projection and sampling
approaches, single-pass, and multi-pass randomized algorithms, and how to
utilize them in the computation of the Tucker decomposition and the HOSVD.

automate financial and business transactions. However, many bugs and
vulnerabilities have been identified in many contracts which raises serious
concerns about smart contract security, not to mention that the blockchain
systems on which the smart contracts are built can be buggy. Thus, there is a
significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high
reliability. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to learn
characteristics of smart contracts in Solidity, which is useful for clone
detection, bug detection and contract validation on smart contracts. Our new
approach is based on word embeddings and vector space comparison. We parse
smart contract code into word streams with code structural information, convert
code elements (e.g., statements, functions) into numerical vectors that are
supposed to encode the code syntax and semantics, and compare the similarities
among the vectors encoding code and known bugs, to identify potential issues.
We have implemented the approach in a prototype, named SmartEmbed. Results show
that our tool can effectively identify many repetitive instances of Solidity
code, where the clone ratio is around 90\%. Code clones such as type-III or
even type-IV semantic clones can also be detected accurately. Our tool can
identify more than 1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases
efficiently and accurately. Our tool can also help to efficiently validate any
given smart contract against a known set of bugs, which can help to improve the
users' confidence in the reliability of the contract.

control is much sought-after due to the scientific and technological
opportunities it unlocks. For magnetic materials, chiral interactions between
spins promote the formation of sophisticated swirling magnetic states such as
skyrmions, with rich topological properties and great potential for future
technologies. Currently, chiral magnetism requires either a restricted group of
natural materials or synthetic thin-film systems that exploit interfacial
effects. Here, using state-of-the-art nanofabrication and magnetic X-ray
microscopy, we demonstrate the imprinting of complex chiral spin states via
three-dimensional geometric effects at the nanoscale. By balancing dipolar and
exchange interactions in an artificial ferromagnetic double-helix
nanostructure, we create magnetic domains and domain walls with a well-defined
spin chirality, determined solely by the chiral geometry. We further
demonstrate the ability to create confined 3D spin textures and topological
defects by locally interfacing geometries of opposite chirality. The ability to
create chiral spin textures via 3D nano-patterning alone enables exquisite
control over the properties and location of complex topological magnetic
states, of great importance for the development of future metamaterials and
devices in which chirality provides enhanced functionality.

reflects the amount of heat dissipated into the environment and free energy
lost in nonequilibrium systems. According to the thermodynamic uncertainty
relation, we propose a deterministic method to estimate the entropy production
from a single trajectory of system states. We explicitly and approximately
compute an optimal current that yields the tightest lower bound using
predetermined basis currents. Notably, the obtained tightest lower bound is
intimately related to the multidimensional thermodynamic uncertainty relation.
By proving the saturation of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation in the
short-time limit, the exact estimate of the entropy production can be obtained
for overdamped Langevin systems, irrespective of the underlying dynamics. For
Markov jump processes, because the attainability of the thermodynamic
uncertainty relation is not theoretically ensured, the proposed method provides
the tightest lower bound for the entropy production. When entropy production is
the optimal current, a more accurate estimate can be further obtained using the
integral fluctuation theorem. We illustrate the proposed method using three
systems: a four-state Markov chain, a periodically driven particle, and a
multiple bead-spring model. The estimated results in all examples empirically
verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

of the structure and function of a large network. A lot of efforts have been
devoted to calculating graphlet statistics where random walk based approaches
are commonly used to access restricted graphs through the available application
programming interfaces (APIs). However, most of them merely consider individual
networks while overlooking the strong coupling between different networks. In
this paper, we estimate the graphlet concentration in multi-layer networks with
real-world applications. An inter-layer edge connects two nodes in different
layers if they belong to the same person. The access to a multi-layer network
is restrictive in the sense that the upper layer allows random walk sampling,
whereas the nodes of lower layers can be accessed only though the inter-layer
edges and only support random node or edge sampling. To cope with this new
challenge, we define a suit of two-layer graphlets and propose a novel random
walk sampling algorithm to estimate the proportion of all the 3-node graphlets.
An analytical bound on the sampling steps is proved to guarantee the
convergence of our unbiased estimator. We further generalize our algorithm to
explore the tradeoff between the estimated accuracies of different graphlets

of quarks and no mixing with the third generation. In our case, through the
addition of a third Higgs doublet with a small vacuum-expectation-value but
very large masses, thus later decoupling, all quarks become massive and quark
mixing is fully reproduced. In fact, all quark mixing angles are expressed in

describe in great detail how actions are perceived by the agents, and how they
affect the world. DEL games were recently introduced as a way to define classes
of games with imperfect information where the actions available to the players
are described very precisely. This framework makes it possible to define
easily, for instance, classes of games where players can only use public
actions or public announcements. These games have been studied for reachability
objectives, where the aim is to reach a situation satisfying some epistemic
property expressed in epistemic logic; several (un)decidability results have
been established. In this work we show that the decidability results obtained
for reachability objectives extend to a much more general class of winning
conditions, namely those expressible in the epistemic temporal logic LTLK. To
do so we establish that the infinite game structures generated by DEL public
actions are regular, and we describe how to obtain finite representations on
which we rely to solve them.

units of social behaviour that address particular challenges. Although their
performance might be adequate for controlled environments, deploying these
agents in the wild is difficult. Moreover, the increasing demand for autonomous
agents capable of living alongside humans calls for the design of more robust
social agents that can cope with diverse social situations. We believe that to
design such agents, their sociality and cognition should be conceived as one.
This includes creating mechanisms for constructing social reality as an
interpretation of the physical world with social meanings and selective
deployment of cognitive resources adequate to the situation. We identify
several design principles that should be considered while designing agent
architectures for socio-cognitive systems. Taking these remarks into account,
we propose a socio-cognitive agent model based on the concept of Cognitive
Social Frames that allow the adaptation of an agent's cognition based on its
interpretation of its surroundings, its Social Context. Our approach supports
an agent's reasoning about other social actors and its relationship with them.
Cognitive Social Frames can be built around social groups, and form the basis
for social group dynamics mechanisms and construct of Social Identity.

the formulas valid in the short-range case, which involve the scattering
lengths of the interaction potential in different angular momentum channels

generalize previous results in \cite{LS}, which apply to bosons in the lowest

path-specific effects framework (Pearl, 2001; Avin et al., 2005), such
fine-grained decompositions necessitate stringent assumptions, such as
correctly specifying the causal structure among the mediators, and there being
no unobserved confounding among the mediators. In contrast, interventional
direct and indirect effects for multiple mediators (Vansteelandt and Daniel,
2017) can be identified under much weaker conditions, while providing
scientifically relevant causal interpretations. Nonetheless, current estimation
approaches require (correctly) specifying a model for the joint mediator
distribution, which can be difficult when there is a high-dimensional set of
possibly continuous and non-continuous mediators. In this article, we avoid the
need to model this distribution, by developing a definition of interventional

longitudinal mediation. We propose a novel estimation strategy that uses
non-parametric estimates of the (counterfactual) mediator distributions.
Non-continuous outcomes can be accommodated using non-linear outcome models.
Estimation proceeds via Monte Carlo integration. The procedure is illustrated

multiple neighborhood search that depends on the stochastic annealing schedule

current layout to jump out of a local optimum by iteratively reassigns some
circles and accepts the new layout with some probability during the search. The
acceptance probability is adjusted adaptively using simulated annealing that
fine-tunes the search direction in order to reach the global optimum. We

ETGs as well. The goal of our study is to understand the link between dust and
cold gas in nearby ETGs as a function of HI content. We analyse deep optical
$g-r$ images obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope for a sample of 21 HI-rich and 41 HI-poor ETGs. We find that all
HI-rich galaxies contain dust seen as absorption. Moreover, in 57 percent of
these HI-rich galaxies, the dust is distributed in a large-scale spiral
pattern. Although the dust detection rate is relatively high in the HI-poor
galaxies ($\sim$59 percent), most of these systems exhibit simpler dust
morphologies without any evidence of spiral structures. We find that the
HI-rich galaxies possess more complex dust morphology extending to almost two
times larger radii than HI-poor objects. We measured the dust content of the
galaxies from the optical colour excess and find that HI-rich galaxies contain
six times more dust (in mass) than HI-poor ones. In order to maintain the dust
structures in the galaxies, continuous gas accretion is needed, and the
substantial HI gas reservoirs in the outer regions of ETGs can satisfy this
need for a long time. We find that there is a good correspondence between the
observed masses of the gas and dust, and it is also clear that dust is present
in regions further than 3~Reff. Our findings indicate an essential relation
between the presence of cold gas and dust in ETGs and offer a way to study the
interstellar medium in more detail than what is possible with HI observations.

discontinuities in the flow solution is typically achieved through a priori
troubled cell indicators, which guide the subsequent action of an appropriate
shock capturing mechanism. Arriving at a stable and accurate solution often
requires empirically based parameter tuning and adjustments of the indicator
settings to the discretization and solution at hand. In this work, we propose
to separate the task of shock detection and shock capturing more strongly and
aim to develop a shock indicator that is robust, accurate, requires minimal
user input and is suitable for high order element-based methods like
discontinuous Galerkin and flux reconstruction methods. The novel indicator is
learned from analytical data through a supervised learning strategy; its input
is given by the high order solution field, its output is an element-local map
of the shock position. We use state of the art methods from edge detection in
image analysis based on deep convolutional multiscale networks and deep
supervision to train the indicators. The resulting networks are then used as
black box indicators, showing their robustness and accuracy on well established
canonical testcases. All simulations are run ab initio using the developed
indicators, showing that they provide also stability during the strongly
transient phases. In particular for high order schemes with large cells and
considerable inner-cell resolution capabilities, we demonstrate how the
additional accurate prediction of the position of the shock front can be
exploited to guide inner-element shock capturing strategies.

bubble clusters. However, due to the complex dependence of the force on
multiple parameters, it is highly non-trivial to include the effects of this
force in the simulations of bubble clusters. In this paper, machine learning is
used to develop a data-driven model for the secondary Bjerknes force between
two insonated bubbles as a function of the equilibrium radii of the bubbles,
the distance between the bubbles, the amplitude and the frequency of the
pressure. The force varies over several orders of magnitude, which poses a
serious challenge for the usual machine learning models. To overcome this
difficulty, the magnitudes and the signs of the force are separated and
modelled separately. A nonlinear regression is obtained with a feed-forward
network model for the logarithm of the magnitude, whereas the sign is modelled
by a support-vector machine model. The principle, the practical aspects related
to the training and validation of the machine models are introduced. The
predictions from the models are checked against the values computed from the
Keller-Miksis equations. The results show that the models are extremely
efficient while providing accurate estimate of the force. The models make it
computationally feasible for the future simulations of the bubble clusters to
include the effects of the secondary Bjerknes force.

effectively fuse the multi-level representations and recover the underlying
subspaces more accurately. The loss function is then minimized through an
iterative scheme which alternatively updates the network parameters and
produces new clusterings of the samples. Experiments on four real-world

of the method, which is able to acquire sub-microsecond dynamics as the impulse

streak camera measurements to verify the method. Finally, potential limitations

experiment. This experiment often requires an efficient and homogenous
collection of light from a relatively large chip on a small area of an optical
fiber or spectrometer slit. Moreover, this effort is complicated by the fact
that the DMD acts as a diffractive element, which causes severe spectral
inhomogeneities in the light collection. We studied the effect of light
diffraction via a whiskbroom hyperspectral camera in a broad spectral range.
Based on the knowledge, we designed a variety of different approaches to light
collection. We mapped the efficiency and spectral homogeneity of each of the
configuration - namely its ability to couple the light into commercially
available fiber spectrometers working in the visible and IR range (up to 2500
nm). We found the integrating spheres to provide homogeneous light collection,
which, however, suffers from very low efficiency. The best compromise between
the performance parameters was provided by a combination of an engineered
diffuser with an off-axis parabolic mirror. We used this configuration to
create a computational microscope able to carry out hyperspectral imaging of a
sample in a broad spectral range (400-2500 nm). We see such a setup as an ideal
tool to carry out spectrally-resolved transmission microscopy in a broad

across many manufacturing industries. Driven by that industrial need, a variety
of algorithms and tools have been developed that combine AI (machine learning
and analytics) with domain knowledge in physics, chemistry, and materials
science. AI-driven materials design can be divided to mainly two stages; the
first one is the modeling stage, where the goal is to build an accurate
regression or classification model to predict material properties (e.g. glass
transition temperature) or attributes (e.g. toxic/non-toxic). The next stage is
design, where the goal is to assemble or tune material structures so that they
can achieve user-demanded target property values based on a prediction model
that is trained in the modeling stage. For maximum benefit, these two stages
should be architected to form a coherent workflow. Today there are several
emerging services and tools for AI-driven material design, however, most of
them provide only partial technical components (e.g. data analyzer, regression
model, structure generator, etc.), that are useful for specific purposes, but
for comprehensive material design, those components need to be orchestrated
appropriately. Our material design system provides an end-to-end solution to
this problem, with a workflow that consists of data input, feature encoding,
prediction modeling, solution search, and structure generation. The system
builds a regression model to predict properties, solves an inverse problem on
the trained model, and generates novel chemical structure candidates that
satisfy the target properties. In this paper we will introduce the methodology
of our system, and demonstrate a simple example of inverse design generating
new chemical structures that satisfy targeted physical property values.

the annotation of training data. Active learning has been proposed to address
this bottleneck using stopping methods to minimize the cost of data annotation.
An important capability for improving the utility of stopping methods is to
effectively forecast the performance of the text classification models.
Forecasting can be done through the use of logarithmic models regressed on some
portion of the data as learning is progressing. A critical unexplored question
is what portion of the data is needed for accurate forecasting. There is a
tension, where it is desirable to use less data so that the forecast can be
made earlier, which is more useful, versus it being desirable to use more data,
so that the forecast can be more accurate. We find that when using active
learning it is even more important to generate forecasts earlier so as to make
them more useful and not waste annotation effort. We investigate the difference
in forecasting difficulty when using accuracy and F-measure as the text
classification system performance metrics and we find that F-measure is more
difficult to forecast. We conduct experiments on seven text classification
datasets in different semantic domains with different characteristics and with
three different base machine learning algorithms. We find that forecasting is
easiest for decision tree learning, moderate for Support Vector Machines, and
most difficult for neural networks.

channel pixel values on the three imaginary parts of a quaternion. Different
from some traditional models which treat color pixel as a scalar and represent
color channels separately, whereas, during the quaternion-based reconstruction,
it is significant that the inherent color structures of color images and color
videos can be completely preserved. Under the definition of Tucker rank, the
global low-rank prior to quaternion tensor is encoded as the nuclear norm of
unfolding quaternion matrices. Then, by applying the ADMM framework, we provide
the tensor completion algorithm for any order quaternion tensors, which
theoretically can be well used to recover missing entries of any
multidimensional data with color structures. Simulation results for color
videos and color images recovery show the superior performance and efficiency
of the proposed method over some state-of-the-art existing ones.

"2001.10677","KitIan Kou","Jifei Miao and Kit Ian Kou","Quaternion matrix regression for color face recognition",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regression analysis-based approaches have been widely studied for face
recognition (FR) in the past several years. More recently, to better deal with
some difficult conditions such as occlusions and illumination, nuclear norm
based matrix regression methods have been proposed to characterize the low-rank
structure of the error image, which generalize the one-dimensional, pixel-based
error model to the two-dimensional structure. These methods, however, are
inherently devised for grayscale image based FR and without exploiting the
color information which is proved beneficial for FR of color face images.
Benefiting from quaternion representation, which is capable of encoding the
cross-channel correlation of color images, we propose a novel color FR method
by formulating the color FR problem as a nuclear norm based quaternion matrix
regression (NQMR). We further develop a more robust model called R-NQMR by
using the logarithm of the nuclear norm, instead of the original nuclear norm,
which adaptively assigns weights on different singular values, and then extend
it to deal with the mixed noise. The proposed models, then, are solved using
the effective alternating direction multiplier method (ADMM). Experiments on
several public face databases demonstrate the superior performance and efficacy
of the proposed approaches for color FR, especially for some difficult
conditions (occlusion, illumination and mixed noise) over some state-of-the-art
regression analysis-based approaches.

switching and saturation), each satisfying Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. An
update for reversible and remanent quantities is then computed within one, in

detection in networks. However, large-scale networks bring computational
challenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the
spectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical
perspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a
stochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we
first use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized
spectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the
random sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds
of the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the
population adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation
error for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild
conditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same
theoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We
also extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical
experiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of
randomized methods. A new R package called Rclust is developed and made
available to the public.

mismatch between the short text and the topic model and further affecting the
forecasting performance. Exploiting advanced and appropriate methods to
construct high-quality features from news headlines becomes crucial in crude

outperforms the other benchmarks. Another significant merit is that our method
also yields good forecasting performance when applied to other futures

change of scenes. In this work, motivated by two stream ConvNets, we propose a
novel two stream FreqSaptialTemporalNet for face anti-spoofing which
simultaneously takes advantage of frequent, spatial and temporal information.
Compared with existing methods which mine spoofing cues in multi-frame RGB

discriminative deep neural network, encouraging the primary difference between
live and fake video to be automatically unearthed. Extensive experiments show
promising improvement results using the proposed architecture. Meanwhile, we
proposed a concise method to obtain a large amount of spoofing training data by
utilizing a frequent augmentation pipeline, which contributes detail

describe a novel architecture that enables multiple low-compute NAO robots to
perform real-time detection, recognition and localization of objects in its
camera view and take programmable actions based on the detected objects. The
proposed algorithm for object detection and localization is an empirical
modification of YOLOv3, based on indoor experiments in multiple scenarios, with
a smaller weight size and lesser computational requirements. Quantization of
the weights and re-adjusting filter sizes and layer arrangements for
convolutions improved the inference time for low-resolution images from the
robot s camera feed. YOLOv3 was chosen after a comparative study of bounding
box algorithms was performed with an objective to choose one that strikes the
perfect balance among information retention, low inference time and high
accuracy for real-time object detection and localization. The architecture also
comprises of an effective end-to-end pipeline to feed the real-time frames from
the camera feed to the neural net and use its results for guiding the robot
with customizable actions corresponding to the detected class labels.
