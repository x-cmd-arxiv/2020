is ergodic uniformly in the selection and mutation parameters, and that the
measures induced by the solution to the stochastic differential equation are
uniformly locally asymptotically normal. Subsequently these two results are
used to analyse the statistical properties of the Maximum Likelihood and
Bayesian estimators for the selection parameter, when both selection and
mutation are acting on the population. In particular, it is shown that these
estimators are uniformly over compact sets consistent, display uniform in the
selection parameter asymptotic normality and convergence of moments over
compact sets, and are asymptotically efficient for a suitable class of loss
functions.

compute the trace of Frobenius $t$ modulo primes $\ell$ and restore it by the

$r$ of the Frobenius action on $E[\ell]$ and of restricting the number $t

expensive computation of modular polynomials. We study the distribution of the

which is basically a PLL or a DLL. Once the PLL (or DLL) is locked, the phase
detector samples the data at the center of the eye as well as at the data

matching performance with supervised pre-training, but sometimes at the cost of
an even higher number of parameters. Extracting subnetworks from these large
unsupervised convnets with preserved performance is of particular interest to
make them less computationally intensive. Typical pruning methods operate
during training on a task while trying to maintain the performance of the
pruned network on the same task. However, in self-supervised feature learning,
the training objective is agnostic on the representation transferability to
downstream tasks. Thus, preserving performance for this objective does not
ensure that the pruned subnetwork remains effective for solving downstream
tasks. In this work, we investigate the use of standard pruning methods,
developed primarily for supervised learning, for networks trained without
labels (i.e. on self-supervised tasks). We show that pruned masks obtained with

suggesting that pruning operates similarly for self-supervised and supervised

density material. Due to the extensive time coverage of our observations, we
also constrain the presence of CSM shells surrounding the progenitor of
SN\,1972E. We rule out essentially all medium and thick shells with masses of
0.05$-$0.3 M$_\odot$ at radii between $\sim$10$^{17}$ and 10$^{18}$ cm, and
thin shells at specific radii with masses down to $\lesssim$0.01 M$_\odot$.
These constraints rule out swaths of parameter space for a range of single and
double degenerate progenitor scenarios, including recurrent nova,
core-degenerate objects, ultra-prompt explosions and white dwarf (WD) mergers
with delays of a few hundred years between the onset of merger and explosion.
Allowed progenitors include WD-WD systems with a significant ($>$ 10$^{4}$
years) delay from the last episode of common envelope evolution and single
degenerate systems undergoing recurrent nova, provided that the recurrence
timescale i short and the system has been in the nova phase for
$\gtrsim$10$^{4}$ yr, such that a large ($>$ 10$^{18}$ cm) cavity has been
evacuated. Future multi-epoch observations of additional intermediate-aged Type

The problem is formulated using the indirect method which casts the optimal
guidance problem as a system of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems.
Using the Theory of Functional Connections, the problem constraints are
analytically embedded into a ""constrained expression,"" which maintains a
free-function that is expanded using orthogonal polynomials with unknown
coefficients. The constraints are satisfied regardless of the values of the
unknown coefficients which convert the two-point boundary value problem into an
unconstrained optimization problem. This process casts the solution into the
admissible subspace of the problem and therefore simple numerical techniques
can be used (i.e. in this paper a nonlinear least-squares method is used). In
addition to the derivation of this technique, the method is validated in two
scenarios and the results are compared to those obtained by the general purpose
optimal control software, GPOPS-II. In general, the proposed technique produces
solutions of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-10})$. Additionally, for the proposed test
cases, it is reported that each individual TFC-based inner-loop iteration
converges within 6 iterations, each iteration exhibiting a computational time
between 72 and 81 milliseconds within the MATLAB legacy implementation.

advantages and disadvantages in centralising AI governance. Some
considerations, such as efficiency and political power, speak in favour of
centralisation. Conversely, the risk of creating a slow and brittle institution
speaks against it, as does the difficulty in securing participation while
creating stringent rules. Other considerations depend on the specific design of
a centralised institution. A well-designed body may be able to deter forum
shopping and ensure policy coordination. However, forum shopping can be
beneficial and a fragmented landscape of institutions can be self-organising.
Centralisation entails trade-offs and the details matter. We conclude with two
core recommendations. First, the outcome will depend on the exact design of a
central institution. A well-designed centralised regime covering a set of
coherent issues could be beneficial. But locking-in an inadequate structure may
pose a fate worse than fragmentation. Second, for now fragmentation will likely
persist. This should be closely monitored to see if it is self-organising or
simply inadequate.

having highly time-dependent cellular patterns, consisting of numerous bright
cells called granules and dark surrounding-channels called intergranular lanes.
Many efforts have been made to characterize the granulation, which may be used
as an energy source for various types of dynamical phenomena. Although the
horizontal gas flow dynamics in intergranular lanes may play a vital role, but
they are poorly understood. This is because the Doppler signals can be obtained
only at the solar limb, where the signals are severely degraded by a
foreshortening effect. To reduce such a degradation, we use Hinode's
spectroscopic data, which are free from a seeing-induced image degradation, and
improve its image quality by correcting for straylight in the instruments. The
dataset continuously covers from the solar disk to the limb, providing a
multidirectional line-of-sight (LOS) diagnosis against the granulation. The
obtained LOS flow-field variation across the disk indicates a horizontal flow
speed of 1.8-2.4 km/s. We also derive the spatial distribution of the
horizontal flow speed, which is 1.6 km/s in granules and 1.8 km/s in
intergranular lanes, and where the maximum speed is inside intergranular lanes.
This result newly suggests the following sequence of horizontal flow: A hot
rising gas parcel is strongly accelerated from the granular center, even beyond
the transition from the granules to the intergranular lanes, resulting in the
fastest speed inside the intergranular lanes, and the gas may also experience
decelerations in the intergranular lane.

leveraging the cheap and abundant storage available in end-user devices so as

Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), the shared-link coded caching problem was
formulated, where each user demands one file (i.e., single file retrieval).
This paper generalizes the MAN problem so as to allow users to request scalar
linear functions of the files. This paper proposes a novel coded delivery
scheme that, based on MAN uncoded cache placement, is shown to allow for the
decoding of arbitrary scalar linear functions of the files (on arbitrary finite
fields). Interestingly, and quite surprisingly, it is shown that the load for
cache-aided scalar linear function retrieval depends on the number of linearly
independent functions that are demanded, akin to the cache-aided single-file
retrieval problem where the load depends on the number of distinct file
requests. The proposed scheme is optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache
placement, in terms of worst-case load, and within a factor 2 otherwise. The
key idea of this paper can be extended to all scenarios which the original MAN
scheme has been extended to, including demand-private and/or device-to-device

plasmon modes enable exact matching of the polarization requirements for
silicon based input/output grating couplers, waveguides and electro-optical

structure, implies a coupling of propagating plasmon modes with a waveguide
mode. The vertically arranged sandwich includes a thin layer of
epsilon-near-zero material (indium tin oxide) providing an efficient modulation
at small length scales. Employed edge plasmons possess a mixed polarization
state and can be excited with horizontally polarized waveguide modes. It allows
the resulting modulator to work directly with efficient grating couplers and
avoid using bulky and lossy polarization converters. A 3D optical model based
on Maxwell equations combined with drift-diffusion semiconductor equations is
developed. Numerically heavy computations involving the optimization of
materials and geometry have been performed. Effective modes, stationary state

  Here, the nonlinear objective function, that describes the inclusion of all
stabilizing terms and the fit to data measurements, is minimized iteratively by
imposing stationarity on the linear equation that results from applying
linearization of the objective function about a starting model. To numerically
solve the resulting linear system, at each iteration, the conjugate gradient
algorithm is used. The general framework is then validated for
three-dimensional synthetic models for both sparse and smooth reconstructions,
and the results are compared with those of individual gravity and magnetic
inversions. It is demonstrated that the presented joint inversion algorithm is
practical and significantly improves reconstructed models obtained by
independent inversion.

alloy clusters with substantial electron transfer from Sn to Pt. The presence
of Sn also makes all the thermally accessible structures closed shell, such

been extensively applied following reactor accidents and also would provide a
key tool for response to a malicious radiological or nuclear incident. Methods
exist to calibrate the aerial survey system for quantification of the
concentration of natural radionuclides, which can provide guidance. However,
these methods have anticipated a spatial distribution of the source which is
large in comparison to the survey altitude. In rapid emergency-response aerial
surveys of areas of safety concern, deposits of relatively small spatial extent
may be expected. The activity of such spatially restricted hot spots is
underestimated using the traditional methods. We present here a spatial
deconvolution method which can recover some of the variation smoothed out by
the averaging due to survey at altitude. We show that the method can recover
the true spatial distribution of concentration of a synthetic source. We then
apply the method to real aerial survey data collected following detonation of a
radiological dispersal device. The findings and implications of the
deconvolution are then discussed by reference to a groundbased truckborne

choose the channel state of an arbitrarily-varying channel between legitimate
users; the receiver is successful if it either decodes to the correct message
or correctly detects adversarial interference. We show that a channel condition
called U-overwritability, which allows the adversary to make its false message

U-overwritable for all ""less myopic"" adversaries. Finally, we show that
stochastic encoders are necessary for positive authentication capacity in some
cases, and examine in detail a binary adversarial channel that illustrates this
necessity. Namely, for this binary channel, we show that when the adversarial
channel is degraded with respect to the main channel between users, the
no-adversary capacity of the underlying channel is achievable with a

that of thus far non-repeating CHIME/FRB events. However, as previously

radio, X-ray, and recently very-high-energy (VHE) $\gamma$-rays by HAWC. The
detection of HAWC $\gamma$-rays with energies as great as 25 TeV motivates
searches for high-energy $\gamma$-ray counterparts in the Fermi-LAT data in the
100 MeV--300 GeV band. In this paper, we report on the first-ever joint
analysis of Fermi-LAT and HAWC observations to study the spectrum and location
of $\gamma$-ray emission from SS~433. Our analysis finds common emission sites
of GeV-to-TeV $\gamma$-rays inside the eastern and western lobes of SS 433. The
total flux above 1 GeV is $\sim 1\times10^{-10}\,\rm cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ in both
lobes. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum in the eastern lobe is consistent with
inverse-Compton emission by an electron population that is accelerated by jets.
To explain both the GeV and TeV flux, the electrons need to have a soft
intrinsic energy spectrum, or undergo a quick cooling process due to
synchrotron radiation in a magnetized environment.

Ortiz, NIPS'02; most recently revisited by Changa and Thangaraj, ISIT'2019)
seeks to estimate the weight of symbols that have not been sampled yet from a
source.
  So far all the approaches have been focused on the IID model which, although
overly simplistic, is already not straightforward to tackle. The non-trivial
part is in handling correlated events and sums of variables with very different
scales where classical concentration inequalities do not yield good bounds.
  In this paper we develop the research on missing mass further, solving the
problem for Markov chains. We reduce the problem to studying the tails of
hitting times and finding \emph{log-additive approximations} to them. More
precisely, we combine the technique of majorization and certain estimates on
set hitting times to show how the problem can be eventually reduced back to the
IID case. Our contribution are a) new technique to obtain missing mass bounds -
we replace traditionally used negative association by majorization which works
for a wider class of processes b) first (exponential) concentration bounds for
missing mass in Markov chain models c) simplifications of recent results on set
hitting times and d) simplified derivation of missing mass estimates for
memory-less sources.

autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (NARX). First, based on gray-box
identification techniques, some constraints on the structure and parameters of
NARX models are proposed to ensure that the identified models display a
key-feature of hysteresis. In addition, a more general framework is developed
to explain how hysteresis occurs in such models. Second, two strategies to
design hysteresis compensators are presented. In one strategy the compensation
law is obtained through simple algebraic manipulations performed on the
identified models. It has been found that the compensators based on gray-box
models outperform the cases with models identified using black-box techniques.
In the second strategy, the compensation law is directly identified from the

continuum-molecular dynamics approach to determine the ion-ion recombination
rate coefficient. The approach is based on the limiting sphere method
classically used for transition regime collision phenomena in aerosols. When
ions are sufficiently far from one another, ion-ion relative motion is
described by diffusion equations while within a critical distance, molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are used to model ion-ion motion. MD simulations are
parameterized using the AMBER force-field as well as by considering partial
charges on atoms. Ion-neutral gas collisions are modeled in two mutually
exclusive cubic domains composed of 103 gas atoms each, which remain centered
on the recombining ions throughout calculations. Example calculations are
reported for NH4+ recombination with NO2- in He, across a pressure range from
10 kPa to 10,000 kPa. Excellent agreement is found in comparison of
calculations to literature values for the 100 kPa recombination rate
coefficient (1.0 x 10-12 m3 s-1) in He. We also recover the experimentally
observed increase in recombination rate coefficient with pressure at
sub-atmospheric pressures, and the observed decrease in recombination rate
coefficient in the high pressure continuum limit. We additionally find that
non-dimensionalized forms of rate coefficients are consistent with recently
developed equations for the dimensionless charged particle-ion collision rate
coefficient based on Langevin dynamics simulations.

large improvements in privacy guarantees without loss of utility by making
reports anonymous. However, these results either comprise of systems with
seemingly disparate mechanisms and attack models, or formal statements with
little guidance to practitioners. Addressing this, we provide a formal
treatment and offer prescriptive guidelines for privacy-preserving reporting
with anonymity. We revisit the ESA framework with a simple, abstract model of
attackers as well as assumptions covering it and other proposed systems of
anonymity. In light of new formal privacy bounds, we examine the limitations of
sketch-based encodings and ESA mechanisms such as data-dependent crowds. We
also demonstrate how the ESA notion of fragmentation (reporting data aspects in

practitioners understand the applicability and limitations of
privacy-preserving reporting, we report on a large number of empirical

Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We focus on two sources:
(i)~stellar-origin black-hole binaries~(SOBHBs) that can migrate from the LISA
band to the band of ground-based gravitational-wave observatories within
weeks/months; and (ii) intermediate-mass black-hole binaries~(IMBHBs) in the
LISA band only. Because of the large number of observable gravitational-wave
cycles, the phase evolution of these systems needs to be modeled to great
accuracy to avoid biasing the estimation of the source parameters. Accretion
affects the gravitational-wave phase at negative ($-4$) post-Newtonian order,
and is therefore dominant for binaries at large separations. If accretion takes
place at the Eddington or at super-Eddington rate, it will leave a detectable
imprint on the dynamics of SOBHBs. In optimistic astrophysical scenarios, a
multiwavelength strategy with LISA and a ground-based interferometer can detect
about $10$ (a few) SOBHB events for which the accretion rate can be measured at
$50\%$ ($10\%$) level. In all cases the sky position can be identified within
much less than $0.4\,{\rm deg}^2$ uncertainty. Likewise, accretion at $\gtrsim
10\%$ ($\gtrsim 100\%$) of the Eddington rate can be measured in IMBHBs up to
redshift $z\approx 0.1$ ($z\approx 0.5$), and the position of these sources can
be identified within less than $0.01\,{\rm deg}^2$ uncertainty. Altogether, a
detection of SOBHBs or IMBHBs would allow for targeted searches of
electromagnetic counterparts to black-hole mergers in gas-rich environments

make quite good BLR candidates, because they are self-shielded flows and can
cover a large portion of the ionizing flux-density ($\phi_H$-$n_H$) plane. We
then conduct Monte Carlo radiative transfer and photoionization calculations,
which fully account for self-shielding and multiple scattering in a
non-spherical geometry. The emergent model spectra show broad emission lines
with equivalent widths and line ratios comparable to those observed in AGN,
provided that the wind has a volume filling factor of $f_V\lesssim0.1$. Similar
emission line spectra are produced for a variety of wind geometries (polar or
equatorial) and for launch radii that differ by an order of magnitude. The line
emission arises almost exclusively from plasma travelling below the escape
velocity, implying that `failed winds' are important BLR candidates. The
behaviour of a line-emitting wind (and possibly any `smooth flow' BLR model) is
similar to that of the locally optimally-emitting cloud (LOC) model originally
proposed by Baldwin et al (1995), except that the gradients in ionization state

lower masses, NSCs are formed primarily from globular clusters that inspiral
into the center of the galaxy, while at higher masses, star formation within
the nucleus forms the bulk of the NSC. We also discuss the coexistence of NSCs
and central black holes, and how their growth may be linked. The extreme
densities of NSCs and their interaction with massive black holes lead to a wide
range of unique phenomena including tidal disruption and gravitational wave
events. Lastly, we review the evidence that many NSCs end up in the halos of
massive galaxies stripped of the stars that surrounded them, thus providing
valuable tracers of the galaxies' accretion histories.

Using \textit{Gaia} DR2 data, we aim to determine if such a population is

Methods: We studied the kinematics of \textit{Gaia} DR2 sources with parallax
values between 1/60 and 1/30 milliarcseconds towards two regions that show
abnormally high values of extinction and reddening; the results are compared
with predictions from GALAXIA Galactic model. We also plotted the

the parallaxes, and studied the effects of the large parallax errors by Monte
Carlo sampling. Results: The kinematics point towards a Galactic origin for one
of the regions, while the provenance of the stars in the other is not clear. A
spectroscopic analysis of some of the sources in the first region confirms that
they are located in the halo. The CM diagram of the sources suggests that some

currently being debated. The direct detection of the neutron star merger
GW170817, through gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation, has
confirmed such events as important sources of the $r$-process elements.
However, chemical evolution models are not able to reproduce the observed
chemical abundances in the Milky Way when neutron star mergers are assumed to
be the only $r$-process site and realistic time distributions of such events
are taken into account. Now for the first time, we combine all the available
observational evidence of the Milky Way and its dwarf galaxy satellites to show
that the data can only be explained if there are (at least) two distinct
$r$-process sites: a quick source with timescales comparable to core-collapse
supernovae, $t_{quick}\lesssim10^8$ yr, and a delayed source with
characteristic timescales $t_{delayed}\gtrsim4$ Gyr. The delayed $r$-process
source most probably originates in neutron star mergers, as the timescale fits
well with that estimated for GW170817. Given the short timescales of the quick
source, it is likely associated with massive stars, though a specific
fast-track channel for compact object mergers cannot be excluded at this point.
Our approach demonstrates that only by looking at all the available data will
we be able to solve the puzzle that is the $r$-process.

identify topological insulators via the bulk-boundary correspondence. This can
be extended to high-order topological insulators for which the most striking
feature is in-gap modes at boundaries of higher co-dimension, e.g. the corners
of a 2D material. Unfortunately, this spectroscopic approach is not always
viable since the energies of the topological modes are not protected and they
can often overlap the bulk bands, leading to potential misidentification. Since
the topology of a material is a collective product of all its eigenmodes, any
conclusive indicator of topology must instead be a feature of its bulk band
structure, and should not rely on specific eigen-energies. For many topological
crystalline insulators the key topological feature is fractional charge density
arising from the filled bulk bands, but measurements of charge distributions
have not been accessible to date. In this work, we experimentally measure
boundary-localized fractional charge density of two distinct 2D
rotationally-symmetric metamaterials, finding 1/4 and 1/3 fractionalization. We
then introduce a new topological indicator based on collective phenomenology
that allows unambiguous identification of higher-order topology, even in the
absence of in-gap states. Finally, we demonstrate the higher-order
bulk-boundary correspondence associated with this fractional feature by using
boundary deformations to spectrally isolate localized corner modes where they
were previously unobservable.

and we are proceeding with field trials of the instrument in high-fidelity
operational environments. Prospective end users have been involved in trial set
up and execution, assuring applicability in their mission spaces. SCoTSS has
been subject to trials involving hidden sources, heavily shielded sources,
imager moving with respect to source, and complicated man-made surroundings.
Our operators value high sensitivity for anomaly geolocation and mapping. End
users also require an instrument which is capable of direction reconstruction
in motion, as well as rapid imaging of a field of view. We have developed a
""time to image"" measure which allows for quantitative comparison of imagers of
fundamentally different technology, where one design may have an advantage in
terms of energy resolution and compactness and another design may have an
advantage in terms of efficiency and cost effectiveness. We present here the
performance of the SCoTSS imager in rapid direction finding. As well, we
compare the time to image quantity for the SCoTSS imager and the H3D Polaris-H
Quad imager where the data were taken under equivalent conditions. This
quantitative measure of imaging performance can allow operators to make an
informed choice of the design that meets their needs taking into consideration
also weight and size as well as budgetary constraints.

generation of massive amounts of graphical content, both in 2D and in 3D.
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and style control mechanisms, such as
Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), have proved particularly effective in
this context, culminating in the state-of-the-art StyleGAN architecture. While
such models are able to learn diverse distributions, provided a sufficiently
large training set, they are not well-suited for scenarios where the
distribution of the training data exhibits a multi-modal behavior. In such
cases, reshaping a uniform or normal distribution over the latent space into a
complex multi-modal distribution in the data domain is challenging, and the
generator might fail to sample the target distribution well. Furthermore,
existing unsupervised generative models are not able to control the mode of the
generated samples independently of the other visual attributes, despite the
fact that they are typically disentangled in the training data.
  In this paper, we introduce UMMGAN, a novel architecture designed to better
model multi-modal distributions, in an unsupervised fashion. Building upon the
StyleGAN architecture, our network learns multiple modes, in a completely
unsupervised manner, and combines them using a set of learned weights. We
demonstrate that this approach is capable of effectively approximating a
complex distribution as a superposition of multiple simple ones. We further
show that UMMGAN effectively disentangles between modes and style, thereby
providing an independent degree of control over the generated content.

IR source with $S_{500}$~120mJy (Red Virgo 4 - RV4). Based on IRAM/EMIR and
IRAM/NOEMA detections of the CO(5-4), CO(4-3), and [CI] lines, RV4 is located
at z=4.724, yielding a total observed L$_{IR}$ of
1.1+/-0.6x0$^{14}$L$_{\odot}$. At the position of the Herschel emission, three
blobs are detected with the VLA at 10cm. The CO(5-4) line detection of each
blob confirms that they are at the same redshift with the same line width,
indicating that they are multiple images of the same source. In Spitzer and
deep optical observations, two sources, High-z Lens 1 (HL1) West and HL1 East,
are detected at the center of the three VLA/NOEMA blobs. These two sources are
placed at z=1.48 with XSHOOTER spectra, suggesting that they could be merging
and gravitationally lensing the emission of RV4. HL1 is the second most distant
lens known to date in strong lensing systems. The Einstein radius of the
lensing system is 2.2""+/-0.2 (20kpc). The high redshift of HL1 and the large
Einstein radius are highly unusual for a strong lensing system. We present the
ISM properties of the background source RV4. Different estimates of the gas
depletion time yield low values suggesting that RV4 is a SB galaxy. Among all
high-z SMGs, this source exhibits one of the lowest L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{IR}$
ratios, 3.2+/-0.9x10$^{-6}$, suggesting an extremely short gas tdepl of only
14+/-5Myr. It also shows a relatively high L$_{[CI]}$ to L$_{CO(4-3)}$ ratio
(0.7+/-0.2) and low L$_{CO(5-4)}$ to L$_{IR}$ ratio (only ~50% of the value
expected for normal galaxies) hinting a low density of gas. Finally, we discuss
that the short tdepl of RV4 can be explained by either a very high SFE, which
is difficult to reconcile with major mergers simulations of high-z galaxies, or
a rapid decrease of SF, which would bias the estimate of tdepl toward low
value.

crucially diminishes the accuracy with which the desired expectation values can

included relativistic corrections responsible for the precession of pericenter

the three bodies. We revisit this problem and develop a fully consistent
derivation of the secular three-body problem to first post-Newtonian order. We
start with the Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman equations for a three-body system and
expand the accelerations as a power series in the ratio of the semi-major axes
of the inner ($a_1$) and outer ($a_2$) binary. We then perform a
post-Keplerian, two-parameter expansion of the single-orbit-averaged Lagrange
planetary equations in $\delta = v^2/c^2$ and $\epsilon = a_1/a_2$ using the
method of multiple scales. Using this method, we derive previously-indentified
secular effects at $\delta \epsilon^{5/2}$ order that arise directly from the
equations of motion. We also calculate new secular effects through $\delta
\epsilon^4$ order that can lead to eccentricity growth over many Lidov-Kozai
cycles when the tertiary is much more massive than the inner binary. In such
cases, inclusion of these effects can substantially alter the evolution of
three-body systems as compared to an analysis in which they are neglected.
Careful analysis of post-Newtonian three-body effects will be important to
understand the formation and properties of coalescing binaries that form via
three-body dynamical processes.

populations attract attention because it is a fairly common phenomenon and
because spatial synchrony may elevate a risk of extinction and may lead to
other environmental impacts. Conditions for stable synchronization in a system
of linearly coupled predator-prey oscillators have been considered in the past.
However, the spatial dispersion coupling may be relatively weak and may not
necessarily lead to a stable, complete synchrony. If the coupling between
oscillators is too weak to induce a stable synchrony, oscillators may be
engaged into intermittent synchrony, when episodes of synchronized dynamics are
interspersed with the episodes of desynchronized dynamics. In the present study
we consider the temporal patterning of this kind of intermittent synchronized
dynamics in a system of two dispersal-coupled Rosenzweig-MacArthur
predator-prey oscillators. We consider the properties of the distributions of
durations of desynchronized intervals and their dependence on the model
parameters. We show that the temporal patterning of synchronous dynamics (an
ecological network phenomenon) may depend on the properties of individual
predator-prey patch (individual oscillator) and may vary independently of the
strength of dispersal. We also show that if the dynamics of predator is slow
relative to the dynamics of the prey (a situation that may promote brief but
large outbreaks), dispersal-coupled predator-prey oscillating populations
exhibit numerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to few long
desynchronizations) and may require weaker dispersal in order to reach strong
synchrony.

  Minimal Mesh Refinement",,,,,"cs.CG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Any closed manifold of genus g can be cut open to form a topological disk and
then mapped to a regular polygon with 4g sides. This construction is called the
canonical polygonal schema of the manifold, and is a key ingredient for many
applications in graphics and engineering, where a parameterization between two
shapes with same topology is often needed. The sides of the 4g-gon define on
the manifold a system of loops, which all intersect at a single point and are
disjoint elsewhere. Computing a shortest system of loops of this kind is
NP-hard. A computationally tractable alternative consists in computing a set of
shortest loops that are not fully disjoint in polynomial time, using the greedy
homotopy basis algorithm proposed by Erickson and Whittlesey, and then detach
them in post processing via mesh refinement. Despite this operation is
conceptually simple, known refinement strategies do not scale well for high
genus shapes, triggering a mesh growth that may exceed the amount of memory
available in modern computers, leading to failures. In this paper we study
various local refinement operators to detach cycles in a system of loops, and
show that there are important differences between them, both in terms of mesh
complexity and preservation of the original surface. We ultimately propose two
novel refinement approaches: the former minimizes the number of new elements in
the mesh, possibly at the cost of a deviation from the input geometry. The
latter allows to trade mesh complexity for geometric accuracy, bounding
deviation from the input surface. Both strategies are trivial to implement, and
experiments confirm that they allow to realize canonical polygonal schemas even
for extremely high genus shapes where previous methods fail.

not trivial using traditional classification approaches due to its encrypted
nature. We utilize two well-known neural networks, namely multi-layer
perceptron and recurrent neural network to create our cascade neural network
focused on two metrics: class scores and distance from the center of the
classes. Such approach combines extraction, selection, and classification
functionality into a single end-to-end system to systematically learn the
non-linear relationship between input and predicted performance. Therefore, we
could distinguish VPN traffics from non-VPN traffics by rejecting the unrelated
features of the VPN class. Moreover, we obtain the application type of non-VPN
traffics at the same time. The approach is evaluated using the general traffic
dataset ISCX VPN-nonVPN, and an acquired dataset. The results demonstrate the
efficacy of the framework approach for encrypting traffic classification while
also achieving extreme accuracy, $95$ percent, which is higher than the

a global understanding of the chemistry in HAT-P-7b's atmosphere and assess the
importance of disequilibrium chemistry on UHJs.
  We apply a hierarchical modelling approach utilising 97 1D atmospheric
profiles from 3D GCM of HAT-P-7b. For each 1D profile, we evaluate our kinetic
cloud formation model consistently with the local gas-phase composition in
chemical equilibrium. We then evaluate quenching results from a zeroth-order
approximation in comparison to a kinetic gas-phase approach.
  We find that the zeroth-order approach of estimating quenching points agrees
well with the full gas-kinetic modeling results. Chemical disequilibrium has
the greatest effect on the nightside and morning abundance of species such as
H, H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, and all C$_n$H$_m$ molecules; heavier
C$_n$H$_m$ molecules are more affected by disequilibrium processes. CO
abundance, however, is affected only marginally. While dayside abundances also
notably change, those around the evening terminator of HAT-P-7b are the least
affected by disequilibrium processes. The latter finding may partially explain
the consistency of observed transmission spectra of UHJs with atmospheres in
thermochemical equilibrium. Photochemistry only negligibly affects molecular
abundances and quenching levels.
  In general, the quenching points of HAT-P-7b's atmosphere are at much lower
pressures in comparison to the cooler hot-jupiters. We propose several avenues
to look for the effect of disequilibrium processes on UHJs that are, in
general, based on abundance and opacity measurements at different local times.
It remains a challenge to completely disentangle this from the chemical effects
of clouds and that of a primordial non-solar abundance.

that the incompressibility $K_0$ has a uniform prior PDF within its absolute

qualitatively consistent. The uncertainties of all three parameters are

which we develop a non-perturbative model for valence quark interaction in the
mean field of the nucleonic interior to describe their distribution in the
moderate x region (0.05 < x < 0.4). The short range quark-quark interaction
effects in our approach generate the high x tail of valence quark
distributions. The presented non-perturbative model is based on the picture in
which three relativistic valence quarks occupy the nucleon core at distances of
$\le 0.5$ Fm while interacting in the mean field generated by the residual
nucleon system. The calculations are based on the assumption of the a
factorization of the internal interaction of short-range three valence quarks
with the long-range interaction of these quarks with the residual system. The
theoretical approach is based on effective light-front diagrammatic approach
which allows us to introduce the valence quark and residual system wave
functions in a consistent way The parameters of these wave functions are fixed
by the position of the peak of the xf_q(x) distribution of valence quarks at
Q_0 corresponding to the charm-quark mass. With few parameters we achieved a
very reasonable description of the up and down valence quark distributions in
the moderate x region (x < 0.4), where one expects the mean field dynamics to
dominate. The model, however, systematically underestimates the high $x$ region

opportunity to study neutrinos with energies far beyond the reach of
terrestrial accelerators. These neutrinos are used to study high-energy
neutrino interactions and to probe the Earth through absorption tomography.
Current studies of TeV neutrinos use cross sections which are calculated for
free nucleons with targets which are assumed to contain equal numbers of
protons and neutrons.
  Here we consider modifications of high-energy neutrino interactions due to
two nuclear effects: modifications of the parton densities in the nucleus,
referred to here as shadowing, and the effect of non-isoscalar targets, with
unequal numbers of neutrons and protons. Both these effects depend on the
interaction medium. Because shadowing is larger for heavier nuclei, such as
iron, found in the Earth's core, it introduces a zenith-angle dependent change
in the absorption cross section. These modifications increase the cross
sections by 1-2\% at energies below 100 TeV (antishadowing), and reduce it by
3-4\% at higher energies (shadowing).
  Nuclear effects also alter the inelasticity distribution of neutrino
interactions in water/ice by increasing the number of low inelasticity
interactions, with a larger effect for $\nu$ than $\bar\nu$. These effects are
particularly large in the energy range below a few TeV. These effects could
alter the cross sections inferred from events with tracks originating within
the active detector volume as well as the ratio $\nu/\bar\nu$ inferred from
inelasticity measurements.
  The uncertainties in these nuclear effects are larger than the uncertainties
on the free-proton cross sections and will thus limit the systematic precision
of future high-precision measurements at neutrino telescopes.

cooperative at some population densities and competitive at others. The results
extend our previous work on similar models in homogeneous environments. We also
consider competition between two populations that are ecologically identical,

between two different diffusion rates. The motivation for that is to gain
insight into when switching might be advantageous versus diffusing at a fixed
rate. This is a variation on the classical results for ecologically identical
competitors with differing fixed diffusion rates, where it is well known that

to evaluate, and computing derivatives of the map, or derivative-adjoints, may
not be feasible. Additionally, in many applications only noisy evaluations of
the map may be available. We propose an approach to Bayesian inversion in such
settings that builds on the derivative-free optimization capabilities of
ensemble Kalman inversion methods. The overarching approach is to first use
ensemble Kalman sampling (EKS) to calibrate the unknown parameters to fit the
data; second, to use the output of the EKS to emulate the parameter-to-data
map; third, to sample from an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution in
which the parameter-to-data map is replaced by its emulator. This results in a
principled approach to approximate Bayesian inference that requires only a
small number of evaluations of the (possibly noisy approximation of the)
parameter-to-data map. It does not require derivatives of this map, but instead
leverages the documented power of ensemble Kalman methods. Furthermore, the EKS
has the desirable property that it evolves the parameter ensembles towards the
regions in which the bulk of the parameter posterior mass is located, thereby
locating them well for the emulation phase of the methodology. In essence, the
EKS methodology provides a cheap solution to the design problem of where to
place points in parameter space to efficiently train an emulator of the

Standard locally decodable codes are error correcting codes with a

any desired message bit can be recovered with good probability by querying only
a small number of positions in the corrupted codeword. This allows one to
recover any message bit very efficiently in sub-linear or even logarithmic
time. Besides this straightforward application, locally decodable codes have
also found many other applications such as private information retrieval,
secure multiparty computation, and average-case complexity.
  However, despite extensive research, the tradeoff between the rate of the
code and the number of queries is somewhat disappointing. For example, the best
known constructions still need super-polynomially long codeword length even
with a logarithmic number of queries, and need a polynomial number of queries
to achieve a constant rate. In this paper, we show that by using a randomized
encoding, in several models we can achieve significantly better rate-query
tradeoff. In addition, our codes work for both the standard Hamming errors, and

orbital distance is important when considering the combined tidal response for
Jupiter. Conversely, the details of the interior structure have a negligible
influence on $k_{nm}$, for models that match the zonal harmonics $J_2$, $J_4$
and $J_6$, already measured to high precision by Juno. As the mission
continues, improved coverage of Jupiter's gravity field at different phases of
Io's orbit is expected to yield an observed value for the degree-2 Love number
($k_{22}$) and potentially select higher--degree $k_{nm}$. We present a test of
the sensitivity of the Juno Doppler signal to the calculated $k_{nm}$, which
suggests the detectability of $k_{33}$, $k_{42}$ and $k_{31}$, in addition to
$k_{22}$. A mismatch of a robust Juno observation with the remarkably small
range in calculated Io equilibrium $k_{22}=0.58976\pm0.0001$, would indicate a
heretofore uncharacterized dynamic contribution to the tides.

$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) nebula at high-$z$ that occur predominantly in overdense
proto-cluster regions. Especially the prototypical SSA22a-LAB1 at $z=3.1$ has
become an observational reference for LABs across the electromagnetic spectrum.
  Aims: We want to understand the powering mechanisms that drive the LAB to
gain empirical insights into galaxy formation processes within a rare dense
environment at high-$z$.
  Methods: LAB 1 was observed for 17.5h with the VLT/MUSE integral-field
spectrograph. We produced optimally extracted narrow band images in Ly$\alpha$
$\lambda1216$ and HeII $\lambda1640$. By using a moment based analysis we
mapped the kinematics of the blob.
  Results: We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission to surface-brightness limits of
$10^{-19}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. At this depth we reveal a bridge
between LAB 1 and its northern neighbour LAB 8, as well as a shell-like
filament towards the south of LAB 1. We find a coherent large scale east-west
$\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient that is aligned perpendicular to the
major axis of the blob. We detect HeII emission in three distinct regions, but
we can only provide upper limits for CIV.
  Conclusions: Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: Ionising
radiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while
Ly$\alpha$ scattering is contributing at larger distances. However,
HeII/Ly$\alpha$ ratios combined with upper limits on CIV/Ly$\alpha$ can not
discriminate between AGN ionisation and feedback driven shocks. The alignment
of the angular momentum vector parallel to the morphological principal axis
appears odds with the predicted norm for high-mass halos, but likely reflects
that LAB\,1 resides at a node of multiple intersecting filaments of the cosmic
web.

transportation science, spatial economics, sociology and many other fields. For
more than 100 years, many human mobility prediction models have been proposed,
among which the gravity model analogous to Newton's law of gravitation is
widely used. Another classical model is the intervening opportunity (IO) model,
which indicates that an individual selecting a destination is related to both
the destination's opportunities and the intervening opportunities between the
origin and the destination. The IO model established from the perspective of
individual selection behavior has recently triggered the establishment of many
new IO class models. Although these IO class models can achieve accurate
prediction at specific spatiotemporal scales, an IO class model that can
describe an individual's destination selection behavior at different
spatiotemporal scales is still lacking. Here, we develop a universal
opportunity model that considers two human behavioral tendencies: one is the
exploratory tendency, and the other is the cautious tendency. Our model
establishes a new framework in IO class models and covers the classical
radiation model and opportunity priority selection model. Furthermore, we use
various mobility data to demonstrate our model's predictive ability. The
results show that our model can better predict human mobility than previous IO
class models. Moreover, this model can help us better understand the underlying
mechanism of the individual's destination selection behavior in different types
of human mobility.

Carlson-Goldman modes using THz near field technique, although none of these

decays exponentially with the lag between two consecutive receding horizons,

convergence instead. Overall this approach induces our local exponential

Recently, a new modeling technique called the data-driven coronal field model,
in which the time evolution of magnetic field is driven by a sequence of
photospheric magnetic and velocity field maps, has been developed and revealed
the dynamics of flare-productive active regions. Here we report on the first
qualitative and quantitative assessment of different data-driven models using a
magnetic flux emergence simulation as a ground-truth (GT) data set. We compare
the GT field with those reconstructed from the GT photospheric field by four
data-driven algorithms. It is found that, at least, the flux rope structure is
reproduced in all coronal field models. Quantitatively, however, the results
show a certain degree of model dependence. In most cases, the magnetic energies
and relative magnetic helicity are comparable to or at most twice of the GT
values. The reproduced flux ropes have a sigmoidal shape (consistent with GT)
of various sizes, a vertically-standing magnetic torus, or a packed structure.
The observed discrepancies can be attributed to the highly non-force-free input
photospheric field, from which the coronal field is reconstructed, and to the
modeling constraints such as the treatment of background atmosphere, the bottom
boundary setting, and the spatial resolution.

with impacts that respect, point wise, the separability symmetry. The energy in
each degree of freedom is preserved, and the motion along each level set is
conjugated, via action angle coordinates, to a geodesic flow on a flat
two-dimensional surface in the four dimensional phase space. Yet, for a range
of energies, these surfaces are not the simple Liouville-Arnold tori - these
are tori of genus two, thus the motion on them is not conjugated to simple
rotations. Namely, even though energy is not transferred between the two
degrees of freedom, the impact system is quasi-integrable and is not of the
Liouville-Arnold type. In fact, for each level set in this range, the motion is
conjugated to the well studied and highly non-trivial dynamics of directional
motion in L-shaped billiards, where the billiard area and shape as well as the
direction of motion vary continuously on iso-energetic level sets. Return maps
to Poincar\'e section of the flow are shown to be conjugated, on each level

there exist step locations for which some of the level sets exhibit motion

restored to homogeneous steady states. The dynamic agents interacting

to scene variation, and that is able to infer part information such as
orientational and relative spatial relationships. The proposed modality is
based on spatial temporal graph representations of surgical tools in videos,
for surgical activity recognition. To explore its effectiveness, we model and
recognize surgical gestures with the proposed modality. We construct spatial
graphs connecting the joint pose estimations of surgical tools. Then, we
connect each joint to the corresponding joint in the consecutive frames forming
inter-frame edges representing the trajectory of the joint over time. We then
learn hierarchical spatial temporal graph representations using Spatial
Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN). Our experiments show that
learned spatial temporal graph representations perform well in surgical gesture
recognition even when used individually. We experiment with the Suturing task
of the JIGSAWS dataset where the chance baseline for gesture recognition is
10%. Our results demonstrate 68% average accuracy which suggests a significant
improvement. Learned hierarchical spatial temporal graph representations can be
used either individually, in cascades or as a complementary modality in
surgical activity recognition, therefore provide a benchmark for future
studies. To our knowledge, our paper is the first to use spatial temporal graph
representations of surgical tools, and pose-based skeleton representations in
general, for surgical activity recognition.

replacement cost. Simultaneous scheduling of these \textsc{dcd}s and continuous
control devices, e.g., distributed energy resources, is imperative for reducing
the operating cost. This also increases the lifetime of \textsc{dcd}s and helps
to avoid the sub-optimal/infeasible solutions. Considering the high cost of
discrete control actions (dcas), they may never be justified against the other
options in a short scheduling horizon (sh). With a longer sh, their benefits
over a long period justify dcas. However, a shorter \textsc{sh} helps to hedge
against the risk impelled by uncertainties. Here, the system's future is
modeled as a set of multi-period scenarios. The operator exploits a long sh,
but solely applies the decisions made for the first period and waits for
updated data to make the next decisions. This enables cost reduction by
strategically applying dcas prior to the time that they are inevitable while
avoiding them when unneeded. The proposed branch-and-cut-based solution
methodology accurately deals with dcas while applying some expediting
heuristics. During the branching process, a globally convergent trust-region

including the correspondence between rays and pixels, 3D physical points and

grouped into direction parameter set and depth parameter set. A two-step

parameters. The proposed method is able to reuse traditional camera calibration
methods for the direction parameter set. A simply raw image-based calibration
of depth parameter set was further proposed. Systematic validations were
conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed calibration method.

However, to date its clinical applications have been limited by unpredictable
fetal and maternal motion during image acquisition. Even after spatial
realigment, these cause spurious signal fluctuations confounding measures of
functional connectivity and biasing statistical inference of relationships
between connectivity and individual differences. As there is no ground truth

evaluating the efficacy of different regression based methods for removing
motion artifacts after realignment by assessing the residual relationship of

exploiting the leakage in dynamic operations drive rapid development of new SE

systems) works out differently, resulting in breaking of the Hamiltonian
symmetry of spectra; time-reversal asymmetry causes chirality. This interesting

boat-shaped top having misaligned axes of inertia and geometry [Phys. Lett. A

study the 3-dimensional Lie-Poisson systems, and classify the prototypes of

of the underlying Lie algebra; invoking Bianchi's list of all 3-dimensional Lie
algebras, we show that the so-called class-B algebras, which are produced by
asymmetric deformations of the simple algebra so(3), yield chiral spectra when
linearized around their singularities. The theory of deformation is generalized

In a first step we will prove a strong comparison result relating composable
strings of morphisms and coherent diagrams on cubes with support on a path from
the initial to the final object.
  We observe that both structures are equivalent (by passing to higher
analogues of mesh categories) to distinguished coherent diagrams on special
classes of morphism objects in the 2-category of parasimplices. Furthermore, we
show that the notion of distinguished coherent diagrams generalizes well to
arbitrary morphism objects in this 2-category. The resulting categories of
coherent diagrams lead to higher versions of the
$\mathsf{S}_{\bullet}$-construction and are closely related to representations
of higher Auslander algebras of Dynkin quivers of type A.
  Understanding these categories and the functors relating them in general will
require a detailed analysis of the 2-category of parasimplices as well as basic
results from abstract cubical homotopy theory (since subcubes of distinguished
diagrams very often turn out to be bicartesian). Finally, we show that the
previous comparison result extends to a duality theorem on general categories
of distinguished coherent diagrams, as a special case leading to some new
derived equivalences between higher Auslander algebras.

wishes to retrieve a single message from $N$ non-communicating and
non-colluding databases (servers). All servers store the same set of $M$
messages and they respond to the user through a block fading Gaussian Multiple
Access Channel (MAC). The goal in this setting is to keep the index of the
required message private from the servers while minimizing the overall
communication overhead.
  This work provides joint privacy and channel coding retrieval schemes for the
Gaussian MAC with and without fading. The schemes exploit the linearity of the
channel while using the Compute and Forward (CF) coding scheme. Consequently,
single-user encoding and decoding are performed to retrieve the private
message. In the case of a channel without fading, the achievable retrieval rate
is shown to outperform a separation-based scheme, in which the retrieval and
the channel coding are designed separately. Moreover, this rate is
asymptotically optimal as the SNR grows, and are up to a constant gap of $2$
bits per channel use from the channel capacity without privacy constraints, for
all SNR values. When the channel suffers from fading, the asymmetry between the
servers' channels forces a more complicated solution, which involves a hard
optimization problem. Nevertheless, we provide coding scheme and lower bounds
on the expected achievable retrieval rate which are shown to have the same
scaling laws as the channel capacity, both in the number of servers and the

However, most existing works treat each video frame equally and ignore their
temporal interactions. To overcome this drawback, a few methods try to select
some key frames and then perform attacks based on them. Unfortunately, their
selection strategy is independent of the attacking step, therefore the
resulting performance is limited. Instead, we argue the frame selection phase
is closely relevant with the attacking phase. The key frames should be adjusted
according to the attacking results. For that, we formulate the black-box video
attacks into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Specifically, the
environment in RL is set as the recognition model, and the agent in RL plays
the role of frame selecting. By continuously querying the recognition models
and receiving the attacking feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its frame
selection strategy and adversarial perturbations become smaller and smaller. We
conduct a series of experiments with two mainstream video recognition models:
C3D and LRCN on the public UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets. The results

the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a dimer which includes two identical
metal nanoparticles (NPs). Considering the dipole-dipole interaction in a
Drude-like model, an appropriate equation is derived for the permittivity of
each NP. The restoration force related to the classical confinement originating
from the finite size of NPs is considered and an appropriate adjustment
coefficient is considered for this term through analyzing experimental data.
Two different polarizations are considered for the laser beam electric field
and it is shown that the orientation of electric field has essential role in
the linear optical properties of dimer. Numerical investigation is accomplished
for a dimer of gold NPs with two different diameters of 4nm and 20nm. For the
parallel polarization, dipole-dipole interaction leads to the red-shift of SPR
wavelength and increase in its peak value while for the perpendicular
polarization, the absolutely opposite results are derived. For all cases, it is
shown that SPR wavelength functionality with respect to the geometric factor
$a/d$ (NP radius to the separation) can be presented by a cubic equation that
fits better than an exponential one suggested by the earlier studies which
demonstrates the dipole-dipole characteristic of the interaction.

deformation-induced microstructure evolution, microfracture, and microvoid
nucleation are examples of applications for which accurate stress and strain
fields are required. A characteristic feature of these simulations is that the
problem domain is simple (typically a rectilinear representative volume element
(RVE)), but the evolution of internal topological features is extremely
complex. Traditionally, the finite element method (FEM) is used for elasticity
calculations; FEM is nearly ubiquituous due to (1) its ability to handle meshes
of complex geometry using isoparametric elements, and (2) the weak formulation
which eschews the need for computation of second derivatives. However, variable
topology problems (e.g. microstructure evolution) require either remeshing, or
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) - both of which can cause extensive overhead and
limited scaling. Block-structured AMR (BSAMR) is a method for adaptive mesh
refinement that exhibits good scaling and is well-suited for many problems in
materials science. Here, it is shown that the equations of elasticity can be
efficiently solved using BSAMR using the finite difference method. The boundary
operator method is used to treat different types of boundary conditions, and
the ""reflux-free"" method is introduced to efficiently and easily treat the
coarse-fine boundaries that arise in BSAMR. Examples are presented that
demonstrate the use of this method in a variety of cases relevant to materials
science: Eshelby inclusions, fracture, and microstructure evolution. Reasonable
scaling is demonstrated up to $\sim$4000 processors with tens of millions of

a novel method to evaluate the uncertainty of four popular entropy models,
including Shannon, Shannon-Power Low (PL), Tsallis, and Renyi, in shear stress
estimation in circular channels. The Bayesian Monte-Carlo (BMC) uncertainty
method is simplified considering a 95% Confidence Bound (CB). We developed a
new statistic index called as FREEopt-based OCB (FOCB) using the statistical
indices Forecasting Range of Error Estimation (FREE) and the percentage of
observed data in the CB (Nin), which integrates their combined effect. The
Shannon and Shannon PL entropies had close values of the FOCB equal to 8.781

stress values in circular channels followed by traditional uniform flow shear
stress and Tsallis models with close values of 14.491 and 14.895, respectively.
However, Renyi entropy with much higher values of FOCB equal to 57.726 has less
certainty in the estimation of shear stress than other models. Using the
presented results in this study, the amount of confidence in entropy methods in
the calculation of shear stress to design and implement different types of open

different definitions are discussed with special emphasis to its relationship
with the reciprocity concept. Starting from the Onsager reciprocal relations
generally applicable to many physical processes, we present the derivation of
the Lorentz theorem and discuss other implications of reciprocity for
electromagnetic systems. Next, we identify all possible routes towards
engineering nonreciprocal devices and analyze in detail three of them: Based on
external bias, based on nonlinear and time-variant systems. The principles of
the operation of different nonreciprocal devices are explained. We address the
similarity and fundamental difference between nonreciprocal effects and
asymmetric transmission in reciprocal systems. In addition to the tutorial
description of the topic, the manuscript also contains original findings. In
particular, general classification of reciprocal and nonreciprocal phenomena in
linear bianisotropic media based on the space- and time-reversal symmetries is
presented. This classification serves as a powerful tool for drawing analogies
between seemingly distinct effects having the same physical origin and can be
used for predicting novel electromagnetic phenomena. Furthermore,
electromagnetic reciprocity theorem for time-varying systems is derived and its

segmenting targeted parts of MRIs and generating new MRI datasets from random
noise. More specifically, a Deep Neural Network architecture called U-net is
used to segment bones and cartilages of Knee MRIs, and several Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) are compared and tuned to create new realistic and
high quality brain MRIs that can be used as training set for more advanced
models. Three main architectures are described: Deep Convolution GAN (DCGAN),
Super Resolution Residual GAN (SRResGAN) and Progressive GAN (ProGAN), and five
loss functions are tested: the Original loss, LSGAN, WGAN, WGAN_GP and DRAGAN.
Moreover, a quantitative benchmark is carried out thanks to evaluation measures
using Principal Component Analysis. The results show that U-net can achieve
state-of-the-art performance in segmenting bones and cartilages in Knee MRIs
(Accuracy of more than 99.5%). Moreover, the three GAN architectures can
successfully generate realistic brain MRIs even if some models have

one-sided smoothing labels, regularization with gradient penalty in the loss

this paper is to explore the effect of the holdup fraction and interior pipe's
position on the pressure gradient and flow regime. The comparisons indicate
that moving the pipe from an entirely eccentric to a partially eccentric

the inner pipe was changed from a completely eccentric geometry to a less
eccentric configuration, we notice an increase of 48-303 \% of the mean
pressure gradient. Comparatively, cases, where the pipe was moved from a
concentric to a more eccentric configuration, result in less drastic pressure
gradient changes. 2 cases were within 22 \% of the experimental results for
mean, max, and min pressure gradient, while the last two cases exceeded the
minimum and mean pressure gradients by 25-250 %, respectively. We rarely
observed a change of flow regime as an effect of moving the inner pipe; 2 out
of the 8 horizontal cases indicate transition from wavy flow to slug flow or
significantly larger waves. The most prominent and frequent discrepancies
identified were altered slug and wave frequencies. Through the simulations, we
notice that there is an increased pressure gradient accompanying an increased
holdup fraction when the phase-averaged velocities were the same. Corresponding
to a fractional holdup increase of 0.177, 0.244, 0.063, and 0.073, the increase

field. The magnet is at rest and contains electromagnetic momentum, but there
was no obvious mechanical momentum to balance this for momentum conservation.
They concluded that some sort of mechanical momentum, which they called ""hidden
momentum"", was contained in the magnet and ascribed this momentum to
relativistic effects, a contention that was apparently confirmed by Coleman and
Van Vleck. Since then, a magnetic dipole in an electric field has been
considered to have this new form of momentum, but this view ignores the
electromagnetic forces that arise when an electric field is applied to a magnet
or a magnet is formed in an electric field. The electromagnetic forces result
in the magnet gaining electromagnetic momentum and an equal and opposite amount
of mechanical momentum so that it is moving in its original rest frame. This
moving reference frame is erroneously taken to be the rest frame in studies
that purport to show hidden momentum. Here I examine the analysis of Shockley

directly by comparing the predicted flow fields with the ground truth or

objective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically
employed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the
actual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple
measures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring
study for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow
benchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We collected forced-choice paired
comparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To
increase the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired
comparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality
assessment, called artefact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data, we
reconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As
a result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t.
the visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows
the necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for
optical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the
ground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods
dedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we
proposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the
