framework for learning how to make decisions. However, this success relies on
the interactive hand-tuning of a reward function by RL experts. On the other
hand, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to learn a reward function
from readily-obtained human demonstrations. Yet, IRL suffers from two major
limitations: 1) reward ambiguity - there are an infinite number of possible
reward functions that could explain an expert's demonstration and 2)
heterogeneity - human experts adopt varying strategies and preferences, which
makes learning from multiple demonstrators difficult due to the common
assumption that demonstrators seeks to maximize the same reward. In this work,
we propose a method to jointly infer a task goal and humans' strategic
preferences via network distillation. This approach enables us to distill a
robust task reward (addressing reward ambiguity) and to model each strategy's
objective (handling heterogeneity). We demonstrate our algorithm can better
recover task reward and strategy rewards and imitate the strategies in two
simulated tasks and a real-world table tennis task.

line-of-sight (LOS) velocities from observations of the photospheric Si I 10827
A line. This spectral line is routinely observed together with the
chromospheric He I 10830 A triplet as it helps to constrain the atmospheric

Si I 10827 A. We employ synthetic profiles starting from the Bifrost enhanced
network simulation. The profiles are computed solving the radiative transfer
equation, including non-local thermodynamic equilibrium effects on the
determination of the atomic level populations of Si I. We found a good
correlation between the inferred velocities from bisectors taken at different
line profile intensities and the original simulation velocity at given optical
depths. This good correlation means that we can associate bisectors taken at
different line-profile percentages with atmospheric layers that linearly
increase as we scan lower spectral line intensities. We also determined that a
fit to the line-core intensity is robust and reliable, providing information
about atmospheric layers that are above those accessible through bisectors.
Therefore, by combining both methods on the Si I 10827 A line, we can
seamlessly trace the quiet-Sun LOS velocity stratification from the deep
photosphere to higher layers until around $\log \tau = -3.5$ in a fast and
straightforward way. This method is ideal for generating quick-look reference
images for future missions like the Daniel K. Inoue Solar Telescope and the

differential equations with Gaussian noise. Our aim is to provide an abstract
framework which is applicable to a large class of SPDEs and includes many
important cases of nonlinear parabolic problems which are of quasi- or
semilinear type. This first part is on local existence and well-posedness. A
second part in preparation is on blow-up criteria and regularization. Our
theory is formulated in an $L^p$-setting, and because of this we can deal with
nonlinearities in a very efficient way. Applications to several concrete
problems and their quasilinear variants are given. This includes Burger's
equation, the Allen-Cahn equation, the Cahn-Hilliard equation,
reaction-diffusion equations, and the porous media equation. The interplay of
the nonlinearities and the critical spaces of initial data leads to new results
and insights for these SPDEs. The proofs are based on recent developments in
maximal regularity theory for the linearized problem for deterministic and
stochastic evolution equations. In particular, our theory can be seen as a
stochastic version of the theory of critical spaces due to
Pr\""uss-Simonett-Wilke (2018). Sharp weighted time-regularity allow us to deal
with rough initial values and obtain instantaneous regularization results. The
abstract well-posedness results are obtained by a combination of several
sophisticated splitting and truncation arguments.

over-estimate future risk when present realized volatility is high and vice

different questions arise, relevant for applications and theory: What are the
factors which affect the degree of procyclicality? More specifically, how does
the choice of risk measure affect this? How does this behaviour vary with the
choice of realized volatility estimator? How do different underlying model
assumptions influence the pro-cyclical effect? In this paper we consider three
different well-known risk measures (Value-at-Risk, Expected Shortfall,
Expectile), the r-th absolute centred sample moment, for any integer $r>0$, as
realized volatility estimator (this includes the sample variance and the sample
mean absolute deviation around the sample mean) and two models (either an iid
model or an augmented GARCH($p$,$q$) model). We show that the strength of
procyclicality depends on these three factors, the choice of risk measure, the
realized volatility estimator and the model considered. But, no matter the
choices, the procyclicality will always be present.

presented. The viability of the STA model, which is based on a statistical
superconfigurations accounting approach for calculating the atomic and
radiative properties, is examined by comparing and contrasting its results
against the available experimental data and other theoretical calculations.
First, we focus on the emission data. To model the data, the Eulerian
radiation-hydrodynamics code FastRad3D is used in conjunction with STA to
obtain the STA-required inputs, namely, the time-dependent temperature and
density profiles of the Ge plasmas. Consequently, we find that STA results fit
the experimental spectrum [High Energy Density Phys., 6 (2010) 105] reasonably
well. However, careful comparison between experimental and theoretical results
in the photon-energy regions of ~ 1.7 keV shows some degrees of disparity
between the two. This may be due to the non-LTE effects and the presence of
spatial gradients in the sample. Limitations of STA to model the experimental
spectrum precisely is expected and underscoring the difficulty of the present
attempts as the model assumed local thermodynamics equilibrium population
dynamics. Second, we examine the STA calculated multi-frequency opacities,
ionized population fraction and average ionization for a broad range of Ge
plasma conditions. Comparing with a hybrid LTE opacity code which combines the
statistical super-transition-array and fine-structure methods [High Energy
Density Phys., 7 (2011) 234], impressively good agreement is found between the
two calculations.

properties of complex materials. An attractive route to control magnetism with
strain is provided by the piezomagnetic effect, whereby the staggered spin
structure of an antiferromagnet is decompensated by breaking the crystal field
symmetry, which induces a ferrimagnetic polarization. Piezomagnetism is
especially attractive because unlike magnetostriction it couples strain and
magnetization at linear order, and allows for bi-directional control suitable
for memory and spintronics applications. However, its use in functional devices
has so far been hindered by the slow speed and large uniaxial strains required.
Here, we show that the essential features of piezomagnetism can be reproduced
with optical phonons alone, which can be driven by light to large amplitudes
without changing the volume and hence beyond the elastic limits of the
material. We exploit nonlinear, three-phonon mixing to induce the desired
crystal field distortions in the antiferromagnet CoF$_2$. Through this effect,
we generate a ferrimagnetic moment of 0.2 $\mu_B$ per unit cell, nearly three
orders of magnitude larger than achieved with mechanical strain.

elements in BD 03 740, BD -13 3442 and CD -33 1173 and HD 84937. (studied in a
previous paper of this series) are in accord with these trends and lie at the

features, and generally their abundances are in reasonable agreement. For Cr we
find only minimal abundance disagreement between the neutral (mean of
[Cri/Fe]=+0.01) and ionized species (mean of [Crii/Fe]=+0.08), unlike most
studies in the past. The prominent exception is Co, for which the neutral
species indicates a significant overabundance (mean of [Co/H]=-2.53), while no
such enhancement is seen for the ionized species (mean of [Coii/H]=-2.93).
These new stellar abundances, especially the correlations among Sc, Ti, and V,

three-dimensional (3D) continuum and a fully 3D lattice often found in a
condensed matter system. We use a pairing fluctuation theory which includes
self-consistent feedback effects at finite temperatures, and find widespread
pseudogap phenomena beyond the BCS regime. As a consequence of the lattice
periodicity, the superfluid transition temperature $T_c$ decreases with pairing
strength in the BEC regime, where it approaches asymptotically $T_c = \pi
an/2m$, with $a$ being the $s$-wave scattering length, and $n$ ($m$) the
fermion density (mass). In addition, the quasi-two dimensionality leads to fast
growing (absolute value of the) fermionic chemical potential $\mu$ and pairing
gap $\Delta$, which depends exponentially on the ratio $d/a$. Importantly,
$T_c$ at unitarity increases with the lattice constant $d$ and hopping integral
$t$. The effect of the van Hove singularity on $T_c$ is identified. The
superfluid density exhibits $T^{3/2}$ power laws at low $T$, away from the

properties. The galaxy cluster XLSSC 122 was originally detected as a faint,
extended X-ray source in the XMM Large Scale Structure survey and was revealed

redshifts of 1.9 +/- 0.2. Subsequent observations at millimetre wavelengths
detected a Sunyaev-Zel'dovich decrement along the line of sight to XLSSC 122,
thus confirming the existence of hot intracluster gas, while deep imaging
spectroscopy from the European Space Agency's X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission
(XMM-Newton) revealed an extended, X-ray bright gaseous atmosphere with a
virial temperature of 60 million Kelvin, enriched with metals to the same
extent as are local clusters. Here we report rest frame optical spectroscopic

of a parametrized quantum circuit $V(\vec{\theta})$ to minimize a cost function
$C$. While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers,
they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we
rigorously prove two results, assuming $V(\vec{\theta})$ is an alternating
layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result
states that defining $C$ in terms of global observables leads to exponentially
vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when $V(\vec{\theta})$ is
shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed
costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining $C$ with local
observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the
depth of $V(\vec{\theta})$ is $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$. Our results establish a
connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with
large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder
implementation.

that the EPR argument can be developed without using the concept of `element of
physical reality', thus eliminating any philosophical element in the logical
chains of the paper. Deprived of its philosophical ornament, the EPR argument
plainly reduces to require what quantum mechanics can not do: to assign
definite values to two incompatible physical quantities. Hidden variables
theories built up according to Bell - type theorems are formulated on the basis
of the assumption that the locality condition implies the statistical
independence between two measurements space - like separated. This assumption
is valid only with the additional one that statistical dependence between two
measurements requires a causal connection between them. This additional
assumption rules out the possibility that statistical dependence may due to an
intrinsic property of the physical system under study. Therefore, hidden
variables theories are built up with a restriction which leads them to be
disproved by experiment. Quantum mechanical non - locality, invoked for
describing EPR - type experiments, is strictly connected to the hypothesis (NDV
hypothesis) according to which the twin photons of entangled pairs do not have
a definite polarization before measurements. Both hypotheses are used only for
describing EPR experiments and not for making predictions. Therefore, they can
be dropped without reducing the predictive power of quantum mechanics
concerning entangled photons pairs. Furthermore, both hypotheses can be
experimentally tested by a modification of a standard experimental apparatus
designed for studying entangled photons pairs.

a substantial enhancement in the energy distribution consistent with a

these methods are not physically plausible: that is when the recovered spectra
are reintegrated with the underlying camera sensitivities, the resulting

most learning-based SR models train for a fixed exposure setting and we show
that this can result in poor performance when exposure varies.

circumstellar signals (e.g., planets, circumstellar disks) are unavoidably
altered by over-fitting and/or self-subtraction, making forward modeling a
necessity to recover these signals. We present a forward modeling--free

circumstellar signals when the imputation region is relatively small, which
thus enables precise measurement for these circumstellar objects. We apply it
to simulated point source and circumstellar disk observations to demonstrate
its proper recovery of them. We apply it to Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) K1-band

applications. This is a challenging problem as an edge cloud-service provider
may not have sufficient resources to satisfy all resource requests.
Furthermore, allocating available resources optimally to different applications
is also challenging. Resource sharing among different edge cloud-service
providers can address the aforementioned limitation as certain service
providers may have resources available that can be ``rented'' by other service
providers. However, edge cloud service providers can have different objectives
or \emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and effective
mechanism to share resources among service providers, while considering the
different objectives of various providers. We model resource sharing as a
multi-objective optimization problem and present a solution framework based on
\emph{Cooperative Game Theory} (CGT). We consider the strategy where each
service provider allocates resources to its native applications first and
shares the remaining resources with applications from other service providers.
We prove that for a monotonic, non-decreasing utility function, the game is
canonical and convex. Hence, the \emph{core} is not empty and the grand
coalition is stable. We propose two algorithms \emph{Game-theoretic Pareto
optimal allocation} (GPOA) and \emph{Polyandrous-Polygamous Matching based
Pareto Optimal Allocation} (PPMPOA) that provide allocations from the core.
Hence the obtained allocations are \emph{Pareto} optimal and the grand
coalition of all the service providers is stable. Experimental results confirm
that our proposed resource sharing framework improves utilities of edge
cloud-service providers and application request satisfaction.

direct penalization of probabilistic false positives, weighted by label, during

handling a variety of known shortcomings of machine learning, ranging from
imbalanced classes to medical diagnostic error to reinforcement of social bias.
We create scenarios that emulate those issues using the MNIST data set and

novel, simple, and effective deep neural framework, called Skim and Intensive
Reading Model (SIRM), for figuring out implied textual meaning. The proposed
SIRM consists of two main components, namely the skim reading component and
intensive reading component. N-gram features are quickly extracted from the
skim reading component, which is a combination of several convolutional neural
networks, as skim (entire) information. An intensive reading component enables
a hierarchical investigation for both local (sentence) and global (paragraph)
representation, which encapsulates the current embedding and the contextual
information with a dense connection. More specifically, the contextual
information includes the near-neighbor information and the skim information
mentioned above. Finally, besides the normal training loss function, we employ
an adversarial loss function as a penalty over the skim reading component to
eliminate noisy information arisen from special figurative words in the
training data. To verify the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of the
proposed architecture, we conduct extensive comparative experiments on several
sarcasm benchmarks and an industrial spam dataset with metaphors. Experimental
results indicate that (1) the proposed model, which benefits from context
modeling and consideration of figurative language, outperforms existing
state-of-the-art solutions, with comparable parameter scale and training speed;
(2) the SIRM yields superior robustness in terms of parameter size sensitivity;
(3) compared with ablation and addition variants of the SIRM, the final
framework is efficient enough.

reduced for correlators in a ""separable"" form---we define a suitable notion of
separability for cosmological trispectra, and derive formulas for angular
correlators of different separability classes. As an application of our
formalism, we compute the angular galaxy trispectrum at tree level, with and
without primordial non-Gaussianity. This includes effects of redshift space
distortion and bias parameters up to cubic order. We also compute the
non-Gaussian covariance of the angular matter power spectrum due to the
connected four-point function, beyond the Limber approximation. We demonstrate
that, in contrast to the standard lore, the Limber approximation can fail for

Carlo simulations for a spin-fermion model near an $O(3)$ symmetric

scales that emerges near the quantum critical point. At high energy scales,
there is a broad regime characterized by Landau-damped order parameter dynamics
with dynamical critical exponent $z=2$, while the fermionic excitations remain
coherent. The quantum critical magnetic fluctuations are well described by
Hertz-Millis theory, except for a $T^{-2}$ divergence of the static AFM
susceptibility. This regime persists down to a lower energy scale, where the
fermions become overdamped and concomitantly, a transition into a $d-$wave
superconducting state occurs. These findings resemble earlier results for a
spin-fermion model with easy-plane AFM fluctuations of an $O(2)$ SDW order
parameter, despite noticeable differences in the perturbative structure of the
two theories. In the $O(3)$ case, perturbative corrections to the spin-fermion
vertex are expected to dominate at an additional energy scale, below which the
$z=2$ behavior breaks down, leading to a novel $z=1$ fixed point with emergent
local nesting at the hot spots [Schlief et al., PRX 7, 021010 (2017)].
Motivated by this prediction, we also consider a variant of the model where the
hot spots are nearly locally nested. Within the available temperature range in

Hertz-Millis behavior, but no evidence for the predicted $z=1$ criticality.

nearly constant starting from 6 days after first light ($g-r\sim-0.15$ mag),
while the time evolution at earlier epochs is characterized by a continuous
range of slopes, from events rapidly transitioning from redder to bluer colors
(slope of $\sim-0.25$ mag day$^{-1}$) to events with a flatter evolution. The
continuum in the slope distribution is in good agreement both with models

A correlation between the stellar/gas velocity dispersion ($\sigma_{star}$,

observational test of the role of stellar feedback in re-shaping the dark
matter density profile. In this work we test the validity of this prediction by
studying a sample of star-forming galaxies at $0.6<z<1.0$ from the LEGA-C
survey, which provides high signal-to-noise measurements of stellar and gas
kinematics. We find that a weak but significant correlation between
$\sigma_{star}$ (and $\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR indeed exists for galaxies in the
lowest mass bin (M$_\ast\sim10^{10}\,$M$_\odot$). This correlation, albeit with
a $\sim$35% scatter, holds for different tracers of star formation, and becomes
stronger with redshift. This result generally agrees with the picture that at
higher redshifts star formation rate was generally higher, and galaxies at
M$_\ast\lesssim10^{10}\,$M$_\odot$ have not yet settled into a disk. As a
consequence, they have shallower gravitational potentials more easily perturbed
by stellar feedback. The observed correlation between $\sigma_{star}$ (and
$\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR supports the scenario predicted by cosmological
simulations, in which feedback-driven outflows cause fluctuations in the
gravitation potential that flatten the density profiles of low-mass galaxies.

representations. In this article we describe the motivation, construction, and
application of a physical model of solar-system ephemeris uncertainties, which
focuses on the degrees of freedom (Jupiter's orbital elements) most relevant to
gravitational-wave searches with pulsar timing arrays. This model, BayesEphem,
was used to derive ephemeris-robust results in NANOGrav's 11-yr
stochastic-background search, and it provides a foundation for future searches
by NANOGrav and other consortia. The analysis and simulations reported here
suggest that ephemeris modeling reduces the gravitational-wave sensitivity of
the 11-yr dataset; and that this degeneracy will vanish with improved
ephemerides and with the longer pulsar timing datasets that will become
available in the near future.

origins and a set of destinations, using different modes of transport in
Argentina. The input data for the tool is a set of destinations (a
geo-referenced list of points of city amenities or ""opportunities"", such as
firms, schools, hospitals, parks, banks or retail, etc.) and a set of origins
characterized by their geographic coordinates that could be interpreted as
households or other. The tool determines, from each origin, which is the
closest destination, depending on the distance or travel time and the mode of
transport (on foot, by bicycle, by car, and by public transport).
  The sets of origins and destinations are large sets, which can contain up to
several thousand points. We applied and developed algorithms to improve the
scalability of the different parts of the procedure. For the public
transportation network, we pre-processed the reachable lines from each point
and used quad-trees to determine the distance between said points and the bus
line's path.
  A second objective of this project was to rely only on open data, such as
Open Street Map (OSM) data, together with making this tool open source.
Therefore, the successful development and implementation of this tool is
potentially beneficial to both public sector agencies as well as NGOs and other
civil society organizations that focus their work on the design and
implementation of public policies, aimed at improving accessibility in cities
as a way to reduce spatial inequalities and social exclusion.

the importance of CTS to accomplish flexible transmission in N-1

proposed as opposed to current industry practices of static network in
short-term operations. The proposed model is tested and validated on the IEEE

thermonuclear explosions in C/O white dwarfs (WDs), a great deal remains
uncertain about the binary companion that facilitates the explosive disruption
of the WD. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of a large, unique data
set of 127 SNe$\,$Ia with exquisite coverage by the Zwicky Transient Facility
(ZTF). High-cadence (six observations per night) ZTF observations allow us to
measure the SN rise time and examine its initial evolution. We develop a
Bayesian framework to model the early rise as a power law in time, which
enables the inclusion of priors in our model. For a volume-limited subset of
normal SNe$\,$Ia, we find that the mean power-law index is consistent with 2 in
the $r_\mathrm{ZTF}$-band ($\alpha_r = 2.01\pm0.02$), as expected in the
expanding fireball model. There are, however, individual SNe that are clearly
inconsistent with $\alpha_r=2$. We estimate a mean rise time of 18.9$\,$d (with
a range extending from $\sim$15 to 22$\,$d), though this is subject to the
adopted prior. We identify an important, previously unknown, bias whereby the
rise times for higher-redshift SNe within a flux-limited survey are
systematically underestimated. This effect can be partially alleviated if the
power-law index is fixed to $\alpha=2$, in which case we estimate a mean rise
time of 21.7$\,$d (with a range from $\sim$18 to 23$\,$d). The sample includes
a handful of rare and peculiar SNe$\,$Ia. Finally, we conclude with a
discussion of lessons learned from the ZTF sample that can eventually be
applied to observations from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

general relativity, since it asserts that given any generic initial data on a
spacelike hypersurface, the future can be uniquely predicted. However, recently
it has been found that for charged black holes in asymptotically de Sitter
spacetimes, the metric and massless scalar fields can be extended beyond the
Cauchy horizon. This spells doom on the strong cosmic censorship conjecture,
which prohibits precisely this scenario. In this work we try to understand the
genericness of the above situation by studying the effect of NUT charge and
conformally coupled scalar field on the violation of strong cosmic censorship
conjecture for charged asymptotically de Sitter black holes. We have shown that
even in the presence of the NUT charge and a conformally coupled scalar field
strong cosmic censorship conjecture in indeed violated for such black holes
with Cauchy horizon. Moreover, the presence of conformal coupling makes the
situation even worse, in the sense that the scalar field is extendible across
the Cauchy horizon as a $C^{1}$ function. On the other hand, the strong cosmic
censorship conjecture is respected for conformally coupled scalar field in
rotating black hole spacetimes with NUT charge. This reinforces the belief that
possibly for astrophysical black holes, strong cosmic censorship conjecture is
respected, irrespective of the nature of the scalar field.

excellent spatial match to existing Hubble optical and near-infrared
observations of this system. A significant molecular gas mass,
$\sim$9$\times$10$^9$M$_\odot$, is located in between the two nuclei, forming a
clumpy stream kinematically dominated by turbulence, rather than a smooth
rotating disk as previously assumed from lower resolution data. Evidence for
rotation is seen in the gas surrounding the southern nucleus, but not in the
northern one. Dynamical shells can be seen, likely associated with nuclear
supernovae remnants. We further detect the presence of significant high
velocity outflows, some of them reaching velocities $>$500 km/s, affecting a
significant fraction, $\sim$11\% of the molecular gas in the nuclear region.
Inside the spheres of influence of the northern and southern supermassive black

pinned and advances with stick-slip dynamics. The analytical solution of the

randomization of agent parameters and environment conditions to expose the

acceptable performance, the computational complexity required to capture a
large variation of parameters for comprehensive scenarios on a given task such

to theoretically prove and empirically demonstrate that a deep attention

performs as well as training on a dataset with high domain and parameter

  Deconvolution","13 pages, 5 figures",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In applications such as multi-receiver radars and ultrasound array systems,
the observed signals can often be modeled as a linear convolution of an unknown
signal which represents the transmit pulse and sparse filters which describe
the sparse target scenario. The problem of identifying the unknown signal and
the sparse filters is a sparse multichannel blind deconvolution (MBD) problem
and is in general ill-posed. In this paper, we consider the identifiability
problem of sparse-MBD and show that, similar to compressive sensing, it is
possible to identify the sparse filters from compressive measurements of the
output sequences. Specifically, we consider compressible measurements in the
Fourier domain and derive identifiability conditions in a deterministic setup.
Our main results demonstrate that $L$-sparse filters can be identified from
$2L^2$ Fourier measurements from only two coprime channels. We also show that
$2L$ measurements per channel are necessary. The sufficient condition sharpens
as the number of channels increases asymptotically in the number of channels,
it suffices to acquire on the order of $L$ Fourier samples per channel. We also
propose a kernel-based sampling scheme that acquires Fourier measurements from
a commensurate number of time samples. We discuss the gap between the
sufficient and necessary conditions through numerical experiments including
comparing practical reconstruction algorithms. The proposed compressive MBD
results require fewer measurements and fewer channels for identifiability
compared to previous results, which aids in building cost-effective receivers.

  towards applications in flexible electronics: A computational study","Main Paper 23 pages, 13 figures",,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of wrinkles in Graphene Nanoribbons (GNR) and other
two-dimensional (2D) materials significantly alter their mechanical,
electronic, optical properties, which can be either beneficial or detrimental.
Experimentally, it has been observed that during the commonly used growth
process of GNR, water molecules, sourced from ambient humidity, can be diffused
in between GNR and the substrate. The water diffusion causes wrinkle formation
in GNR, which influences its properties. Furthermore, the diffused water
eventually dries, creating the alteration not only in the geometry of Wrinkled
Graphene Nanoribbons (WGNR) but also its features. Computational analysis of
these phenomena can provide an atomistic-level understanding of the phenomena.
Therefore, in this work, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to
model the water diffusion and evaporation in between GNR and its substrate, and
their effect on wrinkle formation and dynamics. Additionally, Density
Functional Theory (DFT)-based analysis is used to characterize the difference
in the electronic structure of WGNR caused by the change in wrinkle geometry.
Our study reveals that the initially distributed wrinkles tend to coalesce to
form a localized wrinkle whose configuration depends on the initial wrinkle
geometry and the amount of diffused water. The wrinkle configuration changes
upon drying, while it remains static until the complete drying. The movement of
the localized wrinkle is the combination of three fundamental modes - bending,
buckling, and sliding. The stress analysis reveals that the maximum stress is
at the base of the wrinkle, and its magnitude is always below the plasticity
limit. The DFT results provide insight into the potential of using the wrinkles
to control the direction of electron flow for the applications in flexible
electronics.

properties, bio-compatibility, and ultra-low friction. Their multiphase
structure leads to a complex interfacial rheology, yet a detailed, microscopic
understanding of hydrogel friction is still emerging. Using a custom-built

polyacrylic acid (PAA), polyacrylamide (PAAm), and agarose hydrogel spheres on
smooth surfaces. We find that at low velocities, friction is controlled by
hydrodynamic flow through the porous hydrogel network, and is inversely
proportional to the characteristic pore size. At high velocities, a mesoscopic,
lubricating liquid film forms between the gel and surface that obeys
elastohydrodynamic theory. Between these regimes, the frictional force
decreases by an order of magnitude and displays slow relaxation over several
minutes. Our results can be interpreted as an interfacial shear thinning of the
polymers with an increasing relaxation time due to the confinement of
entanglements. This transition can be tuned by varying the solvent salt
concentration, solvent viscosity, and sliding geometry at the interface.

similarly well-defined loss function due to the lack of point-wise true values

equal to mean-square-error (MSE) in a standard regression problem. Our loss
function is universally applicable, thus providing a general standard to
evaluate the quality of any model/strategy that predicts the true-lift. We
demonstrate that despite its novel definition, one can still perform gradient
descent directly on this loss function to find the best fit. This leads to a
new way to train any parameter-based model, such as deep neural networks, to

widely used in social and data sciences with the goal of learning latent topics
that emerge, evolve, and fade over time. Previous work on dynamic topic
modeling primarily employ the method of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF),
where slices of the data tensor are each factorized into the product of
lower-dimensional nonnegative matrices. With this approach, however,
information contained in the temporal dimension of the data is often neglected
or underutilized. To overcome this issue, we propose instead adopting the
method of nonnegative CANDECOMP/PARAPAC (CP) tensor decomposition (NNCPD),
where the data tensor is directly decomposed into a minimal sum of outer
products of nonnegative vectors, thereby preserving the temporal information.
The viability of NNCPD is demonstrated through application to both synthetic
and real data, where significantly improved results are obtained compared to
those of typical NMF-based methods. The advantages of NNCPD over such
approaches are studied and discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first time that NNCPD has been utilized for the purpose of dynamic topic
modeling, and our findings will be transformative for both applications and
further developments.

use this approach to couple the helical edges states in a 2D topological

the edge conductance is sensitive to the magnetization state of the CrI3, and
the coupling can be understood in terms of an exchange field from the nearest

find that the nonlinear edge conductance depends on the magnetization of the

produces an extraordinarily large nonreciprocal current that is switched by

approximation $v\in\mathcal{M}$ of an unknown function $u \in \mathcal{V}$ by
minimizing the empirical norm $\|u-v\|_n$. We consider this problem for general
nonlinear subsets and establish error bounds for the empirical best
approximation error. Our results are based on a restricted isometry property
(RIP) which holds in probability and is independent of the nonlinear least
squares setting. Several model classes are examined where analytical statements
can be made about the RIP and the results are compared to existing sample
complexity bounds from the literature. We find that for well-studied model
classes our general bound is weaker but exhibits many of the same properties as
these specialized bounds. Notably, we demonstrate the advantage of an optimal
sampling density (as known for linear spaces) for sets of functions with sparse
representations.

November 2017 by Chandra at a luminosity of $L_{\rm X} =
(7.8\pm0.8)\times10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$. Examination of archival data for NGC
925 reveals that ULX-3 was detected by Swift at a similarly high luminosity in
2011, as well as by XMM-Newton in January 2017 at a much lower luminosity of
$L_{\rm X} = (3.8\pm0.5)\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. With an additional Chandra
non-detection in 2005, this object demonstrates a high dynamic range of flux of
factor >26. In its high-luminosity detections, ULX-3 exhibits a hard power-law
spectrum with $\Gamma=1.6\pm0.1$, whereas the XMM-Newton detection is slightly
softer, with $\Gamma=1.8^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ and also well-fitted with a broadened
disc model. The long-term light curve is sparsely covered and could be
consistent either with the propeller effect or with a large-amplitude
superorbital period, both of which are seen in ULXs, in particular those with
neutron star accretors. Further systematic monitoring of ULX-3 will allow us to
determine the mechanism by which ULX-3 undergoes its extreme variability and to
better understand the accretion processes of ULXs.

density is one of the most important mechanisms for developing fracture
resistance. A finite element framework for simulating bone adaptation, commonly
called bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed by a novel method to
both quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The
authors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for
modelling fracture is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone
density distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that
configurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed
exclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for
post-processing and enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the
evolving crack front. In this paper density fields are generated from both (a)
bone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry and material
properties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly
evaluate the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have
a spatially smooth density field with higher regularity than if the field is
directly approximated on the finite element mesh. Therefore, discrete density
data is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted Least
Squares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical
simulations for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including
consideration of an equine 3rd metacarpal bone. The degree of bone adaption is
shown to influence both fracture resistance and the resulting crack path.

afterglow emission in the HESS detected GRB 190829A. Swift and Fermi
observations of the prompt phase of this GRB reveal two isolated sub-bursts or
episodes, separated by a quiescent phase. The energetic and the spectral
properties of the first episode are in stark contrast to the second. The first
episode, which has a higher spectral peak of $\sim 120\:\text{keV}$ and a low
isotropic energy $\sim 10^{50}\:\text{erg}$ is an outlier to the Amati
correlation and marginally satisfies the Yonetoku correlation. However, the
energetically dominant second episode has lower peak energy and is consistent
with the above correlations. We compared this GRB to other low luminosity GRBs
(LLGRBs). Prompt emission of LLGRBs also indicates a relativistic shock
breakout origin of the radiation. For GRB 190829A, some of the properties of a
shock breakout origin are satisfied. However, the absence of an accompanying
thermal component and energy above the shock breakout critical limit precludes
a shock breakout origin. In the afterglow, an unusual long-lasting late time
flare of duration $\sim 10^4\:\text{s}$ is observed. We also analyzed the
late-time \fermi-LAT emission that encapsulates the H.E.S.S. detection. Some of
the LAT photons are likely to be associated with the source. All the above
observational facts suggest GRB 190829A is a peculiar low luminosity GRB that
is not powered by a shock breakout, and with an unusual rebrightening due to a
patchy emission or a refreshed shock during the afterglow. Furthermore, our
results show that TeV energy photons seem common in both high luminosity GRBs
and LLGRBs.

potential economic benefits of utilizing the Emergency Power Control (EPC)
functionality of HVDC lines for the provision of fast reserves as a compliment

findings of the paper suggest that the frequency of redispatching actions will
increase in the future and that the cost of security for Nordic TSOs could be

static parameter estimation problems that appear in aerospace engineering
applications is proposed. It is shown how these problems can be recast into a
form suitable for the proposed two-stage estimation process. In the first
stage, linear least squares is used to obtain a subset of the unknown
parameters (set 1), while a residual sampling procedure is used for selecting
initial values for the rest of the parameters (set 2). In the second stage,
depending on the uniqueness of the local minimum, either only the parameters in
the second set need to be re-estimated, or all the parameters will have to be
re-estimated simultaneously, by a nonlinear constrained optimization. The
estimates from the first stage are used as initial conditions for the second
stage optimizer. It is shown that this approach alleviates the sensitivity to
initial conditions and minimizes the likelihood of converging to an incorrect
local minimum of the nonlinear cost function. An error bound analysis is
presented to show that the first stage can be solved in such a way that the
total cost function will be driven to the optimal cost, and the difference has
an upper bound. Two tutorial examples are used to show how to implement this
estimator and compare its performance to other similar nonlinear estimators.
Finally, the estimator is used on a 5-hole Pitot tube calibration problem using
flight test data collected from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which

significance level. The lag of the $\gamma$-ray relative to 15 GHz is
$-60^{+5}_{-10}$ days, translating to a distance $3.18^{+0.50}_{-0.27}$ parsec
(pc) between them. Within uncertainties, the locations of the $\gamma$-ray and
optical emitting regions are roughly the same, and are away from the jet base
within $1.2$ pc. The derived magnetic field in optical and $\gamma$-ray
emitting regions is about $0.36$ G. The logarithm of $\gamma$-ray flux is
significantly linearly correlated with that of $V$ band fluxes, which can be
explained by the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) process, the external Compton
(EC) processes, or the combination of them. We find a significant linear
correlation in the plot of $\log\prod$ (polarization degree) versus $\log \nu
F_{\nu}$ at $V$ band, and use the empirical relation $\Pi \sim \sin^n \theta'$
($\theta'$ is the observing angle in the comoving frame blob) to explain it.
The behaviors of color index (generally redder when brighter at the active
state) and $\gamma$-ray spectral index (softer when brighter) could be well
explained by the twisted jet model. These findings suggest that the curvature

interpretation, which undermines confidence in their use for important
applications. Nevertheless, they are consistently utilized in many
applications, consequential to humans' lives, mostly because of their better
performance. Therefore, there is a great need for computational methods that
can explain, audit, and debug such models. Here, we use flip points to
accomplish these goals for deep learning models with continuous output scores
(e.g., computed by softmax), used in social applications. A flip point is any
point that lies on the boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a model
with a binary yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal
scores for ""yes"" and ""no"". The flip point closest to a given input is of
particular importance because it reveals the least changes in the input that
would change a model's classification, and we show that it is the solution to a
well-posed optimization problem. Flip points also enable us to systematically
study the decision boundaries of a deep learning classifier. The resulting
insight into the decision boundaries of a deep model can clearly explain the
model's output on the individual-level, via an explanation report that is
understandable by non-experts. We also develop a procedure to understand and
audit model behavior towards groups of people. Flip points can also be used to
alter the decision boundaries in order to improve undesirable behaviors. We
demonstrate our methods by investigating several models trained on standard
datasets used in social applications of machine learning. We also identify the
features that are most responsible for particular classifications and
misclassifications.

time-varying environments. We formulate the general trajectory optimization
problem within the framework of time-varying constrained convex optimization
and proposed a novel version of the online gradient ascent algorithm for such
problems. Moreover, the gradient feedback is noisy and allows us to use the
proposed algorithm for a range of practical applications where it is difficult
to acquire the true gradient. In contrast to the most available literature, we
present the offline sublinear regret of the proposed algorithm up to the path
length variations of the optimal offline solution, the cumulative gradient, and
the error in the gradient variations. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound
on the offline dynamic regret, which defines the optimality of any trajectory.
  To show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we consider two practical
problems of interest. First, we consider a device to device (D2D)
communications setting, and the goal is to design a user trajectory while
maximizing its connectivity to the internet. The second problem is associated
with the online planning of energy-efficient trajectories for unmanned surface
vehicles (USV) under strong disturbances in ocean environments with both static
and dynamic goal locations. The detailed simulation results demonstrate the
significance of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real data sets. Video

from more accurate fluoroscopy data via calibration. This paper presents a
robust self-calibration algorithm suitable for single-plane and dual-plane
fluoroscopy. A three-dimensional (3D) target field was imaged by the
fluoroscope in a strong geometric network configuration. The unknown 3D
positions of targets and the fluoroscope pose were estimated simultaneously by
maximizing the likelihood of the Student-t probability distribution function. A
smoothed k-nearest neighbour (kNN) regression is then used to model the
deterministic component of the image reprojection error of the robust bundle
adjustment. The Maximum Likelihood Estimation step and the kNN regression step
are then repeated iteratively until convergence. Four different error modeling
schemes were compared while varying the quantity of training images. It was
found that using a smoothed kNN regression can automatically model the
systematic errors in fluoroscopy with similar accuracy as a human expert using
a small training dataset. When all training images were used, the 3D mapping
error was reduced from 0.61-0.83 mm to 0.04 mm post-calibration (94.2-95.7%

0.20-0.21 pixels (83.2-83.8% improvement). When using biplanar fluoroscopy, the
3D measurement accuracy of the system improved from 0.60 mm to 0.32 mm (47.2%

  conditional GAN in cytopathological digital slides",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multi-focus image fusion technologies compress different focus depth images
into an image in which most objects are in focus. However, although existing
image fusion techniques, including traditional algorithms and deep
learning-based algorithms, can generate high-quality fused images, they need
multiple images with different focus depths in the same field of view. This
criterion may not be met in some cases where time efficiency is required or the
hardware is insufficient. The problem is especially prominent in large-size
whole slide images. This paper focused on the multi-focus image fusion of
cytopathological digital slide images, and proposed a novel method for
generating fused images from single-focus or few-focus images based on
conditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Through the adversarial
learning of the generator and discriminator, the method is capable of
generating fused images with clear textures and large depth of field. Combined
with the characteristics of cytopathological images, this paper designs a new
generator architecture combining U-Net and DenseBlock, which can effectively
improve the network's receptive field and comprehensively encode image
features. Meanwhile, this paper develops a semantic segmentation network that
identifies the blurred regions in cytopathological images. By integrating the
network into the generative model, the quality of the generated fused images is
effectively improved. Our method can generate fused images from only
single-focus or few-focus images, thereby avoiding the problem of collecting
multiple images of different focus depths with increased time and hardware
costs. Furthermore, our model is designed to learn the direct mapping of input
source images to fused images without the need to manually design complex
activity level measurements and fusion rules as in traditional methods.

fairness, auction has been widely applied in this heterogeneous resource

mechanisms have been proposed. However, they fail to protect the bid privacy of
users from being inferred from the auction results. In this paper, we design a
differentially private combinatorial cloud auction mechanism (DPCA) to address
this privacy issue. Technically, we employ the exponential mechanism to compute
a clearing unit price vector with a probability proportional to the
corresponding revenue. We further improve the mechanism to reduce the running
time while maintaining high revenues, by computing a single clearing unit
price, or a subgroup of clearing unit prices at a time, resulting in the
improved mechanisms DPCA-S and its generalized version DPCA-M, respectively. We
theoretically prove that our mechanisms can guarantee differential privacy,
approximate truthfulness and high revenue. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DPCA can generate near-optimal revenues at the price of
relatively high time complexity, while the improved mechanisms achieve a
tunable trade-off between auction revenue and running time.

composite quantum system comprising of a few lower-dimensional subsystems. In a
more general approach, it has been shown that fewer body correlations can
reveal the non-local nature of the correlations arising from a quantum
mechanical description of nature. Such tests on the correlations can be
transformed to a semi-definite program (SDP). This study reports the
experimental implementation of a local measurement-based hierarchy on the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hardware utilizing three nuclear spins as
qubits. The protocol has been experimentally tested on genuinely entangled
tripartite states such as W state, GHZ state and a few graph states. In all the
cases, the experimentally measured correlations were used to formulate the SDP,
using linear constraints on the entries of the moment matrix. We observed that
for each genuinely entangled state, the SDP failed to find a semi-definite
positive moment matrix consistent with the experimental data. This implies that
the observed correlations can not arise from local measurements on a separable
state and are hence non-local in nature, and also confirms that the states

challenges when applied to 3D medical volumetric data (i.e., CT and MR images)
due to the high memory cost and anisotropic resolution, which adversely affect
their performance. Furthermore, mainstream SISR methods are designed to work
over specific upsampling factors, which makes them ineffective in clinical
practice. In this paper, we introduce a Spatially Aware Interpolation NeTwork
(SAINT) for medical slice synthesis to alleviate the memory constraint that
volumetric data poses. Compared to other super-resolution methods, SAINT
utilizes voxel spacing information to provide desirable levels of details, and
allows for the upsampling factor to be determined on the fly. Our evaluations
based on 853 CT scans from four datasets that contain liver, colon, hepatic
vessels, and kidneys show that SAINT consistently outperforms other SISR
methods in terms of medical slice synthesis quality, while using only a single
model to deal with different upsampling factors.

state-of-the-art performance, for many specific inputs a simpler network might
already suffice. Existing works exploited this observation by learning to skip
convolutional layers in an input-dependent manner. However, we argue their
binary decision scheme, i.e., either fully executing or completely bypassing
one layer for a specific input, can be enhanced by introducing finer-grained,
""softer"" decisions. We therefore propose a Dynamic Fractional Skipping (DFS)
framework. The core idea of DFS is to hypothesize layer-wise quantization (to
different bitwidths) as intermediate ""soft"" choices to be made between fully
utilizing and skipping a layer. For each input, DFS dynamically assigns a
bitwidth to both weights and activations of each layer, where fully executing
and skipping could be viewed as two ""extremes"" (i.e., full bitwidth and zero
bitwidth). In this way, DFS can ""fractionally"" exploit a layer's expressive
power during input-adaptive inference, enabling finer-grained
accuracy-computational cost trade-offs. It presents a unified view to link
input-adaptive layer skipping and input-adaptive hybrid quantization. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superior tradeoff between computational
cost and model expressive power (accuracy) achieved by DFS. More visualizations
also indicate a smooth and consistent transition in the DFS behaviors,
especially the learned choices between layer skipping and different
quantizations when the total computational budgets vary, validating our
hypothesis that layer quantization could be viewed as intermediate variants of
layer skipping. Our source code and supplementary material are available at

  Guaranteed Cost Control with Convex Parameterization","12 pages, 7 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper involves the innovative development of a symmetric Gauss-Seidel
ADMM algorithm to solve the H-infinity guaranteed cost control problem. In the
presence of parametric uncertainties, the H-infinity guaranteed cost control
problem generally leads to the large-scale optimization. This is due to the
exponential growth of the number of the extreme systems involved with respect
to the number of parametric uncertainties. In this work, through a variant of
the Youla-Kucera parameterization, the stabilizing controllers are
parameterized in a convex set; yielding the outcome that the H-infinity
guaranteed cost control problem is converted to a convex optimization problem.
Based on an appropriate re-formulation using the Schur complement, it then
renders possible the use of the ADMM algorithm with symmetric Gauss-Seidel
backward and forward sweeps. Significantly, this approach alleviates the
often-times prohibitively heavy computational burden typical in many H-infinity
optimization problems while exhibiting good convergence guarantees, which is
particularly essential for the related large-scale optimization procedures
involved. With this approach, the desired robust stability is ensured, and the
disturbance attenuation is maintained at the minimum level in the presence of
parametric uncertainties. Rather importantly too, with the attained
effectiveness, the methodology thus evidently possesses extensive applicability
in various important controller synthesis problems, such as decentralized
control, sparse control, and output feedback control problems.

self-consistent manner enabling physical interpretation of potential
variability in the primary X-ray emission continuum and/or any emission lines

flux of the source emission (for both objects) has remained almost constant
throughout all the observations, displaying only minor variability in some
spectral parameters and the source flux (largest variation is a ~25% drop in
the flux of Swift J1756.9-2508). We note a striking variability of the Fe

in 4U 1543-624 and ~170 eV in Swift J1756.9-2508, to non-detections with upper

the screening of the Fe K$\alpha$ line by the overabundant oxygen in the

strong correlation between the Fe K${\alpha}$ line strength and the abundance

benzene, naphthalene to perylene and coronene) and of various degrees of

show that for Lepton FDM, such a structure can naturally arise from an extra
dimensional setup. The extra dimension is taken to be flat, with the dark
matter and mediator fields confined to a brane on one end of the extra
dimension, and the Higgs field to a brane on the other end. The Standard Model
fermion and gauge fields are the zero modes of corresponding bulk fields with
appropriate boundary conditions. Global flavor symmetries exist in the bulk and
on the FDM brane, while they are broken on the Higgs brane. Flavor violating
processes arise due to the misalignment of bases for which the interactions on
the two branes are diagonalized, and their size can be controlled by a choice
of the lepton profiles along the extra dimension. By studying the parameter
space for the model, we show that when relic abundance and indirect detection

In this paper, we propose a new Chinese keyword spotter for natural images,

by text line detection. Firstly, proposals of text lines are generated by
Faster R-CNN;Then, text line masks and keyword masks are predicted by

spectral analysis we use both phenomenological and physics-based models. We
employ an often used empirical model to identify the main characteristics of
the spectral shape in relation to nominal spectral characteristics of X-ray
pulsars. Additionally, we used the latest version of Bulk \& Thermal
comptonization model (BW), to assess the validity of the spectral components
required by the empirical model and to investigate the origin of the hard X-ray
emission. We also analyzed the source light-curve, studying the pulse shape at
different energy ranges and tracking the spectral evolution with pulse phase by
using the model independent hardness ratio (HR). Results: We find that while
both the empirical and physical (BW) spectral models can produce good spectral
fits, the BW model returns physically plausible best-fit values for the source
parameters and does not require any additional spectral components to the
non-thermal, accretion column emission. The BW model also yielded an estimation
of the neutron star magnetic field placing it in the 10^12G range. Conclusions:
Our results, show that the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source
emission are consistent with the scattering processes expected for radiation
dominated shocks within the accretion column of highly magnetized accreting
neutron stars. We further indicate that physically-derived spectral models such
as BW, can be used to tentatively infer fundamental source parameters, in the
absence of more direct observational signatures.

Currently, it is estimated that CS has been adapted to over 60 languages;

proposes a novel and efficient Mandarin Chinese CS system, satisfying the main
criterion that the hand coding constitutes a complement to the lips movements.
We propose to code vowels [i, u, y] as semiconsonants when they are followed by
other Mandarin finals, which reduces the number of Mandarin finals to be coded
from 36 to 16. We establish a coherent similarity between Mandarin Chinese and
French vowels for the remaining 16 vowels, which allows us to take advantage of
the French CS system. Furthermore, by investigating the lips viseme
distribution based on a new corpus, an optimal allocation of the 16 Mandarin
vowels to different hand positions is obtained. A Gaussian classifier was used
to evaluate the average separability of different allocated vowel groups, which
gives 92.08\%, 92.33\%, and 92.73\% for the three speakers, respectively. The
consonants are mainly designed according to their similarities with the French
CS system, as well as some considerations on the special Mandarin consonants.

goal is to develop colloidal particles that mimic and exceed the diversity and
length-scales of atomic and molecular assembly, electrostatically charged
particles cannot change the sign of their surface charge or transform from
monopoles to higher-order multipoles. In liquid-crystal colloids, elastic
interactions between particles arise to minimize the free energy associated
with elastic distortions in the long-range alignment of rod-like molecules
around the particles. In dipolar, quadrupolar and hexadecapolar nematic
colloids, the symmetries of such elastic distortions mimic both electrostatic
multipoles and the outmost occupied electron shells of atoms. Electric and
magnetic switching, spontaneous transformations and optical control of elastic
multipoles, as well as their interactions with topological defects and surface
boundary conditions, have been demonstrated in such colloids. However, it has
long been understood that elastic monopoles should relax to uniform or
higher-order multipole states because of the elastic torques that they induce.
Here we develop nematic colloids with strong elastic monopole moments and with
elastic torques balanced by optical torques exerted by ambient light. We
demonstrate the monopole-to-quadrupole reconfiguration of these colloidal
particles by unstructured light, which resembles the driving of atoms between
the ground state and various excited states. We show that the sign of the
elastic monopoles can be switched, and that like-charged monopoles attract

addition, current task-specific meta-learning methods may either suffer from
hand-crafted structure design or lack the capability to capture complex

can quickly find the most relevant structure and tailor the learned structure

contributions of vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction, we first
show that for the two-atom system initially prepared in the factorizable
eigenstates $|g_Ag_B\rangle$ and $|e_Ae_B\rangle$, where $g$ and $e$ represent
the ground state and the excited state of a single atom respectively, both
vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction contribute to the average
rate of change of energy of the two-atom system, and the contribution of vacuum
fluctuations is independent of the interatomic separation while that of atomic
radiation reaction is dependent on it. This is contrary to the existing results
in the literature where vacuum fluctuations are interatomic-separation
dependent. However, if the two-atom system is initially prepared in the
unfactorizable symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, the average rate of
change of energy of the two-atom system is never perturbed by the vacuum
fluctuations, but is totally a result of the atomic radiation reaction. We then
consider two special cases of motion of the two-atom system which is initially
prepared in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, i.e., synchronized
inertial motion and synchronized uniform acceleration. In contrast to the
average rate of change of energy of a single uniformly accelerated atom, the
average rate of change of energy of the uniformly accelerated two-atom system
is nonthermal-like. The effects of noninertial motion on the transitions of
states of the two correlated atoms are also discussed.

power grid more complicated and difficult to model and handle. This paper
proposes an approach for the solution of unit commitment (UC) problem
incorporating multiple uncertainties that exist in both wind power and power
grid inherently, consisting of probability, possibility, and interval measures.
To handle the manifold uncertainties in a comprehensive and efficient manner,
the evidence theory (ET) is applied to fuse these uncertain variables into
Dempster-Shafer structure. Moreover, the power loss is introduced into power
balance constraints, and the extended affine arithmetic (EAA) is employed to
evaluate the uncertainty of power loss caused by the propagation of the
aforementioned uncertainties. Regarding the mix-discrete nonlinear
characteristics of the established optimization model, an enhanced grey wolf
optimizer (GWO) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model.
Specifically, the corresponding commitment schedule is determined by a kind of
binary grey wolf optimizer (BGWO), and the economic dispatch (ED) is settled by
GWO. Finally, the IEEE 30-bus test system and a real-sized 183-bus China power
system are studied to demonstrate the validity and scalability of the proposed

Lyrae stars showing the Blazhko effect observed in OGLE-IV to investigate a
possible connection between modulation amplitudes and periods, light curve and
pulsation characteristics. We found that there is no simple monotonic
correlation between any combination of two parameters concerning the Blazhko
and pulsation amplitudes, periods and the shape of the light curves. There are
only systematic limits. There is a bottom limit of the modulation period with
respect to the pulsation period. We also found that the possible range of
modulation amplitudes decreases with increasing pulsation period which could
point towards that the Blazhko effect is suppressed in cooler, larger, more
luminous and less metal abundant bulge RR Lyrae stars. Our investigation
revealed that the distribution of the modulation periods can be described with
two populations of stars with the mean modulation periods of 48 and 186 days.
There is a certain region with a low density of the modulated stars, which we
call the Blazhko valley, in the pulsation period-modulation period plane. Based
on the similarity of the modulation envelopes, basically every star can be
assigned to one of six morphological classes. Double modulation was found in 25
per cent of the studied stars. Only 6.3 per cent of modulated stars belongs to

First, the diameter parameter can be replaced by any contraction-closed

restricted duals and show that the restricted NA dual can provide relaxation
bounds at least as good as the ones obtained by the restricted SW dual. In our
numerical study on two problem classes, one traditional and one novel, we
observe that the proposed LDDR approaches yield significant optimality gap
reductions compared to existing general-purpose bounding methods for MSMIP
problems.

  Problems with Nonlinear Constraints","17 pages, 5 figures",,,,"math.OC cs.DC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Decentralized optimization for non-convex problems are now demanding by many
emerging applications (e.g., smart grids, smart building, etc.). Though
dramatic progress has been achieved in convex problems, the results for
non-convex cases, especially with non-linear constraints, are still largely
unexplored. This is mainly due to the challenges imposed by the non-linearity
and non-convexity, which makes establishing the convergence conditions
bewildered. This paper investigates decentralized optimization for a class of
structured non-convex problems characterized by: (i) nonconvex global objective
function (possibly nonsmooth) and (ii) coupled nonlinear constraints and local
bounded convex constraints w.r.t. the agents. For such problems, a
decentralized approach called Proximal Linearizationbased Decentralized Method
(PLDM) is proposed. Different from the traditional (augmented) Lagrangian-based
methods which usually require the exact (local) optima at each iteration, the
proposed method leverages a proximal linearization-based technique to update
the decision variables iteratively, which makes it computationally efficient
and viable for the non-linear cases. Under some standard conditions, the PLDM
global convergence and local convergence rate to the epsilon-critical points
are studied based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property which holds for most
analytical functions. Finally, the performance and efficacy of the method are
illustrated through a numerical example and an application to multi-zone
heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) control.

constant $c_{d,k}>0$ such that for every $n$-point set $X\subset \mathbb R^d$
there exists a $k$-flat that intersects at least $c_{d,k} n^{d+1-k} -
o(n^{d+1-k})$ of the $(d-k)$-dimensional simplices spanned by $X$. However, the
optimal values of the constants $c_{d,k}$ are mostly unknown. The case $k=0$
(stabbing by a point) has received a great deal of attention.
  In this paper we focus on the case $k=1$ (stabbing by a line). Specifically,
we try to determine the upper bounds yielded by two point sets, known as the
""stretched grid"" and the ""stretched diagonal"". Even though the calculations are
independent of $n$, they are still very complicated, so we resort to analytical
and numerical software methods. We provide strong evidence that, surprisingly,
for $d=4,5,6$ the stretched grid yields better bounds than the stretched
diagonal (unlike for all cases $k=0$ and for the case $(d,k)=(3,1)$, in which
both point sets yield the same bound). Our experiments indicate that the
stretched grid yields $c_{4,1}\leq 0.00457936$, $c_{5,1}\leq 0.000405335$, and
$c_{6,1}\leq 0.0000291323$.

designed by solving optimization problems subject to specific constraints,
which can be formulated as variable or functional optimization. If the
objective and constraint functions of a variable optimization problem can be
derived, standard numerical algorithms can be applied for finding the optimal
solution, which however incur high computational cost when the dimension of the
variable is high. To reduce the on-line computational complexity, learning the
optimal solution as a function of the environment's status by deep neural
networks (DNNs) is an effective approach. DNNs can be trained under the
supervision of optimal solutions, which however, is not applicable to the
scenarios without models or for functional optimization where the optimal
solutions are hard to obtain. If the objective and constraint functions are
unavailable, reinforcement learning can be applied to find the solution of a
functional optimization problem, which is however not tailored to optimization
problems in wireless networks. In this article, we introduce unsupervised and
reinforced-unsupervised learning frameworks for solving both variable and
functional optimization problems without the supervision of the optimal

and the distribution of environment's status is known or unknown, we can invoke
unsupervised learning algorithm. When the mathematical model of the environment
is incomplete, we introduce reinforced-unsupervised learning algorithms that
learn the model by interacting with the environment. Our simulation results
confirm the applicability of these learning frameworks by taking a user
association problem as an example.

rich interplay of photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions in structured
subwavelength arrays of quantum emitters. Here we report on the direct
observation of the cooperative subradiant response of a two-dimensional (2d)
square array of atoms in an optical lattice. We observe a spectral narrowing of
the collective atomic response well below the quantum-limited decay of
individual atoms into free space. Through spatially resolved spectroscopic
measurements, we show that the array acts as an efficient mirror formed by only
a single monolayer of a few hundred atoms. By tuning the atom density in the
array and by changing the ordering of the particles, we are able to control the
cooperative response of the array and elucidate the interplay of spatial order
and dipolar interactions for the collective properties of the ensemble. Bloch
oscillations of the atoms out of the array enable us to dynamically control the
reflectivity of the atomic mirror. Our work demonstrates efficient optical
metamaterial engineering based on structured ensembles of atoms and paves the
way towards the controlled many-body physics with light and novel light-matter

tripartite photonic states and subjecting them to controlled amounts of
dephasing. When the dephasing is applied to all the qubits, we find that the
entanglement is the most fragile quantity, followed by the quantum coherence,
then mutual information. This is in agreement with the widely held expectation
that multipartite quantum correlations are a highly fragile manifestation of

various fields, so far it is still challenging to make it scalable to handle
``big data''. On the other hand, the robustness property is less explored and
there exists only limited theoretical results. Motivated by the need of
handling such data, recently we proposed a novel spectral embedding algorithm,
which we coined Robust and Scalable Embedding via Landmark Diffusion
(ROSELAND). In short, we measure the affinity between two points via a set of
landmarks, which is composed of a small number of points, and ``diffuse'' on
the dataset via the landmark set to achieve a spectral embedding. Roseland can
be viewed as a generalization of the commonly applied spectral embedding
algorithm, the diffusion map (DM), in the sense that it shares various
properties of DM. In this paper, we show that Roseland is not only numerically
scalable, but also preserves the geometric properties via its diffusion nature
under the manifold setup; that is, we theoretically explore the asymptotic
behavior of Roseland under the manifold setup, including handling the
U-statistics-like quantities, and provide a $L^\infty$ spectral convergence
with a rate. Moreover, we offer a high dimensional noise analysis and show that
Roseland is robust to noise. We also compare Roseland with other existing
algorithms with numerical simulations.

  In this paper, we characterize how users read their enterprise emails, and
reveal the various contextual factors that impact reading time. Our approach
starts with a reading time analysis based on the reading events from a major
email platform, followed by a user study to provide explanations for some
discoveries. We identify multiple temporal and user contextual factors that are
correlated with reading time. For instance, email reading time is correlated
with user devices: on desktop reading time increases through the morning and
peaks at noon but on mobile it increases through the evening till midnight. The
reading time is also negatively correlated with the screen size.
  We have established the connection between user status and reading time:
users spend more time reading emails when they have fewer meetings and busy
hours during the day. In addition, we find that users also reread emails across
devices. Among the cross-device reading events, 76% of reread emails are first
visited on mobile and then on desktop. Overall, our study is the first to
characterize enterprise email reading time on a very large scale. The findings
provide insights to develop better metrics and user models for understanding
and improving email interactions.

approaches the periodic orbit's destabilization energy where the stability

further away from the periodic one for a fixed energy. In addition, performing

protocol implementations written in the C language. We assume that each
successful run of a protocol follows the same path through the C code,
justified by the fact that typical security protocols have linear structure. We
then perform symbolic execution of that path to extract a model expressed in a
process calculus similar to the one used by the CryptoVerif tool. The symbolic
execution uses a novel algorithm that allows symbolic variables to represent
bitstrings of potentially unknown length to model incoming protocol messages.
  The extracted models do not use pointer-addressed memory, but they may still
contain low-level details concerning message formats. In the next step we
replace the message formatting expressions by abstract tupling and projection
operators. The properties of these operators, such as the projection operation
being the inverse of the tupling operation, are typically only satisfied with
respect to inputs of correct types. Therefore we typecheck the model to ensure
that all type-safety constraints are satisfied. The resulting model can then be
verified with CryptoVerif to obtain a computational security result directly,
or with ProVerif, to obtain a computational security result by invoking a
computational soundness theorem.
  Our method achieves high automation and does not require user input beyond
what is necessary to specify the properties of the cryptographic primitives and
the desired security goals. We evaluated the method on several protocol
implementations, totalling over 3000 lines of code. The biggest case study was
a 1000-line implementation that was independently written without verification
in mind. We found several flaws that were acknowledged and fixed by the
authors, and were able to verify the fixed code without any further

traditional single-tasking optimization through knowledge transfer between
tasks. However, current multi-tasking optimization algorithms have some
deficiencies. For high similarity problems, the knowledge that can accelerate
the convergence rate of tasks has not been fully taken advantages of. For low
similarity problems, the probability of generating negative transfer is high,
which may result in optimization performance degradation. In addition, some
knowledge transfer methods proposed previously do not fully consider how to
deal with the situation in which the population falls into local optimum. To
solve these issues, a two-stage adaptive knowledge transfer evolutionary
multi-tasking optimization algorithm based on population distribution, labeled
as EMT-PD, is proposed. EMT-PD can accelerate and improve the convergence
performance of tasks based on the knowledge extracted from the probability
model that reflects the search trend of the whole population. At the first
transfer stage, an adaptive weight is used to adjust the step size of
individual's search, which can reduce the impact of negative transfer. At the
second stage of knowledge transfer, the individual's search range is further
adjusted dynamically, which can improve the diversity of population and be
beneficial for jumping out of local optimum. Experimental results on
multi-tasking multi-objective optimization test suites show that EMT-PD is
superior to other six state-of-the-art evolutionary multi/single-tasking
algorithms. To further investigate the effectiveness of EMT-PD on
many-objective optimization problems, a multi-tasking many-objective test suite
is also designed in this paper. The experimental results on the new test suite
also demonstrate the competitiveness of EMT-PD.

consisted of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately
600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations
represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can
collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26
variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The
application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods
are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex
exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving

all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five
afore-mentioned methods. The new methodology is identified as well-performing
in the long run, especially when more than two individual forecasting methods
are combined within its framework. Moreover, the possibility of case-informed
integrations of diverse hydrological forecasting methods within systematic
frameworks is algorithmically investigated and discussed. The related
investigations encompass linear regression analyses, which aim at finding
interpretable relationships between the values of a representative forecasting

highest maximal transmission. Using the transfer matrix formalism, it is shown
that this effect occurs when the two eigenvalues of the transfer matrix

under-luminous super-massive black holes (SMBHs) ever known, offering a rare
opportunity to study the physics of accreting SMBHs at the most quiescent
state. Recent Very Large Array (VLA) observations have detected a radio source
at the nucleus of M32, which is suggested to be the radio counterpart of the
SMBH. To further investigate the radio properties of this nuclear source, we
have conducted follow-up, high-resolution VLA observations in four epochs
between 2015--2017, each with dual frequencies. At 6 GHz, the nuclear source is
resolved under an angular resolution of $\sim$0\farcs4, exhibiting a coreless,
slightly lopsided morphology with a detectable extent of $\sim$2.5 \arcsec
($\sim$10 parsec). No significant variability can be found among the four
epochs. At 15 GHz, no significant emission can be detected within the same
region, pointing to a steep intrinsic radio spectrum (with a 3\,$\sigma$ upper
limit of -1.46 for the spectral index). We discuss possible scenarios for the
nature of this nuclear source and conclude that a stellar origin, in particular
planetary nebulae, X-ray binaries, supernova remnants or diffuse ionized gas
powered by massive stars, can be ruled out.Instead, the observed radio
properties can be explained by synchrotron radiation from a hypothetical wind
driven by the weakly accreting SMBH.

identical molecules (e.g., pyramidal as $NH_3$) that present inversion doubling
due to the internal spatial inversion of their nuclear conformations by
tunneling. The peculiarity of this system lies in the simplicity of this type
of molecular system in which two near levels can be connected by allowed
electric dipole transition with considerable value of the dipole moment
transition and negligible spontaneous emission because the transition is in the
microwave or far-infrared range. These properties give place to entanglement
states oscillating by free evolution with frequency determined by the
dipole-dipole interaction and negligible spontaneous decay, which allows to
consider an efficient quantum Zeno effect by frequent measurements of one of
the entangled states. If the molecules are initially both in the upper (or
lower) eigenstate, the system evolves under an external radiation field, which
can induce oscillations of the generated entangled states, with frequency of
the order of the Rabi frequency of the field. For a certain detuning, a
symmetric entangled state, eigenstate of the collective system can be
populated, and given its negligible spontaneous emission, could be maintained
for a time only limited by external decoherence processes which could be
minimized. Although the data used are those of the $NH_3$ molecule, other
molecules could present the same advantageous features.

is to use a deterministic approximation of the future which is easier to
understand and solve, but which is criticized for ignoring uncertainty. We show
that a parameterized version of a deterministic lookahead can be an effective
way of handling uncertainty, while enjoying the computational simplicity of a
deterministic lookahead. We present the parameterized lookahead model as a form
of policy for solving a stochastic base model, which is used as the basis for
optimizing the parameterized policy. This approach can handle complex,
high-dimensional state variables, and avoids the usual approximations
associated with scenario trees. We formalize this approach and demonstrate its

Even after these foregrounds are removed, the reconstructed map may not exactly

and offset into the measured correlations. In this paper, we simulate future
surveys of neutral hydrogen using the Horizon Run 4 (HR4) cosmological N-body

combine with foreground radio emission maps from the Global Sky Model, to
create accurate simulations over the entire sky. We simulate the HI sky for the
frequency range 700-800 MHz, matching the sensitivity of the Tianlai
pathfinder. We test the accuracy of the fastICA, PCA and log-polynomial fitting
foreground removal methods to recover the input cosmological angular power
spectrum and measure the parameters. We show the effect of survey noise levels
and beam sizes on the recovered the cosmological constraints. We find that
while the reconstruction removes power from the cosmological 21cm distribution
on large-scales, we can correct for this and recover the input parameters in
the noise-free case. However, the effect of noise and beam size of the Tianlai
pathfinder prevents accurate recovery of the cosmological parameters when using
only intensity mapping information.

two-terminal key agreement model with an eavesdropper that observes a sequence
that is correlated with the sequences observed by the legitimate terminals. The
additions to the model are that the encoder observes a noisy version of a
remote source, and the noisy output and the remote source output together with
an action sequence are given as inputs to the measurement channel at the
decoder. Thus, correlation is introduced between the noise components on the
encoder and decoder measurements. The model with a secret key generated by an
encoder is extended to the randomized models, where a secret-key is embedded to
the encoder. The results are relevant for several user and device
authentication scenarios including physical and biometric identifiers with
multiple measurements that provide diversity and multiplexing gains. To
illustrate the behavior of the rate region, achievable (secret-key rate,
storage-rate, cost) tuples are given for binary identifiers and measurement
channels that can be represented as a mixture of binary symmetric subchannels.
The gains from using an action sequence such as a large secret-key rate at a
significantly small hardware cost, are illustrated to motivate the use of
low-complexity transform-coding algorithms with cost-constrained actions.

$pp$ collisions at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 13 TeV, corresponding to
a total integrated luminosity of 9 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the LHCb experiment.
Referring to these states by their mass, the mass values are \begin{align*}
m(\Omega_b(6316)^-) &= 6315.64\pm0.31\pm0.07\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6330)^-) &= 6330.30\pm0.28\pm0.07\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6340)^-) &= 6339.71\pm0.26\pm0.05\pm0.50 {\rm MeV}, \\
m(\Omega_b(6350)^-) &= 6349.88\pm0.35\pm0.05\pm0.50 {\rm MeV},
\end{align*}where the uncertainties are statistical, systematic and the last is
due to the knowledge of the $\Xi_b^0$ mass. The natural widths of the three
lower mass states are consistent with zero, and the 90% confidence-level upper
limits are determined to be ${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6316)^-)<2.8}$ MeV,
${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6330)^-)<3.1}$ MeV and ${\Gamma(\Omega_b(6340)^-)<1.5}$ MeV.
The natural width of the $\Omega_b(6350)^-$ peak is $1.4^{+1.0}_{-0.8}\pm0.1$
MeV, which is 2.5$\sigma$ from zero and corresponds to an upper limit of 2.8
MeV. The peaks have local significances ranging from 3.6$\sigma$ to
7.2$\sigma$. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the significances
of the $\Omega_b(6316)^-$ and $\Omega_b(6330)^-$ peaks are reduced to
2.1$\sigma$ and 2.6$\sigma$ respectively, while the two higher mass peaks
exceed 5$\sigma$. The observed peaks are consistent with expectations for
excited $\Omega_b^-$ resonances.

typical reaction--diffusion system, which include degenerate diffusion, and
whose non-linearities arise from chemical reactions. We show that there is an
{\it indirect diffusion effect}, i.e. an effective diffusion for the
non-diffusive species which is incurred by a combination of diffusion from
diffusive species and reversible reactions between the species. Deriving new
estimates for such degenerate reaction-diffusion system, we show, by applying
the entropy method, that the solution converges exponentially to equilibrium,
and provide explicit convergence rates and associated constants.

coalescence equation, in particular a family of scaling functions which are
closely related to the different possible critical behaviors. These scaling
functions lead to new conjectures, in particular on the shapes of the critical
trees, that we have checked numerically.

it is very helpful to the deaf people. Automatic CS recognition can help
communications between the deaf people and others. Due to the asynchronous
nature of lips and hand movements, fusion of them in automatic CS recognition
is a challenging problem. In this work, we propose a novel re-synchronization
procedure for multi-modal fusion, which aligns the hand features with lips
feature. It is realized by delaying hand position and hand shape with their
optimal hand preceding time which is derived by investigating the temporal
organizations of hand position and hand shape movements in CS. This
re-synchronization procedure is incorporated into a practical continuous CS
recognition system that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with
multi-stream hidden markov model (MSHMM). A significant improvement of about
4.6\% has been achieved retaining 76.6\% CS phoneme recognition correctness
compared with the state-of-the-art architecture (72.04\%), which did not take
into account the asynchrony of multi-modal fusion in CS. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to tackle the asynchronous multi-modal fusion in the
automatic continuous CS recognition.

inserting Trojans to deliver malicious payloads such as fault injections,
Denial-of-Service (DoS), and information leakage attacks when activated by the
adversary. Simulation results indicate that wordline voltage can be increased

Furthermore, two wordlines or bitlines can be shorted to leak information or
inject faults by exploiting the DRAM's refresh operation. We demonstrate an

fleet of identical vehicles aims at collecting rewards (prizes) available at
given locations, while satisfying restrictions on the travel times. In TOP,
each location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to
maximize the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time
limit. In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner
Team Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset
of mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total
sum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory
location must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based
formulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm
benefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and
works by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some
general connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on
dual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of
inequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut
algorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to
evaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational
experiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several
STOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more
TOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new
optimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in
this work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.

form of prototypical conformal maps for each type of target domain. We then
present solutions for a range of potential flow phenomena including flow
singularities, moving boundaries, uniform flows, straining flows and
circulatory flows. By phrasing the solutions in terms of the transcendental
Schottky--Klein prime function, the ensuing solutions are valid for an
arbitrary number of obstacles per period window. Moreover, our solutions are
exact and do not require any asymptotic approximations.

with absolute bolometric magnitude Mbol. Such a correlation is predicted by
stellar evolution theory. We confirm this relation observationally, using a
sample of 445 stars with precise stellar parameters. It holds over 17 stellar
magnitudes from Mbol = 9.0 mag to -8.0 mag with a scatter of 0.17 mag above
Mbol = -3.0 and 0.29 mag below this value. We then test the relation with 2.2

the same relation holds with a scatter of ~0.2 mag for single stars offering a

given: (i) the meanings of its words, and, (ii) its grammatical structure. The
recently introduced DisCoCirc model extends this to text consisting of multiple
sentences. While in DisCoCat all meanings are fixed, in DisCoCirc each sentence
updates meanings of words. In this paper we explore different update mechanisms
for DisCoCirc, in the case where meaning is encoded in density matrices---which
come with several advantages as compared to vectors.
  Our starting point are two non-commutative update mechanisms, borrowing one
from quantum foundations research, from Leifer and Spekkens. Unfortunately,
neither of these satisfies any desirable algebraic properties, nor are internal
to the meaning category. By passing to double density matrices we do get an
elegant internal diagrammatic update mechanism.
  We also show that (commutative) spiders can be cast as an instance of the
Leifer-Spekkens update mechanism. This result is of interest to quantum
foundations, as it bridges the work in Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM) with
that on conditional quantum states. Our work also underpins implementation of

paper first considers a general class of consensus algorithms, where each
benign agent computes an ""auxiliary point"" based on the received values and
moves its state toward this point. Concerning this generic form, we present
conditions for achieving resilient consensus and obtain a lower bound on the
exponential convergence rate. Assuming that the number of malicious agents is
upper bounded, two specific resilient consensus algorithms are further
developed based on the obtained conditions. Particularly, the first solution,
based on Helly's Theorem, achieves the consensus within the convex hull formed
by the benign agents' initial states, where the auxiliary point can be
efficiently computed through linear programming. On the other hand, the second
algorithm serves as a ""built-in"" security guarantee for standard average
consensus algorithms, in the sense that its performance coincides exactly with
that of the standard ones in the absence of faulty nodes while also resisting
the serious influence of the misbehaving ones in adversarial environment. Some

composed of min-max regret versions of classical 0-1 optimization problems with

state-of-the-art exact algorithms for this class of problems work by solving a
corresponding mixed integer linear programming formulation in a Benders'
decomposition fashion. Each of the possibly exponentially many Benders' cuts is
separated on the fly through the resolution of an instance of the classical 0-1
optimization problem counterpart. Since these separation subproblems may be
NP-hard, not all of them can be modeled by means of linear programming, unless
P = NP. In these cases, the convergence of the aforementioned algorithms are
not guaranteed in a straightforward manner. In fact, to the best of our
knowledge, their finite convergence has not been explicitly proved for any

algorithms through the definition of a logic-based Benders' decomposition
framework and prove their convergence to an optimal solution in a finite number
of iterations. As this framework is applicable to any interval 0-1 min-max
regret problem, its finite optimal convergence also holds in the cases where
the separation subproblems are NP-hard.

solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations with positive cosmological constant.
In accordance with [9][10], we initially derive an uncertainty principle for
the associated spherical and hyperbolical time-slices to highlight the
connection between the classical notion of spatial curvature and the quantum
mechanical uncertainty of position and momentum in de Sitter space (Theorem).
Based on the positive and negative curvatures of these foliations, an
alternative notion of (time-dependent) energy and dark energy of the vacuum is
established. This opens the possibility of a formal derivation of Einstein's
gravitational constant $\kappa$ by matching the dark energy contribution at the
Planck scale at one Planck time after the initial singularity. Moreover, for
the fraction of 70\% dark energy, the age of the universe is estimated to be
about 13.7 billion years. Finally, we verify that the metric corresponding to a
suitable junction of the hyperbolic and the spherical foliation is a solution
of Einstein's field equations. This suggests a cosmology given by a de Sitter
space embedded into an asymptotic Schwarzschild-Anti-de Sitter background.

diverges in the thermodynamic limit while the error is found to grow no faster

the migrating epithelial monolayer are currently unknown. Ten years ago, a
method known as Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) was suggested from which the
intercellular stresses could be computed given a traction field. The core
assumption of MSM is that the intercellular stresses within the monolayer
behave similarly to passive systems like a Hookean solid (an elastic sheet) or
a Newtonian fluid (thin fluid film), implying a relation between the
displacements/velocities and tractions. Due to the lack of independently
measured intercellular stresses, validation of MSM is difficult. An alternative
approach, which we give here, is based on simultaneous measurements of the
monolayer velocity field and the cell/substrate tractions. With limited
assumptions, the velocity field suffices to compute tractions, which we can
then compare directly with those measured by traction force microscopy. We find
that the calculated tractions and measured tractions are uncorrelated. Since
both classical MSM and a purely viscous description of the relation between
displacements or velocities and tractions depends on a linear constitutive law,
it follows that some modification of these approaches is needed. One possible
resolution is the inclusion of an active force. To this end, we give a new
relationship between the active force density and the measured velocity(or
displacement) field, and tractions, which by Newton's laws, must be obeyed.

The appropriateness of using Stokes' Law will be discussed in terms of recent
experimental research in the ballistic or ""coasting"" phase of motion occurring
at a very short time scale. Given the mesoscopic nature of the friction force
for relatively dense fluids, we should expect the agitation force to also be
mesoscopic. But it is often unrealistically modeled as uncorrelated individual
impacts. It has been suggested occasionally that mesoscopic pressure
fluctuations are appropriate for denser fluids. The purpose of this paper is to
model friction as a result of mesoscopic pressure fluctuations. First, the
simple random walk will be used to approximate the time and space scales below
which ballistic motion begins and diffusive motion ends. Following that,
pressure fluctuations and the associated time scale will be introduced to
explain Brownian motion. As successful as the pressure fluctuation model is for
many fluids, it will be shown to fail for fluids like glycerin that have
viscosities a thousand times and more that of water.

in tandem with the high efficiency achieved by machine learning techniques in
regression and classification problems, different artificial intelligence
techniques are adopted model the performance of organic/inorganic
heterojunction UV photodiode. Herein, the performance of a fabricated
Au/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode was explained in details and showed an excellent
responsivity, and detectivity for UV light of intensities ranges from 20 to 80
${mW/cm^2}$. The fabricated photodiodes exhibited a linear current-irradiance
relationship under illumination up to 65 ${mW/cm^2}$. It also exhibits good
response times of ${t_{rise} = 408}$ ms and ${t_{fall} = 490}$ ms. Furthermore,
we have not only fitted the characteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three
classical algorithms; k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural network, and
genetic programming besides using a quantum neural network to predict the
behaviour of the fabricated device. The models have achieved outstanding
results and managed to capture the trend of the target values. The Quantum
Neural Network has been used for the first time to model the photodiode. The
models can be used instead of repeating the fabrication process. This means a
reduction in cost and manufacturing time.
