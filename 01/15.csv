composite $q \bar q$ system in its lowest-energy states lies predominantly in
1+1 dimensions, as in an open string with the quark and the antiquark at its
two ends. Accordingly, we study the lowest-energy states of an open string
$q\bar q$ system in QCD and QED in 1+1 dimensions. We show that $\pi^0, \eta$,
and $\eta'$ can be adequately described as open string $q\bar q$ QCD mesons. By
extrapolating into the $q\bar q$ QED sector in which a quark and an antiquark
interact with the QED interaction, we find an open string isoscalar
$I(J^\pi)$=$0(0^-)$ QED meson state at 17.9$\pm$1.5 MeV and an isovector
$(I(J^\pi)$=$1(0^-), I_3$=0) QED meson state at 36.4$\pm$3.8 MeV. The predicted
masses of the isoscalar and isovector QED mesons are close to the masses of the
hypothetical X17 and E38 particles observed recently, making them good
candidates for these particles. The decay products of QED mesons may show up as
excess $e^+e^-$ and $\gamma \gamma$ pairs in the anomalous soft photon
phenomenon associated with hadron productions in high-energy hadron-proton
collisions and $e^+$-$e^-$ annihilations. Measurements of the invariant masses
of excess $e^+e^-$ and $\gamma \gamma$ pairs will provide tests for the
existence of the open string $q\bar q$ QED mesons. An assembly of gravitating
QED mesons are expected to emit electron-positron pairs and/or gamma rays and
their decay energies and lifetimes will be modified by their gravitational
binding energies. Consequently, a self-gravitating isoscalar QED meson assembly
whose mass $M$ and radius $R$ satisfy $(M/M_\odot)/(R/R_\odot) \gtrsim 4.71
\times 10^5$ will not produce electron-positron pairs nor gamma rays and may be
a good candidate for the primordial dark matter.

spontaneously synchronize. These nonlinear dynamics are the basis for a simple

inherent simplicity and favorable noise characteristics, injection locking has
become a workhorse for coherent amplification and high-fidelity signal
synthesis in applications ranging from precision atomic spectroscopy to
distributed sensing. Within integrated photonics, however, these injection
locking dynamics remain relatively untapped--despite significant potential for
technological and scientific impact. Here, we demonstrate injection locking in
a silicon photonic Brillouin laser for the first time. Injection locking of
this monolithic device is remarkably robust, allowing us to tune the laser
emission by a significant fraction of the Brillouin gain bandwidth. Harnessing
these dynamics, we demonstrate amplification of small signals by more than 23
dB. Moreover, we demonstrate that the injection locking dynamics of this system
are inherently nonreciprocal, yielding unidirectional control and back-scatter
immunity in an all-silicon system. This device physics opens the door to new
strategies for phase noise reduction, low-noise amplification, and back-scatter

Experiments on artificial data and EMNIST demonstrate that theoretical
predictions are indeed verified in practice. In particular, we provide a

homeostatic baseline values in distal pulmonary vascular bed via, a so-called,
homeostatic optimization. To define the vascular homeostasis and total
hemodynamics in the vascular tree, we consider two time-scales: a cardiac cycle
and a longer period of vascular adaptations. An iterative homeostatic
optimization is performed at the slow-time scale and incorporates: an extended
Murray's law, wall metabolic cost function, stress equilibrium, and
hemodynamics. The pulmonary arterial network of small vessels is represented by
a fractal bifurcating tree. The pulsatile blood flow is described by a
Womersley's deformable wall analytical solution. A vessel wall mechanical
response is described by the constrained mixture theory for an orthotropic
membrane and then linearized around mean pressure. Wall material parameters are
characterized by using available porcine pulmonary artery experiments and human
data from literature. Illustrative examples for symmetric and asymmetric
fractal trees are presented to provide homeostatic values in normal subjects.
We also outline the key ideas for the derivation of a temporal multiscale
formalism to justify the proposed one-way coupled system of governing equations
and identify the inherent assumptions. The developed framework demonstrates a
potential for advanced parametric studies and future G&R and hemodynamics

solution in addition to a charge conservation equation which relates the
species concentration to each other. Moreover, momentum and mass conservation
equations are adopted and there solution allows for the calculation of the
advective contribution to the transport in the NP equations.
  The proposed framework is developed by first deriving the numerical model
equations (NMEs) corresponding to the partial differential equations (PDEs)
based on several different time and space discretization schemes, which are
compared to assess solutions accuracy. The derivation also considers various
charge conservation scenarios, which also have pros and cons in terms of speed
and accuracy. Ion transport problems in arbitrary pore networks were considered
and solved using both PNM and finite element method (FEM) solvers. Comparisons
showed an average deviation, in terms of ions concentration, between PNM and
FEM below $5\%$ with the PNM simulations being over ${10}^{4}$ times faster
than the FEM ones for a medium including about ${10}^{4}$ pores. The improved
accuracy is achieved by utilizing more accurate discretization schemes for both
the advective and migrative terms, adopted from the CFD literature. The NMEs
were implemented within the open-source package OpenPNM based on the iterative
Gummel algorithm with relaxation.

propagate to uncertainty in dose and plan quality indicators like dose-volume
histograms (DVHs). Current approaches to quantify and mitigate such
uncertainties rely on explicitly computed error scenarios and are thus subject
to statistical uncertainty and limitations regarding the underlying uncertainty
model. Here we present an alternative, analytical method to approximate moments
of the probability distribution of DVH-points and evaluate its accuracy on
patient data. We use analytical probabilistic modeling (APM) to derive those
moments for individual DVH-points based on the probability distribution over
dose. Further we use the computed moments to parameterize distinct probability
distributions over DVH-points (here normal or beta distributions) to compute
percentiles/$\alpha$-DVHs. The model is then evaluated on three patient cases
in 30- and single-fraction scenarios by assuming the dose to follow a
multivariate normal distribution obtained from APM. The results are compared to
a sampling benchmark. The evaluation of the new probabilistic model against the
sampling benchmark proves its correctness under perfect assumptions as well as
good agreement in realistic conditions. Ca. 90% of all computed expected
DVH-points and their standard deviations agree within 1% volume with their
empirical counterpart from sampling, for both fractionated and single fraction
treatments. $\alpha$-DVHs achieve better agreement with empirical percentiles
when assuming a beta instead of a normal distribution: While in both cases
probabilities show large local deviations (up to $\pm$0.2), the respective
$\alpha$-DVH only showed small deviations (up to $\pm$5% volume for a normal,
and up to 2% for a beta distribution). A previously published model by
different authors yielded substantially deviating $\alpha$-DVHs.

model a metro system as graphs with various topologies and propose a unified
Physical-Virtual Collaboration Graph Network (PVCGN), which can effectively
learn the complex ridership patterns from the tailor-designed graphs.
Specifically, a physical graph is directly built based on the realistic
topology of the studied metro system, while a similarity graph and a
correlation graph are built with virtual topologies under the guidance of the
inter-station passenger flow similarity and correlation. These complementary
graphs are incorporated into a Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (GC-GRU)
for spatial-temporal representation learning. Further, a Fully-Connected Gated
Recurrent Unit (FC-GRU) is also applied to capture the global evolution
tendency. Finally, we develop a Seq2Seq model with GC-GRU and FC-GRU to
forecast the future metro ridership sequentially. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale benchmarks (e.g., Shanghai Metro and Hangzhou Metro) well
demonstrate the superiority of our PVCGN for station-level metro ridership

circuits with noise appearing either before or after each gate, the assumptions
are inappropriate for describing realistic noise that may have strong
gate-dependence and complicated nonlocal effects, and general computing models
such as analog quantum simulators. To address these challenges, we first extend
the scenario, where each computation process, being either digital or analog,
is described by a continuous time evolution. For noise from imperfections of
the engineered Hamiltonian or additional noise operators, we show it can be
effectively suppressed by a novel stochastic QEM method. Since our method only
assumes accurate single qubit controls, it is applicable to all digital quantum
computers and various analog simulators. Meanwhile, errors in the mitigation
procedure can be suppressed by leveraging the Richardson extrapolation method.
As we numerically test our method with various Hamiltonians under energy
relaxation and dephasing noise and digital quantum circuits with additional
two-qubit crosstalk, we show an improvement of simulation accuracy by two

similarity between data include comparing in the original sample space,
comparing in the embedding space from a model performing a certain task, or
fine-tuning a pretrained model with different datasets and evaluating the
performance changes therefrom. However, these practices would suffer from
shallow comparisons, task-specific biases, or extensive time and computations
required to perform comparisons. We present SimEx, a new method for early
prediction of inter-dataset similarity using a set of pretrained autoencoders
each of which is dedicated to reconstructing a specific part of known data.
Specifically, our method takes unknown data samples as input to those
pretrained autoencoders, and evaluate the difference between the reconstructed
output samples against their original input samples. Our intuition is that, the
more similarity exists between the unknown data samples and the part of known
data that an autoencoder was trained with, the better chances there could be
that this autoencoder makes use of its trained knowledge, reconstructing output
samples closer to the originals. We demonstrate that our method achieves more
than 10x speed-up in predicting inter-dataset similarity compared to common
similarity-estimating practices. We also demonstrate that the inter-dataset
similarity estimated by our method is well-correlated with common practices and
outperforms the baselines approaches of comparing at sample- or

is indeed the case. Glyoxal can form through recombination of two HCO radicals
and is then further hydrogenated. Here we aim to constrain the methyl formate,
glycolaldehyde, and ethylene glycol formation on the surface of interstellar
dust grains through this cold and dark formation route. We also probe the
dependence of the grain mantle composition on the initial gas-phase composition
and the dust temperature. A full CO hydrogenation reaction network was built
based on quantum chemical calculations for the rate constants and branching
ratios. This network was used in combination with a microscopic kinetic Monte
Carlo simulation to simulate ice chemistry, taking into account all positional
information. After benchmarking the model against CO-hydrogenation experiments,
simulations under molecular cloud conditions were performed. COMs are formed in
all interstellar conditions we studied, even at temperatures as low as 8 K.
This is because the HCO + HCO reaction can occur when HCO radicals are formed
close to each other and do not require to diffuse. Relatively low abundances of
methyl formate are formed. The final COM abundances depend more on the H-to-CO
ratio and less on temperature. Only above 16 K, where CO build-up is less
efficient, does temperature start to play a role. Molecular hydrogen is
predominantly formed through abstraction reactions on the surface. Our
simulations are in agreement with observed COM ratios for mantles that have

contribution to the matter is twofold: first, we introduce a one-parameter

version of convex hulls, and show that for some choice of $t$, the
corresponding estimator is minimax on the class of models of $C^2$ manifolds
introduced in [Genovese et al., Manifold estimation and singular deconvolution

procedure for the parameter $t$, leading to a minimax adaptive manifold
estimator on this class of models. This selection procedure actually allows us
to recover the Hausdorff distance between the set of observations and $M$, and
can therefore be used as a scale parameter in other settings, such as tangent

orifice due to Rayleigh is shown to constitute an exponentially accurate
approximation in the limit where the aspect ratio of the orifice is large; in
the opposite limit, we derive an algebraically accurate correction, depending
upon the logarithm of the aspect ratio, to the impedance of a circular aperture
in a zero-thickness screen. Viscous effects are considered in the limit of thin
Stokes boundary layers, where a boundary layer analysis in conjunction with a
reciprocity argument provides the perturbation to the impedance as a quadrature
of the basic inviscid flow. We show that for large aspect ratios the latter
perturbation can be captured with exponential accuracy by introducing a second
end correction whose value is calculated to be in between two guesses commonly
used in the literature; we also derive an algebraically accurate approximation
in the small-aspect-ratio limit. The viscous theory reveals that the resistance
exhibits a minimum as a function of aspect ratio, with the orifice radius held
fixed. It is evident that the resistance grows in the long-aspect-ratio limit;
in the opposite limit, resistance is amplified owing to the large velocities
close to the sharp edge of the orifice. The latter amplification arrests only
when the the plate is as thin as the Stokes boundary layer. The analytical
approximations derived in this paper could be used to improve circuit modelling

with many applications. Unfortunately, despite intense study, there are still
no significantly faster algorithms for it than the $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ time
algorithm due to Floyd and Warshall (1962). Somewhat faster algorithms exist
for the vertex-weighted version if fast matrix multiplication may be used.
Yuster (SODA 2009) gave an algorithm running in time $\mathcal{O}(n^{2.842})$,
but no combinatorial, truly subcubic algorithm is known.
  Motivated by the recent framework of efficient parameterized algorithms (or
""FPT in P""), we investigate the influence of the graph parameters clique-width
($cw$) and modular-width ($mw$) on the running times of algorithms for solving
All-Pairs Shortest Paths. We obtain efficient (and combinatorial) parameterized
algorithms on non-negative vertex-weighted graphs of times
$\mathcal{O}(cw^2n^2)$, resp. $\mathcal{O}(mw^2n + n^2)$. If fast matrix
multiplication is allowed then the latter can be improved to
$\mathcal{O}(mw^{1.842}n + n^2)$ using the algorithm of Yuster as a black box.
The algorithm relative to modular-width is adaptive, meaning that the running
time matches the best unparameterized algorithm for parameter value $mw$ equal
to $n$, and they outperform them already for $mw \in \mathcal{O}(n^{1 -
\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon > 0$.

STARAI 2020",,,,"cs.SI cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social networking websites face a constant barrage of spam, unwanted messages
that distract, annoy, and even defraud honest users. These messages tend to be
very short, making them difficult to identify in isolation. Furthermore,
spammers disguise their messages to look legitimate, tricking users into
clicking on links and tricking spam filters into tolerating their malicious
behavior. Thus, some spam filters examine relational structure in the domain,
such as connections among users and messages, to better identify deceptive
content. However, even when it is used, relational structure is often exploited
in an incomplete or ad hoc manner. In this paper, we present Extended
Group-based Graphical models for Spam (EGGS), a general-purpose method for
classifying spam in online social networks. Rather than labeling each message
independently, we group related messages together when they have the same
author, the same content, or other domain-specific connections. To reason about
related messages, we combine two popular methods: stacked graphical learning
(SGL) and probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Both methods capture the idea
that messages are more likely to be spammy when related messages are also
spammy, but they do so in different ways; SGL uses sequential classifier
predictions and PGMs use probabilistic inference. We apply our method to four
different social network domains. EGGS is more accurate than an independent
model in most experimental settings, especially when the correct label is
uncertain. For the PGM implementation, we compare Markov logic networks to
probabilistic soft logic and find that both work well with neither one
dominating, and the combination of SGL and PGMs usually performs better than
either on its own.

bifurcation analysis of a small DRG neuron model in this paper. The model is of
Hodgkin-Huxley type and has 9 state variables. It consists of a
Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.7 and a Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.8 sodium channel, a leak channel, a
delayed rectifier potassium and an A-type transient potassium channel. The
dynamics of this model strongly depends on the maximal conductances of the
voltage-gated ion channels and the external current, which can be adjusted
experimentally. We show that the neuron dynamics are most sensitive to the
Na$\mathrm{_v}$1.8 channel maximal conductance ($\bar{g}_{1.8}$). Numerical
bifurcation analysis shows that depending on $\bar{g}_{1.8}$ and the external
current, different parameter regions can be identified with stable steady
states, periodic firing of action potentials, mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs),
and bistability between stable steady states and stable periodic firing of
action potentials. We illustrate and discuss the transitions between these
different regimes. We further analyze the behavior of MMOs. Within this region,
bifurcation analysis shows a sequence of isolated periodic solution branches
with one large action potential and a number of small amplitude peaks per
period. A closer inspection reveals more complex concatenated MMOs in between
these periodic MMOs branches, forming Farey sequences. Lastly, we also find
small solution windows with aperiodic oscillations, which seem to be chaotic.
The dynamical patterns found here as a function of different parameters contain
information of translational importance as their relation to pain sensation and
its intensity is a potential source of insight into controlling pain.

Instead of the gradient coupling to the lattice distortion associated with
ferroelectricity, we consider a direct coupling between the electrons and the
bosonic ferroelectric field that appears in the presence of spin-orbit
coupling. Working in the weak-coupling regime, we find that the pairing
interaction is dominated by the soft transverse optical (TO) mode, resulting in
a $T_{c}$ enhancement upon approaching the FE-QCP. Focusing on even-parity
states, we find that although the $s$-wave state always wins, states with
higher Cooper-pair angular momentum become close competitors as the TO mode
softens. We show that the cubic anisotropy of the FE fluctuations mixes the
$s$-wave and $g$-wave states, resulting in a characteristic anisotropy of the
gap function. The gap anisotropy behaves non-monotonically as the FE-QCP is
approached: upon decreasing the TO mode frequency, the gap anisotropy first
changes sign and then increases in magnitude. We discuss the possible
applications of our results to the superconducting state of SrTiO$_{3}$.

intermediate temperature superfluid states for relatively low population

of $T_\text{c}$. For large $d$ and/or small $t$, which yield an open Fermi
surface, superfluidity can be readily destroyed by a small amount of population
imbalance $p$. The superfluid phase, especially in the BEC regime, can exist
only for a highly restricted volume of the parameter space. Due to the
continuum-lattice mixing, population imbalance gives rise to a new mechanism
for pair hopping, as assisted by excessive majority fermions, which may lead to
significant enhancement of $T_\text{c}$ on the BEC side of the Feshbach
resonance, and also render $T_\text{c}$ approaching a constant asymptote in the

approaches as well as limited applicability for adoption in new environments.
In this paper, we address the aforementioned challenges faced in person

this end, we study the shifted Drinfeld Yangians $Y_\mu(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and
quantum affine algebras $U_{\mu^+,\mu^-}(L\mathfrak{gl}_n)$, which slightly
generalize their $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-counterparts. Our key observation is that
both algebras admit the RTT type realization when $\mu$ (respectively, $\mu^+$
and $\mu^-$) are antidominant coweights. We prove that $T_D(z)$ are polynomial
in $z$ (up to a rational factor) and obtain explicit simple formulas for those
linear in $z$. This generalizes the recent construction by the first two
authors of linear rational Lax matrices in both trigonometric and higher
$z$-degree directions. Furthermore, we show that all $T_D(z)$ are normalized
limits of those parametrized by $D$ supported away from $\{\infty\}$ (in the
rational case) or $\{0,\infty\}$ (in the trigonometric case). The RTT approach
provides conceptual and elementary proofs for the construction of the coproduct
homomorphisms on shifted Yangians and quantum affine algebras of
$\mathfrak{sl}_n$, previously established via rather tedious computations.
Finally, we establish a close relation between a certain collection of explicit
linear Lax matrices and the well-known parabolic Gelfand-Tsetlin formulas.

measure relationships between education, profession, technical skill level

results demonstrate significant relationships across all variable combinations

relationship. This research has three limitations. Data collection was
dependent upon participant self-reporting and has limited externalized power.
Further, the instrument was constructed under the assumption that all
participants could read English and understood the concept of password
strength. Finally, we did not control for external tool use (i.e., password

outcomes add to the collective understanding of user perception of passwords in
specific and authentication in general. Whereas prior research has explored
similar areas, such work has done so by having participants create passwords.
This work measures perception of pre-generated passwords. The results
demonstrate a need for further investigation into why users continue to rely on
weak passwords. The originality of this work rests in soliciting a broad

improves the tractability of model predictive control (MPC) for high degree of

the input trajectory more than three quarters of the optimization variables
used in traditional MPC can be eliminated with practically no effect on system
performance. This parameterization also leads to trajectories which are more
conservative, producing less overshoot in underdamped systems with modeling
error. In this paper we present two MPC solution methods that make use of this
parameterization. The first uses a convex solver, and the second makes use of
parallel computing on a graphics processing unit (GPU). We show that both
approaches drastically reduce solve times for large DoF, long horizon MPC
problems allowing solutions at real-time rates. Through simulation and hardware
experiments, we show that the parameterized convex solver MPC has faster solve
times than traditional MPC for high DoF cases while still achieving similar
performance. For the GPU-based MPC solution method, we use an evolutionary
algorithm and that we call Evolutionary MPC (EMPC). EMPC is shown to have even
faster solve times for high DoF systems. Solve times for EMPC are shown to
decrease even further through the use of a more powerful GPU. This suggests
that parallelized MPC methods will become even more advantageous with the
improvement and prevalence of GPU technology.

explicit expression over corpus features that serves as a proxy for distance

  An attack on the embedding can affect diverse downstream tasks, demonstrating
for the first time the power of data poisoning in transfer learning scenarios.
We use this attack to manipulate query expansion in information retrieval

consider the problem of designing such balanced databases along with associated
rebalancing schemes which maintain the $r$-balanced property under node removal

$S^{\rm z}$, the domain-wall state $\left| \dots \uparrow \uparrow \uparrow
\uparrow \uparrow \downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \downarrow \dots
\right>$ typically ""melts"". At large times, a non-trivial magnetization profile
develops in an expanding region around the initial position of the domain-wall.
For non-integrable dynamics the melting is diffusive, with entropy production
within a melted region of size $\sqrt{t}$. In contrast, when the evolution is
integrable, ballistic transport dominates and results in a melted region
growing linearly in time, with no extensive entropy production: the spin chain
remains locally in states of zero entropy at any time. Here we show that, for
the integrable spin-$1/2$ XXZ chain, low-energy quantum fluctuations in the
melted region give rise to an emergent Luttinger liquid which, remarkably,
differs from the equilibrium one. The striking feature of this emergent
Luttinger liquid is its quasi-particle charge (or Luttinger parameter $K$)
which acquires a fractal dependence on the XXZ chain anisotropy parameter
$\Delta$.

  Type Circuits","23 Pages, 15 Figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Waveform relaxation (WR) methods are based on partitioning large circuits
into sub-circuits which then are solved separately for multiple time steps in
so-called time windows, and an iteration is used to converge to the global
circuit solution in each time window. Classical WR converges quite slowly,
especially when long time windows are used. To overcome this issue, optimized
WR (OWR) was introduced which is based on optimized transmission conditions
that transfer information between the sub-circuits more efficiently than
classical WR. We study here for the first time the influence of overlapping
sub-circuits in both WR and OWR applied to RC circuits. We give a circuit
interpretation of the new transmission conditions in OWR and derive closed-form
asymptotic expressions for the circuit elements representing the optimization
parameter in OWR. Our analysis shows that the parameter is quite different in
the overlapping case, compared to the nonoverlapping one. We then show
numerically that our optimized choice performs well, also for cases not covered
by our analysis. This paper provides a general methodology to derive optimized

decay of AFM order with doping is too slow compared to the experimental phase
diagram, and further, coexistence of AFM and SC orders occurs in all parameter

Examining the SC order at the atomic scale, within the larger scale $d_{x^2 -

encoded in binary polymer strings. Our work builds on results for string
reconstruction problems using composition multisets [Acharya et al., 2015] and
the unique string reconstruction framework proposed in [Pattabiraman et al.,
2019]. Binary polymer-based data storage systems [Laure et al., 2016] operate
by designing two molecules of significantly different masses to represent the
symbols $\{{0,1\}}$ and perform readouts through noisy tandem mass
spectrometry. Tandem mass spectrometers fragment the strings to be read into
shorter substrings and only report their masses, often with errors due to
imprecise ionization. Modeling the fragmentation process output in terms of
composition multisets allows for designing asymptotically optimal codes capable
of unique reconstruction and the correction of a single mass error
[Pattabiraman et al., 2019] through the use of derivatives of Catalan paths.
Nevertheless, no solutions for multiple-mass error-corrections are currently
known. Our work addresses this issue by describing the first multiple-error
correction codes that use the polynomial factorization approach for the
Turnpike problem [Skiena et al., 1990] and the related factorization described
in [Acharya et al., 2015]. Adding Reed-Solomon type coding redundancy into the
corresponding polynomials allows for correcting $t$ mass errors in polynomial
time using $t^2\, \log\,k$ redundant bits, where $k$ is the information string
length. The redundancy can be improved to $\log\,k + t$. However, no decoding
algorithm that runs polynomial-time in both $t$ and $n$ for this scheme are
currently known, where $n$ is the length of the coded string.

hardware design to better meet the high demands of neural network inference. In
particular, analog computing hardware has been heavily motivated specifically
for accelerating neural networks, based on either electronic, optical or
photonic devices, which may well achieve lower power consumption than
conventional digital electronics. However, these proposed analog accelerators
suffer from the intrinsic noise generated by their physical components, which
makes it challenging to achieve high accuracy on deep neural networks. Hence,
for successful deployment on analog accelerators, it is essential to be able to
train deep neural networks to be robust to random continuous noise in the
network weights, which is a somewhat new challenge in machine learning. In this
paper, we advance the understanding of noisy neural networks. We outline how a
noisy neural network has reduced learning capacity as a result of loss of
mutual information between its input and output. To combat this, we propose
using knowledge distillation combined with noise injection during training to
achieve more noise robust networks, which is demonstrated experimentally across
different networks and datasets, including ImageNet. Our method achieves models
with as much as two times greater noise tolerance compared with the previous
best attempts, which is a significant step towards making analog hardware

the abundance pattern of this DLA, combined with a stochastic chemical
enrichment model, to infer the properties of the enriching stars, finding the
total gas mass of this system to be log10(M_gas/M_sun)=6.3+1.4-0.9 and the
total stellar mass to be log10(M_*/M_sun)=4.8+/-1.3. The current observations
disfavour enrichment by metal-poor Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars with
masses <2.4 Msun, limiting the epoch at which this DLA formed most of its
enriching stars. Our modelling suggests that this DLA formed very few stars
until >1 Gyr after the cosmic reionization of hydrogen and, despite its very
low metallicity (~1/1000 of solar), this DLA appears to have formed most of its
stars in the past few hundred Myr. Combining the inferred star formation
history with evidence that some of the most metal-poor DLAs display an elevated
[C/O] ratio at redshift z<3, we suggest that very metal-poor DLAs may have been
affected by reionization quenching. Finally, given the simplicity and

predicts that dense spheroidal stellar structures invariably grow at early
cosmic time. These primordial spheroids evolve toward a virialized dynamical
status as they finally become today's elliptical galaxies and large bulges at
the center of disk galaxies. However, observations reveal that small bulges in
spiral galaxies are common in the nearby universe. The prevailing belief that
all small bulges form at later times from internal processes occurring in the
disk represents a challenge for the {\Lambda}CDM scenario. Notably, the
coevolution of bulges and central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at early
phases of galaxy evolution is also at stake. However, observations have so far
not provided conclusive evidence against their possible early origin. Here, we
report new observations of small bulges showing that they follow the
mass-velocity dispersion relation expected for virialized systems. Contrary to
previous claims, small bulges bridge the gap between massive ellipticals and
globular clusters. This dynamical picture supports a scenario where systems
over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass form at early cosmic time. These
results alleviate the tension between {\Lambda}CDM simulations and observations
at galactic scales. We hypothesize that these small bulges are actually the
low-mass descendants of compact objects observed at high redshift, also known
as red nuggets, which are consistently produced in cosmological {\Lambda}CDM
simulations. Therefore, this also suggests that the established coevolution of
SMBHs and large bulges naturally extends to spheroids in the low-mass regime.

of -3.4 < [Fe/H] < -2.5. This agrees well with a simple closed-box chemical
enrichment model in this range, but is shallower than previous spectroscopic
MDFs presented in the literature, suggesting that there may be a larger
proportion of metal-poor stars in the inner halo than previously reported. We
identify the Monoceros/TriAnd/ACS/EBS/A13 structure in metallicity space in a
low latitude field in the anticenter direction, and also discuss the
possibility that the inner halo is dominated by a single, large merger event,
but cannot strongly support or refute this idea with the current data. Finally,
based on the MDF of field stars, we estimate the number of expected metal-poor
globular clusters in the Milky Way halo to be 5.4 for [Fe/H] < -2.5 and 1.5 for
[Fe/H] < -3, suggesting that the lack of low metallicity globular clusters in
the Milky Way is not due simply to statistical undersampling.

detail the holographic dual of a non-conformal supersymmetric impurity in the

the Kondo model the CFT is strongly coupled in the holographic regime. The
interface we study preserves $d = 1$ $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetry and flows
to conformal fixed points in both the UV and IR. The interface's UV fixed point
is described by $d = 1$ fermionic degrees of freedom, coupled to a gauge
connection on the CFT target space that is induced by the ADHM construction. We
briefly discuss its field-theoretic properties before shifting our focus to its
holographic dual. We analyze the supergravity dual of this interface RG flow,
first in the probe limit and then including gravitational backreaction. In the
probe limit, the flow is realized by the puffing up of probe branes on an
internal $\mathsf{S}^3$ via the Myers effect. We further identify the
backreacted supergravity configurations dual to the interface fixed points.
These supergravity solutions provide a geometric realization of critical
screening of the defect degrees of freedom. This critical screening arises in a
way similar to the original Kondo model. We compute the $g$-factor both in the
probe brane approximation and using backreacted supergravity solutions, and
show that it decreases from the UV to the IR as required by the $g$-theorem.

star-forming main-sequence (SFMS) galaxies with stellar mass $10^9M_\odot$ at
redshifts $0 \leq z \leq 4$ and perform radiative transfer with SKIRT to model
effects of interstellar medium dust on the emitted stellar light. Assuming a
Milky Way (MW) dust type and a dust-to-metal ratio of 0.3, we find that TNG50
SFMS galaxies generally agree with observationally-derived IRX-$\beta$
relations at $z \lesssim 1$. However, we find a redshift-dependent systematic
offset with respect to empirically-derived local relations, with the TNG50
IRX-$\beta$ relation shifting towards lower $\beta$ and steppening at higher
redshifts. This is partially driven by variations in the dust-uncorrected
UV-slope of galaxies, due to different star-formation histories of galaxies
selected at different cosmic epochs; we suggest the remainder of the effect is
caused by differences in the effective dust attenuation curves (EDACs) of
galaxies as a function of redshift. We find a typical galaxy-to-galaxy
variation of 0.3 dex in IRX at fixed $\beta$, correlated with intrinsic galaxy
properties: galaxies with higher star-formation rates, star-formation
efficiencies, gas metallicities and stellar masses exhibit larger IRX values.
We demonstrate a degeneracy between stellar age, dust geometry and dust
composition: $z=4$ galaxies with a Small Magellanic Cloud dust type follow the
same IRX-$\beta$ relation as low-redshift galaxies with MW dust. We provide a

structures are distinct from the disk or point-like morphologies seen toward
the other Orion protostars. The 0.87 mm emission implies temperatures of 41-170
K, requiring internal heating. The bright 8 mm emission implies masses of 0.5

companion, while another exhibits substructure indicating a
companion-candidate. Three compact outflows are detected, two of which may be
driven by companions, with dynamical times of ~300 to ~400 years. The slowest
outflow may be driven by a first hydrostatic core. These protostars appear to
trace an early phase when the centers of collapsing fragments become optically
thick to their own radiation and compression raises the gas temperature. This
phase is thought to accompany the formation of hydrostatic cores. A key
question is whether these structures are evolving on free fall times of ~100
years, or whether they are evolving on Kelvin-Helmholtz times of several
thousand years. The number of these sources imply a lifetime of ~6000 years, in
closer agreement with the Kelvin-Helmholtz time. In this case, rotational
and/or magnetic support could be slowing the collapse.

This paper introduces a hybrid method that makes the best of both approaches.
For potential signals that are resonant in one known feature, this new method
first learns a parameterized reweighting function to morph a given simulation

signal region and then the reweighted background-only simulation can be used
for supervised learning as well as for background estimation. The background
estimation from the reweighted simulation allows for non-trivial correlations

conform with a universal O/H gradient, as found by empirical IFU studies when

of star formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR) and stellar mass surface
density (Sigma_*) to show that starburst galaxies in the local universe are
driven by SFRs that are preferentially boosted in their central regions. Here,
we present molecular gas maps obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array

Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey. The ALMA
and MaNGA data are well matched in spatial resolution, such that the ALMA maps
of molecular gas surface density (Sigma_H2) can be directly compared with MaNGA
maps at kpc-scale resolution. The combination of Sigma_H2, Sigma_* and
Sigma_SFR at the same resolution allow us to investigate whether central
starbursts are driven primarily by enhancements in star formation efficiency
(SFE) or by increased gas fractions. By computing offsets from the resolved
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (Sigma_H2 vs. Sigma_SFR) and the molecular gas main
sequence (Sigma_* vs. Sigma_H2), we conclude that the primary driver of the
central starburst is an elevated SFE. We also show that the enhancement in
Sigma_SFR is accompanied by a dilution in O/H, consistent with a triggering
that is induced by metal poor gas inflow. These observational signatures are
found in both undisturbed (9/12 galaxies in our sample) and recently merged
galaxies, indicating that both interactions and secular mechanisms contribute
to central starbursts.

CO lines only trace these winds in relatively weak UV environments and are
otherwise dissociated in the wind at the intermediate to high UV fields that
most young stars experience. However, CI traces unsubtle kinematic signatures
of a wind in intermediate UV environments ($\sim1000$G$_0$) and can be used to
place constraints on the kinematics and temperature of the wind. In CI
position-velocity diagrams external photoevaporation results in velocities that
are faster than those from Keplerian rotation alone, as well as emission from
quadrants of position-velocity space in which there would be no Keplerian
emission. This is independent of viewing angle because the wind has components
that are perpendicular to the azimuthal rotation of the disc. At intermediate
viewing angles ($\sim 30-60^\circ$) moment 1 maps also exhibit a twisted
morphology over large scales (unlike other processes that result in twists,

material for star and planet formation. Their structures, meaning the spatial
variations of the disk physical conditions, reflect the underlying mechanisms
that drive those formation processes. Observations of the solids and gas in
these disks, particularly at high resolution, provide fundamental insights on
their mass distributions, dynamical states, and evolutionary behaviors. Over
the past decade, rapid developments in these areas have largely been driven by
observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). This
review highlights the state of observational research on disk structures,
emphasizing three key conclusions that reflect the main branches of the field:
(1) Relationships among disk structure properties are also linked to the
masses, environments, and evolutionary states of their stellar hosts; (2) There
is clear, qualitative evidence for the growth and migration of disk solids,
although the implied evolutionary timescales suggest the classical assumption
of a smooth gas disk is inappropriate; and (3) Small-scale substructures with a
variety of morphologies, locations, scales, and amplitudes -- presumably
tracing local gas pressure maxima -- broadly influence the physical and
observational properties of disks. The last point especially is reshaping the
field, with the recognition that these disk substructures likely trace active
sites of planetesimal growth or are the hallmarks of planetary systems at their

Although there are many studies on using learning-based methods for attack

This approach can lessen the performance of detection systems against
content-based attacks like SQL injection, Cross-site Scripting (XSS), and
various viruses.
  In this work, we propose a framework, called deep intrusion detection (DID)

can process high dimensional data content and, accordingly, discover the
sophisticated relations between the auto extracted features of the traffic. To
evaluate the proposed DID system, we use the CIC-IDS2017 and CSE-CIC-IDS2018

dwarf companions lead to thermonuclear runaways observed as classical nova
eruptions peaking at up to 1 Million solar luminosities. Virtually all nova
progenitors are novalike binaries exhibiting high rates of mass transfer to
their white dwarfs before and after an eruption. It is a puzzle that binaries
indistinguishable from novalikes, but with much lower mass transfer rates, and
resulting dwarf nova outbursts, co-exist at the same orbital periods. Nova
shells surrounding several dwarf novae demonstrate that at least some novae
become dwarf novae between successive nova eruptions, though the mechanisms and
timescales governing mass transfer rate variations are poorly understood. Here
we report simulations of the multiGyr evolution of novae which
self-consistently model every eruption's thermonuclear runaway, mass and
angular momentum losses, feedback due to irradiation and variable mass
transfer, and orbital size and period changes. The simulations reproduce the
observed wide range of mass transfer rates at a given orbital period, with
large and cyclic changes in white dwarf-red dwarf binaries emerging on kyr to
Myr timescales. They also demonstrate that deep hibernation, (complete stoppage
of mass transfer for long periods), occurs only in short-period binaries; that
initially very different binaries converge to become nearly identical systems;
that while almost all prenovae should be novalike binaries, dwarf novae should
also occasionally be observed to give rise to novae; and that the masses of
white dwarfs decrease only slightly while their red dwarf companions are
consumed.

set of unlabeled points that are assumed to be local maxima of an unknown value

(i) a set indicator c, which is a binary classifier, and (ii) a comparator
function h that given two nearby samples, predicts which sample has the higher
value of the unknown function v. Loss terms are used to ensure that all
training samples x are a local maxima of v, according to h and satisfy c(x)=1.
Therefore, c and h provide training signals to each other: a point x' in the
vicinity of x satisfies c(x)=-1 or is deemed by h to be lower in value than x.
We present an algorithm, show an example where it is more efficient to use
local maxima as an indicator function than to employ conventional
classification, and derive a suitable generalization bound. Our experiments
show that the method is able to outperform one-class classification algorithms
in the task of anomaly detection and also provide an additional signal that is

easily obtained, but it is very time-consuming and/or expensive to label them.
So, it is desirable to be able to select the optimal samples to label, so that
a good machine learning model can be trained from a minimum amount of labeled
data. Active learning (AL) has been widely used for this purpose. However, most
existing AL approaches are supervised: they train an initial model from a small
amount of labeled samples, query new samples based on the model, and then
update the model iteratively. Few of them have considered the completely
unsupervised AL problem, i.e., starting from zero, how to optimally select the
very first few samples to label, without knowing any label information at all.
This problem is very challenging, as no label information can be utilized. This
paper studies unsupervised pool-based AL for linear regression problems. We
propose a novel AL approach that considers simultaneously the informativeness,
representativeness, and diversity, three essential criteria in AL. Extensive
experiments on 14 datasets from various application domains, using three
different linear regression models (ridge regression, LASSO, and linear support
vector regression), demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Researchers typically specify covariance matrices in logit mixture models under

(allowing correlations between all random coefficients), or a restricted
diagonal matrix (allowing no correlations at all). Our objective is to find
optimal subsets of correlated coefficients for which we estimate covariances.
We propose a new estimator, called MISC, that uses a mixed-integer optimization
(MIO) program to find an optimal block diagonal structure specification for the
covariance matrix, corresponding to subsets of correlated coefficients, for any
desired sparsity level using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior draws
from the unrestricted full covariance matrix. The optimal sparsity level of the
covariance matrix is determined using out-of-sample validation. We demonstrate
the ability of MISC to correctly recover the true covariance structure from
synthetic data. In an empirical illustration using a stated preference survey
on modes of transportation, we use MISC to obtain a sparse covariance matrix

graph whose nodes label the data and the edges capture dependencies among

GSP, generalizes the Discrete Signal Processing (DSP) shift operator $z^{-1}$.
The (right) eigenvectors of the shift $A$ (graph spectral components)
diagonalize $A$ and lead to a graph Fourier basis $F$ that provides a graph
spectral representation of the graph signal. The inverse of the (matrix of the)
graph Fourier basis $F$ is the Graph Fourier transform (GFT), $F^{-1}$. Often,
including in real world examples, this diagonalization is numerically unstable.
This paper develops an approach to compute an accurate approximation to $F$ and
$F^{-1}$, while insuring their numerical stability, by means of solving a non
convex optimization problem. To address the non-convexity, we propose an
algorithm, the stable graph Fourier basis algorithm (SGFA) that we prove to
exponentially increase the accuracy of the approximating $F$ per iteration.
Likewise, we can apply SGFA to $A^H$ and, hence, approximate the stable left
eigenvectors for the graph shift $A$ and directly compute the GFT. We evaluate
empirically the quality of SGFA by applying it to graph shifts $A$ drawn from
two real world problems, the 2004 US political blogs graph and the Manhattan
road map, carrying out a comprehensive study on tradeoffs between different
SGFA parameters. We also confirm our conclusions by applying SGFA on very

along with a linear model for how the amplitudes of these modes evolve in time.
Recently, DMD has been extended to work with more realistic data that is
under-resolved either in time or space, or with data collected in the same
spatial domain over multiple independent time windows. In this work, we develop
an extension to DMD to synthesize globally consistent modes from velocity
fields collected independently in multiple partially overlapping spatial
domains. We propose a tractable optimization to identify modes that span
multiple windows and align their phases to be consistent in the overlapping
regions. First, we demonstrate this approach on data from direct numerical
simulation, where it is possible to split the data into overlapping domains and
benchmark against ground-truth modes. We consider the laminar flow past a
cylinder as an example with distinct frequencies, along with the spatially
developing mixing layer, which exhibits a frequency spectrum that evolves
continuously as the measurement window moves downstream. Next, we analyze
experimental velocity fields from PIV in six overlapping domains in the wake of
a cross-flow turbine. On the numerical examples, we demonstrate the robustness
of this approach to increasing measurement noise and decreasing size of the
overlap regions. In all cases, it is possible to obtain a phase-aligned,
composite reconstruction of the full time-resolved flow field from the
phase-consistent modes over the entire domain.

of infinitesimal perturbations in a stellar model. Modes which are calculated
to be linearly driven should increase their amplitudes exponentially with time;
the fact that nearly constant amplitudes are usually observed is evidence that
nonlinear mechanisms inhibit the growth of finite amplitude pulsations. Models
predict that the mass of convection zones in pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere
(DAV) white dwarfs is very sensitive to temperature (i.e., $M_{\rm CZ} \propto
T_{\rm eff}^{-90}$), leading to the possibility that even low-amplitude
pulsators may experience significant nonlinear effects. In particular, the
outer turning point of finite-amplitude g-mode pulsations can vary with the
local surface temperature, producing a reflected wave that is out of phase with
what is required for a standing wave. This can lead to a lack of coherence of
the mode and a reduction in its global amplitude. In this paper we show that:
(1) whether a mode is calculated to propagate to the base of the convection
zone is an accurate predictor of its width in the Fourier spectrum, (2) the
phase shifts produced by reflection from the outer turning point are large
enough to produce significant damping, and (3) amplitudes and periods are
predicted to increase from the blue edge to the middle of the instability
strip, and subsequently decrease as the red edge is approached. This amplitude
decrease is in agreement with the observational data while the period decrease
has not yet been systematically studied.

structures that maintain a subset of $n$ points from a universe consisting of
$m=n^{1+\Omega(1)}$ points. A data structure is defined to be non-adaptive when
the memory locations that are chosen to be accessed during a query depend only
on the query inputs and not on the contents of memory. We prove an $\Omega(\log
m / \log (sw/n\log m))$ static cell probe complexity lower bound for
non-adaptive data structures that solve the fundamental dictionary problem
where $s$ denotes the space of the data structure in the number of cells and
$w$ is the cell size in bits. Our lower bounds hold for all word sizes
including the bit probe model ($w = 1$) and are matched by the upper bounds of
Boninger et al. [FSTTCS'17].
  Our results imply a sharp dichotomy between dictionary data structures with
one round of adaptive and at least two rounds of adaptivity. We show that
$O(1)$, or $O(\log^{1-\epsilon}(m))$, overhead dictionary constructions are
only achievable with at least two rounds of adaptivity. In particular, we show
that many $O(1)$ dictionary constructions with two rounds of adaptivity such as
cuckoo hashing are optimal in terms of adaptivity. On the other hand,
non-adaptive dictionaries must use significantly more overhead.
  Finally, our results also imply static lower bounds for the non-adaptive
predecessor problem. Our static lower bounds peak higher than the previous,
best known lower bounds of $\Omega(\log m / \log w)$ for the dynamic
predecessor problem by Boninger et al. [FSTTCS'17] and Ramamoorthy and Rao

point can fit in a single cell $w = \Theta(\log m)$. Furthermore, our results
are stronger as they apply to the static setting unlike the previous lower

The

dynamics exhibited by such networks. Of particular interest in such models are
theoretical predictions of spike train statistics. However, due to the
moment-closure problem, approximations are inevitable. We suggest here a series
expansion that explains how higher-order moments couple to lower-order ones.
Our approach makes predictions in terms of certain integrals, the so-called
loop integrals. In previous studies these integrals have been evaluated
numerically, but numerical instabilities are sometimes encountered rendering
the results unreliable. Analytic solutions are presented here to overcome this
problem, and to arrive at more robust evaluations. We were able to deduce these
analytic solutions by switching to Fourier space and making use of complex
analysis, specifically Cauchy's residue theorem. We formalized the loop
integrals and explicitly solved them for specific response functions. To
quantify the importance of these corrections for spike train cumulants, we
numerically simulated spiking networks and compared their sample statistics to
our theoretical predictions. Our results demonstrate that the magnitude of the
nonlinear corrections depends on the working point of the nonlinear network
dynamics, and that it is related to the eigenvalues of the mean-field stability
matrix. For our example, the corrections for the firing rates are in the range
between 4 % and 21 % on average. Precise and robust predictions of spike train
statistics accounting for nonlinear effects are, for example, highly relevant
for theories involving spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP).

traditional action recognition with short, relatively homogeneous video clips.
In this paper, we investigate the problem of recognizing long and complex

literature but is a practical challenge. Our work is inspired in part by how
humans identify events with varying rhythms: quickly catching frames
contributing most to a specific event. We propose a two-stage \emph{end-to-end}
framework, in which the first stage selects the most significant frames while
the second stage recognizes the event using the selected frames. Our model
needs only \emph{event-level labels} in the training stage, and thus is more
practical when the sub-activity labels are missing or difficult to obtain. The
results of extensive experiments show that our model can achieve significant
improvement in event recognition from long videos while maintaining high
accuracy even if the test videos suffer from severe rhythm changes. This
demonstrates the potential of our method for real-world video-based
applications, where test and training videos can differ drastically in rhythms

  Dungeons for The Legend of Zelda","Congress on Evolutionary Computation 2020",,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated their ability to
learn patterns in data and produce new exemplars similar to, but different
from, their training set in several domains, including video games. However,
GANs have a fixed output size, so creating levels of arbitrary size for a
dungeon crawling game is difficult. GANs also have trouble encoding semantic
requirements that make levels interesting and playable. This paper combines a
GAN approach to generating individual rooms with a graph grammar approach to
combining rooms into a dungeon. The GAN captures design principles of
individual rooms, but the graph grammar organizes rooms into a global layout
with a sequence of obstacles determined by a designer. Room data from The
Legend of Zelda is used to train the GAN. This approach is validated by a user
study, showing that GAN dungeons are as enjoyable to play as a level from the
original game, and levels generated with a graph grammar alone. However, GAN
dungeons have rooms considered more complex, and plain graph grammar's dungeons
are considered least complex and challenging. Only the GAN approach creates an
extensive supply of both layouts and rooms, where rooms span across the
spectrum of those seen in the training set to new creations merging design
principles from multiple rooms.

further insights into designing neural network architectures with properties

demonstrate that through the proposed measurable properties, our generalization

information under constraints of efficiency. Yet, evidence for efficient
communication in structural brain networks characterized by hierarchical
organization and highly connected hubs remains sparse. The principle of
efficient coding proposes that the brain transmits maximal information in a
metabolically economical or compressed form to improve future behavior. To
determine how structural connectivity supports efficient coding, we develop a
theory specifying minimum rates of message transmission between brain regions
to achieve an expected fidelity, and we test five predictions from the theory
based on random walk communication dynamics. In doing so, we introduce the
metric of compression efficiency, which quantifies the trade-off between lossy
compression and transmission fidelity in structural networks. In a large sample
of youth (n = 1,042; age 8-23 years), we analyze structural networks derived
from diffusion weighted imaging and metabolic expenditure operationalized using
cerebral blood flow. We show that structural networks strike compression
efficiency trade-offs consistent with theoretical predictions. We find that
compression efficiency prioritizes fidelity with development, heightens when
metabolic resources and myelination guide communication, explains advantages of
hierarchical organization, links higher input fidelity to disproportionate
areal expansion, and shows that hubs integrate information by lossy
compression. Lastly, compression efficiency is predictive of behavior--beyond a
conventional metric--for cognitive domains including executive function,
memory, complex reasoning, and social cognition. Our findings elucidate how
macroscale connectivity supports efficient coding, and serve to foreground
communication processes that utilize random walk dynamics constrained by

effect, and have so far been identified experimentally in magnetically-doped
topological insulator (MTI) thin films and in bilayer graphene moir{\'e}

orbital, depending on whether the orbital magnetization results from
spontaneous spin-polarization combined with spin-orbit interactions, as in the
MTI case, or directly from spontaneous orbital currents, as in the moir{\'e}

example by the sign of the anomalous Hall effect, the magnetization of an
orbital Chern insulator will often have opposite signs for weak $n$ and weak

switching of a magnetic state in the presence of a fixed magnetic field.

performance of proposal-based object detectors (a.k.a. two-stage object

non-trivial to train object detectors on unlabeled data due to the

proposal learning approach to learn proposal features and predictions from both

learning module and a consistency-based proposal learning module. In the
self-supervised proposal learning module, we present a proposal location loss
and a contrastive loss to learn context-aware and noise-robust proposal
features respectively. In the consistency-based proposal learning module, we
apply consistency losses to both bounding box classification and regression
predictions of proposals to learn noise-robust proposal features and
predictions. Our approach enjoys the following benefits: 1) encouraging more
context information to delivered in the proposals learning procedure; 2) noisy
proposal features and enforcing consistency to allow noise-robust object
detection; 3) building a general and high-performance semi-supervised object
detection framework, which can be easily adapted to proposal-based object
detectors with different backbone architectures. Experiments are conducted on
the COCO dataset with all available labeled and unlabeled data. Results
demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance of

paper develops a comprehensive energy efficiency analysis framework based on

different factors including the traffic between the VM and its users, the VM

traffic is high and/or the VMs have a linear power profile. In such a linear
profile case, the creation of multiple VM replicas does not increase the
computing power consumption significantly (there may be a slight increase due
to idle / baseline power consumption) if the number of users remains constant,
however the VM replicas can be brought closer to the end users, thus reducing
the transport network power consumption. In our scenario, the optimum placement

contact manifold $W \times S^1$ where $W$ is a Liouville manifold, or a closed
Liouville-fillable contact manifold $M$. The inputs of $d_{\rm CBM}$ are
different in these two cases. In the former case the inputs are (contact)
star-shaped domains of $W \times S^1$, and in the latter case the inputs are
contact 1-forms of $M$. In particular, the contact Banach-Mazur distance
$d_{\rm CBM}$ defined in the former case is motivated by the concept, relative
growth rate, which was originally defined and studied by Eliashberg and
Polterovich. In addition, we investigate the relations of $d_{\rm CBM}$ to
various numerical measurements in contact geometry and symplectic geometry, for
instance, contact shape invariant, (coarse) symplectic Banach-Mazur distance.
Moreover, we obtain several large-scale geometric properties in terms of
$d_{\rm CBM}$. Finally, we propose a quantitative comparison between elements
in the derived categories of sheaves of modules (over certain topological
spaces). This is based on several important properties of the singular support
of sheaves.

a progressive dispersion process. Mono-centric agglomeration emerges when
inter-regional trade and/or production externalities incur high transportation
costs, while uniform dispersion occurs when these costs become negligibly small
(i.e., when distance dies). In multi-regional geography, the network structure
of production externalities can determine the geographical distribution of
workers as economic integration increases. If production externalities are
governed solely by geographical distance, a mono-centric spatial distribution
emerges in the form of suburbanization. However, if geographically distant
pairs of regions are connected through tight production linkages, multi-centric
spatial distribution can be sustainable.

elucidating outbreak dynamics, shaping response strategies, and preparing for
future epidemics. SEMs typically represent counts of individuals in discrete
infection states using Markov jump processes (MJPs), but are computationally
challenging as imperfect surveillance, lack of subject-level information, and
temporal coarseness of the data obscure the true epidemic. Analytic integration
over the latent epidemic process is impossible, and integration via Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is cumbersome due to the dimensionality and
discreteness of the latent state space. Simulation-based computational
approaches can address the intractability of the MJP likelihood, but are
numerically fragile and prohibitively expensive for complex models. A linear
noise approximation (LNA) that approximates the MJP transition density with a
Gaussian density has been explored for analyzing prevalence data in
large-population settings, but requires modification for analyzing incidence
counts without assuming that the data are normally distributed. We demonstrate
how to reparameterize SEMs to appropriately analyze incidence data, and fold
the LNA into a data augmentation MCMC framework that outperforms deterministic
methods, statistically, and simulation-based methods, computationally. Our
framework is computationally robust when the model dynamics are complex and
applies to a broad class of SEMs. We evaluate our method in simulations that

applications of two-dimensional (2D) layered semiconductors. Here, we explore
the enhanced carrier transport through metal-semiconductor interfaces in WS2
field effect transistors (FETs) by introducing a typical transition metal, Cu,
with two different doping strategies: (i) a ""generalized"" Cu doping by using
randomly distributed Cu atoms along the channel and (ii) a ""localized"" Cu
doping by adapting an ultrathin Cu layer at the metal-semiconductor interface.
Compared to the pristine WS2 FETs, both the generalized Cu atomic dopant and
localized Cu contact decoration can provide a Schottky-to-Ohmic contact
transition owing to the reduced contact resistances by 1 - 3 orders of
magnitude, and consequently elevate electron mobilities by 5 - 7 times higher.
Our work demonstrates that the introduction of transition metal can be an
efficient and reliable technique to enhance the carrier transport and device
performance in 2D TMD FETs.

performance of ph-AFQMC with complex-restricted orbitals than with
spin-unrestricted orbitals. We then showed the utilization of essential spin
symmetry breaking when computing the single-triplet gap of a known

regularized orbital-optimized second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation

with a small active space fail to capture the triplet ground state. We show
unambiguously that neither triplet nor quintet is strongly correlated using
UHF, $\kappa$-OOMP2, and coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD)

breaking in this problem. By virtue of this, we were able to perform

a priori to training, using expensive manual or automated iterative tuning.
This study proposes gradient-only line searches to resolve the learning rate
for neural network training algorithms. Stochastic sub-sampling during training
decreases computational cost and allows the optimization algorithms to progress
over local minima. However, it also results in discontinuous cost functions.
Minimization line searches are not effective in this context, as they use a
vanishing derivative (first order optimality condition), which often do not
exist in a discontinuous cost function and therefore converge to
discontinuities as opposed to minima from the data trends. Instead, we base
candidate solutions along a search direction purely on gradient information, in
particular by a directional derivative sign change from negative to positive (a
Non-negative Associative Gradient Projection Point (NN- GPP)). Only considering
a sign change from negative to positive always indicates a minimum, thus
NN-GPPs contain second order information. Conversely, a vanishing gradient is
purely a first order condition, which may indicate a minimum, maximum or saddle
point. This insight allows the learning rate of an algorithm to be reliably
resolved as the step size along a search direction, increasing convergence
performance and eliminating an otherwise expensive hyperparameter.

alternative approach to directly measure the topological invariant on a

high-dimensional topological phases remains a challenge due to the technical

atomic chains are studied in this work. We propose that by introducing
incommensurate modulations on the interatomic distances of 1D periodic atomic
chains, the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model can be mimicked,
although the crucial difference is the existence of long-range dipole-dipole
interactions. The discrete band structures with respect to the modulation
phase, which plays the role of a dimension extension parameter, are calculated
for finite chains beyond the nearest-neighbor approximation. It is found that
the present system indeed supports nontrivial topological states localized over
the boundaries. Despite the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions
that leads to an asymmetric band structure, it is demonstrated that this system
inherits the topological properties of two-dimensional integer quantum Hall
systems. The spectral position, for both real and imaginary frequencies, and
number of these topologically protected edge states are still governed by the
gap-labeling theorem and characterized by the topological invariant, namely,
the (first) Chern number, indicating the validity of bulk-boundary
correspondence. Due to the fractal spectrum arising from the quasiperiodicity
in a substantially wide range of system parameters, our system provides a large
number of topological gaps and optical states readily for practical use. It is
also revealed that a substantial proportion of the topological edge states are
highly subradiant with extremely low decay rates, which therefore offer an
appealing route for controlling the emission of external quantum emitters and
achieving high-fidelity quantum state storage.

a thermal source in the presence of spatially diverging magnetic field lines.
Observations show that in the inner heliosphere, the electron temperature
declines with the distance approximately as $T_{e}(r)\sim r^{-0.3} \dots
r^{-0.7}$, which is significantly slower than the adiabatic expansion law $
\sim r^{-4/3}$. Motivated by such observations, we propose a kinetic theory
that addresses the non-adiabatic evolution of a nearly collisionless plasma
expanding from a central thermal source. We concentrate on the dynamics of
energetic electrons propagating along a radially diverging magnetic flux tube.
Due to the conservation of their magnetic moments, the electrons form a beam
collimated along the magnetic field lines. Due to weak energy exchange with the
background plasma, the beam population slowly loses its energy and heats the
background plasma. We propose that no matter how weak the collisions are, at
large enough distances from the source a universal regime of expansion is
established where the electron temperature declines as $T_e(r)\propto
r^{-2/5}$. This is close to the observed scaling of the solar wind temperature
in the inner heliosphere. Our first-principle kinetic derivation may thus
provide an explanation for the slower-than-adiabatic temperature decline in the
solar wind. More broadly, it may be useful for describing magnetized winds from
G-type stars.

procedures has been observed in both the theoretical and applied literature. We
focus on valid definitions of p-values in the scenarios when composite null
models are in effect. A valid p-value (VpV) statistic can be used to make a
prefixed level-decision. In this context, Kolmogorov Smirnov goodness-of-fit
tests and the normal two sample problem are considered. In particular, we
examine an issue regarding the goodness-of-fit testability based on a single
observation. This article exemplifies constructions of new test procedures,
advocating practical reasons to implement VpV-based mechanisms. The VpV
framework induces an extension of the conventional expected p-value (EPV) tool
for measuring the performance of a test. Associating the EPV concept with the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methodology, a well-established
biostatistical approach, we propose a Youden index based optimality principle
to derive critical values of decision making procedures. In these terms, the
significance level alpha=0.05 can be suggested, in many situations. In light of
an ROC curve analysis, we introduce partial EPVs to characterize properties of
tests including their unbiasedness. We also provide the intrinsic relationship
between the Bayes Factor (BF) test statistic and the BF of test statistics.

algorithm is unrolled to a deep network architecture with trainable parameters.
In the case of gradient descent algorithms, as a result of the training
process, one often observes the acceleration of the convergence speed with
learned non-constant step size parameters whose behavior is not intuitive nor
interpretable from conventional theory. In this paper, we provide a theoretical
interpretation of the learned step size of deep-unfolded gradient descent
(DUGD). We first prove that the training process of DUGD reduces not only the
mean squared error loss but also the spectral radius related to the convergence
rate. Next, we show that minimizing the upper bound of the spectral radius
naturally leads to the Chebyshev step which is a sequence of the step size
based on Chebyshev polynomials. The numerical experiments confirm that the
Chebyshev steps qualitatively reproduce the learned step size parameters in
DUGD, which provides a plausible interpretation of the learned parameters.
Additionally, we show that the Chebyshev steps achieve the lower bound of the
convergence rate for the first-order method in a specific limit without
learning parameters or momentum terms.

wireless networks under a conflict-graph interference model and single-hop
traffic. The objective is to guarantee that at least a certain fraction of
packets of each link are delivered within their deadlines, which is referred to
as delivery ratio. This problem has been studied before under restrictive
frame-based traffic models, or greedy maximal scheduling schemes like LDF
(Largest-Deficit First) that provide poor delivery ratio for general traffic
patterns. In this paper, we pursue a different approach through randomization
over the choice of maximal links that can transmit at each time. We design
randomized policies in collocated networks, multi-partite networks, and general
networks, that can achieve delivery ratios much higher than what is achievable
by LDF. Further, our results apply to traffic (arrival and deadline) processes
that evolve as positive recurrent Markov Chains. Hence, this work is an
improvement with respect to both efficiency and traffic assumptions compared to
the past work. We further present extensive simulation results over various
traffic patterns and interference graphs to illustrate the gains of our

of this mechanical set-up, two elastic nonlinear solids are considered jointed
through a frictionless and bilateral surface, so that continuity of the normal

component is null. Moreover, the displacement can develop only in a way that
the bodies in contact do neither detach, nor overlap. Surprisingly, this finite
strain problem has not been correctly formulated until now, so that this

are shown to be non-trivial and different from previously (and erroneously)

derived to show that previous formulations based on frictionless contact or
'spring-type' interfacial conditions are not able to predict bifurcations in

show that these bifurcations are a reality and become possible when the correct

significantly affects the imaginary part of complex band structures, the

increases with increasing in-plane Al-Al distance, leading to larger TMR

(MHD) turbulence driven by compressive driving to study generation of
solenoidal velocity component and small-scale magnetic field. We mainly focus
on the effects of mean magnetic field ($B_0$) and the sonic Mach number
($M_s$). We also consider two different driving schemes in terms of correlation
timescale of forcing vectors: a finite-correlated driving and a
delta-correlated driving. The former has a longer correlation timescale of
forcing vectors, which is comparable to large-eddy turnover time, than the
latter. Our findings are as follows. First, when we fix the value of $B_0$, the
level of solenoidal velocity component after saturation increases as $M_s$
increases. A similar trend is observed for generation of magnetic field when
$B_0$ is small. Second, when we fix the value of $M_s$, HD and MHD simulations
result in similar level of the solenoidal component when $B_0$ $\lesssim$ 0.2
(or Alfven Mach number of $\sim$ 5). However, the level increases when $B_0$
$\gtrsim$ 0.2. Roughly speaking, the magnetic energy density after saturation
is a linearly increasing function of $B_0$ irrespective of $M_s$. Third,
generation of solenoidal velocity component is not sensitive to numerical
resolution, but that of magnetic energy density is mildly sensitive. Lastly,
when initial conditions are same, the finite-correlated driving always produces
more solenoidal velocity and small-scale magnetic field components than the
delta-correlated driving. We additionally analyze the vorticity equation to
understand why higher $M_s$ and $B_0$ yield larger quantity of the solenoidal
velocity component.

$\rho^{\gamma}$, with polytropic $\gamma$ ranging from 0.7 to 5/3. We mainly
aim at determining the effects of polytropic $\gamma$ and driving schemes on
the decay law of turbulence energy, E $\propto$ $t^{-\alpha}$. We additionally
study probability density function (PDF) of gas density and skewness of the
distribution in polytropic turbulence driven by compressive driving. Our
findings are as follows. First of all, we find that even if polytropic $\gamma$
does not strongly change scaling relation of the decay law, the driving schemes
weakly change the relation; in our all simulations, turbulence decays with
$\alpha$ $\approx$ 1, but compressive driving yields smaller $\alpha$ than
solenoidal driving at the same sonic Mach number. Second, we calculate
compressive and solenoidal velocity components separately and compare their
decay rates in turbulence initially driven by compressive driving. We find that
the former decays much faster so that it ends up having a smaller fraction than
the latter. Third, the density PDF of compressively driven turbulence with
polytropic $\gamma$ $>$ 1 deviates from log-normal distribution: it has a
power-law tail at low density as in the case of solenoidally driven turbulence.
However, as it decays, the density PDF becomes approximately log-normal. We
discuss why decay rates of compressive and solenoidal velocity components are
different in compressively driven turbulence and astrophysical implication of
our findings.

other cameras. At each step, the switcher decides which action to take from the
two controllers according to the visibility of the target. The experimental

The objective of this research is to develop a model-based observer that

show the potential of the proposed observer to estimate automatically terrain

function on the data. However, when using standard dimensionality reduction
algorithms as the filter function, Mapper suffers from considerable

Our proposed technique relies on finding a subset of points called landmarks

graph captures the structural characteristics of the point cloud, and its
weights are determined using a Finite Markov Chain. We further compress this
graph by applying induced maps from standard community detection algorithms.
Using techniques borrowed from manifold tearing, we prune and reinstate edges
in the induced graph based on their modularity to summarize the shape of data.
We empirically demonstrate how our technique captures the structural
characteristics of real and synthetic data sets. Further, we compare our
approach with Mapper using various filter functions like t-SNE, UMAP, LargeVis

modeling. The methodology relies on a series of deep adversarial neural network
architecture with physics-based regularization. The network is used to simulate
the dynamic behavior of physical quantities (i.e. saturation) subject to a set
of governing laws (e.g. mass conservation) and corresponding boundary and
initial conditions. A residual equation is formed from the governing
partial-differential equation and used as part of the training. Derivatives of
the estimated physical quantities are computed using automatic differentiation
algorithms. This allows the model to avoid overfitting, by reducing the
variance and permits extrapolation beyond the range of the training data
including uncertainty implicitely derived from the distribution output of the
generative adversarial networks. The approach is used to simulate a 2 phase
immiscible transport problem (Buckley Leverett). From a very limited dataset,
the model learns the parameters of the governing equation and is able to
provide an accurate physical solution, both in terms of shock and rarefaction.
We demonstrate how this method can be applied in the context of a forward
simulation for continuous problems. The use of these models for the inverse
problem is also presented, where the model simultaneously learns the physical
laws and determines key uncertainty subsurface parameters. The proposed
methodology is a simple and elegant way to instill physical knowledge to
machine-learning algorithms. This alleviates the two most significant
shortcomings of machine-learning algorithms: the requirement for large datasets
and the reliability of extrapolation. The principles presented in this paper
can be generalized in innumerable ways in the future and should lead to a new
class of algorithms to solve both forward and inverse physical problems.

that there is a phase transition between hairy and BI black holes. The metric

Here, we show that a highly coherent and broadband mid-IR frequency comb can be

of pulses from a few-cycle Ti:Sapphire oscillator. By tightly focusing the
oscillator output beam into a single-pass fan-out-type periodically-poled

to incident beam, it is shown that mid-IR frequency comb with more than an
octave spectral bandwidth from 1550 cm-1 (46 THz) to 3650 cm-1 (110 THz) and
vanishing carrier-envelop offset phase can be generated. Then, using two

the effectiveness of convective heat transport, which is conveniently described
via the scaling of the Nusselt number (${\rm{Nu}}$) with the Rayleigh
(${\rm{Ra}}$) and Prandtl (${\rm{Pr}}$) numbers. In RBC experiments, the heat
supplied to the bottom plate is also partly transferred by thermal radiation.
This heat transport channel, acting in parallel with the convective and
conductive heat transport channels, is usually considered insignificant and
thus neglected. Here we present a detailed analysis of conventional far-field
as well as strongly enhanced near-field radiative heat transport occurring in
various RBC experiments, and show that the radiative heat transfer partly
explains differences in ${\rm{Nu}}$ measured in different experiments. A
careful inclusion of the radiative transport appreciably changes the
${\rm{Nu}}={\rm{Nu}}({\rm{Ra}})$ scaling inferred in turbulent RBC experiments
near ambient temperature utilizing gaseous nitrogen and sulphur hexafluoride as
working fluids. On the other hand, neither the conventional far-field radiation
nor the strongly enhanced near-field radiative heat transport appreciably
affects the heat transport law deduced in cryogenic helium RBC experiments.

robustness against control errors. However, the conventional non-adiabatic
holonomic quantum computation (NHQC) is limited by the fact that all of the
operations require exactly the same amount of evolution time, even for a
small-angle rotation. Furthermore, NHQC confines the driving part of the
Hamiltonian to strictly cover a fixed pulse area, making it sensitive to
control errors. Here we present an unconventional approach of NHQC, termed
brachistochronic NHQC, for bypassing these limitations. Specifically, with
B-NHQC, non-Abelian geometric gates can be time-optimized by following the
brachistochrone curve, minimizing the impact from the environmental
decoherence. Additionally, we demonstrate that B-NHQC is compatible with
composed pulses, which can further enhance the robustness against pulse errors.
For benchmarking, we provide a thorough analysis on the performance of B-NHQC
under experimental conditions; we found that the gate error can be reduced by
as much as 64% compared with NHQC.

the BAO features. We find that for a line flux of $L = 7\times 10^{-17} \ {\rm

sensitivity by a factor of two (i.e. $L = 3.5\times 10^{-17} \ {\rm

more factors are yet to be modelled, including dust obscuration, the damping
wing due to the intergalactic medium, and low redshift interlopers. If these

high-probability candidate members to the Corona-Australis association, 262 of
which had never been reported as members before. Our sample of members covers
the magnitude range between $G\gtrsim5$ mag and $G\lesssim20$ mag, and it
reveals the existence of two kinematically and spatially distinct subgroups.
There is a distributed `off-cloud' population of stars located in the north of
the dark clouds that is twice as numerous as the historically known `on-cloud'
population that is concentrated around the densest cores. By comparing the
location of the stars in the HR-diagram with evolutionary models, we show that
these two populations are younger than 10 Myr. Based on their infrared excess
emission, we identify 28 Class II and 215 Class III stars among the sources
with available infrared photometry, and we conclude that the frequency of Class
II stars (i.e. `disc-bearing' stars) in the on-cloud region is twice as large
as compared to the off-cloud population. The distance derived for the
Corona-Australis region based on this updated census is $d=149.4^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$

for higher $x$ values. Upon annealing, the bcc structure undergoes a
polymorphic transformation to the A15 one and all HEAs exhibits bulk
superconductivity. For $x$ = 0.2, whereas the bcc polymorph is not
superconducting down to 1.8 K, the A15 polymorph has a superconducting
transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ of 10.2 K and an estimated zero-temperature
upper critical field $B_{\rm c2}$(0) of 20.1 T, both of which are the highest
among HEA superconductors. With increasing Mo content $x$, both $T_{\rm c}$ and
$B_{\rm c2}$(0) of the A15-type HEAs decrease, yet the large ratio of $B_{\rm
c2}$(0)/$T_{\rm c}$ signifies a disorder-induced enhancement of the upper
critical field over a wide $x$ range. The decrease in $T_{\rm c}$ is attributed
to the decrease in both the electronic specific-heat coefficient and
electron-phonon coupling strength. Furthermore, the valence electron count
dependence of $T_{\rm c}$, which is different from both the binary A15 and
other structurally different HEA superconductors, suggests that $T_{\rm c}$ may
be increased further by reducing the number of valence electrons. Our results
not only uncover HEA superconductors of a new structural type, but also provide

BKP states with arbitrarily number of gluons in the planar limit. The numerical
analysis shows that contrary to the pomeron case where the leading states
become discretized, the odderon states still remain a continuous family
starting at intercept one. The following rapidity dependence of the amplitude
is studied. For the pomeron-odderon system the relation between the
descriptions in the reggeized gluon (BFKL) framework and the color dipole/CGC
one is investigated.

audio as input to synthesize a photo-realistic video. This method is unique
because it is highly dynamic. It does not assume a person-specific rendering
network yet capable of translating arbitrary source audio into arbitrary video
output. Instead of learning a highly heterogeneous and nonlinear mapping from
audio to the video directly, we first factorize each target video frame into
orthogonal parameter spaces, i.e., expression, geometry, and pose, via
monocular 3D face reconstruction. Next, a recurrent network is introduced to
translate source audio into expression parameters that are primarily related to
the audio content. The audio-translated expression parameters are then used to
synthesize a photo-realistic human subject in each video frame, with the
movement of the mouth regions precisely mapped to the source audio. The
geometry and pose parameters of the target human portrait are retained,
therefore preserving the context of the original video footage. Finally, we
introduce a novel video rendering network and a dynamic programming method to
construct a temporally coherent and photo-realistic video. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.
Our method is end-to-end learnable and robust to voice variations in the source

(RBCD) method for minimizing a composite problem, where the objective function
could be either convex or nonconvex, and the smooth part are freed from the
global Lipschitz-continuous (partial) gradient assumption. Under the notion of
relative smoothness based on the Bregman distance, we prove that every limit
point of the generated sequence is a stationary point. Further, we show that
the iteration complexity of the proposed method is $O(n\varepsilon^{-2})$ to
achieve $\epsilon$-stationary point, where $n$ is the number of blocks of
coordinates. If the objective is assumed to be convex, the iteration complexity
is improved to $O(n\epsilon^{-1} )$. If, in addition, the objective is strongly
convex (relative to the reference function), the global linear convergence rate
is recovered. We also present the accelerated version of the RBCD method, which
attains an $O(n\varepsilon^{-1/\gamma} )$ iteration complexity for the convex
case, where the scalar $\gamma\in [1,2]$ is determined by the
\textit{generalized translation variant} of the Bregman distance. Convergence
analysis without assuming the global Lipschitz-continuous (partial) gradient

The relative success of ensemble methods is attributed to their ability to

reinforcement learning owing to the high sample complexity and computational
expense involved in obtaining a diverse ensemble. We present a novel training

ensembles of policies obtained from a single training run. These policies are
diverse in nature and are learned through directed perturbation of the model

extreme diversity can prove detrimental to overall performance. Selection of an
adequately diverse set of policies is done through our novel policy selection

authentication codes (MACs) to provide message authentication and integrity is
not possible due to the large size of the MAC output. A straightforward yet
naive solution to this problem is to employ a truncated MAC which undesirably
sacrifices cryptographic strength in exchange for reduced communication
overhead. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach
for message authentication called \textit{Cumulative Message Authentication
Code} (CuMAC), which consists of two distinctive procedures:
\textit{aggregation} and \textit{accumulation}. In aggregation, a sender
generates compact authentication tags from segments of multiple MACs by using a
systematic encoding procedure. In accumulation, a receiver accumulates the
cryptographic strength of the underlying MAC by collecting and verifying the
authentication tags. Embodied with these two procedures, CuMAC enables the
receiver to achieve an advantageous trade-off between the cryptographic
strength and the latency in processing of the authentication tags. Furthermore,
for some latency-sensitive messages where this trade-off may be unacceptable,
we propose a variant of CuMAC that we refer to as \textit{CuMAC with
Speculation} (CuMAC/S). In addition to the aggregation and accumulation
procedures, CuMAC/S enables the sender and receiver to employ a speculation
procedure for predicting future message values and pre-computing the
corresponding MAC segments. For the messages which can be reliably speculated,
CuMAC/S significantly reduces the MAC verification latency without compromising
the cryptographic strength. We have carried out comprehensive evaluation of
CuMAC and CuMAC/S through simulation and a prototype implementation on a real
car.

(DESWs) and backward volume (BVSWs) configurations within the same, 30 nm
thick, ferromagnetic, CoFeB waveguide. Sub-micron U-shaped antennas are used to
deliver the necessary in-plane and out-of-plane RF fields. We measure the
spin-wave transmission with respect to in-plane field orientation, frequency
and propagation distance. Unlike DESW, BVSWs are reciprocally transduced and
collected for either direction of propagation, but their ability to transport
energy is lower than DESWs for two reasons. This arises first because BVSW are
inductively transduced less efficiently than DESWs. Also, in the range of
wavevectors (~5 rad. um-1) typically excited by our antennas, the group
velocity of BVSWs stays lower than that of DESW, which leads to reduced
propagation ability that impact transmission signals in an exponential manner.
In contrast, the group velocity of DESWs is maximum at low fields and decreases
continuously with the applied field. The essential features of the measured SW
characteristics are well reciprocated by a simple, 1-D analytical model which
can be used to assess the potential of each configuration.

the presence of malicious accounts, known as social bots, which are often used
to diffuse misleading information. Social bots are automated accounts whose
goal is to interact with humans and influence them. Starting from the
definition of credulous (i.e., human accounts with a high percentage of bot

preventive measure, which users may be the target of bots' activities, hence
more exposed to the misleading/unreliable content. Our results showed that the

whose objective is to accurately predict the numerical degrees of relevance of
an extremely large number of labels to a data point. XR can provide elegant
solutions to many large-scale ranking and recommendation applications including
Dynamic Search Advertising (DSA). XR can learn more accurate models than the
recently popular extreme classifiers which incorrectly assume strictly
binary-valued label relevances. Traditional regression metrics which sum the
errors over all the labels are unsuitable for XR problems since they could give
extremely loose bounds for the label ranking quality. Also, the existing
regression algorithms won't efficiently scale to millions of labels. This paper
addresses these limitations through: (1) new evaluation metrics for XR which
sum only the k largest regression errors; (2) a new algorithm called XReg which
decomposes XR task into a hierarchy of much smaller regression problems thus
leading to highly efficient training and prediction. This paper also introduces
a (3) new labelwise prediction algorithm in XReg useful for DSA and other
recommendation tasks. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrated that XReg
can outperform the state-of-the-art extreme classifiers as well as large-scale
regressors and rankers by up to 50% reduction in the new XR error metric, and
up to 2% and 2.4% improvements in terms of the propensity-scored precision
metric used in extreme classification and the click-through rate metric used in

make transactions on this platform very difficult to track, thus triggering the
emergence of various illegal activities in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Particularly,
mixing services in Bitcoin, originally designed to enhance transaction

three levels, namely, network level, account level and transaction level. To

we propose the concept of Attributed Temporal Heterogeneous motifs (ATH

valid for this type of problems in a unified framework. Here, we extend the
solver for GPU-accelerated clusters using CUDA Fortran. The porting makes
extensive use of CUF kernels and has been greatly simplified by the unified
memory feature of CUDA Fortran, which handles the data migration between host

$H$ as an induced subgraph in a host graph $G$. If $G$ belongs to a bounded
expansion class, the algorithm runs in linear time. Our design choices are
motivated by the need for an approach that can be engineered into a practical
implementation for sparse host graphs.
  Specifically, we introduce a decomposition of the pattern $H$ called a
counting dag $\vec C(H)$ which encodes an order-aware, inclusion-exclusion
counting method for $H$. Given such a counting dag and a suitable linear
ordering $\mathbb G$ of $G$ as input, our algorithm can count the number of
times $H$ appears as an induced subgraph in $G$ in time $O(\|\vec C\| \cdot h
\text{wcol}_{h}(\mathbb G)^{h-1} |G|)$, where $\text{wcol}_h(\mathbb G)$
denotes the maximum size of the weakly $h$-reachable sets in $\mathbb G$. This
implies, combined with previous results, an algorithm with running time
$O(4^{h^2}h (\text{wcol}_h(G)+1)^{h^3} |G|)$ which only takes $H$ and $G$ as
input.
  We note that with a small modification, our algorithm can instead use
strongly $h$-reachable sets with running time $O(\|\vec C\| \cdot h
\text{col}_{h}(\mathbb G)^{h-1} |G|)$, resulting in an overall complexity of
$O(4^{h^2}h \text{col}_h(G)^{h^2} |G|)$ when only given $H$ and $G$.
  Because orderings with small weakly/strongly reachable sets can be computed
relatively efficiently in practice [11], our algorithm provides a promising
alternative to algorithms using the traditional $p$-treedepth colouring
framework [13]. We describe preliminary experimental results from an initial
open source implementation which highlight its potential.

large Shard size (the number of nodes inside a Shard) to sustain the low
failure probability so that only a small number of Shards may exist. In this
paper, we present a new approach of Blockchain Sharding that can withstand up
to n/2 of nodes being bad. We categorise the nodes into different classes, and
every Shard has a fixed number of nodes from different classes. We prove that
this design is much more secure than the traditional models (only have one
class) and the Shard size can be reduced significantly. In this way, many more
Shards can exist, and the transaction throughput can be largely increased. The
improved Blockchain Sharding approach is promising to serve as the foundation
for decentralised autonomous organisations and decentralised database.

applications in a wide range of fields. The aim is to accurately and
efficiently detect changepoints in time series data when both the number of
time points and dimensions grow large. Existing methods typically aggregate or
project the data to a smaller number of dimensions; usually one. We present a
high-dimensional changepoint detection method that takes inspiration from
geometry to map a high-dimensional time series to two dimensions. We show
theoretically and through simulation that if the input series is Gaussian then
the mappings preserve the Gaussianity of the data. Applying univariate
changepoint detection methods to both mapped series allows the detection of
changepoints that correspond to changes in the mean and variance of the
original time series. We demonstrate that this approach outperforms the current
state-of-the-art multivariate changepoint methods in terms of accuracy of
detected changepoints and computational efficiency. We conclude with
applications from genetics and finance.

position from 1.2 K in zero field to higher temperatures in the magnetic field,
with the corresponding decrease in the magnetic entropy. The low temperature
magnetic entropy at 5 kOe field is Rln2 - (1/2)Rln(3/2) which is same as for
the spin ice state. Substitution of non-magnetic, isovalent La$^{3+}$ for
Dy$^{3+}$ gradually induces the structural change from highly disordered

existing approaches, the common key step is to estimate the haze density of

haze-relevant features. Several recent works also automatically learn the
features via directly exploiting Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). However,
it may be insufficient to fully capture the intrinsic attributes of hazy
images. To obtain effective features for single image dehazing, this paper
presents a novel Ranking Convolutional Neural Network (Ranking-CNN). In
Ranking-CNN, a novel ranking layer is proposed to extend the structure of CNN
so that the statistical and structural attributes of hazy images can be
simultaneously captured. By training Ranking-CNN in a well-designed manner,
powerful haze-relevant features can be automatically learned from massive hazy
image patches. Based on these features, haze can be effectively removed by
using a haze density prediction model trained through the random forest
regression. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms several
previous dehazing approaches on synthetic and real-world benchmark images.
Comprehensive analyses are also conducted to interpret the proposed Ranking-CNN

of circular photogalvanic currents in $\text{Bi}_2\text{Se}_3$ nanowires. Each
nanowire shows topological surface states. Here, we generate and distinguish
the different photocurrent contributions via the driving light wave. We
separate the circular photogalvanic currents from those due to thermal Seebeck
effects, through controlling the laser light polarization. The results reveal a
spin-polarized surface-Dirac electron flow in the nanowires arising from
spin-momentum locking and spin-orbit effects. The second photocurrent
contribution described in this letter is caused by the thermal Seebeck effect.
By scanning the photocurrent, it can be spatially resolved; upon reversing the
gradient direction along the nanowire, the photocurrent changes its sign, and
close to the gold contacts, the amplitudes of the different photocurrent
contributions are affected by the proximity to the contacts. In the center of
the nanowires, where the effects from the gold contact/ topological insulator
stacks vanish, the spin-polarized current remains constant along the nanowires.
This opens up a new method of all-optical spin current generation in
topological insulator nanowires and hybrid structures for nanoscale

interacting in different contexts. Often, the same set of actors can be
characterized by multiple social relations, captured by a multidimensional
network. A common situation is that of colleagues working in the same
institution, whose social interactions can be defined on professional and
personal levels. In addition, individuals in a network tend to interact more
frequently with similar others, naturally creating communities. Latent space
models for network data are useful to recover clustering of the actors, as they
allow to represent similarities between them by their positions and relative
distances in an interpretable low dimensional social space. We propose the
infinite latent position cluster model for multidimensional network data, which
enables model-based clustering of actors interacting across multiple social
dimensions. The model is based on a Bayesian nonparametric framework, that
allows to perform automatic inference on the clustering allocations, the number
of clusters, and the latent social space. The method is tested on simulated
data experiments, and it is employed to investigate the presence of communities
in two multidimensional networks recording relationships of different types

an optical system is subject to various sources of anticipated and

Mechanical stress changes the geometry between the cameras that make up the
stereo pair, and as a consequence, the pre-calculated epipolar geometry is no
longer valid. Our method is based on optimization of camera geometry parameters
and plugs directly into the output of the stereo matching algorithm. Therefore,
it is able to recover calibration parameters on image pairs obtained from a
decalibrated stereo system with minimal use of additional computing resources.
The number of successfully recovered depth pixels is used as an objective
function, which we aim to maximize. Our simulation confirms that the method can
run constantly in parallel to stereo estimation and thus help keep the system
calibrated in real time. Results confirm that the method is able to recalibrate
all the parameters except for the baseline distance, which scales the absolute
depth readings. However, that scaling factor could be uniquely determined using

time projection chambers (TPC) filled with liquid argon (LAr) as their
technology for the next generation of detectors. Because of its typical drift
length of several meters, relatively large cathode voltages are desirable to
provide a sizeable drift field. Current designs are based on feedthroughs with
high voltages (HV) limited to several hundred kV. The present work proposes a
novel method to produce higher voltages inside the detector. It is based on a
Van de Graaff HV generator where the charge transporting belt is replaced by a
cryogenic LAr flow. Negative charge is injected in liquid by means of a
grounded sharp point facing a positive voltage electrode with a high speed LAr
stream in between. The LAr flow transports the charge to the cathode through an
electrically insulating pipe. In the cathode the charge is extracted with a
metallic mesh. The LAr flux is driven by a cryogenic helium pump with
unidirectional valves assuring a continuous flow. The LAr operational
temperature is maintained by a pressurized liquid nitrogen deposit with
automatic filling. The whole system is installed within a dewar container that
will be filled with LAr reproducing the typical TPC conditions. This design has
no mobile parts, so it is very robust and can be easily embedded within the
structural support of a TPC cathode. A prototype of this HV generator has been
constructed at CIEMAT (Madrid), and is currently being characterized. This R&D
is presented and the preliminary results are discussed.

agents to learn to control the acceleration and steering of a car while
navigating a randomly generated racetrack. Different versions of two
actor-critic learning algorithms are tested on this environment: Sampled Policy
Gradient (SPG) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). An extension of SPG is
introduced that aims to improve learning performance by weighting action
samples during the policy update step. The effect of using experience replay
(ER) is also investigated. To this end, a modification to PPO is introduced
that allows for training using old action samples by optimizing the actor in
log space. Finally, a new technique for performing ER is tested that aims to
improve learning speed without sacrificing performance by splitting the
training into two parts, whereby networks are first trained using state
transitions from the replay buffer, and then using only recent experiences. The
results indicate that experience replay is not beneficial to PPO in continuous
action spaces. The training of SPG seems to be more stable when actions are
weighted. All versions of SPG outperform PPO when ER is used. The ER trick is
effective at improving training speed on a computationally less intensive
version of SPG.

that introduces a level of anonymity. The data collected by the sensors is
stored in cloud or local storage and is shared with insurance company on demand
to find the liable party that in turn increases the privacy of the users. BIS

encode objects with similar geometry nearby in feature space. Retrieving
relevant experience for an unseen object is thus a nearest neighbour search
with the encoded feature maps. DGCM-Net also reconstructs 3D-3D correspondences

  Corresponding Backward Stable Root Finder",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A new measure called min-max elementwise backward error is introduced for
approximate roots of scalar polynomials $p(z)$. Compared with the elementwise
relative backward error, this new measure allows for larger relative
perturbations on the coefficients of $p(z)$ that do not participate much in the
overall backward error. By how much these coefficients can be perturbed is
determined via an associated max-times polynomial and its tropical roots. An
algorithm is designed for computing the roots of $p(z)$. It uses a companion
linearization $C(z) = A-zB$ of $p(z)$ to which we added an extra zero leading
coefficient, and an appropriate two-sided diagonal scaling that balances $A$
and makes $B$ graded in particular when there is variation in the magnitude of
the coefficients of $p(z)$. An implementation of the QZ algorithm with a strict
deflation criterion for eigenvalues at infinity is then used to obtain
approximations to the roots of $p(z)$. Under the assumption that this
implementation of the QZ algorithm exhibits a graded backward error when $B$ is
graded, we prove that our new algorithm is min-max elementwise backward stable.
Several numerical experiments show the superior performance of the new
algorithm compared with the MATLAB \texttt{roots} function. Extending the
algorithm to polynomial eigenvalue problems leads to a new polynomial
eigensolver that exhibits excellent numerical behaviour compared with other
existing polynomial eigensolvers, as illustrated by many numerical tests.

appear if $T$ and $CPT$ violations in mixing are present. Invalidity of these

exploring the diversity of connectivity pattern emerged in networks. Due to the
fundamental significance, it has drawn much attention in the field of network
analysis and mining. Some related works appeared in recent years have
significantly advanced our understanding of how to predict the strong and weak
ties in the social networks. However, most of the proposed approaches are
scenario-aware methods heavily depending on some special contexts and even
exclusively used in social networks. As a result, they are less applicable to
various kinds of networks.
  In contrast to the prior studies, here we propose a new computational
framework called Neighborhood Estimating Weight (NEW) which is purely driven by
the basic structure information of the network and has the flexibility for
adapting to diverse types of networks. In NEW, we design a novel index, i.e.,
connection inclination, to generate the representative features of the network,
which is capable of capturing the actual distribution of the tie strength. In
order to obtain the optimized prediction results, we also propose a
parameterized regression model which approximately has a linear time complexity
and thus is readily extended to the implementation in large-scale networks. The
experimental results on six real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed
predictive model outperforms the state of the art methods, which is powerful
for predicting the missing tie strengths when only a part of the network's tie
strength information is available.

protection & address the key challenges like sub-optimal performance and low
unlinkability. Specifically, we focus on cases where Bloom-filter templates
results in non-ideal performance due to presence of large degradations within
iris images. Iris recognition is challenged with number of occluding factors
such as presence of eye-lashes within captured image, occlusion due to eyelids,
low quality iris images due to motion blur. All of such degrading factors
result in obtaining non-reliable iris codes & thereby provide non-ideal
biometric performance. These factors directly impact the protected templates
derived from iris images when classical Bloom-filters are employed. To this
end, we propose and extend our earlier ideas of Morton-filters for obtaining
better and reliable templates for iris. Morton filter based TP for iris codes
is based on leveraging the intra and inter-class distribution by exploiting
low-rank iris codes to derive the stable bits across iris images for a
particular subject and also analyzing the discriminable bits across various
subjects. Such low-rank non-noisy iris codes enables realizing the template
protection in a superior way which not only can be used in constrained setting,

is to automate the construction of similarity measures using machine learning,
while keeping training time as low as possible. Our objective is to investigate
how to apply machine learning to effectively learn a similarity measure. Such a
learned similarity measure could be used for CBR systems, but also for

resulted in two novel similarity measure designs. One design using a

this paper, we introduce a novel approach for this type of resourceaware data
transfer which brings together supervised learning for network quality
prediction with reinforcement learningbased decision making. The performance
evaluation is carried out using data-driven network simulation and real world
experiments in the public cellular networks of multiple Mobile Network
Operators (MNOs) in different scenarios. The proposed transmission scheme
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic approaches in most
scenarios and achieves data rate improvements of up to 181% in uplink and up to
270% in downlink transmission direction in comparison to conventional periodic
data transfer.

the Highly Improved Staggered Quarks (HISQ) action with $m_{\pi} \approx $ 230
MeV. The strength of magnetic fields $|eB|$ ranges from 0 to around 3.3 GeV$^2$
($\sim 60 m_\pi^2$). We found that the masses of neutral pseudo-scalar
particles, e.g. neutral pion and kaon, monotonouslly decrease as the magnetic
field grows and then saturate at a nonzero value. It is observed that heavier
neutral pseudo-scalars are less affected by magnetic fields. Moreover, we found
a non-monotonous behavior of charged pion and kaon mass in magnetic field for
the first time. In the case of small magnetic field (0 $\leq~|eB| \lesssim$ 0.3
GeV$^2~\sim 6m_\pi^2$ ) the mass of charged pseudo-scalar grows with magnetic
field and can be well described by the Lowest Landau Level approximation, while
for $|eB|$ larger than 0.3 GeV$^2$ the mass starts to decrease. The possible
connection between $|eB|$ dependences of neutral pion mass and the decreasing
behavior of pseudo-critical temperature in magnetic field is discussed. Due to
the nonzero value of neutral pion mass our simulation indicates that the
superconducting phase of QCD does not exist in the current window of magnetic
field.

Three different motility types can be distinguished: slow, fast and mixed
motilities. Slow CTLs remain nearly stationary within the collagen matrix and
show slightly anti-persistent motility, while the fast ones move quickly and
persistent (i.e. with not too large turning angles). The dynamics of the mixed
type consists of periods of slow and fast motions; both states are persistent,
but they have different persistencies. The dynamics can be well described by a
two-state persistent random walk model. We extract the parameters of the model
by analyzing experimental data. The mean square displacements predicted by the

fitting parameter. Potential reasons for the observed two-state motility are
discussed. T cells dig the collagen during their migration and form channels,
which facilitate the movement of other CTLs in the collagen network.

two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), but they were rarely
observed in non-Mo-based TMDCs. Herein, by post-growth Nb doping, high density
4|4E-W and 4|4P-Se MTBs were introduced into molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) grown
WSe2 monolayers. Of them, 4|4E-W MTB with a novel structure was discovered
experimentally for the first time, while 4|4P-Se MTBs present a random
permutations of W and Nb, forming a 1D alloy system. Comparison between the
doped and non-doped WSe2 confirmed that Nb dopants are essential for MTB
formation. Furthermore, quantitative statistics reveal the areal density of
MTBs is directly proportional to the concentration of Nb dopants. To unravel
the injection pathway of Nb dopants, first-principles calculations about a set
of formation energies for excess Nb atoms with different configurations were
conducted, based on which a model explaining the origin of MTBs introduced by
excess metal was built. We conclude that the formation of MTBs is mainly driven
by the collective evolution of excess Nb atoms introduced into the lattice of
host WSe2 crystal and subsequent displacement of metal atoms (W or Nb). This
study provides a novel way to tailor the MTBs in 2D TMDC materials via proper
metal doping and presents a new opportunities for exploring the intriguing
properties.

particle that evolves on a lattice with a tight-binding Hamiltonian (TBH),
i.e., evolves via what we will call an electric TBH; this phenomenon will be
referred to as TBH Bloch oscillations. A similar phenomenon is known to show up
in so-called electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs); this phenomenon will
be referred to as DQW Bloch oscillations. This similarity is particularly
salient when the electric field of the DQW is weak. For a wide, i.e., spatially
extended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical
oscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric
TBH and the electric DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly
suggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch oscillations correspond to two
counter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations. In this work it is
shown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a
weak electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the
superposition of two continuous-time expressions, which are counter-propagating
solutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude is the cosine of the
arbitrary coin-operator mixing angle. In contrast, if one wishes the
continuous-time approximation to hold for spatially localized initial
conditions, one needs at least the DQW to be lazy, as suggested by numerical
simulations and by the fact that this has been proven in the case of a
vanishing electric field.

are to monitor and control environments. Also, sensor nodes distribute based on
network usage. One of the most significant issues in this type of network is
the energy consumption of sensor nodes. In fixed-sink networks, nodes which are
near the sink act as an interface to transfer data of other nodes to sink. This
causes the energy consumption of sensors reduces rapidly. Therefore, the
lifetime of the network declines. Sensor nodes owing to their weaknesses are
susceptible to several threats, one of which is denial-of-sleep attack (DoSA)
threatening WSN. Hence, the DoSA refers to the energy loss in these nodes by
maintaining the nodes from entering energy-saving and sleep mode. In this
paper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on mobile sink, firefly algorithm
based on leach, and Hopfield neural network (WSN-FAHN). Thus, mobile sink is
applied to both improve energy consumption and increase network lifetime.
Firefly algorithm is proposed to cluster nodes and authenticate in two levels
to prevent from DoSA. In addition, Hopfield neural network detects the
direction route of the sink movement to send data of CH. Furthermore, here
WSN-FAHN technique is assessed through wide simulations performed in the NS-2

outcomes in comparison with contemporary schemes based on performance metrics

population using predictions from a classifier trained on a different

specificities of the classifier are either perfect or transportable from the
training to the test population. These assumptions are inappropriate in the
presence of dataset shift, when the misclassification rates in the training
population are not representative of those for the test population.
Quantification under dataset shift has been addressed only for single-class
(categorical) predictions and assuming perfect knowledge of the true labels on
a small subset of the test population. We propose generalized Bayes
quantification learning (GBQL) that uses the entire compositional predictions
from probabilistic classifiers and allows for uncertainty in true class labels
for the limited labeled test data. Instead of positing a full model, we use a
model-free Bayesian estimating equation approach to compositional data based
only on a first-moment assumption. The idea will be useful in Bayesian
compositional data analysis in general as it is robust to different generating
mechanisms for compositional data and includes categorical outputs as a special
case. We show how our method yields existing quantification approaches as
special cases. Extension to an ensemble GBQL that uses predictions from
multiple classifiers yielding inference robust to inclusion of a poor
classifier is discussed. We outline a fast and efficient Gibbs sampler using a
rounding and coarsening approximation to the loss functions. We also establish
posterior consistency, asymptotic normality and valid coverage of interval

Empirical performance of GBQL is demonstrated through simulations and analysis

learned representations by comparing sample features with corresponding

magnetization, energy, and spin-spin correlations. The samples generated by
RBMs are more evenly distributed across temperature than those generated by

their inspired Cut\&Count technique, they obtained $\mathcal{O}^*(\alpha^{tw})$

Unfortunately, like other dynamic programming algorithms on tree

widely believed to be unavoidable. In contrast, for the slightly larger
parameter called treedepth, there are already several examples of algorithms
matching the time bounds obtained for treewidth, but using only polynomial
space. Nevertheless, this has remained open for connectivity problems.
  In the present work, we close this knowledge gap by applying the Cut\&Count
technique to graphs of small treedepth. While the general idea is unchanged, we
have to design novel procedures for counting consistently cut solution
candidates using only polynomial space. Concretely, we obtain time

properties of a fuel/air mixture that are often utilized as scaling parameters
in turbulent combustion. While LFS at atmospheric and elevated pressures are
extensively investigated, experimental measurements of ESR with counterflow
premixed flames are very limited for flame instability often occurs near
extinction, especially at high pressures. Due to the scarcity of ESR
measurements, most combustion kinetic models are mainly validated and optimized
against LFS. However, it is questionable whether the controlling reactions are
the same for ESR and LFS such that those models are also valid for predicting
ESR. This work quantifies the kinetic similarities between ESR and LFS by
analyzing their kinetic sensitivity directions. The direction is represented by
a unit vector composed of the normalized sensitivity of ESR or LFS to the rate
constant for each elemental reaction. Consequently, the similarity between the
two directions is measured by the inner product of the corresponding unit
vectors. The sensitivity directions of ESR and LFS are found parallel for
various fuels, equivalence ratios, and pressures. Furthermore, sensitivity
directions at various strain rates are also similar for the maximum
temperature, local temperature at various locations in the flame coordinate,
and ESR in counterflow premixed flames. These findings suggest that LFS and ESR
are similarly effective as the target for constraining and optimizing rate
constants in kinetic models. In addition, the independence of the sensitivity
directions on the strain rate also enables us to perform uncertainty
quantification for turbulent flames with a wide range of strain rates based on
the kinetic sensitivity of ESR and LFS.

the flow can be extended to the collision manifold having central

have been numerous attempts to model the invasion of tumorous glioma cells via
partial differential equations in the form of advection-diffusion-reaction

validation via experimental data has been found to be difficult, as time
sequence measurements are generally missing. Also the clinical interest lies in
the actual (invisible) tumor extent for a particular MRI/DTI scan and not in a

the extent of glioblastoma (GBM) invasion at the time of a given MRI/DTI scan.
The underlying dynamics can be derived from an instationary GBM model, falling
into the wide class of advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The
stationalisation is introduced via an analytical solution of the Fisher-KPP
equation, the simplest model in the considered model class. We investigate the

systems, such as the iron-based superconductors. Using large-scale density
matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we study at zero-temperature
the nematic spin liquid that competes with spin dipolar and quadrupolar orders.
We use these nematic orders to characterize different quantum phases and
quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we study a spin-$1$
bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg model on the square lattice with couplings
beyond nearest neighbors. We focus on parameter regions around the highly
symmetric $SU(3)$ point where the bilinear and biquadratic interactions are
equal. With growing further-neighbor biquadratic interactions, we identify
different spin dipolar and quadrupolar orders. We find that the DMRG results on
cylindrical geometries correctly detect nematicity in different quantum states
and accurately characterize the quantum phase transitions among them.
Therefore, spin-driven nematicity -- here defined as the spontaneous breaking
of the lattice invariance under a 90$^o$ rotation -- is an order parameter
which can be studied directly in DMRG calculations in two dimensions in

by $e^2/(1+\theta^2)$, where $\theta$ is the dimensionless Chern-Simons
parameter. This could be useful for describing the substrate interaction with
two-dimensional materials and the doping dependence of the dielectric constant
in graphene. In the dynamical limit, we calculate the effective current-current
action of the model considering Dirac electrons. We show that this resembles
the electromagnetic and statistical interactions, but with two different
overall constants, given by $e^2/(1+\theta^2)$ and $e^2\theta/(1+\theta^2)$.
Therefore, the $\theta$-parameter does not provide a topological mass for the
Gauge field in PQED, which is a relevant difference in comparison with quantum
electrodynamics. Thereafter, we apply the one-loop perturbation theory in our
model. Within this approach, we calculate the electron self-energy, the
electron renormalized mass, the corrected gauge-field propagator, and the
renormalized Fermi velocity for both high- and low-speed limits, using the
renormalization group. In particular, we obtain a maximum value of the
renormalized mass for $\theta\approx 0.36$. This behavior is an important

exchange interactions has previously been modeled as correlated for $T >
T_{SP}$ and mean field for $T < T_{SP}$. We use correlated states throughout in
the $J_1-J_2$ model with antiferromagnetic exchange $J_1$ and $J_2 = \alpha
J_1$ between first and second neighbors, respectively, and variable frustration
$0 \leq \alpha \leq 0.50$. The thermodynamic limit is reached at high $T$ by
exact diagonalization of short chains and at low $T$ by density matrix
renormalization group calculations of progressively longer chains. In contrast
to mean field results, correlated states of 1D models with linear spin-phonon
coupling and a harmonic adiabatic lattice provide an internally consistent
description in which the parameter $T_{SP}$ yields both the stiffness and the
lattice dimerization $\delta(T)$. The relation between $T_{SP}$ and
$\Delta(\delta,\alpha)$, the $T = 0$ gap induced by dimerization, depends
strongly on $\alpha$ and deviates from the BCS gap relation that holds in
uncorrelated spin chains. Correlated states account quantitatively for the
magnetic susceptibility of TTF-CuS$_4$C$_4$(CF$_3$)$_4$ crystals ($J_1 = 79$ K,
$\alpha = 0$, $T_{SP} = 12$ K) and CuGeO$_3$ crystals ($J_1 = 160$ K, $\alpha =
0.35$,
  $T_{SP} = 14$ K). The same parameters describe the specific heat anomaly of
CuGeO$_3$ and inelastic neutron scattering. Modeling the spin-Peierls
transition with correlated states exploits the fact that $\delta(0)$ limits the
range of spin correlations at $T = 0$ while $T > 0$ limits the range at
$\delta= 0$.

a prototype implementation of PLR is analyzed through systematic experiments,

show how PL and PLR can be extended to support richer ontologies, by means of

pool of cars is used to cover a set of ride requests while uncovered requests
are assigned to other modes of transport (MOT). A car's route consists of one
or more trips. Each trip must have a specific but non-predetermined driver,
start in a depot and finish in a (possibly different) depot. Ride-sharing
between users is allowed, even when two rides do not have the same origin
and/or destination. A user has always the option of using other modes of
transport according to an individual list of preferences.
  The problem can be formulated as a vehicle scheduling problem. In order to
solve the problem, an auxiliary graph is constructed in which each trip
starting and ending in a depot, and covering possible ride-shares, is modeled
as an arc in a time-space graph. We propose a two-layer decomposition algorithm
based on column generation, where the master problem ensures that each request
can only be covered at most once, and the pricing problem generates new
promising routes by solving a kind of shortest-path problem in a time-space
network. Computational experiments based on realistic instances are reported.
The benchmark instances are based on demographic, spatial, and economic data of
Vienna, Austria. We solve large instances with the column generation based
approach to near optimality in reasonable time, and we further investigate

aims to improve the representation capability of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
The motivation is that DNNs have unimportant (invalid) filters (e.g., l1 norm
close to 0). These filters limit the potential of DNNs since they are
identified as having little effect on the network. While filter pruning removes
these invalid filters for efficiency consideration, filter grafting
re-activates them from an accuracy boosting perspective. The activation is
processed by grafting external information (weights) into invalid filters. To
better perform the grafting process, we develop an entropy-based criterion to
measure the information of filters and an adaptive weighting strategy for
balancing the grafted information among networks. After the grafting operation,
the network has very few invalid filters compared with its untouched state,
enpowering the model with more representation capacity. We also perform
extensive experiments on the classification and recognition tasks to show the
superiority of our method. For example, the grafted MobileNetV2 outperforms the

that given the input and computational resource requirements, calls the model
that will consume the minimum compute resources for a successful inference.
Mobile devices can use the proposed algorithm to offload the hard inputs to the
cloud while inferring the easy ones locally. Besides, in the large scale
cloud-based intelligent applications, instead of replicating the most-accurate
model, a range of small and large models can be multiplexed from depending on
the input's complexity which will save the cloud's computational resources. The
input complexity or hardness is determined by the number of models that can
predict the correct label. For example, if no model can predict the label
correctly, then the input is considered as the hardest. The proposed algorithm
allows the mobile device to detect the inputs that can be processed locally and
the ones that require a larger model and should be sent a cloud server.
Therefore, the mobile user benefits from not only the local processing but also
from an accurate model hosted on a cloud server. Our experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm improves mobile's model accuracy by 8.52% which is
because of those inputs that are properly selected and offloaded to the cloud
server. In addition, it saves the cloud providers' compute resources by a
factor of 2.85x as small models are chosen for easier inputs.

paths of pathogen transmission between the healthcare facilities:
inter-hospital patient transfers (direct transfers) and readmission of
colonized patients (indirect transfers). In the latter case, the patients may
be readmitted to the same facility or to a different one. Intra-hospital
pathogen transmission is governed by a SIS model expressed by a system of

  Using a network model created for a Lower Saxony region (Germany), we showed
that the proposed model reproduces the basic properties of
healthcare-associated pathogen spread. Moreover, it shows the important
contribution of the readmission of colonized patients on the prevalence of
individual hospitals as well as of overall healthcare system: it can increase
the overall prevalence by the factor of 4 as compared to inter-hospital
transfers only. The final prevalence in individual healthcare facilities was
shown to depend on average length of stay by a non-linear concave function.
  Finally, we demonstrated that the network parameters of the model may be
derived from administrative admission/discharge records. In particular, they
are sufficient to obtain inter-hospital transfer probabilities, and to express
the patients' transfer as a Markov process.

orbital positions (ecliptic longitudes) of the giant planets in ten-day

suggestion that the ~12-year and ~51-year periodicities in the north-south

time-reversal-symmetric system simulated by the superconducting circuits is
witnessed by the Euler number of the occupied band instead of the vanishing
Chern number. However, we note that there are some confusions about the
non-integer behaviors of the Euler number in the topological trivial phase. In
this paper, we show that the reason is straightforward because the quantum
metric tensor $g_{\mu \nu} $ is actually positive semi-definite. In a general
two-dimensional two-band system, we can proved that: (1) If the phase is
topological trivial, then the quantum metric must be degenerate (singular)~---
$\det {g_{\mu \nu} }=0$ in some region of the first Brillouin zone. This leads
to the invalidity of the Gauss-Bonnet formula and exhibits an ill-defined
``non-integer Euler number''; (2) If the phase is topological nontrivial with a
non-vanishing Berry curvature, then the quantum metric will be a positive
definite Riemann metric in the entire first Brillouin zone. Therefore the Euler
number of the energy band will be guaranteed an even number $\chi=2(1-g)$ by
the Gauss-Bonnet theorem on the closed two-dimensional Bloch energy band
manifold with the genus $g$, which provides an effective topological index for
a class of nontrivial topological phases.

be treated by anti-epileptic drugs and a much lower percentage by surgery.
Diagnostic procedures for epilepsy and monitoring are highly specialized and
labour-intensive. The accuracy of the diagnosis is also complicated by
overlapping medical symptoms, varying levels of experience and inter-observer
variability among clinical professions. This paper proposes a novel hybrid
bilinear deep learning network with an application in the clinical procedures
of epilepsy classification diagnosis, where the use of surface
electroencephalogram (sEEG) and audiovisual monitoring is standard practice.
Hybrid bilinear models based on two types of feature extractors, namely
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), are
trained using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) of one-second sEEG. In the
proposed hybrid models, CNNs extract spatio-temporal patterns, while RNNs focus
on the characteristics of temporal dynamics in relatively longer intervals
given the same input data. Second-order features, based on interactions between
these spatio-temporal features are further explored by bilinear pooling and
used for epilepsy classification. Our proposed methods obtain an F1-score of
97.4% on the Temple University Hospital Seizure Corpus and 97.2% on the
EPILEPSIAE dataset, comparing favourably to existing benchmarks for sEEG-based
seizure type classification. The open-source implementation of this study is

between the c,b-quark running masses{m}_{c,b}, the gluon condensate<\alpha_s
G^2> and the QCD coupling \alpha_s in the MS-scheme from an analysis of the
charmonium and bottomium spectra and the B_c-meson mass. We use optimized
ratios of relativistic Laplace sum rules (LSR) evaluated at the \mu-subtraction
stability point where higher orders PT and D< 6-8-dimensions non-perturbative
condensates corrections are included. We obtain [1] \alpha_s(2.85)=0.262(9) and
\alpha_s(9.50)=0.180(8) from the (pseudo)scalar
M_{\chi_{0c(0b)}}-M_{\eta_{c(b)}} mass-splittings at \mu=2.85(9.50) GeV. The
most precise result from the charm channel leads to \alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.318(15)
and \alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1183(19)(3) in excellent agreement with the world average:
\alpha_s(M_Z)=0.1181(11)[3,4]. Updated results from a global fit of the
(axial-)vector and (pseudo)scalar channels using Laplace and Moments sum rules
@ N2LO [1] combined with the one from M_{B_c} [2] lead to the new tentative QCD
spectral sum rules (QSSR) average : m_c(m_c)|_average= 1266(6) MeV and
m_b(m_b)|_average=4196(8) MeV. The values of the gluon condensate <\alpha_s
G^2> from the (axial)-vector charmonium channels combined with previous
determinations in Table 1, leads to the new QSSR average [1]: <\alpha_s
G^2>_average=(6.35\pm 0.35)x 10^{-2} GeV^4. Our results clarify the (apparent)
discrepancies between different estimates of <\alpha_s G^2> from J/\psi sum
rule but also shows the sensitivity of the sum rules on the choice of the
\mu-subtraction scale. As a biproduct, we deduce the B_c-decay constants
f_{B_c}=371(17) MeV and f_{B_c}(2S)< 139(6) MeV.

  arXiv:1904.00078",,,,"cs.RO cs.CV cs.HC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, an autonomous tethered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is
developed into a visual assistant in a marsupial co-robots team, collaborating
with a tele-operated Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for robot operations in
unstructured or confined environments. These environments pose extreme
challenges to the remote tele-operator due to the lack of sufficient
situational awareness, mostly caused by the unstructuredness and confinement,
stationary and limited field-of-view and lack of depth perception from the
robot's onboard cameras. To overcome these problems, a secondary tele-operated
robot is used in current practices, who acts as a visual assistant and provides
external viewpoints to overcome the perceptual limitations of the primary
robot's onboard sensors. However, a second tele-operated robot requires extra
manpower and teamwork demand between primary and secondary operators. The
manually chosen viewpoints tend to be subjective and sub-optimal. Considering
these intricacies, we develop an autonomous tethered aerial visual assistant in
place of the secondary tele-operated robot and operator, to reduce human robot
ratio from 2:2 to 1:2. Using a fundamental viewpoint quality theory, a formal
risk reasoning framework, and a newly developed tethered motion suite, our
visual assistant is able to autonomously navigate to good-quality viewpoints in
a risk-aware manner through unstructured or confined spaces with a tether. The
developed marsupial co-robots team could improve tele-operation efficiency in
nuclear operations, bomb squad, disaster robots, and other domains with novel
tasks or highly occluded environments, by reducing manpower and teamwork
demand, and achieving better visual assistance quality with trustworthy
risk-aware motion.

different ice mantles of varying compositions experimentally, in order to
evaluate their potential impact on astrochemical models. The sputtering yields
of complex organic molecules is of particular interest, since few mechanisms
are efficient enough to induce a significant feedback to the gas phase. We
irradiated methanol and carbon dioxide ice mixtures of varying ratios with
swift heavy ions in the electronic sputtering regime. We monitored the
evolution of the infrared spectra and the species released to the gas phase
with a mass spectrometer. Methanol and 13C-methanol isotopologue were used to
remove any ambiguity on the measured irradiation products. The sputtering of
methanol embedded in carbon dioxide ice is an efficient process leading to the
ejection of intact methanol in the gas phase. We establish that when methanol
is embedded in a carbon-dioxide-rich mantle exposed to cosmic rays, a
significant fraction is sputtered as intact molecules. The sputtered fraction
follows the time-dependent bulk composition of the ice mantle, the latter
evolving with time due to the radiolysis-induced evolution of the bulk. If
methanol is embedded in a carbon dioxide ice matrix, as the analyses of the
spectral shape of the CO2 bending mode observations in some lines of sight
suggest, the overall methanol sputtering yield is higher than if embedded in a
water ice mantle. The sputtering is increased by a factor close to the dominant
ice matrix sputtering yield, which is about six times higher for pure carbon
dioxide ice when compared to water ice. These experiments are further
constraining the cosmic-ray-induced ice mantle sputtering mechanisms important
role in the gas-phase release of complex organic molecules from the
interstellar solid phase.

challenging. Instead of separating a two-speaker signal in signal space like
speech source separation, a speaker embedding de-mixing approach is proposed.
The proposed approach separates different speaker properties from a two-speaker
signal in embedding space. The proposed approach contains two steps. In step
one, the clean speaker embeddings are learned and collected by a residual TDNN
based network. In step two, the two-speaker signal and the embedding of one of
the speakers are both input to a speaker embedding de-mixing network. The
de-mixing network is trained to generate the embedding of the other speaker by
reconstruction loss. Speaker identification accuracy and the cosine similarity
score between the clean embeddings and the de-mixed embeddings are used to
evaluate the quality of the obtained embeddings. Experiments are done in two
kind of data: artificial augmented two-speaker data (TIMIT) and real world
recording of two-speaker data (MC-WSJ). Six different speaker embedding
de-mixing architectures are investigated. Comparing with the performance on the

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1911.10187",,,,"cs.DC cs.CR cs.DM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We improve the fundamental security threshold of eventual consensus
Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain protocols under the longest-chain rule by
showing, for the first time, the positive effect of rounds with concurrent
honest leaders.
  Current security analyses reduce consistency to the dynamics of an abstract,
round-based block creation process that is determined by three events
associated with a round: (i) event $A$: at least one adversarial leader, (ii)
event $S$: a single honest leader, and (iii) event $M$: multiple, but honest,
leaders. We present an asymptotically optimal consistency analysis assuming
that an honest round is more likely than an adversarial round (i.e., $\Pr[S] +
\Pr[M] > \Pr[A]$); this threshold is optimal. This is a first in the literature
and can be applied to both the simple synchronous communication as well as
communication with bounded delays.
  In all existing consistency analyses, event $M$ is either penalized or
treated neutrally. Specifically, the consistency analyses in Ouroboros Praos
(Eurocrypt 2018) and Genesis (CCS 2018) assume that $\Pr[S] - \Pr[M] > \Pr[A]$;
the analyses in Sleepy Consensus (Asiacrypt 2017) and Snow White (Fin. Crypto
2019) assume that $\Pr[S] > \Pr[A]$. Moreover, all existing analyses completely
break down when $\Pr[S] < \Pr[A]$. These thresholds determine the critical
trade-off between the honest majority, network delays, and consistency error.
  Our new results can be directly applied to improve the security guarantees of
the existing protocols. We also provide an efficient algorithm to explicitly
calculate these error probabilities in the synchronous setting. Furthermore, we
complement these results by analyzing the setting where $S$ is rare, even
allowing $\Pr[S] = 0$, under the added assumption that honest players adopt a
consistent chain selection rule.

(ASR) field. However, it is challenging to deploy a Transformer-based
end-to-end (E2E) model for online speech recognition. In this paper, we propose
the Transformer-based online CTC/attention E2E ASR architecture, which contains
the chunk self-attention encoder (chunk-SAE) and the monotonic truncated
attention (MTA) based self-attention decoder (SAD). Firstly, the chunk-SAE
splits the speech into isolated chunks. To reduce the computational cost and
improve the performance, we propose the state reuse chunk-SAE. Sencondly, the
MTA based SAD truncates the speech features monotonically and performs
attention on the truncated features. To support the online recognition, we
integrate the state reuse chunk-SAE and the MTA based SAD into online
CTC/attention architecture. We evaluate the proposed online models on the HKUST
Mandarin ASR benchmark and achieve a 23.66% character error rate (CER) with a
320 ms latency. Our online model yields as little as 0.19% absolute CER
degradation compared with the offline baseline, and achieves significant
improvement over our prior work on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based online

normalized between -1 and 1 after each convolutional layer, and this leaves one
bit unused in half-precision floating-point representation. By taking advantage
of the unused bit, we create a backup for the most significant bit to protect
it against the soft errors. Also, considering the fact that in MLC STT-RAMs the
cost of memory operations (read and write), and reliability of a cell are
content-dependent (some patterns take larger current and longer time, while
they are more susceptible to soft error), we rearrange the data block to
minimize the number of costly bit patterns. Combining these two techniques
provides the same level of accuracy compared to an error-free baseline while
improving the read and write energy by 9% and 6%, respectively.

user's intention of the basket matters. The intent of a shopping basket can be
retrieved from both user-item collaborative filtering signals and multi-item
correlations. By defining a basket entity to represent the basket intent, we
can model this problem as a basket-item link prediction task in the
User-Basket-Item~(UBI) graph. Previous work solves the problem by leveraging
user-item interactions and item-item interactions simultaneously. However,
collectivity and heterogeneity characteristics are hardly investigated before.
Collectivity defines the semantics of each node which should be aggregated from
both directly and indirectly connected neighbors. Heterogeneity comes from
multi-type interactions as well as multi-type nodes in the UBI graph. To this
end, we propose a new framework named \textbf{BasConv}, which is based on the
graph convolutional neural network. Our BasConv model has three types of
aggregators specifically designed for three types of nodes. They collectively
learn node embeddings from both neighborhood and high-order context.
Additionally, the interactive layers in the aggregators can distinguish
different types of interactions. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets prove the effectiveness of BasConv. Our code is available online at

possess a certain community structure that plays an important role in
understanding the properties of these networks. Moreover, many machine learning
algorithms and tools that are developed for complex networks try to take
advantage of the existence of communities to improve their performance or
speed. As a result, there are many competing algorithms for detecting
communities in large networks. Unfortunately, these algorithms are often quite
sensitive and so they cannot be fine-tuned for a given, but a constantly
changing, real-world network at hand. It is therefore important to test these
algorithms for various scenarios that can only be done using synthetic graphs
that have built-in community structure, power-law degree distribution, and
other typical properties observed in complex networks. The standard and
extensively used method for generating artificial networks is the LFR graph
generator. Unfortunately, this model has some scalability limitations and it is
challenging to analyze it theoretically. Finally, the mixing parameter $\mu$,
the main parameter of the model guiding the strength of the communities, has a
non-obvious interpretation and so can lead to unnaturally-defined networks. In
this paper, we provide an alternative random graph model with community
structure and power-law distribution for both degrees and community sizes, the
Artificial Benchmark for Community Detection (ABCD). We show that the new model
solves the three issues identified above and more. The conclusion is that these
models produce comparable graphs but ABCD is fast, simple, and can be easily
tuned to allow the user to make a smooth transition between the two extremes:
pure (independent) communities and random graph with no community structure.

  Recommendation","This paper has been accepted by IEEE TKDE",,,,"cs.SI cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social recommendation has emerged to leverage social connections among users
for predicting users' unknown preferences, which could alleviate the data
sparsity issue in collaborative filtering based recommendation. Early
approaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors'
interests for better user modeling and failed to model the social influence
diffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we
propose a preliminary work of a neural influence diffusion network (i.e.,
DiffNet) for social recommendation (Diffnet), which models the recursive social
diffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user.
However, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social
network and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion
process in the social network would neglect the users' latent collaborative
interests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose
DiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence
diffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the
social recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest
network as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting these two network
information for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by
iteratively aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's
previous embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the
social network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the
user-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention
network that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these
three aspects. Finally, extensive experimental results on two real-world
datasets clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model.
