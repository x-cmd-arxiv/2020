machine learning. Current approaches for these issues are mixup, SamplePairing
and BC learning. In our work, we state the hypothesis that mixing many images
together can be more effective than just two. Batchboost pipeline has three
stages: (a) pairing: method of selecting two samples. (b) mixing: how to create
a new one from two samples. (c) feeding: combining mixed samples with new ones
from dataset into batch (with ratio $\gamma$). Note that sample that appears in
our batch propagates with subsequent iterations with less and less importance
until the end of training. Pairing stage calculates the error per sample, sorts
the samples and pairs with strategy: hardest with easiest one, than mixing
stage merges two samples using mixup, $x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2$. Finally, feeding
stage combines new samples with mixed by ratio 1:1. Batchboost has 0.5-3%
better accuracy than the current state-of-the-art mixup regularization on
CIFAR-10 & Fashion-MNIST. Our method is slightly better than SamplePairing
technique on small datasets (up to 5%). Batchboost provides stable training on
not tuned parameters (like weight decay), thus its a good method to test
performance of different architectures. Source code is at:

finite set of sampled data affected by a bounded measurement noise, with
unknown bound. The objective is to identify one-step-ahead models and their
accuracy in terms of worst-case simulation error bounds. To do so, the Set
Membership identification framework is exploited. Theoretical results are
derived, allowing one to estimate the noise bound and system decay rate. Then,
these quantities and the data are employed to define the Feasible Parameter Set
(FPS), which contains all possible models compatible with the available
information. Here, the estimated decay rate is used to refine the standard FPS
formulation, by adding constraints that enforce the desired converging behavior
of the models' impulse response. Moreover, guaranteed simulation error bounds
for an infinite future horizon are derived, improving over recent results
pertaining to finite simulation horizon only. These bounds are the basis for a
result and method to guarantee asymptotic stability of the identified model.
Finally, the desired one-step-ahead model is identified by means of numerical
optimization, and the related simulation error bounds are evaluated. Both
input-output and state-space model structures are addressed. The approach is
showcased on a numerical example and on real-world experimental data of the
roll rate dynamics of an autonomous glider.

objects from measurements of the perturbed magnetic field in metal detection
taken over range of low frequencies. The magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT)
provides a characterisation of a conducting permeable object using a small
number of coefficients, has explicit formula for their calculation and a well
understood frequency behaviour, which we call its spectral signature. However,
to compute such signatures, and build a library of them for object
classification, requires repeated solution of a direct (full order) problem,
which is typically accomplished using a finite element discretisation. To
overcome this issue, we propose an efficient reduced order model (ROM) using a
proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for the rapid computation of MPT spectral
signatures. Our ROM benefits from output certificates, which give bounds on the
accuracy of the predicted outputs with respect to the full order model
solutions. To further increase the efficiency of the computation of the MPT
spectral signature, we provide scaling results, which enable an immediate
calculation of the signature under changes in the object size or conductivity.
We illustrate our approach by application to a range of homogenous and
inhomogeneous conducting permeable objects.

High-Resolution Feature-based Attack (HRFA), yielding authentic adversarial

modifying the latent feature representation of the image, i.e., the gradients
back propagate not only through the victim DNN, but also through the generative

generates adversarial examples that are in high-resolution, realistic,

observed microlensing of the individual quasar images. A small sample of
gravitationally lensed quasar systems was chosen where the quasar images appear
to lie on the fringe of the stellar distribution of the lensing galaxy. As with
most quasar systems, all the individual quasar images were observed to be
microlensed. The surface brightness of the lensing galaxy at the positions of
the quasar images was measured from HST frames, and converted to stellar
surface mass density. The surface density of smoothly distributed dark matter
at the image positions was obtained from lensing models of the quasar systems
and applied to the stellar surface mass density to give the optical depth to
microlensing. This was then used to assess the probability that the stars in
the lensing galaxy could be responsible for the observed microlensing. The
results were supported by microlensing simulations of the star fields around
the quasar images combined with values of convergence and shear from the
lensing models. Taken together, the probability that all the observed
microlensing is due to stars was found to be ~0.0003. Errors resulting from
surface brightness measurement, mass-to-light ratio and the contribution of the
dark matter halo do not significantly affect this result. It is argued that the
most plausible candidates for the microlenses are primordial black holes,
either in the dark matter halos of the lensing galaxies, or more generally
distributed along the lines of sight to the quasars.

from the raw trajectory data? How can we infer such a mobility model from the

inference to accommodate the real-world trajectory data that is sparsely
sampled over time?
  In this paper, based on formal and rigid definitions of the stay/travel
mobility, we propose a single trajectory inference algorithm that utilizes a
generic long-tailed sparsity pattern in the large-scale trajectory data. The
algorithm guarantees a 100\% precision in the stay/travel inference with a
provable lower-bound in the recall. Furthermore, we introduce an
encoder-decoder learning architecture that admits multiple trajectories as
inputs. The architecture is optimized for the mobility inference problem
through customized embedding and learning mechanism. Evaluations with three
trajectory data sets of 40 million urban users validate the performance
guarantees of the proposed inference algorithm and demonstrate the superiority
of our deep learning model, in comparison to well-known sequence learning
methods. On extremely sparse trajectories, the deep learning model achieves a
2$\times$ overall accuracy improvement from the single trajectory inference
algorithm, through proven scalability and generalizability to large-scale

clinical operations such as cardiac bi-ventricular volume estimation. More
recently, there has been a shift to utilizing deep learning and fully
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image segmentation that has
yielded state-of-the-art results in many public benchmark datasets. Despite the
progress of deep learning in medical image segmentation, standard CNNs are
still not fully adopted in clinical settings as they lack robustness and
interpretability. Shapes are generally more meaningful features than solely
textures of images, which are features regular CNNs learn, causing a lack of
robustness. Likewise, previous works surrounding model interpretability have
been focused on post hoc gradient-based saliency methods. However,
gradient-based saliency methods typically require additional computations post
hoc and have been shown to be unreliable for interpretability. Thus, we present
a new architecture called Shape Attentive U-Net (SAUNet) which focuses on model
interpretability and robustness. The proposed architecture attempts to address
these limitations by the use of a secondary shape stream that captures rich
shape-dependent information in parallel with the regular texture stream.
Furthermore, we suggest multi-resolution saliency maps can be learned using our
dual-attention decoder module which allows for multi-level interpretability and
mitigates the need for additional computations post hoc. Our method also

  Airborne Time in China and the U.S","44 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Actual airborne time (AAT) is the time between wheels-off and wheels-on of a
flight. Understanding the behavior of AAT is increasingly important given the
ever growing demand for air travel and flight delays becoming more rampant. As
no research on AAT exists, this paper performs the first empirical analysis of
AAT behavior, comparatively for the U.S. and China. The focus is on how AAT is
affected by scheduled block time (SBT), origin-destination (OD) distance, and
the possible pressure to reduce AAT from other parts of flight operations.
Multiple econometric models are developed. The estimation results show that in
both countries AAT is highly correlated with SBT and OD distance. Flights in
the U.S. are faster than in China. On the other hand, facing ground delay prior
to takeoff, a flight has limited capability to speed up. The pressure from
short turnaround time after landing to reduce AAT is immaterial. Sensitivity
analysis of AAT to flight length and aircraft utilization is further conducted.
Given the more abundant airspace, flexible routing networks, and efficient ATFM
procedures, a counterfactual that the AAT behavior in the U.S. were adopted in
China is examined. We find that by doing so significant efficiency gains could
be achieved in the Chinese air traffic system. On average, 11.8 minutes of AAT
per flight would be saved, coming from both reduction in SBT and reduction in
AAT relative to the new SBT. Systemwide fuel saving would amount to over 300
million gallons with direct airline operating cost saving of nearly $1.3
billion nationwide in 2016.

propagation in nematic liquid crystals is undertaken. These dispersive shock
waves are generated from step initial conditions for the optical field and are
resonant in that linear diffractive waves are in resonance with the DSW,
resulting in a resonant linear wavetrain propagating ahead of it. It is found
that there are six regimes, which are distinct and require different solution
methods. In previous studies, the same solution method was used for all
regimes, which does not yield solutions in full agreement with numerical
solutions. Indeed, the standard DSW structure disappears for sufficiently large
initial jumps. Asymptotic theory, approximate methods or Whitham modulation
theory are used to find solutions for these resonant dispersive shock waves in
a given regime. The solutions are found to be in excellent agreement with
numerical solutions of the nematic equations in all regimes. It is found that
for small initial jumps, the resonant wavetrain is unstable, but that it
stabilises above a critical jump height. It is additionally found that the DSW
is unstable, except for small jump heights for which there is no resonance and
large jump heights for which there is no standard DSW structure.

stars have strong mass loss, these spectra provide valuable information about
supernova progenitors, such as mass-loss rates, wind velocities, and surface
abundances. We show that these events span a wide range of explosion and
progenitor properties, exhibiting supernova luminosities in the 1e8 to 1e12
Lsun range, temperatures from 10000 to 60000 K, progenitor mass-loss rates from
a few 1e-4 up to 1 Msun/yr, wind velocities from 100 to 800 km/s, and surface

progenitors of supernovae interacting with circumstellar material have
significantly increased mass-loss before explosion compared to what massive
stars show during the rest of their lifetimes. We also infer a lack of
correlation between surface abundances and mass-loss rates. This may point to
the pre-explosion mass-loss mechanism being independent of stellar mass. We
find that the majority of these events have CNO-processed surface abundances.
In the single star scenario this points to a preference towards high-mass RSGs

process of energy transfer from kinetic energy to internal energy due to
molecular viscosity. In large eddy simulation (LES) with one-equation
turbulence models, the energy dissipation process is modeled by a rate term in
the transport equation of the subgrid-scale (SGS) kinetic energy. Despite its
important role in maintaining a proper energy balance between the resolved and
SGS scales, modeling of the energy dissipation rate has received scarce
attention. In this paper, a SGS model belonging to the dynamic structure family
is developed based on findings from direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies
of decaying isotropic turbulence. The model utilizes a Leonard-type term, a SGS
viscosity, and a characteristic scaling term to predict the energy dissipation
rate in LES. A posteriori tests of the model have been carried out under
direct-injection gasoline and diesel engine-like conditions. Spray
characteristics such as penetration rates and mixture fractions have been
examined. It is found that the current SGS model accurately predicts
vapor-phase penetrations across different mesh resolutions under both gasoline
and diesel spray conditions, due to its correct scaling of SGS energy
dissipation rate with the SGS kinetic energy and LES fitter width. In contrast,
the classic model that is widely used in the literature predicts a scaling of
energy dissipation rate upon mesh resolution, exhibiting a noticeable mesh
dependence.

given as the symmetric closure of a locally confluent and (co-)well-founded
relation. We show that, assuming the property in question is sufficiently nice,
it is enough to prove it for the empty cycle and for cycles given by local
confluence.
  Our motivation and application is in the field of homotopy type theory, which
allows us to work with the higher-dimensional structures that appear in
homotopy theory and in higher category theory, making coherence a central
issue. This is in particular true for quotienting - a natural operation which
gives a new type for any binary relation on a type and, in order to be
well-behaved, cuts off higher structure (set-truncates). The latter makes it
hard to characterise the type of maps from a quotient into a higher type, and
several open problems stem from this difficulty.
  We prove our theorem on cycles in a type-theoretic setting and use it to show
coherence conditions necessary to eliminate from set-quotients into 1-types,
deriving approximations to open problems on free groups and pushouts. We have

Moreover, no tool is available to verify if the Bit-Alias is within given

physical processes in the presence of ultra-strong magnetic fields. Up to now,
most of our knowledge about magnetar sources came from spectral analysis, which
allowed to test the resonant Compton scattering scenario and to probe the
structure of the star magnetosphere. On the other hand, radiation emitted from
magnetar surface is expected to be strongly polarized and its observed
polarization pattern bears the imprint of both scatterings onto magnetospheric
charges and QED effects as it propagates in the magnetized vacuum around the
star. X-ray polarimeters scheduled to fly in the next years will finally allow
to exploit the wealth of information stored in the polarization observables.
Here we revisit the problem of assessing the spectro-polarimetric properties of
magnetar persistent emission. At variance with previous investigations, proper
account for more physical surface emission models is made by considering either
a condensed surface or a magnetized atmosphere. Results are used to simulate

spectral models. In this work we demonstrate how producing these models for a
time series of data can provide unique information about supernovae (SNe).
Unlike previous work, we specifically concentrate on the method for obtaining
the best synthetic spectral fits, and the errors associated with the preferred
model parameters. We demonstrate how varying the ejecta mass, bolometric
luminosity ($L_{bol}$) and photospheric velocity ($v_{ph}$), affects the
outcome of the synthetic spectra. As an example we analyze the photospheric
phase spectra of the GRB-SN\,2016jca. It is found that for most epochs (where
the afterglow subtraction is small) the error on $L_{bol}$ and $v_{ph}$ was
$\sim$5\%. The uncertainty on ejecta mass and K.E. was found to be $\sim$20%,
although this can be expected to dramatically decrease if models of nebular
phase data can be simultaneously produced. We also demonstrate how varying the
elemental abundance in the ejecta can produce better synthetic spectral fits.
In the case of SN\,2016jca it is found that a decreasing $^{56}$Ni abundance as
a function of decreasing velocity produces the best fit models. This could be
the case if the $^{56}$Ni was sythesised at the side of the GRB jet, or dredged
up from the centre of the explosion. The work presented here can be used as a
guideline for future studies on supernovae which use the same or similar
radiation transfer code.

Software Defined Networking (SDN), by permitting support of stateful flow
processing functions over hardware network switches specifically designed for

stateful data planes permit to keep (and dynamically update) local per-flow
states inside network switches, thus dramatically improving reactiveness of
network applications to state changes. Still, also in stateful data planes, the
control and update of non-local states is assumed to be completely delegated to

  Our LOADER proposal aims at contrasting the apparent dichotomy between local

take localized (in-switch) decisions not only on local states but also on
replicated global states, thus providing support for network-wide applications
without incurring the drawbacks of classical approaches. To this purpose, i) we
provide high-level programming abstractions devised to define the states and
the update logic of a generic network-wide application, and ii) we detail the
underlying low level state management and replication mechanisms. We then show
LOADER's independence of the stateful data plane technology employed, by
implementing it over two distinct stateful data planes (P4 switches and OPP -
Open Packet Processor - switches), and by experimentally validating both
implementations in an emulated testbed using a simple distributed

tuning of the device parameters. To date, crosstalk to the dot potentials is
routinely and efficiently compensated using so-called virtual gates, which are
specific linear combinations of physical gate voltages. However, due to
exponential dependence of tunnel couplings on gate voltages, crosstalk to the
tunnel barriers is currently compensated through a slow iterative process. In
this work, we show that the crosstalk on tunnel barriers can be efficiently
characterized and compensated for, using the fact that the same exponential
dependence applies to all gates. We demonstrate efficient calibration of
crosstalk in a quadruple quantum dot array and define a set of virtual barrier

for the computation of graph problems. It allows the edges of an $n$-node input
graph to be read sequentially in $p$ passes using $\tilde{O}(n)$ space. In this
model, some graph problems, such as spanning trees and $k$-connectivity, can be
exactly solved in a single pass; while other graph problems, such as triangle
detection and unweighted all-pairs shortest paths, are known to require
$\tilde{\Omega}(n)$ passes to compute. For many fundamental graph problems, the
tractability in these models is open. In this paper, we study the tractability
of computing some standard spanning trees. Our results are:
  (1) Maximum-Leaf Spanning Trees. This problem is known to be APX-complete
with inapproximability constant $\rho\in[245/244,2)$. By constructing an
$\varepsilon$-MLST sparsifier, we show that for every constant $\varepsilon >
0$, MLST can be approximated in a single pass to within a factor of
$1+\varepsilon$ w.h.p. (albeit in super-polynomial time for $\varepsilon \le
\rho-1$ assuming $\mathrm{P} \ne \mathrm{NP}$).
  (2) BFS Trees. It is known that BFS trees require $\omega(1)$ passes to
compute, but the na\""{i}ve approach needs $O(n)$ passes. We devise a new
randomized algorithm that reduces the pass complexity to $O(\sqrt{n})$, and it
offers a smooth tradeoff between pass complexity and space usage.
  (3) DFS Trees. The current best algorithm by Khan and Mehta {[}STACS 2019{]}
takes $\tilde{O}(h)$ passes, where $h$ is the height of computed DFS trees. Our
contribution is twofold. First, we provide a simple alternative proof of this
result, via a new connection to sparse certificates for $k$-node-connectivity.
Second, we present a randomized algorithm that reduces the pass complexity to
$O(\sqrt{n})$, and it also offers a smooth tradeoff between pass complexity and
space usage.

the minimizer to intensify its calculations near the boundary separating each

expensive calculations deep within the normal or superfluid regions, resulting
in more efficient use of compute time. The application of the procedure we

trajectories in the $(d,N)$-plane: $d=3-\alpha/N$ and not at fixed dimension
$d=3$. Our study also reveals that the known BMB line is only half of the true
line of fixed points, the second half being made of singular fixed points. The
potentials of these singular fixed points show a cusp for a finite value of the
field and their finite $N$ counterparts a boundary layer.

usually associated with chaos can be directly detected from the evolution of
the number operator in the one-dimensional, noninteracting Aubry-Andr\'e model.
Both the quantity and the model are studied in experiments with cold atoms. We
consider a single-particle and system sizes experimentally reachable. By
varying the disorder strength within values below the critical point of the
model, level statistics similar to those found in random matrix theory are
obtained. Dynamically, these properties of the spectrum are manifested in the

II using deep photometry from the 1.3m SkyMapper telescope at Siding Spring
Observatory, Australia. The SkyMapper filter-set contains a
metallicity-sensitive intermediate-band $v$ filter covering the prominent Ca II
K feature at 3933.7A. When combined with photometry from the SkyMapper $u, g$,
and $i$ filters, we demonstrate that $v$ band photometry can be used to obtain
stellar metallicities with a precision of $\sim0.20$dex when [Fe/H] $> -2.5$,
and $\sim0.34$dex when [Fe/H] $< -2.5$. Since the $u$ and $v$ filters bracket
the Balmer Jump at 3646A, we also find that the filter-set can be used to
derive surface gravities. We thus derive photometric metallicities and surface
gravities for all stars down to a magnitude of $g\sim20$ within $\sim$75
arcminutes of Tucana II. Photometric metallicity and surface gravity cuts
remove nearly all foreground contamination. By incorporating Gaia proper
motions, we derive quantitative membership probabilities which recover all
known members on the red giant branch of Tucana II. Additionally, we identify
multiple likely new members in the center of the system and candidate members
several half-light radii from the center of the system. Finally, we present a
metallicity distribution function derived from the photometric metallicities of
likely Tucana II members. This result demonstrates the utility of wide-field
imaging with the SkyMapper filter-set in studying UFDs, and in general, low
surface brightness populations of metal-poor stars. Upcoming work will clarify
the membership status of several distant stars identified as candidate members

barrier to treatment success. While research has traditionally focused on
genetic sources of resistance, recent findings suggest that cancer cells can
acquire transient resistant phenotypes via epigenetic modifications and other
non-genetic mechanisms. Although these resistant phenotypes are eventually
relinquished by individual cells, they can temporarily 'save' the tumor from
extinction and enable the emergence of more permanent resistance mechanisms.
These observations have generated interest in the potential of epigenetic
therapies for long-term tumor control or eradication. In this work, we develop
a mathematical model to study how phenotypic switching at the single-cell level
affects resistance evolution in cancer. We highlight unique features of
non-genetic resistance, probe the evolutionary consequences of epigenetic drugs
and explore potential therapeutic strategies. We find that even short-term
epigenetic modifications and stochastic fluctuations in gene expression can
drive long-term drug resistance in the absence of any bona fide resistance
mechanisms. We also find that an epigenetic drug that slightly perturbs the
average retention of the resistant phenotype can turn guaranteed treatment
failure into guaranteed success. Lastly, we find that combining an epigenetic
drug with an anti-cancer agent can significantly outperform monotherapy, and
that treatment outcome is heavily affected by drug sequencing.

resolution coordinate data permits sports scientists to have to-the-second
estimates of external load metrics, such as acceleration load and high speed
running distance, traditionally used to understand the physical toll a game
takes on an athlete. Unfortunately, collecting this data requires installation
of expensive hardware and paying costly licensing fees to data providers,
restricting its availability. Algorithms have been developed that allow a
traditional broadcast feed to be converted to x-y coordinate data, making
tracking data easier to acquire, but coordinates are available for an athlete
only when that player is within the camera frame. Obviously, this leads to
inaccuracies in player load estimates, limiting the usefulness of this data for
sports scientists. In this research, we develop models that predict offscreen
load metrics and demonstrate the viability of broadcast-derived tracking data

storing unit, simply consisting of a system, acting as the battery, and a bath.
The charging cycle---connect, let thermalize, disconnect, extract
work---requires very little external control and the charged state of the
battery, being a part of global thermal equilibrium, can be maintained
indefinitely and for free. The efficiency, defined as the ratio of the
extractable work stored in the battery and the total work spent on connecting

also a source of dissipation: the entropy production per charging cycle is
always significant, strongly limiting the efficiency in all coupling strength
regimes. We show that our general results also hold for generic microcanonical

The total complexity depends on the specific problem, however, starting from
work \cite{nemirovski2009robust} it was generally accepted that the SA is
better than the SAA. % Nevertheless, in case of large-scale problems SA may run
out of memory as storing all data on one machine and organizing online access

contradistinction to SA allows parallel/distributed calculations. We show that

size of galaxies and has a number of plausible application to study cosmology
and galaxy physics. We present a detailed analysis of the fundamental plane of
the SDSS-III BOSS LOWZ and CMASS galaxies. For the standard fundamental plane,
we find a strong redshift evolution for the mean residual and show that it is
primarily driven by the redshift evolution of the surface brightness of the
galaxies. After correcting for the redshift evolution, the FP residuals are
strongly correlated with the galaxy properties and some observational
systematics. We show that the variations in the FP between the central and
satellite galaxies, that have been observed in the literature, can primarily be
explained by the correlation of the FP with the galaxy luminosity. We also
measure the cross correlations of the FP residuals with the galaxy density
field. The amplitude of the cross correlations depends on the galaxy properties
and environment with brighter and redder galaxies showing stronger correlation.
In general, galaxies in denser environments (higher galaxy bias ) show stronger
correlations. We also compare FP amplitude with the amplitudes of intrinsic
alignments of galaxy shapes (IA), finding the two to be correlated. Finally,
using the FP residuals we also study the impact of intrinsic alignments on the
constraint of growth rate using redshift space distortions. We do not observe
any significant trends in measurements of the growth rate $f$ as function of

untrained observers a gold standard in fixation detection?"" They conclude the
answer is no. If they had entitled their paper: ""Is human classification by
experienced untrained observers a gold standard in fixation detection when data
quality is very poor, data are error-filled, data presentation was not optimal,
and the analysis was seriously flawed?"", I would have no case to make. In the
present report, I will present evidence to support my view that this latter
title is justified. The low quality data assessment is based on using a
relatively imprecise eye-tracker, the absence of head restraint for any
subjects, and the use of infants as the majority of subjects (60 of 70
subjects). Allowing subjects with more than 50% missing data (as much as 95%)
is also evidence of low quality data. The error-filled assessment is based on
evidence that a number of the ""fixations"" classified by ""experts"" have obvious
saccades within them, and that, apparently, a number of fixations were
classified on the basis of no signal at all. The evidence for non-optimal data
presentation stems from the fact that, in a number of cases, perfectly good
data was not presented to the coders. The flaws in the analysis are evidenced
by the fact that entire stretches of missing data were considered classified,
and that the measurement of saccade amplitude was based on many cases in which
there was no saccade at all. Without general evidence to the contrary, it is
correct to assume that some human classifiers under some conditions may meet
the criteria for a gold standard, and classifiers under other conditions may
not. This conditionality is not recognized by Hooge et al. A fair assessment
would conclude that whether or not humans can be considered a gold standard is
still very much an open question.

two sets of 3D points in the presence of large amounts of outlier
correspondences. We first reformulate the registration problem using a
Truncated Least Squares (TLS) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of
spurious correspondences. Then, we provide a general graph-theoretic framework
to decouple scale, rotation, and translation estimation, which allows solving
in cascade for the three transformations. Despite the fact that each subproblem
is still non-convex and combinatorial in nature, we show that (i) TLS scale and
(component-wise) translation estimation can be solved in polynomial time via
adaptive voting, (ii) TLS rotation estimation can be relaxed to a semidefinite
program (SDP) and the relaxation is tight, even in the presence of extreme
outlier rates, and (iii) the graph-theoretic framework allows drastic pruning
of outliers by finding the maximum clique. We name the resulting algorithm
TEASER (Truncated least squares Estimation And SEmidefinite Relaxation). While
solving large SDP relaxations is typically slow, we develop a second fast and
certifiable algorithm, named TEASER++, that uses graduated non-convexity to
solve the rotation subproblem and leverages Douglas-Rachford Splitting to
efficiently certify global optimality.
  For both algorithms, we provide theoretical bounds on the estimation errors,
which are the first of their kind for robust registration problems. Moreover,
we test their performance on standard, object detection, and the 3DMatch
benchmarks, and show that (i) both algorithms dominate the state of the art and
are robust to more than 99% outliers, (ii) TEASER++ can run in milliseconds,
and (iii) TEASER++ is so robust it can also solve problems without
correspondences, where it largely outperforms ICP and it is more accurate than
Go-ICP while being orders of magnitude faster.

We study both electron-phonon and entirely electronic pairing mechanisms. In

subleading pairing phases belong to the $E$ channel. We explicitly compute the
momentum dependence of the associated order parameters and find that the
leading state has no nodal points for electron-phonon pairing but exhibits six
sign changes on the Fermi surface if the Coulomb interaction dominates. On top
of these system-specific considerations, we also present general results
relevant to other correlated graphene-based moir\'e superlattice systems. We
show that, irrespective of microscopic details, triplet pairing will be
stabilized if the collective electronic fluctuations breaking the enhanced

under time reversal, even when the main $\text{SU}(2)_+ \times

acceleration that operate on volumes of several Mpc$^3$. Numerical simulations
suggest that such bridges are dynamically complex and that weak shocks and
super-Alfv\'{e}nic turbulence can be driven across the entire volume of these
regions. In this Letter we explore, for the first time, the role of second
order Fermi mechanisms for the reacceleration of relativistic electrons
interacting with turbulence in these peculiar regions. We assume the turbulent
energy flux measured in simulations and adopt a scenario in which relativistic
particles scatter with magnetic field lines diffusing in super-Alfv\'enic
turbulence and magnetic fields are amplified by the same turbulence. We show
that steep spectrum and volume filling synchrotron emission can be generated in
the entire intra-cluster bridge region thus providing a natural explanation for
radio bridges. Consequently, radio observations have the potential to probe the
dissipation of energy on scales larger than galaxy clusters and second order
Fermi mechanisms operating in physical regimes that are still poorly explored.
This has a potential impact on several branches of astrophysics and cosmology.

based on forward modeling the appearance of the source in the image plane,
taking into account the distortion by lensing and the instrumental point spread
function (PSF). For singly-imaged sources a global lens model in the format of
the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) lensing maps is required as a starting point.
For multiply-imaged sources, the tool can also fit and apply first

corrections to the local gravitational potential to improve the reconstruction,
depending on the quality of the data. We illustrate the performance and
features of the code with two examples of multiply-imaged systems taken from

in the 12CO J=2-1 line, as well as cloud contamination, the kinks are usually
detected in only one spectral channel, and will require confirmation. The
strongest circumstantial evidence for protoplanets in the absence of higher
spectral resolution data and additional tracers is that, upon deprojection, we
find that all of the candidate planets lie within a gap and/or at the end of a
spiral detected in dust continuum emission. This suggests that a significant
fraction of the dust gaps and spirals observed by ALMA in disks are caused by
embedded protoplanets.

We use the spectra of more than 30,000 red giant branch (RGB) stars in
25 globular clusters (GC), obtained within the MUSE survey of Galactic globular
clusters, to calibrate the Ca II triplet (CaT) metallicity relation and derive
metallicities for all individual stars. We investigate the overall metallicity
distributions as well as those of the different populations within each
cluster.
  Methods. The Ca II triplet in the near-infrared at 8498, 8542, and 8662 AA is
visible in stars with spectral types between F and M and can be used to
determine their metallicities. In this work, we calibrate the relation using
average cluster metallicities from literature and MUSE spectra, and extend it
below the horizontal branch - a cutoff that has traditionally been made to
avoid a non-linear relation - using a quadratic function. In addition to the
classic relation based on V-VHB we also present calibrations based on absolute
magnitude and luminosity. The obtained relations are then used to calculate
metallicities for all the stars in the sample and to derive metallicity
distributions for different populations within a cluster, which have been
separated using so-called ""chromosome maps"" based on HST photometry.
  Results. We show that, despite the relatively low spectral resolution of MUSE
(R=1900-3700) we can derive single star metallicities with a mean statistical
intra-cluster uncertainty of ~0.12 dex. We present metallicity distributions
for the RGB stars in 25 GCs, and investigate the different metallicities of the
populations P3 (and higher) in so-called metal-complex or Type II clusters,
finding metallicity variations in all of them. We also detected unexpected
metallicity variations in the Type I cluster NGC 2808 and confirm the Type II

galaxies it decreases by $\sim 35\%$. We compare our results to other
measurements, finding good agreement at all redshifts, for both blue and red

During a period of two weeks in July 2014, the highest X-ray activity of Mrk501
was observed in ~14 years of operation of the Neil Gehrels Swift Gamma-ray
Burst Observatory. We characterize the broadband variability of Mrk501 from
radio to VHE gamma rays, and evaluate whether it can be interpreted within
theoretical scenarios widely used to explain the broadband emission from
blazars. The temporal evolution of the most prominent and variable segments of
the SED is described with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model with
variations in the break energy of the electron energy distribution (EED), and
with some adjustments in the magnetic field strength and spectral shape of the
EED. A narrow feature at ~3 TeV was observed in the VHE spectrum measured on
2014 July 19 (MJD 56857.98), which is the day with the highest X-ray flux
($>0.3$ keV) measured during the entire Swift mission. This feature is
inconsistent with the classical analytic functions to describe the measured VHE
spectra (power law, log-parabola, and log-parabola with exponential cutoff) at
more than 3$\sigma$. A fit with a log-parabola plus a narrow component is
preferred over the fit with a single log-parabola at more than 4$\sigma$, and a
dedicated Monte Carlo simulation estimated the significance of this extra
component to be larger than 3$\sigma$. Under the assumption that this VHE
spectral feature is real, we show that it can be reproduced with three distinct
theoretical scenarios: a) a pileup in the EED due to stochastic acceleration;
b) a structured jet with two-SSC emitting regions, with one region dominated by
an extremely narrow EED; and c) an emission from an IC pair cascade.

large (Mpc-scale) environments, which can constrain the growth and evolution of
supermassive black holes. Here we measure the clustering of luminous
X-ray-selected AGN in the Stripe 82X and XMM-XXL-North surveys around the peak
epoch of black hole growth, in order to investigate the dependence of
luminosity on large-scale AGN environment. We compute the auto-correlation
function of AGN in two luminosity bins, $10^{43}\leq L_X<10^{44.5}$ erg
s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim 0.8$ and $L_X\geq 10^{44.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at $z\sim 1.8$,
and calculate the AGN bias taking into account the redshift distribution of the
sources using three different methods. Our results show that while the less
luminous sample has an inferred typical halo mass that is smaller than for the
more luminous AGN, the host halo mass may be less dependent on luminosity than
suggested in previous work. Focusing on the luminous sample, we calculate a
typical host halo mass of $\sim 10^{13}$ M$_{\odot}~h^{-1}$, which is similar
to previous measurements of moderate-luminosity X-ray AGN and significantly
larger than the values found for optical quasars of similar luminosities and
redshifts. We suggest that the clustering differences between different AGN
selection techniques are dominated by selection biases, and not due to a
dependence on AGN luminosity. We discuss the limitations of inferring AGN
triggering mechanisms from halo masses derived by large-scale bias.

For a $U(2)$ gauge theory defined with a spin structure, the vanishing of the
bordism group $\Omega_5^{\text{Spin}}(BU(2))$ implies that there can be no
global anomalies, in contrast to the related case of an $SU(2)$ gauge theory.
We show explicitly that the familiar $SU(2)$ global anomaly is replaced by a
local anomaly when $SU(2)$ is embedded in $U(2)$. There must be an even number
of fermions with isospin $2r+1/2$, for $r\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, for this
local anomaly to cancel. The case of a $U(2)$ theory defined without a choice
of spin structure but rather using a spin-$U(2)$ structure, which is possible
when all fermions (bosons) have half-integer (integer) isospin and odd (even)
$U(1)$ charge, is more subtle. We find that the recently-discovered `new
$SU(2)$ global anomaly' is also equivalent, though only at the level of the
partition function, to a perturbative anomaly in the $U(2)$ theory, which is
this time a combination of a mixed gauge anomaly with a gauge-gravity anomaly.
This perturbative anomaly vanishes if there is an even number of fermions with
isospin $4r+3/2$, for $r\in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$, recovering the condition for
cancelling the new $SU(2)$ anomaly. Alternatively, this perturbative anomaly
can be cancelled by a Wess--Zumino term, leaving a low-energy theory with a
global anomaly, which can itself be cancelled by coupling to topological
degrees of freedom.

calculate the laminar flame speeds in degenerate oxygen-neon mixtures with

considered in previous work. We find that trace carbon has little effect on the
flame speeds, but that material with electron fraction $Y_e \approx 0.48-0.49$
has laminar flame speeds that are $\approx 2$ times faster than those at $Y_e =

have replaced the blockchain linear structure with a more flexible directed

fast-growing diffusion of directed acyclic graph based distributed ledger
technologies, researchers lack a basic understanding of their behavior. In this
paper we analyze the Tangle, a directed acyclic graph that is used (with
certain modifications) in various protocols such as IOTA, Byteball, Avalanche

continuous-time model to examine tip count stability and cumulative weight
evolution while varying the rate of incoming transactions. In particular we
confirm analytical predictions on the number of tips with uniform random tip
selection strategy. Second, we show how different tip selection algorithms
affect the growth of the Tangle. Moreover, we explain these differences by
analyzing the spread of exit probabilities of random walks. Our findings
confirm analytically derived predictions and provide novel insights on the
different phases of growth of cumulative weight as well as on the average time
difference for a transaction to receive its first approval when using distinct
tip selection algorithms. Lastly, we analyze simulation overhead and
performance as a function of Tangle size and compare results for different tip

also possesses periodic wave solutions --which reduce to the solitary wave in
the limiting case of infinite period-- as well as rational solutions which are
obtained herein. In addition, employing a long-wave approximation via a
relevant multiscale expansion method, we establish the asymptotic reduction of
the AA system to the Korteweg-de Vries equation. Such a reduction, is not only
another justification for the above solitary wave dynamics, but also may offer
additional insights for the emergence of other possible plasma waves. Direct
numerical simulations are performed for the study of multiple solitary waves

in terms of potentially relevant criteria, while the robustness of spatially

gas in position-velocity space because we reside inside the Galaxy. Substantial
biases exist in most studies on the Milky Way's CGM that focus on
easier-to-detect high-velocity gas. With mock observations on a Milky-Way
analog from the FOGGIE simulation, we investigate four observational biases
related to the Milky Way's CGM. First, QSO absorption-line studies probe a
limited amount of the CGM mass: only 35% of the mass is at high Galactic
latitudes $|b|>20$ degrees, of which only half is moving at $|v_{\rm
LSR}|\gtrsim100$ km s$^{-1}$. Second, the inflow rate ($\dot{M}$) of the cold
gas observable in HI 21cm is reduced by a factor of $\sim10$ as we switch from
the local standard of rest to the galaxy's rest frame; meanwhile $\dot{M}$ of
the cool and warm gas does not change significantly. Third, OVI and NV are
promising ions to probe the Milky Way's outer CGM ($r\gtrsim$15 kpc), but CIV
may be less sensitive. Lastly, the scatter in ion column density is a factor of
2 higher if the CGM is observed from inside-out than from external views
because of the gas radial density profile. Our work highlights that
observations of the Milky Way's CGM, especially those using HI 21cm and QSO
absorption lines, are highly biased. We demonstrate that these biases can be
quantified and calibrated through synthetic observations with simulated
Milky-Way analogs.

creating a uniform platform for the comparison of machine learning and
multimedia processing methods of automatic chronic pain assessment from human

The objective of the challenge is to promote research in the development of
assistive technologies that help improve the quality of life for people with
chronic pain via real-time monitoring and feedback to help manage their
condition and remain physically active. The challenge also aims to encourage
the use of the relatively underutilised, albeit vital bodily expression signals
for automatic pain and pain-related emotion recognition. This paper presents a
description of the challenge, competition guidelines, bench-marking dataset,
and the baseline systems' architecture and performance on the three sub-tasks:
pain estimation from facial expressions, pain recognition from multimodal
movement, and protective movement behaviour detection.

range of solid-state quantum systems, from quantum sensors to repeater nodes in
memory-enhanced quantum communication. Inversion-symmetric group IV vacancy
centers, comprised of Si, Ge, Sn and Pb dopants, hold particular promise as
their neutrally charged electronic configuration results in a ground-state spin
triplet, enabling long spin coherence above cryogenic temperatures. However,
despite the tremendous interest in these defects, a theoretical understanding
of the electronic and spin structure of these centers remains elusive. In this
context, we predict the ground- and excited-state properties of the neutral
group IV color centers from first principles. We capture the product
Jahn-Teller effect found in the excited state manifold to second order in
electron-phonon coupling, and present a non-perturbative treatment of the
effect of spin-orbit coupling. Importantly, we find that spin-orbit splitting
is strongly quenched due to the dominant Jahn-Teller effect, with the lowest
optically-active $^3E_u$ state weakly split into $m_s$-resolved states. The
predicted complex vibronic spectra of the neutral group IV color centers are
essential for their experimental identification and have key implications for
use of these systems in quantum information science.

products reflecting environmental and/or socioeconomic factors as covariates,
or `features', within a geostatistical framework to improve predictions of
disease risk. Feature selection is an important step in building these models,
helping to reduce overfitting and computational complexity, and to improve
model interpretability. Selecting only features that have a causal relationship
with the response variable could potentially improve predictions and
generalisability, but identifying these causal features from
non-interventional, spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem. Here we
examine the performance of a causal feature selection procedure with regard to
estimating malaria incidence in Madagascar. The studied procedure designed for
this task combines the PC algorithm with spatiotemporal prewhitening and
kernel-based independence tests extended to accommodate aggregated data. This
case study reveals a clear advantage for causal feature selection in terms of
the out-of-sample predictive accuracy in a forward temporal estimation task,
but not in a spatiotemporal interpolation task, in comparison with thresholded
spike-and-slab, for both linear and non-linear regression models. Compared to
no feature selection, causal feature selection was most beneficial in settings
wherein the volume of available data was low relative to the model complexity.

towards a more rational, relative and multidimensional perspective in the

heuristics, where the number of nodes per route is balanced. The first
heuristic uses a nearest node approach and the second assigns the closest
vehicle (salesman). A comparison of heuristics with test-instances being in the
Euclidean plane showed similar solution quality and runtime. On average, the
nearest node solutions are approximately one percent better. The closest
vehicle heuristic is especially important when the nodes (customers) are not
known in advance, e.g. for online routing. Whilst the nearest node is
preferable when one vehicle has to be used multiple times to service all
customers. The second contribution is a closed form formula that describes the
mTSP distance dependent on the number of vehicles and customers. Increasing the
number of salesman results in an approximately linear distance growth for
uniformly distributed nodes in a Euclidean grid plane. The distance growth is
almost proportional to the square root of number of customers (nodes). These
two insights are combined in a single formula. The minimum distance of a node
to $n$ uniformly distributed random (real and integer) points was derived and
expressed as functional relationship dependent on the number of vehicles. This
gives theoretical underpinnings and is in agreement with the distances found
via the previous mTSP heuristics. Hence, this allows to compute all expected
mTSP distances without the need of running the heuristics.

quantum dots were uncovered by the T-matrix based master equation (TME). The
TME is so far the primary approach to studying Coulomb drag in the
weak-coupling regime; however, its accuracy and reliability remain unexplored.
Here, we evaluate the performance of the TME for Coulomb drag via a comparison
with numerically exact results obtained by the hierarchical equation-of-motion
approach. We find that the TME can capture qualitative current evolutions
versus dot levels, temperature, and effective coupling strengths, but only
partially succeeds at the quantitative level. Specifically, the TME gives
highly inaccurate drag currents when large charge fluctuations on dots exist
and the fourth-order tunneling processes make a leading-order contribution.
This failure of the TME is attributed to the combined effect of the unique drag
mechanisms and its overlook of the fourth-order single-electron tunnelings. We
identify the reliable regions to facilitate further quantitative studies on
Coulomb drag by the TME.

statistical mechanics that has found numerous applications. We consider the
case of TASEP with a finite chain where particles may enter from the left and
leave to the right at prescribed rates.
  This model can be formulated as a Markov process with a finite number of
states. Due to the irreducibility of the process it is well-known that the
probability distribution on the states is globally attracted to a unique
equilibrium distribution.
  We extend this result to the more detailed level of individual trajectories.
To do so we formulate TASEP as a random dynamical system. Our main result is
that the trajectories from all possible initial conditions contract to each
other yielding the existence of a random attractor that consists of a single
trajectory almost surely. This implies that in the long run TASEP ``filters
out'' any perturbation that changes the state of the particles along the chain.
  In order to prove our main result we first establish that any random
dynamical system on a finite state space possesses both a global random
pullback attractor and a global random forward attractor. This observation
appears to be missing in the literature. We then provide sufficient and
necessary conditions for these attractors to be singletons. Finally, we show
that TASEP satisfies one of these conditions.

compute a minimum-cardinality completion of the neighbourhood of the new vertex

sections are well reproduced with spectroscopic amplitudes from two different
shell model interactions for the Si isotopes: \textit{psdmod} for the
two-neutron transfer, and \textit{psdmwkpn} for the one-neutron transfer.
  Purpose: The origin of this ambiguity can be related to a more complex
mechanism in the one-neutron transfer that requires the unpairing of neutrons
prior to its transfer in the ($^{18}$O,$^{17}$O) reaction. Studying a nucleus
where this characteristic is absent ($^{13}$C) should help to elucidate this
question.
  Method: One-neutron transfer cross sections were measured for the $^{13}$C +
$^{28}$Si at E$_{lab}$ = 30, and 34 MeV, and compared with coupled reaction
channel calculations using spectroscopic amplitudes derived from the
\textit{psdmod} and \textit{psdmwkpn} shell model interactions.
  Results: The spectroscopic amplitudes from the \textit{psdmod} interaction
for the relevant states in $^{29}$Si provide a good description of the

possible influence between any input subsystem and any output subsystem. We
study whether such causal structure can be understood in terms of compositional
structure of the unitary. Given a quantum circuit with no path from input
system $A$ to output system $B$, system $A$ cannot influence system $B$.
Conversely, given a unitary $U$ with a no-influence relation from input $A$ to
output $B$, it follows from [B. Schumacher and M. D. Westmoreland, Quantum
Information Processing 4 no. 1, (Feb, 2005)] that there exists a circuit
decomposition of $U$ with no path from $A$ to $B$. However, as we argue, there
are unitaries for which there does not exist a circuit decomposition that makes
all causal constraints evident simultaneously. To address this, we introduce a
new formalism of `extended circuit diagrams', which goes beyond what is
expressible with quantum circuits, with the core new feature being the ability
to represent direct sum structures in addition to sequential and tensor product
composition. A causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, representing a
unitary $U$, is then one for which there is a path from an input $A$ to an
output $B$ if and only if there actually is influence from $A$ to $B$ in $U$.
We derive causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for a large class
of unitaries, where in each case, the decomposition is implied by the unitary's
respective causal structure. We hypothesize that every finite-dimensional
unitary transformation has a causally faithful extended circuit decomposition.

are often incompletely or noisily labeled, e.g., DeepLesion leaves over 50% of
its lesions unlabeled. Thus, effective methods to harvest missing annotations
are critical for continued progress in medical image analysis. This is the goal
of our work, where we develop a powerful system to harvest missing lesions from
the DeepLesion dataset at high precision. Accepting the need for some degree of
expert labor to achieve high fidelity, we exploit a small fully-labeled subset
of medical image volumes and use it to intelligently mine annotations from the
remainder. To do this, we chain together a highly sensitive lesion proposal
generator and a very selective lesion proposal classifier. While our framework
is generic, we optimize our performance by proposing a 3D contextual lesion
proposal generator and by using a multi-view multi-scale lesion proposal
classifier. These produce harvested and hard-negative proposals, which we then
re-use to finetune our proposal generator by using a novel hard negative
suppression loss, continuing this process until no extra lesions are found.
Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that our method can harvest an
additional 9,805 lesions while keeping precision above 90%. To demonstrate the
benefits of our approach, we show that lesion detectors trained on our
harvested lesions can significantly outperform the same variants only trained
on the original annotations, with boost of average precision of 7% to 10%. We

oscillatory agents. Many functional features of the brain are related to
synchronization of neurons. The type of synchronization transition that may
occur (explosive vs. continuous) has been the focus of intense attention in
recent years, mostly in the context of phase oscillator models for which
collective behavior is independent of the mean-value of natural frequency.
However, synchronization properties of biologically-motivated neural models
depend on the firing frequencies. In this study we report a systematic study of
gamma-band synchronization in spiking Hodgkin-Huxley neurons which interact via
electrical or chemical synapses. We use various network models in order to
define the connectivity matrix. We find that the underlying mechanisms and
types of synchronization transitions in gamma-band differs from beta-band. In
gamma-band, network regularity suppresses transition while randomness promotes
a continuous transition. Heterogeneity in the underlying topology does not lead
to any change in the order of transition, however, correlation between number
of synapses and frequency of a neuron will lead to explosive synchronization in
heterogenous networks with electrical synapses. Furthermore, small-world
networks modeling a fine balance between clustering and randomness (as in the
cortex), lead to explosive synchronization with electrical synapses, but a
smooth transition in the case of chemical synapses. We also find that
hierarchical modular networks, such as the connectome, lead to frustrated
transitions. We explain our results based on various properties of the network,
paying particular attention to the competition between clustering and
long-range synapses.

the same setting but study an objective that is more meaningful in an online
setting: the sum of flow times. The flow time of a job is the total amount of
time that it spends in the system, which may be considerably smaller than its
completion time if it is released late. We provide competitive algorithms for
the online setting with speed augmentation, and also give a lower bound proving
that speed augmentation is in fact necessary. As a side effect of our

completion times by giving an $O(1)$-competitive algorithm for arbitrary sizes

allow for the weighted sum of completion times (or flow times).

prevalent at higher halo mass, driving down $f_{esc}$ (we provide analytical

satisfiability and/or $\#$SAT algorithms which beat exhaustive search by a

  In this paper, we present a new strong lower bound consequence of non-trivial
$\#$SAT algorithm for a circuit class ${\mathcal C}$. Say a symmetric Boolean
function $f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)$ is sparse if it outputs $1$ on $O(1)$ values of
$\sum_i x_i$. We show that for every sparse $f$, and for all ""typical"" ${\cal

bounds against the circuit class $f \circ {\cal C}$, which may be stronger than
${\cal C}$ itself. In particular:
  $\#$SAT algorithms for $n^k$-size ${\cal C}$-circuits running in $2^n/n^k$

massive galaxy clusters, but little attention has been given to individual
galaxy groups. We investigate the scaling relations of galaxy groups and
clusters near the North Ecliptic Pole using X-ray and SZ observations. This
region of the sky is where both the ROSAT and Planck satellites achieved their
deepest observations, permitting the investigation of lower mass systems. Our
sample consists of 62 X-ray detected groups and clusters, spanning a mass range
of $10^{13.4}M_{\odot}<~M_{500}<10^{15}M_{\odot}$ and redshifts of
$0.03\lesssim z \lesssim 0.82$. We extract the total SZ flux from unresolved
Planck data and estimate the fraction of the SZ flux within $R_{500}$ assuming
two different pressure profiles. The SZ scaling relations were derived using a
Bayesian technique that accounts for censored data. We find a power law slope
of $1.73^{+0.19}_{-0.18}$ for the $Y_{SZ}-M_{500}$ relation which is consistent
with the self-similar prediction of 5/3. The slope of $0.89^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$
for the $Y_{SZ}-L_{X,500}$ relation is in agreement with other observational
studies but not the self-similar prediction of 5/4, and the $Y_{SZ}-Y_{X}$
relation lies below the 1:1 relation when the slope is fixed to unity. The
determined scaling relations are dependent on the selected pressure profile, so
resolved data are needed to determine the effects of AGN feedback. In addition,
we find a number of potential cluster candidates in the Planck Compton maps

wide adoption of these tools introduces new challenges related to dependency
management. In this paper, we propose an original study of one such challenge:
the emergence of bloated dependencies.
  Bloated dependencies are libraries that the build tool packages with the
application's compiled code but that are actually not necessary to build and
run the application. This phenomenon artificially grows the size of the built
binary and increases maintenance effort. We propose a tool, called DepClean, to
analyze the presence of bloated dependencies in Maven artifacts. We analyze
9,639 Java artifacts hosted on Maven Central, which include a total of 723,444
dependency relationships. Our key result is that 75.1% of the analyzed
dependency relationships are bloated. In other words, it is feasible to reduce
the number of dependencies of Maven artifacts up to 1/4 of its current count.
We also perform a qualitative study with 30 notable open-source projects. Our
results indicate that developers pay attention to their dependencies and are
willing to remove bloated dependencies: 18/21 answered pull requests were

proven effective in the management of dysphagia. Some studies have recently
considered the positive role of cohesiveness, but there is still an
insufficient understanding of the effect of the rheological properties of the
liquid bolus on the dynamics of bolus transport, particularly when elasticity
and extensional properties are combined with a shear thinning behaviour. This
study combines steady shear, SAOS and capillary breakage extensional rheometry
with an in vitro method to characterize the oral transport of elastic liquids.
Bolus velocity and bolus length were measured from in vitro experiments using
image analysis and related to the shear and extensional properties. A theory
describing the bolus dynamics shows that the elastic and extensional properties
do not influence significantly the oral transit dynamics. Conversely, in vitro
results suggest that the extensional properties can affect the transition from
the oral to the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, where thin, viscoelastic
liquids lead to a fast transit, lower oral post-swallow residues and more
compact bolus with a smoother surface, which may suggest a lower risk of
fragmentation. This mechanistic explanation suggests that the benefit of the
extensional properties of thin viscoelastic liquids in the management of
dysphagia should be further evaluated in clinical trials.

machine learning models consistently misclassify. While there are a number of
methods proposed to generate adversarial examples for text data, it is not
trivial to assess the quality of these adversarial examples, as minor
perturbations (such as changing a word in a sentence) can lead to a significant
shift in their meaning, readability and classification label. In this paper, we
propose an evaluation framework consisting of a set of automatic evaluation
metrics and human evaluation guidelines, to rigorously assess the quality of
adversarial examples based on the aforementioned properties. We experiment with
six benchmark attacking methods and found that some methods generate
adversarial examples with poor readability and content preservation. We also
learned that multiple factors could influence the attacking performance, such
as the length of the text inputs and architecture of the classifiers.

reproductive physiology, as well as gene transcription in non-reproductive
tissues, such as brain, bone, lung and vasculature, in both women and men. An
unusual property of progesterone is its high affinity for the mineralocorticoid
receptor (MR), which regulates electrolyte transport in the kidney in humans
and other terrestrial vertebrates. In humans, rats, alligators and frogs,
progesterone antagonizes activation of the MR by aldosterone, the physiological
mineralocorticoid in terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in elephant shark,
ray-finned fishes and chickens, progesterone activates the MR. Interestingly,
cartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes do not synthesize aldosterone,
raising the question of which steroid(s) activate the MR in cartilaginous
fishes and ray-finned fishes. The simpler synthesis of progesterone, compared
to cortisol and other corticosteroids, makes progesterone a candidate
physiological activator of the MR in elephant sharks and ray-finned fishes.
Elephant shark and ray-finned fish MRs are expressed in diverse tissues,
including heart, brain and lung, as well as, ovary and testis, two reproductive
tissues that are targets for progesterone, which together suggests a
multi-faceted physiological role for progesterone activation of the MR in
elephant shark and ray-finned fish. The functional consequences of progesterone
as an antagonist of some terrestrial vertebrate MRs and as an agonist of fish
and chicken MRs are not fully understood. Indeed, little is known of
physiological activities of progesterone via any vertebrate MR.

Goins, Harris, Kubik and Mbirika, generalized the notion of lattice point
visibility by saying that for a fixed $b\in\mathbb{N}$, a lattice point
$(r,s)\in\mathbb{N}^2$ is $b$-visible from the origin if no other lattice point
lies on the graph of a function $f(x)=mx^b$, for some $m\in\mathbb{Q}$, between
the origin and $(r,s)$. In their analysis they establish that for a fixed
$b\in\mathbb{N}$, the proportion of $b$-visible lattice points is
$\frac{1}{\zeta(b+1)}$, which generalizes the result in the classical lattice
point visibility setting. In this short note we give an $n$-dimensional notion
of $\bf{b}$-visibility that recovers the one presented by Goins et. al. in
$2$-dimensions, and the classical notion in $n$-dimensions. We prove that for a
fixed ${\bf{b}}=(b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n)\in\mathbb{N}^n$ the proportion of
${\bf{b}}$-visible lattice points is given by
$\frac{1}{\zeta(\sum_{i=1}^nb_i)}$.
  Moreover, we propose a $\bf{b}$-visibility notion for vectors $\bf{b}\in

vectors one obtains that the density of
${\bf{b}}=(\frac{b_1}{a_1},\frac{b_2}{a_2},\ldots,\frac{b_n}{a_n})\in\mathbb{Q}_{>0}^n$-visible

visibility for vectors $\bf{b}\in (\mathbb{Q}^{*})^n$, compatible with the
previous notion, that recovers the results of Harris and Omar for $b\in
\mathbb{Q}^{*}$ in $2$-dimensions; and show that the proportion of

  Communications",,,,"cs.LG cs.IT cs.NI math.IT stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, the convergence time of federated learning (FL), when deployed
over a realistic wireless network, is studied. In particular, a wireless
network is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models
(trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS,
acting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received
local FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number
of resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be
selected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning
step. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS
prefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL
model. Hence, the FL performance and convergence time will be significantly
affected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an
appropriate user selection scheme that enables users of higher importance to be
selected more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation,
and user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal
is to minimize the FL convergence time while optimizing the FL performance. To
solve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that
the BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects
on its global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection
policy, the uplink RB allocation can be determined. To further reduce the FL
convergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to estimate the
local FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model
transmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to enhance its
global FL model and improve the FL convergence speed and performance.

medical images is desired. Therefore, an all-purpose anomaly detection method
that can detect virtually all types of lesions/diseases in a given image is
strongly desired. However, few commercially available and versatile anomaly
detection methods for medical images have been provided so far. Recently,
anomaly detection methods built upon deep learning methods have been rapidly
growing in popularity, and these methods seem to provide reasonable solutions
to the problem. However, the workload to label the images necessary for
training in deep learning remains heavy. In this study, we present an anomaly
detection method based on two trained flow-based generative models. With this
method, the posterior probability can be computed as a normality metric for any
given image. The training of the generative models requires two sets of images:
a set containing only normal images and another set containing both normal and
abnormal images without any labels. In the latter set, each sample does not
have to be labeled as normal or abnormal; therefore, any mixture of images
(e.g., all cases in a hospital) can be used as the dataset without cumbersome
manual labeling. The method was validated with two types of medical images:
chest X-ray radiographs (CXRs) and brain computed tomographies (BCTs). The
areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for logarithm
posterior probabilities of CXRs (0.868 for pneumonia-like opacities) and BCTs
(0.904 for infarction) were comparable to those in previous studies with other
anomaly detection methods. This result showed the versatility of our method.

further increase the degree of disentanglement, thereby improving the quality

an explicit constraint to the latent representation, realized by a speaker
classifier, to explicitly eliminate the speaker information that resides in the
latent code. Experimental results confirm that the degree of disentanglement of
the learned latent representation can be enhanced by both GANs and the speaker
classifier. Meanwhile, subjective evaluation results in terms of quality and
similarity scores demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

large data sets with many latent factors. The proposed approach applies a deep
artificial neural network model called an importance-weighted autoencoder

importance sampling technique wherein increasing the number of
importance-weighted (IW) samples drawn during fitting improves the
approximation, typically at the cost of decreased computational efficiency. We
provide a real data application that recovers results aligning with
psychological theory across random starts. Via simulation studies, we show that

exhibit some bias) and obtains similar results to MH-RM in less time. Our
simulations also suggest that the proposed approach performs similarly to and
is potentially faster than constrained joint maximum likelihood estimation, a
fast procedure that is consistent when the sample size and the number of items
simultaneously tend to infinity.

discrete-time linear time-invariant multi-agent network, which is subject to,
concurrently, input delays, random packet-drops, and reference noise. The
problem amounts to an integrated design of delay and packet-drop tolerant
algorithm and determining the ultimate upper bound of the tracking error
between agents' states and the average of the reference signals. The
investigation is driven by the goal of devising a practically more attainable
average tracking algorithm, thereby extending the existing work in the
literature which largely ignored the aforementioned uncertainties. For this
purpose, a blend of techniques from Kalman filtering, multi-stage consensus
filtering, and predictive control is employed, which gives rise to a simple yet
comepelling distributed average tracking algorithm that is robust to
initialization error and allows the trade-off between communication/computation
cost and stationary-state tracking error. Due to the inherent coupling among
different control components, convergence analysis is significantly
challenging. Nevertheless, it is revealed that the allowable values of the
algorithm parameters rely upon the maximal degree of an expected network, while
the convergence speed depends upon the second smallest eigenvalue of the same
network's topology. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is verified by
a numerical example.

significant and sudden drops -up to 60%- when the plate is pulled out at low

alternative physical mechanism that can explain these force fluctuations.

nanofibre-based optical cavities, focussed ion beam (FIB) milling is becoming
popular; it can be used for the fabrication of complex structures directly in
the nanofibre. This technique uses a highly accelerated ion beam to remove
atoms from the target material with high resolution. However, it is challenging
to mill insulating materials with highly-curved structures and large aspect

with an $\varepsilon$ accuracy requires the number of samples $n$ in the order
of $\varepsilon^{-(2s+D)/s}$. In this paper, we analyze the Generalized Contour
Regression (GCR) algorithm for the estimation of the central subspace and use
piecewise polynomials for function approximation. GCR is among the best
estimators for the central subspace, but its sample complexity is an open
question. We prove that GCR leads to a mean squared estimation error of
$O(n^{-1})$ for the central subspace, if a variance quantity is exactly known.
The estimation error of this variance quantity is also given in this paper. The
mean squared regression error of $f$ is proved to be in the order of
$\left(n/\log n\right)^{-\frac{2s}{2s+d}}$ where the exponent depends on the

in the short term, we believe that it is destined to fail as the quality of
fake media generation continues to improve. Soon, neither humans nor algorithms
will be able to reliably distinguish fake versus real content. Thus, pipelines
for assuring the source and integrity of media will be required---and
increasingly relied upon. We propose AMP, a system that ensures the
authentication of media via certifying provenance. AMP creates one or more
publisher-signed manifests for a media instance uploaded by a content provider.
These manifests are stored in a database allowing fast lookup from applications
such as browsers. For reference, the manifests are also registered and signed
by a permissioned ledger, implemented using the Confidential Consortium

the integrity and transparency of all registered manifests. AMP, through its
use of CCF, enables a consortium of media providers to govern the service while
making all its operations auditable. The authenticity of the media can be
communicated to the user via visual elements in the browser, indicating that an

with target shift. Target shift is a problem of mismatch in label distribution
between source and target domains. Typically it appears as class-imbalance in
target domain. In practice, this is an important problem in UDA; as we do not
know labels in target domain datasets, we do not know whether or not its
distribution is identical to that in the source domain dataset. Many
traditional approaches achieve UDA with distribution matching by minimizing
mean maximum discrepancy or adversarial training; however these approaches
implicitly assume a coincidence in the distributions and do not work under
situations with target shift. Some recent UDA approaches focus on class
boundary and some of them are robust to target shift, but they are only
applicable to classification and not to regression.
  To overcome the target shift problem in UDA, the proposed method, partially
shared variational autoencoders (PS-VAEs), uses pair-wise feature alignment
instead of feature distribution matching. PS-VAEs inter-convert domain of each
sample by a CycleGAN-based architecture while preserving its label-related
content. To evaluate the performance of PS-VAEs, we carried out two
experiments: UDA with class-unbalanced digits datasets (classification), and
UDA from synthesized data to real observation in human-pose-estimation
(regression). The proposed method presented its robustness against the
class-imbalance in the classification task, and outperformed the other methods
in the regression task with a large margin.

heterogeneous cloud services (compute, storage, network, applications, etc.)

heterogeneity complicates the implementation of an interoperable cloud system.
Several standards have been proposed to address this challenge and provide a
unified interface to cloud resources. The Open Cloud Computing Interface (OCCI)
thereby focuses on the standardization of a common API for
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) providers while the Topology and
Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) focuses on the
standardization of a template language to enable the proper definition of the
topology of cloud applications and their orchestrations on top of a cloud
system. TOSCA thereby does not define how the application topologies are
created on the cloud. Therefore, we analyse the conceptual similarities between
the two approaches and we study how we can integrate them to obtain a complete
standard-based approach to manage both cloud infrastructure and cloud
application layers. We propose an automated extensive mapping between the
concepts of the two standards and we provide TOSCA Studio, a model-driven tool
chain for TOSCA that conforms to OCCI. TOSCA Studio allows to graphically
design cloud applications as well as to deploy and manage them at runtime using
a fully model-driven cloud orchestrator based on the two standards. Our
contribution is validated by successfully designing and deploying three cloud
applications: WordPress, Node Cellar and Multi-Tier.

tools for extracting and explaining features across a set of biological
structures. However, a principled and robust way to combine shape and pose
features has been illusive due to three main issues: 1) Non-homogeneity of the
data (data with linear and non-linear natural variation across features), 2)
non-optimal representation of the $3D$ motion (rigid transformation
representations that are not proportional to the kinetic energy that move an
object from one position to the other), and 3) artificial discretization of the
models. In this paper, we propose a new framework for dynamic multi-object
statistical modelling framework for the analysis of human joints in a
continuous domain. Specifically, we propose to normalise shape and dynamic
spatial features in the same linearized statistical space permitting the use of
linear statistics; we adopt an optimal 3D motion representation for more
accurate rigid transformation comparisons; and we provide a 3D shape and pose
prediction protocol using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling-based fitting.
The framework affords an efficient generative dynamic multi-object modelling
platform for biological joints. We validate the framework using a controlled
synthetic data. Finally, the framework is applied to an analysis of the human
shoulder joint to compare its performance with standard SSM approaches in
prediction of shape while adding the advantage of determining relative pose
between bones in a complex. Excellent validity is observed and the shoulder
joint shape-pose prediction results suggest that the novel framework may have
utility for a range of medical image analysis applications. Furthermore, the
framework is generic and can be extended to n$>$2 objects, making it suitable
for clinical and diagnostic methods for the management of joint disorders.

assisted by a re-configurable intelligent surface (RIS). The scheme that two
users communicate simultaneously over Rayleigh fading channels is considered.
The channels between the two users and RIS can either be reciprocal or
non-reciprocal. For reciprocal channels, we determine the optimal phases at the
RIS to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). We then
derive exact closed-form expressions for the outage probability and spectral
efficiency for single-element RIS. By capitalizing the insights obtained from
the single-element analysis, we introduce a gamma approximation to model the
product of Rayleigh random variables which is useful for the evaluation of the
performance metrics in multiple-element RIS. Asymptotic analysis shows that the
outage decreases at $\left(\log(\rho)/\rho\right)^L$ rate where $L$ is the
number of elements, whereas the spectral efficiency increases at $\log(\rho)$
rate at large average SINR $\rho$. For non-reciprocal channels, the minimum
user SINR is targeted to be maximized. For single-element RIS, closed-form
solution is derived whereas for multiple-element RIS the problem turns out to
be non-convex. The latter one is solved through semidefinite programming
relaxation and a proposed greedy-iterative method, which can achieve higher
performance and lower computational complexity, respectively.

exchange of hidden spin fluctuations by conduction electrons with two orbitals
can result in high-temperature superconductivity in copper-oxide materials. We
introduce a similar model for high-temperature iron-selenide superconductors
that are electron doped. Conduction electrons carry the minimal 3d xz and 3d yz
iron-atom orbitals. Low-energy hidden spin fluctuations at the checkerboard
wavevector Q_AF result from nested Fermi surfaces at the center and at the
corner of the unfolded (one-iron) Brillouin zone. Magnetic frustration from
super-exchange interactions via the selenium atoms stabilize hidden spin
fluctuations at Q_AF versus true spin fluctuations. At half filling, Eliashberg
theory based purely on the exchange of hidden spin fluctuations reveals a
Lifshitz transition to electron/hole Fermi surface pockets at the corner of the
folded (two-iron) Brillouin zone, but with vanishing spectral weights. The
underlying hidden spin-density wave groundstate is therefore a Mott insulator.
Upon electron doping, Eliashberg theory finds that the spectral weights of the
hole Fermi surface pockets remain vanishingly small, while the spectral weights
of the larger electron Fermi surface pockets become appreciable. This
prediction is therefore consistent with the observation of electron Fermi
surface pockets alone in electron-doped iron selenide by angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Eliashberg theory also finds an instability
to S+- superconductivity at electron doping, with isotropic Cooper pairs that
alternate in sign between the visible electron Fermi surface pockets and the
faint hole Fermi surface pockets. Comparison with the isotropic energy gaps
observed in electron-doped iron selenide by ARPES and by scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) is consistent with short-range hidden magnetic order.

the presence of a three-dimensional band and characterized by the $^{87}$Rb
temperature independent Knight shift and the absence of Hebel-Slichter

in high magnetic fields reflects either the importance of the vortex core
relaxation or the uniqueness of the superconducting state stemming from the

enlarging the region of parameters leads to a more complex state space that we

vehicle-cell association in millimeter wave (mmWave) communication networks.
The aim is to maximize the time average rate per vehicular user (VUE) while
ensuring a target minimum rate for all VUEs with low signaling overhead. We
first formulate the user (vehicle) association problem as a discrete non-convex
optimization problem. Then, by leveraging tools from machine learning,
specifically distributed deep reinforcement learning (DDRL) and the
asynchronous actor critic algorithm (A3C), we propose a low complexity
algorithm that approximates the solution of the proposed optimization problem.
The proposed DDRL-based algorithm endows every road side unit (RSU) with a
local RL agent that selects a local action based on the observed input state.
Actions of different RSUs are forwarded to a central entity, that computes a
global reward which is then fed back to RSUs. It is shown that each
independently trained RL performs the vehicle-RSU association action with low
control overhead and less computational complexity compared to running an
online complex algorithm to solve the non-convex optimization problem. Finally,
simulation results show that the proposed solution achieves up to 15\% gains in
terms of sum rate and 20\% reduction in VUE outages compared to several
baseline designs.

Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) scenario. The DBI action is included in the class of
$k$-essence models, and it has an important role in describing the effective
degrees of freedom of D-branes in the string theory. In the DBI setup, we take
the anti-de Sitter (AdS) warp factor $f(\phi)=f_0\, \phi^{-4}$, and investigate
the self-interacting quartic potential $V(\phi)=\lambda\phi^{4}/4$. We
calculate the full expression of the effective sound speed for our model, and
show that it can evolve with time during the cosmological evolution. Besides,
the adiabatic sound speed evolves with time here, and this influences the
background dynamics to some extent. We show that the effective sound speed is
very close to the adiabatic sound speed. We examine the effect of the variable
sound speed on growth of the perturbations in both the linear and non-linear
regimes. In the linear regime, we apply the Pseudo-Newtonian formalism, and
show that dark energy suppresses the growth of perturbations at low redshifts.
From study the Integrated Sachs-Wolf (ISW) effect in our setup, we see that the
model manifests some deviation from the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. In the
non-linear regime, we follow the approach of spherical collapse model, and
calculate the linear overdensity, the virial overdensity, overdensity at the
turn around and the rate of expansion of collapsed region. We further compute
relative number density of halo objects above a given mass in our setting, and
show that the number of structures with respect to the $\Lambda$CDM model is
reduced more in the high mass tail at high redshifts.

of $\approx 10^{7.9\pm0.1}M_{\rm \odot}$ , suggesting that it could be (the
remnant of) a dwarf galaxy that is in the process of merging with NGC 5252.
Based on a correlation between the mass of the central black hole (BH) and host
galaxy, the ULX is powered by a $10^5M_{\rm \odot}$ black hole. Alternatively,
if the BH mass is $\approx 10^6M_{\rm \odot}$ or larger, the host galaxy of the
ULX must have been heavily stripped during the merger. The ULX $K_s$-band
luminosity is two orders of magnitude smaller than that expected from an
ordinary active galactic nucleus with the observed [O III] luminosity, which
also suggests the ULX lacks a dusty torus. We discuss how these findings
provide suggestive evidence that the ULX is hosting an intermediate-mass black
hole.

reproduction of data, but to compute some answers based on the data resulting
from queries. The similarity identification task is to identify the items in a
database that are similar to a given query item for a given metric. The problem
of compression for similarity identification has been studied in
arXiv:1307.6609 [cs.IT]. Unlike classical compression problems, the focus is
not on reconstructing the original data. Instead, the compression rate is
determined by the desired reliability of the answers. Specifically, the
information measure identification rate characterizes the minimum rate that can
be achieved among all schemes which guarantee reliable answers with respect to
a given similarity threshold. In this paper, we propose a component-based model
for computing correlated similarity queries. The correlated signals are first
decorrelated by the KLT transform. Then, the decorrelated signal is processed
by a distinct D-admissible system for each component. We show that the
component-based model equipped with KLT can perfectly represent the
multivariate Gaussian similarity queries when optimal rate-similarity
allocation applies. Hence, we can derive the identification rate of the
multivariate Gaussian signals based on the component-based model. We then
extend the result to general Gaussian sources with memory. We also study the
models equipped with practical compone\nt systems. We use TC-$\triangle$
schemes that use type covering signatures and triangle-inequality decision
rules as our component systems. We propose an iterative method to numerically
approximate the minimum achievable rate of the TC-$\triangle$ scheme. We show
that our component-based model equipped with TC-$\triangle$ schemes can achieve
better performance than the TC-$\triangle$ scheme unaided on handling the
multivariate Gaussian sources.

can train on man-made routes using artificial holds. Both strength and good
technique is required to successfully reach the top of a climb, and often
coaches work to improve technique so less strength is required, enabling a
climber to ascent more difficult climbs.
  Various aspects of adding computer-interaction to climbing have been studied
in recent years, but there is a large space for research into lightweight tools
to aid recreational intermediate climbers, both with trickier climbs and to
improve their own technique.
  In this CS Masters final project, I explored which form of data-capture and
output-features could improve a climber's training, and analysed how climbers
responded to viewing their data throughout a climbing session, then conducted a
user-centred design to build a lightweight mobile application for intermediate
climbers. A variety of hardware and software solutions were explored, tested
and developed through series of surveys, discussions, wizard-of-oz studies and
prototyping, resulting in a system that most closely meets the needs of local
indoor boulderers given the project's time scope.
  This consists of an iteratively developed interactive mobile app that: can
record, graph, and score the acceleration of a climber, as both a training tool
and gamification incentive for good technique; can link a video recording to
the acceleration graph, to enable frame-by-frame inspection of weaknesses; is
fully approved and distributed on the Google play Store and currently being
regularly used by 15 local climbers. Then I conducted a final usability study,
comprising a thematic analysis of forty minutes's worth of interview
transcripts, to gain a deep understanding of the app's impact on the climbers
using it, along with its benefits and limitations.

question how collective dynamics in active matter is influenced by inertia. In

the relaxation time scale towards the steady state considerably increases with

sufficiently close to it. Then, we use these results and prove that the
adaptive group lasso has oracle properties if weights are obtained from our

delivers the expected results. An economic application to the long-run US money

discuss the consequences of the assumption of a local equilibrium by comparing
the consequences for the nuclear modification factor and the elliptic flows of
charm quarks. For this purpose we employ the parton-hadron-string dynamics
(PHSD), which is an off-shell microscopic transport approach, as well as the
linearized-Boltzmann (LB) scheme obtained by coarse graining the PHSD bulk and
assuming local equilibrium for the interactions of the charm quarks with the
bulk. The $R_{\rm AA}$ of charm quarks stemming from the later LB approach is
also compared to a genuine fluid dynamics evolution initiated by the coarse
grained PHSD, which allows to further assess the consequences of reducing the
full n-body dynamics. We then proceed to a systematic comparison of PHSD with
MC@HQ, another transport model for heavy flavors which also relies on LB
approach. In particular, we investigate the consequences for the nuclear
modification factor of charm quarks if we vary separately the initial heavy
quark distribution function in matter, the expansion dynamics of the QGP and
the elementary interactions of heavy quarks of these models. We find that the
results for both models vary significantly depending on the details of the
calculation. However, both models achieve very similar predictions for key
heavy quark observables for certain combinations of initial condition, bulk
evolution and interactions. We conclude that this ambiguity limits our ability
to determine the different properties of the system based on the current set of

nonlinear general relativistic (GR) $N$-body cosmological simulations recently
introduced in Ref. [1]. GRAMSES adopts a constant mean curvature slicing with a
minimal distortion gauge, where the linear growth rate is scale-dependent, and
the standard method for realising initial particle data is not
straightforwardly applicable. A new method is introduced, in which the initial
positions of particles are generated from the displacement field realised for a
matter power spectrum as usual, but the velocity is calculated by
finite-differencing the displacement fields around the initial redshift. In
this way, all the information required for setting up the initial conditions is
drawn from three consecutive input matter power spectra, and additional
assumptions such as scale-independence of the linear growth factor and growth
rate are not needed. We implement this method in a modified 2LPTic code, and
demonstrate that in a Newtonian setting it can reproduce the velocity field
given by the default 2LPTic code with subpercent accuracy. We also show that
the matter and velocity power spectra of the initial particle data generated
for GRAMSES simulations using this method agree very well with the
linear-theory predictions in the particular gauge used by GRAMSES. Finally, we
discuss corrections to the finite difference calculation of the velocity when
radiation is present, as well as additional corrections implemented in GRAMSES
to ensure consistency. This method can be applied in ICs generation for GR
simulations in generic gauges, and simulations of cosmological models with
scale-dependent linear growth rate.

This is important for improving the performance of a code and avoiding the
presence of low-weight codewords and absorbing sets. The parameters of the
convolutional code are shown to be determined by the parameters of the
underlying difference triangle set. In particular, the free distance of the
code is related to $w$ and the degree of the code is linked to the ""scope"" of
the difference triangle set. Hence, the problem of finding families of

developer to decompose and train such reactive behaviours; namely, approach,
grasp, and retract. Then the robot autonomously learns how to combine them via
an Actor-Critic architecture. The Actor-Critic policy is to determine the
activation and inhibition mechanisms of the reactive behaviours in a particular
temporal sequence. We validate our approach in a simulated robot environment
where the task is picking a block and taking it to a target position while
orienting the gripper from a top grasp. The latter represents an extra
degree-of-freedom of which current end-to-end reinforcement learning fail to
generalise. Our findings suggest that robotic learning can be more effective if
each behaviour is learnt in isolation and then combined them to accomplish the
task. That is, our approach learns the pick and place task in 8,000 episodes,

required by an end-to-end approach and the existing state-of-the-art

exoplanets are focusing on bright stars to obtain high cadence, high

stellar variability. We tested the performance of Gaussian process (GP)
regression on the characterisation of transiting planets, and in particular to
determine how many components of variability are necessary to describe high
cadence, high signal-to-noise light curves expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. We
found that the best GP stellar variability model contains four to five
variability components: one stellar oscillation component, two to four
granulation components, and/or one rotational modulation component. This high
number of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model (1GP)
commonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore, we
compared the performance of the best multi-component GP model with the 1GP
model in the derivation of transit parameters of simulated transits. We found
that for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best multi-component GP model is
slightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP model that
gives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails to retrieve
the transit because it is a poor description of stellar activity. The non-GP
model gives some biased results and the best multi-component GP is capable of
retrieving the correct transit model parameters. We conclude that when
characterising transiting exoplanets with high signal-to-noise ratios and high
cadence light curves, we need models that couple the description of stellar
variability with the transits analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for Earth-like
exoplanets a better description of stellar variability improves the planetary
characterisation.

the entropy to the setting of general conditional expectations onto arbitrary
finite-dimensional von Neumann algebras. The latter inequality, which we call
approximate tensorization of the relative entropy, can be expressed as a lower
bound for the sum of relative entropies between a given density and its
respective projections onto two intersecting von Neumann algebras in terms of
the relative entropy between the same density and its projection onto an
algebra in the intersection, up to multiplicative and additive constants. In
particular, our inequality reduces to the so-called quasi-factorization of the
entropy for commuting algebras, which is a key step in modern proofs of the
logarithmic Sobolev inequality for classical lattice spin systems. We also
provide estimates on the constants in terms of conditions of clustering of
correlations in the setting of quantum lattice spin systems. Along the way, we
show the equivalence between conditional expectations arising from Petz
recovery maps and those of general Davies semigroups.

suppressed, flux phase order occurs locally leading to a time-reversal symmetry
broken surface state. Since the spontaneous currents flowing in the flux phase

quite small. They exist in a narrow region inside the superconductor, and
essentially vanish outside irrespective of the temperature. This result,

high contrast and no scale separation are introduced. Among them is the
nonlocal multicontinua (NLMC) method, which introduces multiple macroscopic
variables in each computational grid. These approaches explore the entire
coarse block resolution and one can obtain optimal convergence results
independent of contrast and scales. However, these approaches are not amenable
to many multiscale simulations, where the subgrid effects are much smaller than
the coarse-mesh resolution. For example, the molecular dynamics of shale gas
occurs in much smaller length scales compared to the coarse-mesh size, which is
of orders of meters. In this case, one can not explore the entire coarse-grid
resolution in evaluating effective properties. In this paper, we merge the
concepts of nonlocal multicontinua methods and Representative Volume Element
(RVE) concepts to explore problems with extreme scale separation. The first
step of this approach is to use sub-grid scale (sub to RVE) to write a
large-scale macroscopic system. We call it intermediate scale macroscale
system. In the next step, we couple this intermediate macroscale system to the
simulation grid model, which are used in simulations. This is done using RVE
concepts, where we relate intermediate macroscale variables to the macroscale
variables defined on our simulation coarse grid. Our intermediate coarse model
allows formulating macroscale variables correctly and coupling them to the
simulation grid. We present the general concept of our approach and present
details of single-phase flow. Some numerical results are presented. For
nonlinear examples, we use machine learning techniques to compute macroscale
parameters.

demonstrated that different models from an isospectral family (i.e., the models
leading to identical predictions for the spectrum of hadrons with fixed quantum

This difference is found to be quite small in the scalar glueball channel but
very large in the vector meson channel which is often used for fixing

clearly favors the choice of the glueball channel for thermodynamic predictions
in AdS/QCD models, with the scalar glueball trajectory being taken from lattice

transport properties via the spin structure. Successful control of
quantum-transport properties in the materials with antiferromagnetic (AFM)

Fermion and topological/axion materials. However, a bulk crystal in which
magnetic and superconducting layers are alternately stacked has not been
realized until now, and the search for functional properties in it is an
interesting yet unexplored field in material science. Here, we discover
superconductivity providing such an ideal platform in EuSn2As2 with the van der
Waals stacking of magnetic Eu layers and superconducting Sn-As layers, and
present the first demonstration of a natural spin-valve effect on the
superconducting current. Below the superconducting transition temperature (Tc),
the electrical resistivity becomes zero in the in-plane direction. In contrast,
it, surprisingly, remains finite down to the lowest temperature in the
out-of-plane direction, mostly due to the structure of intrinsic magnetic
Josephson junctions in EuSn2As2. The magnetic order of the Eu layers (or
natural spin-valve) is observed to be extremely soft, allowing one to easy
control of the out-of-plane to in-plane resistivities ratio from 1 to infinity
by weak external magnetic fields. The concept of multi-functional materials
with stacked magnetic-superconducting layers will open a new pathway to develop
novel spintronic devices with magnetically controllable superconductivity.

cooperative decentralized decision learning in many domains such as search and
rescue, drone surveillance, package delivery and fire fighting problems. In
these domains, a key challenge is learning with a few good experiences, i.e.,
positive reinforcements are obtained only in a few situations (e.g., on
extinguishing a fire or tracking a crime or delivering a package) and in most
other situations there is zero or negative reinforcement. Learning decisions
with a few good experiences is extremely challenging in cooperative MARL
problems due to three reasons. First, compared to the single agent case,
exploration is harder as multiple agents have to be coordinated to receive a
good experience. Second, environment is not stationary as all the agents are
learning at the same time (and hence change policies). Third, scale of problem
increases significantly with every additional agent.
  Relevant existing work is extensive and has focussed on dealing with a few
good experiences in single-agent RL problems or on scalable approaches for
handling non-stationarity in MARL problems. Unfortunately, neither of these
approaches (or their extensions) are able to address the problem of sparse good
experiences effectively. Therefore, we provide a novel fictitious self
imitation approach that is able to simultaneously handle non-stationarity and
sparse good experiences in a scalable manner. Finally, we provide a thorough

designing perception pipelines for autonomous agents such as robots, drones or
automated vehicles. The main reasons, however, for deep learning not being used
for autonomous agents at large scale already are safety concerns. Deep learning
approaches typically exhibit a black-box behavior which makes it hard for them
to be evaluated with respect to safety-critical aspects. While there have been
some work on safety in deep learning, most papers typically focus on high-level
safety concerns. In this work, we seek to dive into the safety concerns of deep
learning methods and present a concise enumeration on a deeply technical level.
Additionally, we present extensive discussions on possible mitigation methods
and give an outlook regarding what mitigation methods are still missing in
order to facilitate an argumentation for the safety of a deep learning method.

significant extra runtime costs. %Furthermore, Spark and similar platforms are

  We propose Tuneful, an approach that efficiently tunes the configuration of

Analysis and Bayesian optimization to identify near-optimal configurations from
a high-dimensional search space, using a small number of executions. This setup
allows the tuning to be done online, without any previous training. Our
experimental results show that Tuneful reduces the search time for finding
close-to-optimal configurations by 62\% (at the median) when compared to
existing state-of-the-art techniques. This means that the amortization of the
tuning cost happens significantly faster, enabling practical tuning for new

through its orbit in the X-rays, where it shows an unusual long minimum close

colliding wind structure is unstable even at apastron. As the stars approach
periastron passage the secondary wind is quenched by the primary wind and the
accretion onto the secondary begins. The accretion phase lasts for $\simeq 12

investigated the emergence of the Friedrich-Wintgen (FW) type BIC and the EP in
a dielectric waveguide comprising a metal grating, focusing on their dependence
on the grating thickness. The BIC emerges at a branch near the anti-crossing
formed of the two waveguide modes, for a grating of any thickness. With the
grating-thickness change, the anti-crossing gap varies and the branch at which
the BIC appears flips. We show that, when the slit is single mode, the BIC
appears at the crossing between the two waveguide modes in the empty-lattice
(zero slit-width) limit, while the results satisfy the criteria for the branch
at which the BIC appears in the previous reports. In addition, we find that the
EP appears near the BIC in the same device only on selecting the grating
thickness. The BIC and EP in the dielectric waveguide comprising a metal
grating, particularly with such tunability, are expected to result in the
development of functional and high-performance photonic devices in addition to

challenge for optimal robot navigation with safety guarantees. Previous work on
motion planning has followed two main strategies to provide a safe bound on an
obstacle's space: a polyhedron, such as a cuboid, or a nonlinear differentiable
surface, such as an ellipsoid. The former approach relies on disjunctive
programming, which has a relatively high computational cost that grows
exponentially with the number of obstacles. The latter approach needs to be
linearized locally to find a tractable evaluation of the chance constraints,
which dramatically reduces the remaining free space and leads to
over-conservative trajectories or even unfeasibility. In this work, we present
a hybrid approach that eludes the pitfalls of both strategies while maintaining
the original safety guarantees. The key idea consists in obtaining a safe
differentiable approximation for the disjunctive chance constraints bounding
the obstacles. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is free of chance
constraint linearization and disjunctive programming, and therefore, it can be
efficiently solved to meet fast real-time requirements with multiple obstacles.
We validate our approach through mathematical proof, simulation and real
experiments with an aerial robot using nonlinear model predictive control to
avoid pedestrians.

embedded into or placed in the vicinity of the two-dimensional electron liquid
(2DEL) and subjected to a circularly polarized electromagnetic radiation
induces ``twisted'' plasmonic oscillations in the adjacent 2DEL. The
oscillations are rectified due to the hydrodynamic nonlinearities leading to
the helicity sensitive circular dc current and to a magnetic moment. This
hydrodynamic inverse Faraday effect (HIFE) can be observed at room temperature
in different materials. The HIFE is dramatically enhanced in a periodic array
of the nanospheres forming a resonant plasmonic coupler. Such a coupler exposed
to a circularly polarized wave converts the entire 2DEL into a vortex state.
Hence, the twisted plasmonic modes support resonant plasmonic-enhanced
gate-tunable optical magnetization. Due to the interference of the plasmonic
and Drude contributions, the resonances have an asymmetric Fano-like shape.
These resonances present a signature of the 2DEL properties not affected by
contacts and interconnects and, therefore, providing the most accurate
information about the 2DEL properties. In particular, the widths of the
resonances encode direct information about the momentum relaxation time and
viscosity of the 2DEL.

stopped germ-grain models. They are defined via a random set of germs generated
by a homogeneous planar Poisson point process in $\mathbf{R}^{2}$. From each
germ, a grain, composed by a random number of branches, grows. This grain stops
to grow whenever one of its branches hits another grain. The classical and
historical example is the line segment model for which the grains are segments
growing in a random direction in $ [0,2\pi)$ with random velocity. In the
bilateral line segment model the segments grow in both directions. Other
examples are considered here such as the Brownian model where the branches are
simply given by independent Brownian motions in $\mathbf{R}^{2}$. The existence
of such dynamics for an infinite number of germs is not obvious and our first
result ensures it in a very general setting. In particular the existence of the
line segment model is proved as soon as the random velocity admits a moment of
order 4 which extends the result by Daley et al (Theorem 4.3 in
\cite{daley2014two}) for bounded velocity. Our result covers also the Brownian
dynamic model. In a second part of the paper, we show that the line segment
model with random velocity admitting a super exponential moment does not
percolate. This improves a recent result (Theorem 3.2

is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials
of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be
expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent
with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by
synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these
neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known
optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest
descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information
length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled

$\mathbb{Z}^{d}$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, with a single source of branching, that is
the lattice point where the birth and death of particles can occur. The random
walk is assumed to be homogeneous, symmetric and irreducible but, in contrast
to previous investigations, the random walk transition intensities $a(x,y)$
decrease as $|y-x|^{-(d+\alpha)}$ for $|y-x|\to \infty$, where
$\alpha\in(0,2)$, that leads to an infinite variance of the random walk jumps.
The~mechanism of the birth and death of particles at the source is governed by
a continuous-time Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson branching process. The source
intensity is characterized by a certain parameter $\beta$. We calculate the
long-time asymptotic behaviour for all integer moments for the number of
particles at each lattice point and for the total population size. With respect
to the parameter $\beta$ a non-trivial critical point $\beta_c>0$ is found for
every $d\geq 1$. In particular, if $\beta>\beta_{c}$ the evolutionary operator
generated a behaviour of the first moment for the number of particles has a
positive eigenvalue. The existence of a positive eigenvalue yields an
exponential growth in $t$ of the particle numbers in the case $\beta>\beta_c$
called \emph{supercritical}. Classification of the branching random walk
treated as \emph{subcritical} ($\beta<\beta_c$) or \emph{critical}

provide such an analysis, by deriving the relevant framework from first
principles. Building on a microscopic model of the bath, we first express heat,
work and entropy production for the closed qubit-bath system where these
definitions are unambiguous. We coarse-grain the obtained expressions, using a
methodology similar to the derivation of the dynamical master equation and
giving rise to consistent expressions of the First and Second Law. We verify
that long coarse graining times yield the Floquet Master Equation and its
already known thermodynamic description. Conversely, short coarse-graining
times yield the OBE and its consistent thermodynamic framework, whose variables
explicitly depend on the quantum coherences in the qubit's energy basis. These
quantum signatures in the heat and in the entropy production flows allow us to
characterize a genuinely quantum non-equilibrium situation, where the
coherences created by the driving field are continuously erased by the bath.
Our findings can be readily extended to larger open quantum systems. They carry
the seeds for future thermodynamic analyses of quantum gates and the design of
quantum engines in the strong coherent driving regime.

build a series of equations of state for hypernuclear compact stars, by
calibrating the coupling constants of the $\Xi$-hyperon to the experimental
binding energy of the single-$\Xi$ hypernuclei $^{15}_{\Xi^-}$C and
$^{12}_{\Xi^-}$Be. Coupling constants of the $\Lambda$-hyperon to nucleons have
been calibrated on a vast collection of experimental data on single
$\Lambda$-hypernuclei and we employ those values. Uncertainties on the
couplings of the $\Sigma$-hyperon to nuclear matter, due to lack of
experimental data, are accounted for by allowing for a wide variation of the
well depth of $\Sigma$ at rest in symmetric saturated nuclear matter. To
account for uncertainties in the nucleonic sector at densities much larger than
the saturation density, a rich collection of parametrizations is employed, some
of them in agreement with existing constraints from nuclear physics and
astrophysics. Neutron star properties are investigated with all these
calibrated equations of state. The effects of the presence of hyperons on the
radius, on the tidal deformability, on the moment of inertia, and on the
nucleonic direct Urca process are discussed. The sensitivity of the hyperonic
direct Urca processes to uncertainties in the nucleonic and hyperonic sectors
is also addressed. It is shown that the relative variations of the radius,
tidal deformability and moment of inertia from the values that characterize
purely nucleonic stars are linearly correlated with the strangeness fraction.
The maximum radius deviation, obtained for most massive neutron stars, is
$\approx 10\%$. The reduction of the maximum mass, triggered by nucleation of
strangeness, is estimated at $\approx 15 - 20\%$, out of which 5\% comes from
insufficient information on the $\Sigma$-hyperon interactions.

easy-axis rare-earth transition-metal ferrimagnet is investigated theoretically
and numerically in the vicinity of the angular momentum compensation point
$T_A$, where the net spin density vanishes. The particular focus is given on
the unusual interaction of the antiferromagnetic dynamics of a ferrimagnetic
domain wall and the adiabatic component of STT, which is absent in
antiferromagnets but exists in the ferrimagnets due to the dominant coupling of
conduction electrons to transition-metal spins. Specifically, we first show
that the STT-induced domain-wall velocity changes its sign across $T_A$ due to
the sign change of the net spin density, giving rise to a phenomenon unique to
ferrimagnets that can be used to characterize $T_A$ electrically. It is also
shown that the frequency of the STT-induced domain-wall precession exhibits its
maximum at $T_A$ and it can approach the spin-wave gap at sufficiently high
currents. Lastly, we report a numerical observation that, as the current
density increases, the domain-wall velocity starts to deviate from the
linear-response result, calling for a more comprehensive theory for the
domain-wall dynamics in ferrimagnets driven by a strong current.

the dynamics it exhibits depends on the precise manner of switching. Here we
take a one-dimensional oscillator and consider scenarios in which switching
occurs: (i) between two driving forces which have different frequencies, or
(ii) as a single forcing whose frequency switches between two values. The
difference is subtle, but entirely changes the long term behaviour, and
concerns whether the switch can be expressed linearly or nonlinearly in terms
of a discontinuous quantity (such as a sign or Heaviside step function that
represents the switch between frequencies). In scenario (i) the oscillator has
a stable periodic orbit, and the system can be described as a Filippov system.
In scenario (ii) the oscillator exhibits hidden dynamics, which lies outside
the theory of Filippov's systems, and causes the system to be increasingly (as
time passes) dominated by sliding along the frequency-switching threshold, and
in particular if periodic orbits do exist, they too exhibit sliding. We show
that the behaviour persists, at least asymptotically, if the systems are
regularized (i.e. if the switch is modelled as a smooth transition in the
manner of (i) or (ii)).

It is hypothesized that this process occurs through the transient mutual
synchronization of neurons located in different regions of the brain when the
stimulus is presented. This mechanism of binding through synchronization can be
directly implemented in neural networks composed of coupled oscillators. To do
so, the oscillators must be able to mutually synchronize for the range of
inputs corresponding to a single class, and otherwise remain desynchronized.
Here we show that the outstanding ability of spintronic nano-oscillators to
mutually synchronize and the possibility to precisely control the occurrence of
mutual synchronization by tuning the oscillator frequencies over wide ranges
allows pattern recognition. We demonstrate experimentally on a simple task that
three spintronic nano-oscillators can bind consecutive events and thus
recognize and distinguish temporal sequences. This work is a step forward in
the construction of neural networks that exploit the non-linear dynamic
properties of their components to perform brain-inspired computations.

of optic in terms of coends that, after some elementary application of the
Yoneda lemma, particularizes in each one of the basic optics. Traversals used
to be the exception; we show an elementary derivation of traversals and discuss
some other new derivations for optics. We relate our characterization of
traversals to the previous ones showing that the coalgebras of a comonad that
represents and split into shape and contents are traversable functors. The
representation of optics in terms of profunctors has many different proofs in
the literature; we discuss two ways of proving it, generalizing both to the
case of mixed optics for an arbitrary action. Categories of optics can be seen
as Eilenberg-Moore categories for a monad described by Pastro and Street. This
gives us two different approaches to composition between profunctor optics of
different families: using distributive laws between the monads defining them,
and using coproducts of monads. The second one is the one implicitly used in
Haskell programming; but we show that a refinement of the notion of optic is
required in order to model it faithfully. We provide experimental

interesting relatives of the famous triplet algebras of logarithmic CFT. The
algebra $V^{(p)}$ (respectively, $R^{(p)}$) is a large extension of the simple
affine vertex algebra $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ (respectively,
$L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ times a Heisenberg algebra), at level $k=-2+1/p$ for
positive integer $p$. In this paper, we derive structural results of these
algebras and prove various conjectures coming from representation theory and
physics.
  We show that SU(2) acts as automorphisms on $V^{(p)}$ and we decompose
$V^{(p)}$ as an $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-module and $R^{(p)}$ as an
$L_k(\mathfrak{gl}_2)$-module. The decomposition of $V^{(p)}$ shows that
$V^{(p)}$ is the large level limit of a corner vertex algebra appearing in the
context of S-duality. We also show that the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of
$V^{(p)}$ is the logarithmic doublet algebra $A^{(p)}$ introduced in [12],
while the reduction of $R^{(p)}$ yields the $B^{(p)}$-algebra of [39].
Conversely, we realize $V^{(p)}$ and $R^{(p)}$ from $A^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ via
a procedure that deserves to be called inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction.
As a corollary, we obtain that the category $KL_{k}$ of ordinary
$L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules at level $k=-2+1/p$ is a rigid vertex tensor
category equivalent to a twist of the category Rep$(SU(2))$. This finally
completes rigid braided tensor category structures for $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$
at all levels $k$.
  We also establish a uniqueness result of certain vertex operator algebra
extensions and use this result to prove that both $R^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ are
certain non-principal W-algebras of type $A$ at boundary admissible levels. The
same uniqueness result also shows that $R^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ are the chiral
algebras of Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1, D_{2p})$ and $(A_1,

  Single Thread","Accepted as a regular paper in the IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently deep convolutional neural networks have achieved significant success
in salient object detection. However, existing state-of-the-art methods require
high-end GPUs to achieve real-time performance, which makes them hard to adapt
to low-cost or portable devices. Although generic network architectures have
been proposed to speed up inference on mobile devices, they are tailored to the
task of image classification or semantic segmentation, and struggle to capture
intra-channel and inter-channel correlations that are essential for contrast
modeling in salient object detection. Motivated by the above observations, we
design a new deep learning algorithm for fast salient object detection. The
proposed algorithm for the first time achieves competitive accuracy and high
inference efficiency simultaneously with a single CPU thread. Specifically, we
propose a novel depthwise non-local moudule (DNL), which implicitly models
contrast via harvesting intra-channel and inter-channel correlations in a
self-attention manner. In addition, we introduce a depthwise non-local network
architecture that incorporates both depthwise non-local modules and inverted
residual blocks. Experimental results show that our proposed network attains
very competitive accuracy on a wide range of salient object detection datasets
while achieving state-of-the-art efficiency among all existing deep learning

exist multiple frames of the same scene. The first of them employs reference
patches on every frame instead of a commonly used single reference frame
method, thus utilizing the complete available information. The remaining two
techniques use a separable spatio-temporal filter to reduce interactions
between dissimilar regions, hence mitigating artifacts. In order to deal with
non-registered datasets we combine all our extensions with robust optical flow
computation. Two of our proposed multi-frame filters outperform existing
extensions on most occasions by a significant margin while also being
competitive with a state-of-the-art neural network-based technique. Moreover,
one of these two strategies is the fastest among all due to its separable

The statistics of fracture in the Fiber Bundle Model (FBM) are now well studied

show here how the correspondence between fracture statistics and the Flory

313, 1985, pp. 218-220) showed that a beam-like structure, often referred to as
a gyrotactic plume, would spontaneously appear from a suspension of gyrotactic
swimmers in a downflowing pipe. Such a plume is prone to an instability to form
blips. This work models the gyrotactic plume as a steady parallel basic state
and its subsequent breakdown into blips as an instability, employing both the
Generalised Taylor Dispersion (GTD) theory and the Fokker-Planck model for
comparison. Upon solving for the basic state, it is discovered that the steady
plume solution undergoes sophisticated bifurcations. When there is no net flow,
there exists a non-trivial solution of the plume structure other than the
stationary uniform suspension, stemming from a transcritical bifurcation with
the average cell concentration. When a net downflow is prescribed, there exists
a cusp bifurcation. Furthermore, there is a critical concentration, at which
the cell concentration at the centre would blow up for the GTD model. The
subsequent stability analysis using the steady plume solution shows that the
Fokker-Planck model is inconsistent with what was experimentally observed, as
it predicts stabilisation of axisymmetric blips at high concentration of the
plume and destabilisation of the first non-axisymmetric mode at low flow rates.

magnetic dipole moment. Thus, it is commonly believed that its excitation is
restricted to a nonlinear two-photon Raman process. However, recent efforts
have shown that a linear excitation in the presence of a supercurrent is
possible, resulting in a new resonant enhancement at $\Omega=2\Delta$ with the
driving light frequency $\Omega$ and the energy of the Higgs mode $2\Delta$.
This is in contrast to the usual $2\Omega = 2\Delta$ resonance condition found
in nonlinear third-harmonic generation experiments. In this communication, we
show that such a linear excitation can still be described as an effective Raman
two-photon process, with one photon at $\omega=2\Delta$ and one virtual photon
at $\omega=0$ which represents the dc supercurrent. At the same time we
demonstrate that a straightforward infrared activation with a single photon
excitation is negligible. Moreover, we give a general context to our theory,
providing an explanation for how the excitation of the Higgs mode in both THz
quench and drive experiments can be understood within a conventional
difference-frequency generation or sum-frequency generation process,
respectively. In such a picture, the observed new resonance condition $\Omega =
2\Delta$ is just a special case. With the same approach, we further discuss
another recent experiment, where we find a suppression of odd order higher
harmonics in the presence of a dc supercurrent.

allow applications to adapt to the amount of available resources by using
mapping segments. This way, applications may switch between different

bundles in the Fourier space, which are formed by pairs of particles. These
bundles are not present in the Boltzmann, Euler and Navier-Stokes equations,
because they are destroyed by the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon
formalism. However, measurements of the flow can detect certain bulk effects
shared across these bundles, such as the power scaling of the kinetic energy.
We estimate the scaling effects produced by two types of potentials: the
Thomas-Fermi interatomic potential (as well as its variations, such as the
Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark potential), and the electrostatic potential. In the
near-viscous inertial range, our estimates yield the inverse five-thirds power
decay of the kinetic energy for both the Thomas-Fermi and electrostatic
potentials. The electrostatic potential is also predicted to produce the
inverse cubic power scaling of the kinetic energy at large inertial scales.
Standard laboratory experiments confirm the scaling estimates for both the
Thomas-Fermi and electrostatic potentials at near-viscous scales. Surprisingly,
the observed kinetic energy spectrum in the Earth atmosphere at large scales
behaves as if induced by the electrostatic potential. Given that the Earth
atmosphere is not electrostatically neutral, we cautiously suggest a hypothesis
that the atmospheric kinetic energy spectra in the inertial range are indeed
driven by the large scale flow via the electrostatic potential coupling.

revealed a lack of stars at intermediate rotation periods, accompanied by a
decrease of photometric variability. Whether this so-called dearth region is a
peculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general manifestation
of stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. Our goal is to measure
stellar rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of
K2 stars, located in different fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light
on the relation between stellar rotation and photometric variability. We use
Lomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine
consistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by
computing the variability range from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian
mixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution.
Combining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in
29,860 stars. For effective temperatures below 6000K, the variability range
shows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of
750 Myr. Additionally, the K2 rotation period distribution shows evidence for
bimodality, although the dearth region is less pronounced compared to the
Kepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good
agreement with the period at the local variability minimum. We conclude that
the period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a
general manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in
the dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright
faculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been
underestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness
variability on the rotation period.

  Problem","7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables",,,,"math.OC cs.CG cs.LG cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is a powerful method for large-scale
optimization problems in the area of machine learning, especially for a
finite-sum formulation with numerous variables. In recent years, mini-batch SGD
gains great success and has become a standard technique for training deep
neural networks fed with big amount of data. Inspired by its success in deep
learning, we apply the idea of SGD with batch selection of samples to a classic
optimization problem in decision version. Given $n$ unit circles, the equal
circle packing problem (ECPP) asks whether there exist a feasible packing that
could put all the circles inside a circular container without overlapping.
Specifically, we propose a stochastic item descent method (SIDM) for ECPP in
large scale, which randomly divides the unit circles into batches and runs
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm on the corresponding batch
function iteratively to speedup the calculation. We also increase the batch
size during the batch iterations to gain higher quality solution. Comparing to
the current best packing algorithms, SIDM greatly speeds up the calculation of
optimization process and guarantees the solution quality for large scale
instances with up to 1500 circle items, while the baseline algorithms usually
handle about 300 circle items. The results indicate the highly efficiency of
SIDM for this classic optimization problem in large scale, and show potential
for other large scale classic optimization problems in which gradient descent
is used for optimization.

connectivity and feedback effects in network dynamics. Focusing on cycle
structure, this paper defines a new matrix, named cycle number matrix, to
represent cycle information of a network, and an index, named cycle ratio, to
quantify the node importance. Experiments on real networks suggest that cycle
ratio contains rich information in addition to well-known benchmark indices,
for example, the node rankings by cycle ratio are largely different from
rankings by degree, H-index, coreness, betweenness and articulation ranking,
while the rankings by degree, H-index, coreness are very similar to each other.
Extensive experiments on identifying vital nodes that maintain network
connectivity, facilitate network synchronization and maximize the early reach
of spreading show that cycle ratio is competitive to betweenness and overall
better than other benchmarks. We believe the in-depth analyses on cycle
structure may yield novel insights, metrics, models and algorithms for network
science.

pervading B335 were mapped using 24 stars after subtracting unrelated ambient
polarization components, for the first time revealing that they have an
axisymmetrically distorted hourglass-shaped structure toward the protostellar
core. On the basis of simple two- and three-dimensional magnetic field
modeling, magnetic inclination angles in the plane-of-sky and line-of-sight
directions were determined to be $90^{\circ} \pm 7^{\circ}$ and $50^{\circ} \pm
10^{\circ}$, respectively. The total magnetic field strength of B335 was
determined to be $30.2 \pm 17.7$ $\mu {\rm G}$. The critical mass of B335,
evaluated using both magnetic and thermal/turbulent support against collapse,
was determined to be $M_{\rm cr} = 3.37 \pm 0.94$ ${\rm M}_{\odot}$, which is
identical to the observed core mass of $M_{\rm core}=3.67$ M$_{\odot}$. We thus
concluded that B335 started its contraction from a condition near equilibrium.
We found a linear relationship in the polarization versus extinction diagram,
up to $A_V \sim 15$ mag toward the stars with the greatest obscuration, which
verified that our observations and analysis provide an accurate depiction of

work zones in the United States, it is important to investigate work zone merge
control, which is critical for improving work zone safety and capacity. This
paper proposes and evaluates a novel highway work zone merge control strategy
based on cooperative driving behavior enabled by artificial intelligence. The
proposed method assumes that all vehicles are fully automated, connected and
cooperative. It inserts two metering zones in the open lane to make space for
merging vehicles in the closed lane. In addition, each vehicle in the closed
lane learns how to optimally adjust its longitudinal position to find a safe
gap in the open lane using an off-policy soft actor critic (SAC) reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm, considering the traffic conditions in its surrounding.
The learning results are captured in convolutional neural networks and used to
control individual vehicles in the testing phase. By adding the metering zones
and taking the locations, speeds, and accelerations of surrounding vehicles
into account, cooperation among vehicles is implicitly considered. This
RL-based model is trained and evaluated using a microscopic traffic simulator.
The results show that this cooperative RL-based merge control significantly
outperforms popular strategies such as late merge and early merge in terms of
both mobility and safety measures.

obstacle (VO) to work in uncertain dynamic environments. In this paper, we show
how a robust model predictive control (MPC) with PVO constraints under
non-parametric uncertainty can be made computationally tractable. At the core
of our formulation is a novel yet simple interpretation of our robust MPC as a
problem of matching the distribution of PVO with a certain desired
distribution. To this end, we propose two methods. Our first baseline method is
based on approximating the distribution of PVO with a Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) and subsequently performing distribution matching using Kullback Leibler
(KL) divergence metric. Our second formulation is based on the possibility of
representing arbitrary distributions as functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
Space (RKHS). We use this foundation to interpret our robust MPC as a problem
of minimizing the distance between the desired distribution and the
distribution of the PVO in the RKHS. Both the RKHS and GMM based formulation
can work with any uncertainty distribution and thus allowing us to relax the
prevalent Gaussian assumption in the existing works. We validate our
formulation by taking an example of 2D navigation of quadrotors with a
realistic noise model for perception and ego-motion uncertainty. In particular,
we present a systematic comparison between the GMM and the RKHS approach and
show that while both approaches can produce safe trajectories, the former is
highly conservative and leads to poor tracking and control costs. Furthermore,
RKHS based approach gives better computational times that are up to one order
of magnitude lesser than the computation time of the GMM based approach.

essential novel ingredient is a pre-Universe reservoir $\mathrm{R_U}$ with
neither space nor time dimensions, in interaction with the universe U. U
results from a process of apparition of spacetime entities emanating from the
ur-elements in $\mathrm{R_U}$. The analysis of this apparition relies on a few
principles like the second law and the principle of conservation of energy,
applied to the thermodynamic system U $\cup\ \mathrm{R_U}$, which is closed.
The principle of conservation of energy does not apply to U alone. The second
law must be understood as ruling the transfer of entropy from $\mathrm{R_U}$ to
U, which is as small as one bit i.e., $k_B \ln 2$ per spacetime entity. In this
context, it is shown that the pressure $p$ of the Universe is negative and that
time and space are decoupled.
  We interpret the spacetime entities as elementary black holes (EBHs) at a
Planckian scale (their entropy of one bit as resulting from quantum
entanglement?). These EBHs with a constant entropy $k_B\ln 2$ own possibly
various angular momenta and electric charges; their statistics obeys a
Boltzmann distribution, if one considers the rotating and charged EBHs as high
energy states of the Schwarzschild EBH. Assuming that the total mass-energy of
the EBHs appeared up to the present epoch is the total mass-energy of the
observable universe, $\approx 35.3\times10^{53}$ kg, we find $T\approx 4.1\
T_P$, a temperature interpreted as the temperature of apparition of the EBHs.
Incidentally this model gives a possible explanation to non-local interactions,
through the hidden presence of $\mathrm{R_U}$, in reason of the absence of time
and space.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation aims to offer suggestions on
which POI to visit next, given a user's POI visit history. This problem has a
wide application in the tourism industry, and it is gaining an increasing
interest as more POI check-in data become available. The problem is often
modeled as a sequential recommendation problem to take advantage of the
sequential patterns of user check-ins, e.g., people tend to visit Central Park
after The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Recently, self-attentive
networks have been shown to be both effective and efficient in general
sequential recommendation problems, e.g., to recommend products, video games,
or movies. Directly adopting self-attentive networks for next POI
recommendation, however, may produce sub-optimal recommendations. This is
because vanilla self-attentive networks do not consider the spatial and
temporal patterns of user check-ins, which are two critical features in next
POI recommendation. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a
model named SANST that incorporates spatio-temporal patterns of user check-ins
into self-attentive networks. To incorporate the spatial patterns, we encode
the relative positions of POIs into their embeddings before feeding the
embeddings into the self-attentive network. To incorporate the temporal
patterns, we discretize the time of POI check-ins and model the temporal
relationship between POI check-ins by a relation-aware self-attention module.
We evaluate the performance of our SANST model with three real-world datasets.
The results show that SANST consistently outperforms the state-of-theart
models, and the advantage in nDCG@10 is up to 13.65%.

presenting the method we used to construct our own dataset from extracted

a one-phase feature selection, followed by supervised classification
algorithms. In the second technique, we use a hybrid approach based on forward

algorithms (EAs) to solve dynamic optimization problems. The applied NN
estimates the position of the next optimum based on the previous time best
solutions. After detecting a change, the predicted solution can be employed to
move the EA's population to a promising region of the solution space in order
to accelerate convergence and improve accuracy in tracking the optimum. While
previous works show improvement of the results, they neglect the overhead
created by NN. In this work, we reflect the time spent on training NN in the
optimization time and compare the results with a baseline EA. We explore if by
considering the generated overhead, NN is still able to improve the results,
and under which condition is able to do so.
  The main difficulties to train the NN are: 1) to get enough samples to
generalize predictions for new data, and 2) to obtain reliable samples. As NN
needs to collect data at each time step, if the time horizon is short, we will
not be able to collect enough samples to train the NN. To alleviate this, we
propose to consider more individuals on each change to speed up sample
collection in shorter time steps. In environments with a high frequency of
changes, the solutions produced by EA are likely to be far from the real
optimum. Using unreliable train data for the NN will, in consequence, produce
unreliable predictions. Also, as the time spent for NN stays fixed regardless
of the frequency, a higher frequency of change will mean a higher produced
overhead by the NN in proportion to the EA. In general, after considering the
generated overhead, we conclude that NN is not suitable in environments with a
high frequency of changes and/or short time horizons. However, it can be
promising for the low frequency of changes, and especially for the environments
that changes have a pattern.

typical formulations of the SBM do not make use of the special structure of
bipartite networks. Here we introduce a Bayesian nonparametric formulation of
the SBM and a corresponding algorithm to efficiently find communities in
bipartite networks which parsimoniously chooses the number of communities. The
biSBM improves community detection results over general SBMs when data are
noisy, improves the model resolution limit by a factor of $\sqrt{2}$, and
expands our understanding of the complicated optimization landscape associated

rather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art
CNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task, especially
when training data size is less. To address this phenomena, transfer learning
has been used as a popularly adopted technique. While transferring the learned
knowledge from one task to another, fine-tuning with the target-dependent Fully
Connected (FC) layers generally produces better results over the target task.
In this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the structure of FC
layers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian optimization. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize five pre-trained CNN models
such as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NASNetMobile. The experiments
are conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely CalTech-101, Oxford-102
Flowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning the newly learned

to the experiments carried out in this research. The proposed AutoFCL method
outperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and Oxford-102 Flowers

active particles tend to sediment as they are density mismatched with the

depends on the interplay between the active motion and the gravity-driven
sedimentation and alignment. It is thus important to understand and quantify
the influence of these gravity-induced effects on the behavior of model
chemically active particles moving near walls. For model gyrotactic,
self-phoretic Janus particles, here we study theoretically the occurrence of

the occurrence of such states as a function of the sedimentation velocity and
of the gyrotactic response of the particle, as well as of the phoretic mobility

simultaneously at both the ceiling and the floor, while the larger part of the
experimentally relevant parameter space corresponds to particles that would
exhibit sliding states only either at the floor or at the ceiling or there are
no sliding states at all. These predictions are critically compared with the

$O^\thicksim(nT\log ^2q+nT\sqrt{D}\log q)$ bit operations and uses $2(n+1)T$
probes to the black box. If $q\geq O(nT^2D)$, it has constant success rate to

keeping linear in $n,T$. A key technique is a randomization which makes all
coefficients of the unknown polynomial distinguishable, producing a diverse
polynomial. This approach, called diversification, was proposed by Giesbrecht
