devices, used to collect data from the grid to improve the efficiency of its
operation. These smart devices communicating wirelessly are susceptible to
attacks and hence the security and privacy of the smart devices along with the
smart grid is a major challenge. Blockchain-based systems provide improved
security and privacy and hence gained a lot of attention in the recent past.
This paper proposes a blockchain-based architecture for Neighborhood Area
Networks (NANs) and Home Area networks (HANs) in Smart Grid. The paper presents
a security analysis in terms of confidentiality, integrity and availability to
show that the proposed blockchain-based Smart Grid architecture is secure.
Also, the impact of the improved security on packet delays, energy and
computational overhead is discussed.

nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, divacancy defects in SiC, and P doped into

the coherence properties of controllably introduced W$^{5+}$ spin centers

B-site ordered double perovskite with a temperature-dependent octahedral

I$ = 0, centers. We characterized these defects by measuring the spin-lattice

$T_1$ = 310 ms and $T_2$ = 4 $\mu$s, establishing the viability of these qubit
candidates. With increasing temperature, $T_2$ remains constant up to T = 60 K
and then decreases to $T_2$ $\approx$ 1 $\mu$s at T = 90 K, and remains roughly
constant until T = 150 K, demonstrating the remarkable stability of $T_2$ with
increasing temperature. Together, these results demonstrate that controlled
defect generation in double perovskite structures can generate viable
paramagnetic point centers for quantum applications and expand the field of

decay between the imaging system and sample, leading to extremely weak field

for arbitrary beam profiles, we derive rigorous bounds on this evanescent
decay. In particular, we show that the decay length is only $w / \pi e \approx
0.12 w$, where $w$ is the spot width in the focal plane, or $\sqrt{A} / 2 e

stable operating point are often affected by modulations from test mass
misalignments leading to an elevated noise floor ranging from 50 to 500 Hz.
Nonstationary noise of this kind results in modulation sidebands and increases
the number of glitches observed in the calibrated strain data. These artifacts
ultimately affect the data quality and decrease the efficiency of the data
analysis pipelines looking for astrophysical signals from continuous waves as
well as the transient events. In this work, we develop a scheme to subtract one
such bilinear noise from the gravitational wave strain data and demonstrate it
at the GEO 600 observatory. We estimate the coupling by making use of
narrow-band signal injections that are already in place for noise projection
purposes and construct a coherent bilinear signal by a two-stage system
identification process. We improve upon the existing filter design techniques
by employing a Bayesian adaptive directed search strategy that optimizes across
the several key parameters that affect the accuracy of the estimated model. The
scheme takes into account the possible nonstationarities in the coupling by
periodically updating the involved filter coefficients. The resulting
postoffline subtraction leads to a suppression of modulation sidebands around
the calibration lines along with a broadband reduction of the midfrequency
noise floor. The observed increase in the astrophysical range and a reduction
in the occurrence of nonastrophysical transients suggest that the above method
is a viable data cleaning technique for current and future generation
gravitational wave observatories.

face limitations in meeting scalability and covering very wide areas which make
their adoption challenging for future IoT applications, especially in

we consider achieving scal-ability and extended coverage by integrating
multiple LPWANs. SNOW (Sensor Network Over White Spaces), a recently proposed
LPWAN architecture over the TV white spaces, has demonstrated its advantages
over existing LPWANs in performance and energy-efficiency. In this paper, we
propose to scale up LPWANs through a seamless integration of multiple SNOWs
which enables concurrent inter-SNOW and intra-SNOW communications. We then
formulate the tradeoff between scalability and inter-SNOW interference as a
constrained optimization problem whose objective is to maximize scalability by
managing white space spectrum sharing across multiple SNOWs. We also prove the
NP-hardness of this problem. To this extent, We propose an intuitive
polynomial-time heuristic algorithm for solving the scalability optimization
problem which is highly efficient in practice. For the sake of theoretical
bound, we also propose a simple polynomial-time 1/2-approximation algorithm for
the scalability optimization problem. Hardware experiments through deployment

quantization for homogeneous Lie groups as mappings between certain Gelfand
triples. For this, we restrict our considerations to the case, where the
homogeneous Lie group $G$ admits irreducible unitary representations, that are
square integrable modulo the center $Z(G)$ of $G$, and where $\dim Z(G)=1$.
Replacing the Schwartz space by a certain subspace $\mathcal S_*(G)
\hookrightarrow \mathcal S(G)$, we characterise the range of the group Fourier
transform on $\mathcal S_*(G)$ and construct distributions and Gelfand triples
around $L^2(G,\mu)$ and its Fourier image $L^2(\hat G,\hat \mu)$, such that the
Fourier transform becomes a Gelfand triple isomorphism. We give results on the
multiplication of distributions with a large class of vector valued smooth
functions and use this to establish the Kohn-Nirenberg quantization as an
isomorphism for our Gelfand triples and provide an explicit formula for the
Kohn-Nirenberg symbol of an operator.

that are free of gradient explosion and vanishing. However, due to the
diversity of network components and complex serial-parallel hybrid connections
in modern DNNs, the evaluation of existing metrics usually requires strong
assumptions, complex statistical analysis, or has limited application fields,
which constraints their spread in the community. In this paper, inspired by the
Gradient Norm Equality and dynamical isometry, we first propose a novel metric
called Block Dynamical Isometry, which measures the change of gradient norm in
individual block. Because our Block Dynamical Isometry is norm-based, its
evaluation needs weaker assumptions compared with the original dynamical
isometry. To mitigate the challenging derivation, we propose a highly
modularized statistical framework based on free probability. Our framework
includes several key theorems to handle complex serial-parallel hybrid
connections and a library to cover the diversity of network components.
Besides, several sufficient prerequisites are provided. Powered by our metric
and framework, we analyze extensive initialization, normalization, and network
structures. We find that Gradient Norm Equality is a universal philosophy
behind them. Then, we improve some existing methods based on our analysis,
including an activation function selection strategy for initialization
techniques, a new configuration for weight normalization, and a depth-aware way
to derive coefficients in SeLU. Moreover, we propose a novel normalization
technique named second moment normalization, which is theoretically 30% faster
than batch normalization without accuracy loss. Last but not least, our
conclusions and methods are evidenced by extensive experiments on multiple
models over CIFAR10 and ImageNet.

semiconductor superlattices (SLs) subjected to constant electric and magnetic
fields. It occurs if the magnetic field possesses nonzero components both along
and perpendicular to the SL axis and the Bloch oscillations along the SL axis
become resonant with cyclotron rotation in the transverse plane. It is a
phenomenon of considerable interest, so that it is important to understand the
underlying mechanism. In an earlier Letter (Phys. Rev. Lett. 114, 166802

occurs through chaotic diffusion along a stochastic web (SW) within
semiclassical collisionless dynamics, the phenomenon actually arises through a
non-chaotic mechanism. In fact, any chaos that occurs tends to reduce the
drift. We now provide fuller details, elucidating the mechanism in physical
terms, and extending the investigation. In particular, we: (i) demonstrate that
pronounced drift enhancement can still occur even in the complete absence of an
SW; (ii) show that, where an SW does exist and its characteristic slow dynamics
comes into play, it suppresses the drift enhancement even before strong chaos
is manifested; (iii) generalize our theory for non-small temperature, showing
that heating does not affect the enhancement mechanism and accounting for some
earlier numerical observations; (iv) demonstrate that certain analytic results
reported previously are incorrect; (v) provide an extended critical review of
the subject and closely related issues; and (vi) discuss some challenging

any graph $G$, let $\nu(G)$ be the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles in
$G$, and $\tau(G)$ be the minimum subset $F$ of edges such that $G \setminus F$
is triangle-free. It is easy to see that $\nu(G) \leq \tau(G) \leq 3 \nu(G)$,
and in fact, this rather obvious inequality holds for a much more general
primal-dual relation between $k$-hyper matching and covering in hypergraphs.
Tuza conjectured in $1981$ that $\tau(G) \leq 2 \nu(G)$, and this question has
received attention from various groups of researchers in discrete mathematics,
settling various special cases such as planar graphs and generalized to bounded
maximum average degree graphs, some cases of minor-free graphs, and very dense
graphs. Despite these efforts, the conjecture in general graphs has remained
wide open for almost four decades.
  In this paper, we provide a proof of a non-trivial consequence of the
conjecture; that is, for every $k \geq 2$, there exist a (multi)-set $F
\subseteq E(G): |F| \leq 2k \nu(G)$ such that each triangle in $G$ overlaps at
least $k$ elements in $F$. Our result can be seen as a strengthened statement
of Krivelevich's result on the fractional version of Tuza's conjecture (and we
give some examples illustrating this.) The main technical ingredient of our
result is a charging argument, that locally identifies edges in $F$ based on a
local view of the packing solution. This idea might be useful in further
studying the primal-dual relations in general and the Tuza's conjecture in
particular.

optimal scheduling of content caching in a time-slotted system under delivery

freely, the probe pulse reverses this transition. This directly allows to
monitor the nonequilibrium dynamics of the impurities as the dynamical
formation of coherent attractive or repulsive Bose polarons and signatures of
their induced-interactions are imprinted in the probe spectra. We show that for
interspecies repulsions exceeding the intraspecies ones a temporal
orthogonality catastrophe occurs, followed by enhanced energy redistribution
processes, independently of the impurity's flavor. This phenomenon takes place
over the characteristic trap timescales. For much longer timescales a steady
state is reached characterized by substantial losses of coherence of the
impurities. This steady state is related to eigenstate thermalization and it is
demonstrated to be independent of the system's characteristics.

features whose angular separations are a fraction of an arcsecond from the
lensing critical curve and appear to be highly but unequally magnified image
pairs of underlying compact sources, with one brightest pair having clear
asymmetry consistently across four filters. One explanation of unequal
magnification is microlensing by intracluster stars, which induces independent
flux variations in the images of individual or groups of source stars in the
lensed galaxy. For a second possibility, intracluster dark matter subhalos
invisible to telescopes effectively perturb lensing magnifications near the
critical curve and give rise to persistently unequal image pairs. Our modeling
suggests, at least for the most prominent identified image pair, that the
microlensing hypothesis is in tension with the absence of notable asymmetry
variation over a six-year baseline, while subhalos of $\sim

Matter typically produce stationary and sizable asymmetries. We judge that
observations at additional times and more precise lens models are necessary to

framework to solve nonlinear problems in signal processing and machine
learning. The standard approach relies on the \emph{kernel trick} to perform
pairwise evaluations of a kernel function, leading to scalability issues for
large datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the
training data. Recently, we proposed \emph{no-trick} (NT) kernel adaptive
filtering (KAF) that leverages explicit feature space mappings using
data-independent basis with constant complexity. The inner product defined by
the feature mapping corresponds to a positive-definite finite-rank kernel that
induces a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).
Information theoretic learning (ITL) is a framework where information theory
descriptors based on non-parametric estimator of Renyi entropy replace
conventional second-order statistics for the design of adaptive systems. An
RKHS for ITL defined on a space of probability density functions simplifies
statistical inference for supervised or unsupervised learning. ITL criteria
take into account the higher-order statistical behavior of the systems and
signals as desired. However, this comes at a cost of increased computational
complexity. In this paper, we extend the NT kernel concept to ITL for improved
information extraction from the signal without compromising scalability.
Specifically, we focus on a family of fast, scalable, and accurate estimators
for ITL using explicit inner product space (EIPS) kernels. We demonstrate the
superior performance of EIPS-ITL estimators and combined NT-KAF using EIPS-ITL
cost functions through experiments.

Techniques range from classic matrix factorization to more recent deep learning

two skyrmions around each other, with the separation between them growing
logarithmically with time. When two skyrmions of the total topological charge
$Q = 2$ are pushed close to each other, the discreteness of the atomic lattice
makes them collapse into one skyrmion of charge $Q = 1$ below a critical

process which deals with the procurement of products and services for
enterprise operations. Procurement is done by issuing purchase orders to
impaneled vendors and invoices submitted by vendors are paid after they go
through a rigorous validation process. Agents orchestrating P2P process often
encounter the problem of matching a product or service descriptions in the
invoice to those in purchase order and verify if the ordered items are what
have been supplied or serviced. For example, the description in the invoice and
purchase order could be TRES 739mL CD KER Smooth and TRES 0.739L CD KER Smth
which look different at word level but refer to the same item. In a typical P2P
process, agents are asked to manually select the products which are similar
before invoices are posted for payment. This step in the business process is
manual, repetitive, cumbersome, and costly. Since descriptions are not
well-formed sentences, we cannot apply existing semantic and syntactic text
similarity approaches directly. In this paper, we present two approaches to
solve the above problem using various types of available agent's recorded
feedback data. If the agent's feedback is in the form of a relative ranking
between descriptions, we use similarity ranking algorithm. If the agent's
feedback is absolute such as match or no-match, we use classification
similarity algorithm. We also present the threats to the validity of our
approach and present a possible remedy making use of product taxonomy and
catalog. We showcase the comparative effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed approaches over many benchmarks and real-world data sets.

shows state change of the gamma-ray emission and spin-down rate. The state
change of PSR J2021+4026 was first observed at 2011 October, at which the
pulsar changes the state from high gamma-ray flux/low spin-down rate state to
low gamma-ray flux/high spin-down rate st\ ate. In December 2014, PSR
J2021+4026 recovered the state before the 2011 state change over a timescale of
a few months. We report that the long term evolution of the gamma-ray flux and
timing behavior suggests that PSR J2021+4026 changed the state near 2018
February 1st and entered a new low gamma-ray flux/high spin-down rate state. At
the 2018 state change, the averaged flux dropped from $(1.29\pm 0.01)\times
10^{-6} {\rm cts~cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ to $(1.12\pm 0.01)\times 10^{-6} {\rm
cts~cm^{-2}s^{-1\ }}$, which has the similar behavior to the case of 2011
event. The spin-down rate has increased by $\sim 3\%$ in the new state since
the 2018 state change. The shapes of pulse profile and spectrum in GeV bands
also changed at the 2018 event, and they are consistent with behavior at the
2011 state change. Our results probably suggest that PSR J2021+4026 is
switching between different states with a timescale of several years, like some
radio pulsars (e.g. PSR~B1828-11). PSR J2021+4026 will provide a unique
opportunity to study the mechanism of the state switching.

to learn an effective spatiotemporal representation for accurate video saliency
prediction (VSP). To address this issue, we develop an effective spatiotemporal
feature alignment network tailored to VSP, mainly including two key
sub-networks: a multi-scale deformable convolutional alignment network (MDAN)
and a bidirectional convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-ConvLSTM) network.
The MDAN learns to align the features of the neighboring frames to the
reference one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can well handle various
motions. Specifically, the MDAN owns a pyramidal feature hierarchy structure
that first leverages deformable convolution (Dconv) to align the
lower-resolution features across frames, and then aggregates the aligned
features to align the higher-resolution features, progressively enhancing the
features from top to bottom. The output of MDAN is then fed into the
Bi-ConvLSTM for further enhancement, which captures the useful long-time
temporal information along forward and backward timing directions to
effectively guide attention orientation shift prediction under complex scene
transformation. Finally, the enhanced features are decoded to generate the
predicted saliency map. The proposed model is trained end-to-end without any
intricate post processing. Extensive evaluations on four VSP benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves favorable performance against
state-of-the-art methods. The source codes and all the results will be
released.

various areas of biomedical research and health care. Nowadays, many
large-scale biomedical knowledge bases (KBs) containing triples about entity
pairs and their relations have been built. KBs are important resources for
biomedical relation extraction. However, previous research pays little
attention to prior knowledge. In addition, the dependency tree contains
important syntactic and semantic information, which helps to improve relation
extraction. So how to effectively use it is also worth studying. In this paper,
we propose a novel convolutional attention network (CAN) for CDR extraction.
Firstly, we extract the shortest dependency path (SDP) between chemical and
disease pairs in a sentence, which includes a sequence of words, dependency
directions, and dependency relation tags. Then the convolution operations are
performed on the SDP to produce deep semantic dependency features. After that,
an attention mechanism is employed to learn the importance/weight of each
semantic dependency vector related to knowledge representations learned from
KBs. Finally, in order to combine dependency information and prior knowledge,
the concatenation of weighted semantic dependency representations and knowledge
representations is fed to the softmax layer for classification. Experiments on
the BioCreative V CDR dataset show that our method achieves comparable
performance with the state-of-the-art systems, and both dependency information
and prior knowledge play important roles in CDR extraction task.

trial are available, a question of interest is to what extent covariates can be
used to optimize treatment decisions. Statistical hypothesis testing of
covariate-by-treatment interaction is ill-suited for this purpose. The
application of decision theory results in treatment rules that compare the
expected benefit of treatment given the patient's covariates against a
treatment threshold. However, determining treatment threshold is often
context-specific, and any given threshold might seem arbitrary when the overall
capacity towards predicting treatment benefit is of concern. We propose the
Concentration of Benefit index (Cb), a threshold-free metric that quantifies
the combined performance of covariates towards finding individuals who will
benefit the most from treatment. The construct of the proposed index is
comparing expected treatment outcomes with and without knowledge of covariates
when one of a two randomly selected patients are to be treated. We show that
the resulting index can also be expressed in terms of the integrated efficiency
of individualized treatment decision over the entire range of treatment
thresholds. We propose parametric and semi-parametric estimators, the latter
being suitable for out-of-sample validation and correction for optimism. We
used data from a clinical trial to demonstrate the calculations in a
step-by-step fashion, and have provided the R code for implementation
(https://github.com/msadatsafavi/txBenefit). The proposed index has intuitive
and theoretically sound interpretation and can be estimated with relative ease

various aspects of estimation and inference for such a metric need to be
pursued in future research.

circuit stability becomes often a major concern, which necessitates to study
the heat transport properties at the molecular-scale. Here we report the
thermoelectric behavior of various tr-nuclear metal-string complexes,
$[M-M-M](dpa)_4(NCS)_2$ for $M \in \{Cr,Ru\}$, bridging Au(111) nanowires as
nanoelectrodes. Based on our charge transport analysis from
\textit{first-principles}, we find that the dominant transmission peaks tend to
move away from the Fermi level upon systematic rutheniation in chromium-based
metal-string complexes due mainly to the coupling of $\pi^{*}$ orbitals from Ru
and $\sigma_{nb}$ orbitals from Cr. Such type of a metal-string junction can
also exhibit strong Coulomb interaction so that its thermoelectric behavior
begins to deviate from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results further suggest
that metal-string complexes can render better thermoelectric devices especially
at the molecular-scale with the thermopower as high as 172 $\mu V/K$ at 300 K.
Considering the contributions from both electrons and phonons, even a high
\textit{figure of merit} of $ZT \sim 2$ may be attained for Cr-Cr-Cr based
metal-string molecular junctions at room temperature. Resonant enhancement in
the thermoelectric efficiency appears to occur in such systems through
alteration of inter-dot electrostatic interactions, which can be controlled by
incorporating Cr and Ru atoms in such tri-nuclear metal-string complexes.

  2020. Fixed typos",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Instance segmentation is one of the fundamental vision tasks. Recently, fully
convolutional instance segmentation methods have drawn much attention as they
are often simpler and more efficient than two-stage approaches like Mask R-CNN.
To date, almost all such approaches fall behind the two-stage Mask R-CNN method
in mask precision when models have similar computation complexity, leaving
great room for improvement.
  In this work, we achieve improved mask prediction by effectively combining
instance-level information with semantic information with lower-level
fine-granularity. Our main contribution is a blender module which draws
inspiration from both top-down and bottom-up instance segmentation approaches.
The proposed BlendMask can effectively predict dense per-pixel
position-sensitive instance features with very few channels, and learn
attention maps for each instance with merely one convolution layer, thus being
fast in inference. BlendMask can be easily incorporated with the
state-of-the-art one-stage detection frameworks and outperforms Mask R-CNN
under the same training schedule while being 20% faster. A light-weight version
of BlendMask achieves $ 34.2% $ mAP at 25 FPS evaluated on a single 1080Ti GPU
card. Because of its simplicity and efficacy, we hope that our BlendMask could
serve as a simple yet strong baseline for a wide range of instance-wise
prediction tasks.

for a wide range of applications. The observation at the macroscopic level
demonstrates that the aggregated urban quantities (e.g., gross domestic
product) scale systematically with population sizes across cities, also known
as urban scaling laws. However, at the mesoscopic level, we lack an
understanding of whether the simple scaling relationship holds within cities,
which is a fundamental question regarding the spatial origin of scaling in
urban systems. Here, by analyzing four extensive datasets covering millions of
mobile phone users and urban facilities, we investigate the scaling phenomena
within cities. We find that the mesoscopic infrastructure volume and
socioeconomic activity scale sub- and super-linearly with the active
population, respectively. For a same scaling phenomenon, however, the exponents
vary in cities of similar population sizes. To explain these empirical
observations, we propose a conceptual framework by considering the
heterogeneous distributions of population and facilities, and the spatial
interactions between them. Analytical and numerical results suggest that,
despite the large number of complexities that influence urban activities, the
simple interaction rules can effectively explain the observed regularity and
heterogeneity in scaling behaviors within cities.

quality management. As the basic computing task, optimal subset repair is not
only applied for cost estimation during the progress of database repairing, but
also directly used to derive the evaluation of database inconsistency.
Computing an optimal subset repair is to find a minimum tuple set from an
inconsistent database whose remove results in a consistent subset left. Tight
bound on the complexity and efficient algorithms are still unknown. In this
paper, we improve the existing complexity and algorithmic results, together
with a fast estimation on the size of optimal subset repair. We first
strengthen the dichotomy for optimal subset repair computation problem, we show
that it is not only APXcomplete, but also NPhard to approximate an optimal
subset repair with a factor better than $17/16$ for most cases. We second show
a $(2-0.5^{\tiny\sigma-1})$-approximation whenever given $\sigma$ functional
dependencies, and a $(2-\eta_k+\frac{\eta_k}{k})$-approximation when an
$\eta_k$-portion of tuples have the $k$-quasi-Tur$\acute{\text{a}}$n property

$2n+\epsilon n$ with a high probability, thus deriving an estimation of
FD-inconsistency degree of a ratio $2+\epsilon$. To support a variety of subset

Associated Virus serotype 2 (AAV2) and Minute Virus of Mice (MVM), both T=1
single stranded DNA viruses, and Bromo Mosaic Virus (BMV), a T=3 single
stranded RNA virus. Experimental validation is by in-vitro, site-directed
mutagenesis data found in literature.
  We combine ab-initio predictions at two scales: at the interface-scale, we
predict the importance (cruciality) of an interaction for successful
subassembly across each interface between VP monomers; and at the capsid-scale,
we predict the cruciality of an interface for successful capsid assembly.
  At the interface-scale, we measure cruciality by changes in the capsid
free-energy landscape partition function when an interaction is removed. The
partition function computation uses atlases of interface subassembly
landscapes, rapidly generated by a novel geometric method and curated
opensource software EASAL (efficient atlasing and search of assembly
landscapes). At the capsid-scale, cruciality of an interface for successful
assembly of the capsid is based on combinatorial entropy.
  Our study goes from resource-light, multiscale computational predictions of
crucial hotspot inter-atomic interactions to validation using data on
site-directed mutagenesis' effect on capsid assembly. By reliably and rapidly
narrowing down target interactions, (no more than 1.5 hours per interface on a
laptop with Intel Core i5-2500K 3.2Ghz CPU and 8GB of RAM) our predictions can
inform and reduce time-consuming in-vitro and in-vivo experiments, or more

possible candidate for dark matter in the Universe. One of the most important
predictions of FDM is the formation of a soliton core instead of a density cusp
at the center of galaxies. If FDM is the correct theory of dark matter, then
the predicted soliton core can help to form the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) in
the Milky Way. We present high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas
flow patterns to constrain the properties of the soliton core based on a
realistic Milky Way potential. We find that a dense center is required to form
a reasonable CMZ. The size and kinematics of the CMZ offer a relatively strong
constraint on the inner enclosed mass profile of the Galaxy. If a soliton core
is not considered, a compact nuclear bulge alone with a radially varying
mass-to-light ratio can match the observed size and kinematics of the CMZ. A
soliton core model with a mass of $\approx4.0\times10^8{\; {\rm M}_{\odot}}$
and a core radius of $\approx0.05{\;{\rm kpc}}$, together with a less massive
nuclear bulge with a constant mass-to-light ratio, also agrees nicely with the
current data. Such a FDM soliton core corresponds to a boson mass of
$\sim2-7\times10^{-22}{\;{\rm eV}}$, which could be further constrained by the
improved determination of the mass-to-light ratio in the Galactic center.

consequentialism, the position that, roughly speaking, outcomes are all that

it does not necessarily provide a tractable way of choosing actions (because of
the combined problems of uncertainty, subjectivity, and aggregation), it
nevertheless provides a powerful foundation from which to critique the existing
literature on machine learning fairness. Moreover, it brings to the fore some
of the tradeoffs involved, including the problem of who counts, the pros and
cons of using a policy, and the relative value of the distant future. In this

bulge structural properties and physical properties of host galaxies. We
confirm previous findings that pseudo bulges on average have smaller S\'{e}rsic
indices, smaller bulge-to-total ratios, and fainter surface brightnesses when
compared with classical bulges. Our sizable sample statistically shows that
pseudo bulges are more intrinsically flattened than classical bulges. Pseudo
bulges are most frequent (incidence $\gtrsim 80\%$) in late-type spirals (later
than Sc). Our measurements support the picture in which pseudo bulges arose
from star formation induced by inflowing gas, while classical bulges were born
out of violent processes such as mergers and coalescence of clumps. We reveal
differences with the literature that warrant attention: (1) the bimodal
distribution of S\'{e}rsic indices presented by previous studies is not
reproduced in our study; (2) classical and pseudo bulges have similar relative
bulge sizes; and (3) the pseudo bulge fraction is considerably smaller in
early-type disks compared with previous studies based on one-dimensional
surface brightness profile fitting. We attribute the above differences to our
improved image quality, more robust bulge-to-disk decomposition technique, and
different classification criteria applied. Moreover, we find that barred
galaxies do not host more pseudo bulges or more prominent pseudo bulges than
unbarred galaxies. Various implications of these findings are discussed.

parallelism enables the use of quantum tools to quantify the coupling between
the spatial and polarisation DoFs, usually implemented with
polarisation-dependent spatial light modulators, which requires the splitting
of the vector mode into two orthogonal polarisation components. Here we put

The abstract is truncated",,,,"cs.CC cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To date, the only way to argue polynomial lower bounds for dynamic algorithms
is via fine-grained complexity arguments. These arguments rely on strong
assumptions about specific problems such as the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH) and the Online Matrix-Vector Multiplication Conjecture (OMv).
While they have led to many exciting discoveries, dynamic algorithms still miss
out some benefits and lessons from the traditional ``coarse-grained'' approach
that relates together classes of problems such as P and NP. In this paper we
initiate the study of coarse-grained complexity theory for dynamic algorithms.
Below are among questions that this theory can answer.
  What if dynamic Orthogonal Vector (OV) is easy in the cell-probe model? A
research program for proving polynomial unconditional lower bounds for dynamic
OV in the cell-probe model is motivated by the fact that many conditional lower
bounds can be shown via reductions from the dynamic OV problem. Since the
cell-probe model is more powerful than word RAM and has historically allowed
smaller upper bounds, it might turn out that dynamic OV is easy in the
cell-probe model, making this research direction infeasible. Our theory implies
that if this is the case, there will be very interesting algorithmic
consequences: If dynamic OV can be maintained in polylogarithmic worst-case
update time in the cell-probe model, then so are several important dynamic
problems such as $k$-edge connectivity, $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate mincut,
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate matching, planar nearest neighbors, Chan's subset
union and 3-vs-4 diameter. The same conclusion can be made when we replace
dynamic OV by, e.g., subgraph connectivity, single source reachability, Chan's
subset union, and 3-vs-4 diameter.
  Lower bounds for $k$-edge connectivity via dynamic OV? (see the full abstract

  translation","Accepted by IPMI 2021",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spinal surgery planning necessitates automatic segmentation of vertebrae in
cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), an intraoperative imaging modality that
is widely used in intervention. However, CBCT images are of low-quality and
artifact-laden due to noise, poor tissue contrast, and the presence of metallic
objects, causing vertebra segmentation, even manually, a demanding task. In
contrast, there exists a wealth of artifact-free, high quality CT images with
vertebra annotations. This motivates us to build a CBCT vertebra segmentation
model using unpaired CT images with annotations. To overcome the domain and
artifact gaps between CBCT and CT, it is a must to address the three
heterogeneous tasks of vertebra segmentation, artifact reduction and modality
translation all together. To this, we propose a novel anatomy-aware artifact
disentanglement and segmentation network (A$^3$DSegNet) that intensively
leverages knowledge sharing of these three tasks to promote learning.
Specifically, it takes a random pair of CBCT and CT images as the input and
manipulates the synthesis and segmentation via different decoding combinations
from the disentangled latent layers. Then, by proposing various forms of
consistency among the synthesized images and among segmented vertebrae, the
learning is achieved without paired (i.e., anatomically identical) data.
Finally, we stack 2D slices together and build 3D networks on top to obtain
final 3D segmentation result. Extensive experiments on a large number of
clinical CBCT (21,364) and CT (17,089) images show that the proposed
A$^3$DSegNet performs significantly better than state-of-the-art competing
methods trained independently for each task and, remarkably, it achieves an
average Dice coefficient of 0.926 for unpaired 3D CBCT vertebra segmentation.

challenging task because the artifacts are structured and non-local in the

one possible approach to MAR is to exploit the latter characteristic by
learning to reduce artifacts in the sinogram. However, if we directly treat the
metal-affected regions in sinogram as missing and replace them with the
surrogate data generated by a neural network, the artifact-reduced CT images
tend to be over-smoothed and distorted since fine-grained details within the
metal-affected regions are completely ignored. In this work, we provide
analytical investigation to the issue and propose to address the problem by (1)
retaining the metal-affected regions in sinogram and (2) replacing the
binarized metal trace with the metal mask projection such that the geometry

may reduce the computational complexity of SD. For further complexity
reduction, an early termination scheme based on the predicted minimum path

is, the boundary of a moving object tends to appear blurry especially when the
object undergoes a fast motion, causing optical flow calculation to break down.
In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a first-image-then-video
two-stage denoising neural network, consisting of an image denoising module for
spatially reducing intra-frame noise followed by a regular spatiotemporal video
denoising module. The intuition is simple yet powerful and effective: the first
stage of image denoising effectively reduces the noise level and, therefore,
allows the second stage of spatiotemporal denoising for better modeling and
learning everywhere, including along the moving object boundaries. This
two-stage network, when trained in an end-to-end fashion, yields the
state-of-the-art performances on the video denoising benchmark Vimeo90K dataset
in terms of both denoising quality and computation. It also enables an
unsupervised approach that achieves comparable performance to existing
supervised approaches.

subset selection per radio frequency (RF) chain based on active/inactive
switches and uses constant phase shifters (CPS) to control the phases of
signals in the RF circuit. In this scheme, for each RF chain, a subset of
receive antennas that contribute more to the desired signal power than the
interference power is chosen for signal combining in the analog domain, whereas
other receive antennas are excluded from signal combining, thereby enhancing
sum-rates. Simultaneously, the proposed structure reduces power consumption in
the RF circuit by exclusively activating switches that correspond to the
antennas selected for each RF chain. We also develop three low-complexity
algorithms for per-RF chain antenna subset selection. Finally, through
numerical simulation, we show that the proposed structure provides higher
spectral efficiency and higher energy efficiency than conventional hybrid
analog and digital combining schemes for mmWave MU-MIMO systems.

to non-deterministic responses and stability problems that can adversely affect
robot control. As a result, many robotic systems devote RTOS for low-level

dimensions require fabrication of very complicated devices or their
applicability is limited to a class of materials. Discovery of new methods with
high thermal sensitivity are required for the widespread use of thermal
conductivity measurements in characterizing materials properties. We propose
and demonstrate a simple non-destructive method with superior thermal
sensitivity to measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of nanosheets and
nanowires using the bolometric effect. The method utilizes laser beam heating
to create a temperature gradient, as small as a fraction of a Kelvin, over the
suspended section of the nanomaterial with electrical contacts. Local
temperature rise due to the laser irradiation alters the electrical resistance
of the device, which can be measured precisely. This resistance change is then
used to extract the temperature profile along the nanomaterial using thermal
conductivity as a fitting parameter. We measured the thermal conductivity of
V2O3 nanosheets to validate the applicability of the method and found an
excellent agreement with the literature. Further, we measured the thermal
conductivity of metallic 2H-TaS2 for the first time and performed ab initio
calculations to support our measurements. Finally, we discussed the
applicability of the method on semiconducting nanosheets and performed
measurements on WS2 and MoS2 thin flakes.

near-infrared. We aim to investigate the inner gaseous disc of IRAS11101-5829
through scattered light from the outflow cavity walls.
  Methods: We observed the environment of the high-mass young stellar object
IRAS11101-5829 and the closest knots of its jet, HH135-136, with the
VLT/SINFONI. We also retrieved archival data from the high-resolution long-slit
spectrograph VLT/X-shooter.
  Results: We detect the first three bandheads of the $\upsilon=2-0$ CO
vibrational emission for the first time in this object. It is coincident with
continuum and Br$\gamma$ emission and extends up to $\sim10000$ au to the
north-east and $\sim10 000$ au to the south-west. The line profiles have been
modelled as a Keplerian rotating disc assuming a single ring in LTE. The model
output gives a temperature of $\sim3000$ K, a CO column density of
$\sim1\times10^{22}\mathrm{ cm^{-2}}$, and a projected Keplerian velocity
$v_\mathrm{K}\sin i_\mathrm{disc} \sim 25\mathrm{ km s^{-1}}$, which is
consistent with previous modelling in other high-mass protostars. In
particular, the low value of $v_\mathrm{K}\sin i_\mathrm{disc}$ suggests that
the disc is observed almost face-on, whereas the well-constrained geometry of
the jet imposes that the disc must be close to edge-on. This apparent
discrepancy is interpreted as the CO seen reflected in the mirror of the
outflow cavity wall.
  Conclusions: From both jet geometry and disc modelling, we conclude that all
the CO emission is seen through reflection by the cavity walls and not
directly. This result implies that in the case of highly embedded objects, as
for many high-mass protostars, line profile modelling alone might be deceptive
and the observed emission could affect the derived physical and geometrical
properties; in particular the inclination of the system can be incorrectly
interpreted.

drawbacks to this approach: firstly, the feature engineering being manual is
cumbersome and requires human knowledge; and secondly, the designed features
might not be best for the objective at hand. This has motivated the adoption of
a recent trend in speech community towards utilisation of representation
learning techniques, which can learn an intermediate representation of the

improved performance. The significance of representation learning has increased
with advances in deep learning (DL), where the representations are more useful
and less dependent on human knowledge, making it very conducive for tasks like
classification, prediction, etc. The main contribution of this paper is to
present an up-to-date and comprehensive survey on different techniques of

determine the same sets of vector fields -- these networks are said to be
ODE-equivalent. The set of all n-cell coupled networks is so partitioned into
classes of ODE-equivalent networks. With no further restrictions, the number of
ODE-classes is not finite and each class has an infinite number of networks.
Inside each ODE-class we can find a finite subclass of networks that minimize
the number of edges in the class, called minimal networks.
  In this paper, we consider coupled cell networks with asymmetric inputs. That
is, if k is the number of distinct edges types, these networks have the
property that every cell receives k inputs, one of each type. Fixing the number
n of cells, we prove that: the number of ODE-classes is finite; restricting to
a maximum of n(n-1) inputs, we can cover all the ODE-classes; all minimal
n-cell networks with n(n-1) asymmetric inputs are ODE-equivalent. We also give
a simple criterion to test if a network is minimal and we conjecture lower
estimates for the number of distinct ODE-classes of n-cell networks with any
number k of asymmetric inputs. Moreover, we present a full list of
representatives of the ODE-classes of networks with three cells and two
asymmetric inputs.

stoichiometric composition, orthorhombic phase, and with high crystallinity.
The nearly perfect in-plane lattice matching of DSO with respect to SIO and
same symmetry result in a full epitaxial inplane alignment, i.e., the c-axis of
DSO and SIO are parallel to each other with only slightly enlarged d110
out-of-plane lattice spacing (+0.38%) due to the small in-plane compressive
strain caused by the DSO substrate. Measurements of the magnetoresistance MR
were carried out for current flow along the [001] and [1-10] direction of SIO
and magnetic field perpendicular to the film plane. MR appears to be distinctly
different for both directions. The anisotropy MR001/MR1-10 > 1 increases with
decreasing T and is especially pronounced for the thinnest films, which
likewise display a hysteretic field dependence below T* ~ 3 K. The coercive
field Hc amounts to 2-5 T. Both, T* and Hc are very similar to the magnetic
ordering temperature and coercivity of DSO which strongly suggests
substrate-induced mechanism as a reason for the anisotropic magnetotransport in

  Multi-channel Target Speech Separation",,,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Target speech separation refers to extracting the target speaker's speech
from mixed signals. Despite the recent advances in deep learning based
close-talk speech separation, the applications to real-world are still an open
issue. Two main challenges are the complex acoustic environment and the
real-time processing requirement. To address these challenges, we propose a
temporal-spatial neural filter, which directly estimates the target speech
waveform from multi-speaker mixture in reverberant environments, assisted with
directional information of the speaker(s). Firstly, against variations brought
by complex environment, the key idea is to increase the acoustic representation
completeness through the jointly modeling of temporal, spectral and spatial
discriminability between the target and interference source. Specifically,
temporal, spectral, spatial along with the designed directional features are
integrated to create a joint acoustic representation. Secondly, to reduce the
latency, we design a fully-convolutional autoencoder framework, which is purely
end-to-end and single-pass. All the feature computation is implemented by the
network layers and operations to speed up the separation procedure. Evaluation
is conducted on simulated reverberant dataset WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix under
speaker-independent scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based multi-channel
approaches with fewer parameters and faster processing speed. Furthermore, the
proposed temporal-spatial neural filter can handle mixtures with varying and
unknown number of speakers and exhibits persistent performance even when
existing a direction estimation error. Codes and models will be released soon.

areas, which allows user stations (STAs) to choose between different Access
Points (APs). The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP
with the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of
some APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement
Learning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically
learn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs
among the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem
since the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of
the others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the
network.
  In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where
STAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and
select the one that better satisfy their needs. To do it, we propose a novel
approach called Opportunistic epsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the
exploration when a suitable AP is found, only resuming the exploration after
several unsatisfactory association rounds. With this approach, we reduce
significantly the network response dynamics, improving the ability of the STAs
to find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the
network resources.
  We investigate how the characteristics of the scenario (position of the APs
and STAs, traffic loads, and channel allocation strategies) impact the learning
process and the achievable performance. We also show that not all the STAs have
to implement the proposed solution to improve their performance. Finally, we
study the case where stations arrive progressively to the system, showing that
the considered approach is also suitable in such a non-stationary set-up.

and counting permutations of $\{1, 2, \ldots, n \}$ that avoid some given

recall that the corresponding sequences, $Av(123\ldots k)$, are Stieltjes

either exactly or numerically, by using the Stieltjes inversion formula as a
fundamental tool. We show that the generating functions of the sequences $\,
Av(1234)$ and $\, Av(12345)$ correspond, up to simple rational functions, to an
order-one linear differential operator acting on a classical modular form given

an order-two linear differential operator acting on the square of a classical
modular form given as a pullback of a $\, _2F_1$ hypergeometric function. We
demonstrate that the density function for the Stieltjes moment sequence
$Av(123\ldots k)$ is closely, but non-trivially, related to the density
attached to the distance traveled by a walk in the plane with $k-1$ unit steps
in random directions. Finally, we study the challenging case of the $Av(1324)$

moment sequence. Accepting this, we show how rigorous lower bounds on the
growth constant of this sequence can be constructed, which are stronger than
existing bounds. A further unproven assumption leads to even better bounds,
which can be extrapolated to give an estimate of the (unknown) growth constant.

Calculations are then performed with the understanding that they could have

density contrasts, where different types of perturbative expansion are
required, but that the way in which gauges can be chosen in the presence of
such structures is severely constrained. In particular, most gauges that are
commonly considered in the cosmology literature are found to be unviable in the
presence of non-linear structures. This includes spatially flat gauge,
synchronous gauge, comoving orthogonal gauge, total matter gauge, N-body gauge,
and the uniform density gauge. In contrast, we find that the longitudinal gauge

energy landscape (EL) techniques have been used to establish slow motion of
orbits near low-energy manifold. We show that both methods are applicable to
flows induced by families of gradients and compare the scope and specificity of
the results. The SRN techniques capture the flow in a thinner neighborhood of
the manifold, affording a leading order representation of the slow flow via as
projection of the flow onto the tangent plane of the manifold. The SRN approach
requires a spectral gap in the linearization of the full gradient flow about
the points on the low-energy manifold. We provide conditions on the choice of
gradient under which the spectral gap is preserved, and show that up to
reparameterization the slow flow is invariant under these choices of gradients.
The EL methods estimate the magnitude of the slow flow, but cannot capture its
leading order form. However the EL only requires normal coercivity for the
second variation of the energy, and does not require spectral conditions on the
linearization of the full flow. It thus applies to a much larger class of
gradients of a given energy. We develop conditions under which the assumptions
of the SRN method imply the applicability of the EL method, and identify a
large family of gradients for which the EL methods apply. In particular we
apply both approaches to derive the interaction of multi-pulse solutions within
the 1+1D Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) gradient flow, deriving gradient
invariance for a class of gradients arising from powers of a homogeneous
differential operator.

using coded caching, but to obtain this most existing centralized coded caching
schemes require that the files at the server be divisible into a large number
of parts (this number is called subpacketization). In fact, most schemes
require the subpacketization to be growing asymptotically as exponential in
$\sqrt[\leftroot{-1}\uproot{1}r]{K}$ for some positive integer $r$ and $K$
being the number of users. On the other extreme, few schemes having
subpacketization linear in $K$ are known; however, they require large number of
users to exist, or they offer only little gain in the rate. In this work, we
propose two new centralized coded caching schemes with low subpacketization and
moderate rate gains utilizing projective geometries over finite fields. Both
the schemes achieve the same asymptotic subpacketization, which is exponential
in $O((\log K)^2)$ (thus improving on the $\sqrt[\leftroot{-1}\uproot{1}r]{K}$
exponent). The first scheme has a larger cache requirement but has at most a
constant rate (with increasing $K$), while the second has small cache
requirement but has a larger rate. As a special case of our second scheme, we
get a new linear subpacketization scheme, which has a more flexible range of
parameters than the existing linear subpacketization schemes. Extending our
techniques, we also obtain low subpacketization schemes for other
multi-receiver settings such as distributed computing and the cache-aided
interference channel. We validate the performance of all our schemes via
extensive numerical comparisons. For a special class of symmetric caching

relatively bluer rest-frame UV slopes (as parametrised by beta), given their
high values of the 'infrared excess' (IRX=L_IR/L_UV), relative to the average

of the underlying stellar populations but we find that the main reason behind
the unusually blue UV slopes are the relatively shallow slopes of the
corresponding dust attenuation curves. We show that, when stellar masses are
being established via SED fitting, it is absolutely crucial to allow the
attenuation curves to vary (rather than fixing it on Calzetti-like law), where
we find that the inappropriate curves may underestimate the resulting stellar
masses by a factor of ~2-3x on average. In addition, we find these LBGs to have
relatively high specific star-formation rates (sSFRs), dominated by the dust
component, as quantified via the fraction of obscured star formation ( f_obs =
SFR_IR/SFR_(UV+IR)). We conclude that the ALMA-bright LBGs are, by selection,
massive galaxies undergoing a burst of a star formation (large sSFRs, driven,
for example, by secular or merger processes), with a likely geometrical
disconnection of the dust and stars, responsible for producing shallow dust

The theory provides a good analytical description of the Eliashberg function

disentangle the effects of transverse and longitudinal excitations on the

  Circular data",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  CircSpaceTime is the only R package currently available that implements
Bayesian models for spatial and spatio-temporal interpolation of circular data.
Such data are often found in applications where, among the many, wind
directions, animal movement directions, and wave directions are involved. To
analyze such data we need models for observations at locations s and times t,
as the so-called geostatistical models, providing structured dependence assumed
to decay in distance and time. The approach we take begins with Gaussian
processes defined for linear variables over space and time. Then, we use either
wrapping or projection to obtain processes for circular data. The models are
cast as hierarchical, with fitting and inference within a Bayesian framework.
Altogether, this package implements work developed by a series of papers; the
most relevant being Jona Lasinio, Gelfand, and Jona Lasinio (2012); Wang and
Gelfand (2014); Mastrantonio, Jona Lasinio, and Gelfand (2016). All procedures
are written using Rcpp. Estimates are obtained by MCMC allowing parallelized
multiple chains run. The implementation of the proposed models is considerably
improved on the simple routines adopted in the research papers. As original
running examples, for the spatial and spatio-temporal settings, we use wind
directions datasets over central Italy.

perturbations in the presence of anisotropic non-Gaussianity. This class of
induced tensor modes arises on superhorizon scales through the intrinsic
quadrupole coupling between long modes and short modes. Scalar perturbations on
all scales from the inflationary Hubble radius to the Silk damping scale at
recombination contribute to the induced tensor powerspectrum at the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) scale. In addition, the induced tensor spectrum
becomes almost scale-invariant. The former property suggests that measurements
of the CMB offer a test of tiny scale physics. However, the latter implies the
secondary effect may contaminate the primordial tensor spectrum, which tells us
the energy scale of inflation. We derive the induced tensor modes originated
from two concrete examples of anisotropic non-Gaussianity; statistically
anisotropic scalar non-Gaussianity and scalar-scalar-tensor non-Gaussianity,
and discuss observational consequences of extremely short scale physics. Also,
we comment on various possibilities of enhancing the induced spectrum with

methodology for distributional modeling and probabilistic forecasting of
circular response variables is rather limited. Most of the existing methods are
built on the framework of generalized linear and additive models, which are
often challenging to optimize and to interpret. Therefore, we suggest circular
regression trees and random forests as an intuitive alternative approach that
is relatively easy to fit. Building on previous ideas for trees modeling
circular means, we suggest a distributional approach for both trees and forests
yielding probabilistic forecasts based on the von Mises distribution. The
resulting tree-based models simplify the estimation process by using the
available covariates for partitioning the data into sufficiently homogeneous
subgroups so that a simple von Mises distribution without further covariates
can be fitted to the circular response in each subgroup. These circular
regression trees are straightforward to interpret, can capture nonlinear
effects and interactions, and automatically select the relevant covariates that
are associated with either location and/or scale changes in the von Mises
distribution. Combining an ensemble of circular regression trees to a circular
regression forest yields a local adaptive likelihood estimator for the von
Mises distribution that can regularize and smooth the covariate effects. The
new methods are evaluated in a case study on probabilistic wind direction
forecasting at two Austrian airports, considering other common approaches as a
benchmark.

$\mathcal{D}_{\text{sh}}$. There were, however, few known games related to
Steiner systems like the hexad game. For a given Steiner system, we construct a
game whose $\mathscr{P}$-position set is its block set.
  By using constructed games, we obtain the following two results. First, we
characterize $\mathcal{D}_{\text{sh}}$ among the 5040 isomorphic $S(5, 6, 12)$
with point set $\{0, 1, \ldots, 11\}$. For each $S(5, 6, 12)$, our construction
produces a game whose $\mathscr{P}$-position set is its block set. From
$\mathcal{D}_{\text{sh}}$, we obtain the hexad game, and this game is
characterized as a unique game with the minimum number of positions among the
obtained 5040 games. Second, we characterize projective Steiner triple systems
by using game distributions. Here, the game distribution of a Steiner system
$\mathcal{D}$ is the frequency distribution of the numbers of positions in
games obtained from Steiner systems isomorphic to $\mathcal{D}$. We find that
the game distribution of an $S(t, t + 1, v)$ can be decomposed into symmetric
components and that a Steiner triple system is projective if and only if its
game distribution has a unique symmetric component.

of the problem definition, rather than serving as prior knowledge which aids
the problem solution. Part III of this monograph starts by addressing ways to
learn graph topology, from the case where the physics of the problem already
suggest a possible topology, through to most general cases where the graph
topology is learned from the data. A particular emphasis is on graph topology
definition based on the correlation and precision matrices of the observed
data, combined with additional prior knowledge and structural conditions, such
as the smoothness or sparsity of graph connections. For learning sparse graphs
(with small number of edges), the least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator, known as LASSO is employed, along with its graph specific variant,
graphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an
intuitive way, and explained. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology
learning paradigm is provided through several examples on physically well
defined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and
computer networks, and spring-mass systems. As many graph neural networks (GNN)
and convolutional graph networks (GCN) are emerging, we have also reviewed the
main trends in GNNs and GCNs, from the perspective of graph signal filtering.
Tensor representation of lattice-structured graphs is next considered, and it
is shown that tensors (multidimensional data arrays) are a special class of
graph signals, whereby the graph vertices reside on a high-dimensional regular
lattice structure. This part of monograph concludes with two emerging
applications in financial data processing and underground transportation
networks modeling.

in place in a curved spacetime, in which the particle is attached to a massless
string and the force is measured by the string's tension. The calculation is
based on the Weyl class of static and axially symmetric spacetimes, and the
presence of the string is manifested by a conical singularity; the tension is
proportional to the angular deficit. A remarkable and appealing aspect of this
approach is that the calculation of the self-force requires no renormalization
of the particle's field. This is in contract with traditional methods, which
incorporate a careful and elaborate subtraction of the singular part of the
field. We implement the approach in a number of different situations. First, we
examine the case of an electric charge in Schwarzschild spacetime, and recover
the classic Smith-Will force in addition to a purely gravitational contribution
to the self-force. Second, we turn to the case of electric and magnetic dipoles
in Schwarzschild spacetime, and correct expressions for the self-force
previously obtained in the literature. Third, we replace the electric charge by
a scalar charge, and recover Wiseman's no-force result, which we generalize to
a scalar dipole. And fourth, we calculate the force exerted on extended bodies
such as Schwarzschild black holes and Janis-Newman-Winicour objects, which
describe scalarized naked singularities.

high-mass stars during their WR phase (i.e. WR stars) and are thus expected to
provide interesting constraints on the stellar Initial Mass Function, massive
star formation, stellar evolution models, etc. Spatially resolved spectroscopy
should in principle provide a more efficient way of identifying WR galaxies
than single-fiber surveys of galactic centers such as SDSS-I & II, as WR stars
should be more preferentially found in discs. Using IFU data from the ongoing
SDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we have performed a thorough search for WR galaxies. We
first identify H II regions in each datacube and carry out full spectral
fitting to the stacked spectra. We then visually inspect the residual spectrum
of each H II region and identify WR regions that present a significant ""blue
bump"" at 4600-4750 A. The resulting WR catalog includes 267 WR regions of
~500pc (radius) sizes, distributed in 90 galaxies from the current sample of
MaNGA (MaNGA Product Launch 7). We find WR regions are exclusively found in
galaxies that show bluest colors and highest star formation rates for their
mass. Most WR galaxies have late-type morphologies and show relatively large
asymmetry in their images, implying that WR regions are more preferentially
found in interacting/merging galaxies. We estimate the stellar mass function of
WR galaxies and the mass-dependent detection rate. The detection rate of WR
galaxies is typically ~2%, with weak dependence on stellar mass. This detection
rate is about 40 times higher than previous studies with SDSS single fiber
data, and by a factor of 2 lower than the CALIFA-based WR catalog. We make
comparisons with SDSS and CALIFA studies, and conclude that different detection
rates can be explained mainly by three factors: spatial coverage, spectral
signal-to-noise ratio, and redshift ranges of the parent sample.

system extends the classic switched system by allowing different subsystem
dimensions. The stability problem of the $M^3D$ system, whose state transitions
at switching instants can be discontinuous due to the dimension-varying
feature, is studied. The discontinuous state transition is formulated by an
affine map that captures both the dimension variations and the state impulses,
with no extra constraint imposed. In the presence of unstable subsystems, the
general criteria featuring a series of Lyapunov-like conditions for the
practical and asymptotic stability properties of the $M^3D$ system are provided
under the proposed slow/fast transition-dependent average dwell time framework.
Then, by considering linear subsystems, we propose a class of parametric
multiple Lyapunov functions to verify the obtained Lyapunov-like stability
conditions and explicitly reveal a connection between the practical/asymptotic
stability property and the non-vanishing/vanishing property of the impulsive
effects in the state transition process. Further, the obtained stability
results for the $M^3D$ system are applied to the consensus problem of the open
multi-agent system (MAS), whose network topology can be switching and
size-varying due to the migrations of agents. It shows that through a proper
transformation, the seeking of the (practical) consensus performance of the
open MAS with disconnected digraphs boils down to that of the (practical)
stability property of an $M^3D$ system with unstable subsystems.

the influence of this liquid penetration of the fabric on droplet spreading on
thin fabric meshes, we measured the droplet spreading ratio on fabric with and
without an underlying substrate using a high-speed camera. For fabrics without
a substrate, the droplet spreading ratio is reduced as the fabric penetration
by the liquid reduces the droplet volume spreading on top of the fabric. Using
entropic lattice Boltzmann simulations, we find that the lower droplet
spreading ratio on fabrics, both with and without a substrate, is due to an
increase of viscous losses inside the droplet during spreading. Comparing

well as continuous decision variables - such as velocity setpoints, control
gains or analogue outputs. However, when defining the corresponding optimal
control or reinforcement learning problem, it is commonly approximated with
fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces. These simplifications aim at
tailoring the problem to a particular algorithm or solver which may only
support one type of action space. Alternatively, expert heuristics are used to
remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous space. In contrast, we
propose to treat hybrid problems in their 'native' form by solving them with
hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and continuous
actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement

the benefits of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly,
hybrid reinforcement learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We
propose reformulating control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve

counterpart of this hairy solution, namely, the rotating Kalb-Ramond black
hole, which encompasses, as special cases, Kerr ($s=0$) and Kerr-Newman ($s=1$)

there exists an extremal value of the Kalb-Ramond parameter ($s=s_{e}$), which
corresponds to an extremal black hole with degenerate horizons, while for
$s<s_{e}$, it describes a nonextremal black hole with Cauchy and event
horizons, and no black hole for $s>s_{e}$. We find that the extremal value
$s_e$ is also influenced by these parameters. The black hole shadow size
decreases monotonically and the shape gets more distorted with an increasing

distorted than the corresponding Kerr black hole shadows. We investigate the

presents the Gordon growth model (Gordon 1962) with some of its extensions

construct the true vacuum state of a lattice Schwinger model using adiabatic

the fermion mass operator with respect to the vacuum. Upon taking a continuum

small mass regime and deviations in large mass regime. We estimate
computational costs required to take a reasonable continuum limit. Our results
imply that digital quantum simulation is already useful tool to explore
non-perturbative aspects of gauge theories with real time and topological

  (https://fc21.ifca.ai/program.php#abstract-talk-66)",,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Although blockchains aim for immutability as their core feature, several
instances have exposed the harms with perfect immutability. The permanence of
illicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement
agencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart
contracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable
blockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents
from both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the
existing proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and
cannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.
  We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable
layer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy
contracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates
additional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable
security guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains
and start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may
propose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that
complies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable.
  Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements,
does not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be
efficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate
it by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS
and PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum
mainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs
is almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity
Multisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that
can be retrieved after the fix.

  Recorded Prostate Cancer Mortality","20 pages, 5 figures",,,,"q-bio.PE q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: Although recorded cancer mortality should include both deaths
from cancer and deaths from cancer treatment, there is evidence suggesting that
the measure may be incomplete. To investigate the completeness of recorded
prostate cancer mortality, we compared other-cause (non-prostate cancer)
mortality in men found and not found to have prostate cancer following a needle
biopsy.
  Methods: We linked Medicare claims data to SEER data to analyze survival in
the population of men aged 65+ enrolled in Medicare who resided in a SEER area
and received a needle biopsy in 1993-2001. We compared other-cause mortality in
men found to have prostate cancer (n=53,462) to that in men not found to have
prostate cancer (n=103,659).
  Results: The age-race adjusted other-cause mortality rate was 471 per 10,000
person-years in men found to have prostate cancer vs. 468 per 10,000 in men not
found to have prostate cancer (RR = 1.01;95% CI:0.98-1.03). The effect was
modified, however, by age. The RR declined in a stepwise fashion from 1.08 (95%
CI:1.03-1.14) in men age 65-69 to 0.89 (95% CI:0.83-0.95) in men age 85 and
older. If the excess (or deficit) in other-cause mortality were added to the
recorded prostate cancer mortality, prostate cancer mortality would rise 23% in
the youngest age group (from 90 to 111 per 10,000) and would fall 30% in the
oldest age group (from 551 to 388 per 10,000).
  Conclusion: Although recorded prostate cancer mortality appears to be an
accurate measure overall, it systematically underestimates the mortality
associated with prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment in younger men and
overestimates it in the very old. We surmise that in younger men
treatment-related deaths are incompletely captured in recorded prostate cancer
mortality, while in older men the diagnosis ""sticks""-- once diagnosed, they are
more likely to be said to have died from the disease.

cooling stages, it is of great interest to calculate inhomogeneous hot and cold
nuclear matter in a variety of phases. The finite-temperature
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (FT-HFB) theory is a primary choice for this purpose,
however, its numerical calculation for superfluid (superconducting)
many-fermion systems in three dimensions requires enormous computational costs.
To study a variety of phases in the crust of hot and cold neutron stars, we
propose an efficient method to perform the FT-HFB calculation with the
three-dimensional (3D) coordinate-space representation. Recently, an efficient
method based on the contour integral of Green's function with the shifted
conjugate-orthogonal conjugate-gradient method has been proposed [Phys. Rev. C
95, 044302 (2017)]. We extend the method to the finite temperature, using the
shifted conjugate-orthogonal conjugate-residual method. We benchmark the 3D
coordinate-space solver of the FT-HFB calculation for hot isolated nuclei and
fcc phase in the inner crust of neutron stars at finite temperature. The
computational performance of the present method is demonstrated. Different
critical temperatures of the quadrupole and the octupole deformations are
confirmed for $^{146}$Ba. The robustness of the shape coexistence feature in
$^{184}$Hg is examined. For the neutron-star crust, the deformed neutron-rich
Se nuclei embedded in the sea of superfluid low-density neutrons appear in the
fcc phase at the nucleon density of 0.045 fm$^{-3}$ and the temperature of $k_B
T=200$ keV. The efficiency of the developed solver is demonstrated for nuclei
and inhomogeneous nuclear matter at finite temperature. It may provide a
standard tool for nuclear physics, especially for the structure of the hot and
cold neutron-star matters.

state in the continuum (BIC) is a guided Bloch mode with a frequency in the
radiation continuum. Optical BICs have found many applications, mainly because
they give rise to resonances with ultra-high quality factors. If the periodic
structure has a relevant symmetry, a BIC may have a symmetry mismatch with
incoming and outgoing propagating waves of the same frequency and compatible
wavevectors, and is considered as protected by symmetry. Propagating BICs with
nonzero Bloch wavevectors have been found on many highly symmetric periodic
structures. They are not protected by symmetry in the usual sense (i.e., there
is no symmetry mismatch), but some of them seem to depend on symmetry for their
existence and robustness. In this paper, we show that the low-frequency
propagating BICs (with only one radiation channel) on biperiodic structures
with an inversion symmetry in the plane of periodicity and a reflection
symmetry in the perpendicular direction are robust to symmetry-preserving
structural perturbations. In other words, a propagating BIC continues its
existence with a slightly different frequency and a slightly different Bloch
wavevector, when the biperiodic structure is perturbed slightly preserving the
inversion and reflection symmetries. Our study enhances theoretical
understanding for BICs on periodic structures and provides useful guidelines
for their applications.

vector, which helps the model to normalize the speaker variations. The SAST
model trained in this way becomes independent of specific training speakers and
thus generalizes better to unseen testing speakers. We investigate different

Moreover, we analyze the influence of the training loss function and the firing
threshold of the penultimate layer, which indicates a ""trap"" region under the
cross-entropy loss that can be escaped by threshold tuning. Extensive
experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our solution.
Besides the quantitative analysis of the influence factors, we evidence that

reveal what happens in SNN attack and might stimulate more research on the

system vibrations and noise generation mechanisms. Machine learning-based
methods to detect and characterize vibrations, to understand sensitivities and
to predict brake squeal are applied with the aim to illustrate how
interdisciplinary approaches can leverage the potential of data science
techniques for classical mechanical engineering challenges. In the first part,
a deep learning brake squeal detector is developed to identify several classes
of typical friction noise recordings. The detection method is rooted in recent
computer vision techniques for object detection based on convolutional neural
networks. It allows to overcome limitations of classical approaches that solely
rely on instantaneous spectral properties of the recorded noise. Results
indicate superior detection and characterization quality when compared to a
state-of-the-art brake squeal detector. In the second part, a recurrent neural
network is employed to learn the parametric patterns that determine the dynamic
stability of an operating brake system. Given a set of multivariate loading
conditions, the RNN learns to predict the noise generation of the structure.
The validated RNN represents a virtual twin model for the squeal behavior of a
specific brake system. It is found that this model can predict the occurrence
and the onset of brake squeal with high accuracy and that it can identify the
complicated patterns and temporal dependencies in the loading conditions that
drive the dynamical structure into regimes of instability.

examining the contributions made to the Great Recession of the late 2000s by
each of the explanatory variables. We disaggregate private sector debt into its
household and non-financial corporate components. We find that both household
and non-financial corporate debt were key determinants of the Great Recession.
We find a considerable degree of non-linearity in the explanatory models. In
contrast, the public sector debt to GDP ratio appears to have made very little
contribution. It did rise sharply during the Great Recession, but this was as a
consequence of the sharp fall in economic activity rather than it being a
cause. We obtain similar results for both the United States and the United
Kingdom.

have been extensively studied at large-scale plasma boundaries, in
quasi-symmetric and asymmetric configurations in the terrestrial magnetotail
and at the magnetopause. Recent high-resolution observations by MMS
(Magnetospheric Multiscale) spacecraft indicate that MR can occur also in the
magnetosheath where the conditions are highly turbulent when the upstream shock
geometry is quasi-parallel. The strong turbulent motions make the boundary
conditions for evolving MR complicated. In this paper it is demonstrated that
the wave observations in localized regions of MR can serve as an additional
diagnostic tool reinforcing our capacity for identifying MR events in turbulent
plasmas. It is shown that in a close resemblance with MR at large-scale
boundaries, turbulent reconnection associated whistler waves occur at
separatrix/outflow regions and at the outer boundary of the electron diffusion
region, while lower hybrid drift waves are associated with density gradients
during the crossing of the current sheet. The lower hybrid drift instability
can make the density inhomogeneities rippled. The identification of MR
associated waves in the magnetosheath represents also an important milestone
for developing a better understanding of energy redistribution and dissipation
in turbulent plasmas.

  2015 (ISBN: 978-1-4822-1485-7)",,,,"stat.AP eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cognitive Radio (CR) networks presents a paradigm shift aiming to alleviate
the spectrum scarcity problem exasperated by the increasing demand on this
limited resource. It promotes dynamic spectrum access, cooperation among
heterogeneous devices, and spectrum sharing. Spectrum sensing is a key
cognitive radio functionality, which entails scanning the RF spectrum to unveil
underutilised spectral bands for opportunistic use. To achieve higher data
rates while maintaining high quality of service QoS, effective wideband
spectrum sensing routines are crucial due to their capability of achieving
spectral awareness over wide frequency range(s)\ and efficiently harnessing the
available opportunities. However, implementing wideband sensing under stringent
size, weight, power and cost requirements (e.g., for portable devices) brings
formidable design challenges such as addressing potential prohibitively high
complexity and data acquisition rates. This article gives a survey of various
wideband spectrum sensing approaches outlining their advantages and
limitations; special attention is paid to approaches that utilise sub-Nyquist
sampling techniques. Other aspects of CR such as cooperative sensing and
performance requirements are briefly addressed. Comparison between sub-Nyquist
sensing approaches is also presented.

potential of this method is illustrated with respect to the analyses of
clusterless uniform and normal distributions of points, as well as a
one-dimensional clustering model characterized by two intervals with high

method is then considered as a means of feature selection and cluster
identification, and two simple but potentially effective respective methods are
described and illustrated with respect to some hypothetical situations.

may impair a person's movement, speech and visual functions. Diagnosis of MS
typically involves a combination of complex clinical assessments and tests to

smartphone monitoring in free-living conditions, could potentially aid in
objectively assessing the symptoms of MS by quantifying symptom presence and
intensity over long periods of time. Here, we present a deep-learning approach
to diagnosing MS from smartphone-derived digital biomarkers that uses a novel
combination of a multilayer perceptron with neural soft attention to improve
learning of patterns in long-term smartphone monitoring data. Using data from a
cohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are
able to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88). Our
experimental results indicate that digital biomarkers derived from smartphone
