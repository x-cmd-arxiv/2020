  A Clinical Workflow Simulation",,,,,"cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The aim is to evaluate whether smart worklist prioritization by artificial
intelligence (AI) can optimize the radiology workflow and reduce report
turnaround times (RTAT) for critical findings in chest radiographs (CXRs).
Furthermore, we investigate a method to counteract the effect of false negative
predictions by AI -- resulting in an extremely and dangerously long RTAT, as
CXRs are sorted to the end of the worklist.
  We developed a simulation framework that models the current workflow at a
university hospital by incorporating hospital specific CXR generation rates,
reporting rates and pathology distribution. Using this, we simulated the
standard worklist processing ""first-in, first-out"" (FIFO) and compared it with
a worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was
performed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked
in descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate,
congestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. Furthermore, we
introduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest
urgency is assigned to the examination.
  The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all
Prioritization-simulations compared to the FIFO-simulation (e.g. pneumothorax:
35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p $<0.0001$), while the maximum RTAT for most findings
increased at the same time (e.g. pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p
$<0.0001$). Our ""upper limit"" substantially reduced the maximum RTAT all
classes (e.g. pneumothorax: 979 min vs. 1293 min / 1178 min; p $<0.0001$).
  Our simulations demonstrate that smart worklist prioritization by AI can
reduce the average RTAT for critical findings in CXRs while maintaining a small
maximum RTAT as FIFO.

Moreover, we obtain conditions for the existence of an orbitally stable

successfully applied for the prediction of NICS in this series of molecules,
including some non-planar ones containing 5- and 7-membered rings. This model,

supply the hot water demand for domestic use in houses. These systems (e.g. gas

heat up water and store this hot water for supplying the domestic demands. The
latter allows to some extent a decoupling of the heat production from the heat
demand. We focus on the situation where each heating system has its own demand
and buffer and the supply of the heating systems is coming from a common
source. In practice, the common source may lead to a coupling of the planning
for the group of heating systems. The bottleneck to supply the energy may be
the capacity of the distribution system (e.g. the electricity networks or the
gas network). As this has to be dimensioned for the maximal consumption, it is
important to minimize the maximal peak. This planning problem is known to be
\NP-hard. We present polynomial-time approximation algorithms for four variants

the conditions under which the broken translation symmetry along a rough
surface may be restored. This symmetry has often been presumed in existing work
but not always with proper justifications. Another one relates to the physical
meaning of a phenomenological parameter (denoted by $p$) intuitively introduced

experimental studies of surface roughness but has so far lacked a rigorous

incrementally learning tasks causes artificial neural networks to overwrite
relevant information learned about older tasks, resulting in 'Catastrophic
Forgetting'. Efforts to overcome this phenomenon often utilize resources
poorly, for instance, by growing the network architecture or needing to save
parametric importance scores, or violate data privacy between tasks. To tackle
this, we propose SPACE, an algorithm that enables a network to learn
continually and efficiently by partitioning the learnt space into a Core space,
that serves as the condensed knowledge base over previously learned tasks, and
a Residual space, which is akin to a scratch space for learning the current
task. After learning each task, the Residual is analyzed for redundancy, both
within itself and with the learnt Core space. A minimal number of extra
dimensions required to explain the current task are added to the Core space and
the remaining Residual is freed up for learning the next task. We evaluate our
algorithm on P-MNIST, CIFAR and a sequence of 8 different datasets, and achieve
comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art methods while overcoming
catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, our algorithm is well suited for
practical use. The partitioning algorithm analyzes all layers in one shot,
ensuring scalability to deeper networks. Moreover, the analysis of dimensions
translates to filter-level sparsity, and the structured nature of the resulting
architecture gives us up to 5x improvement in energy efficiency during task
inference over the current state-of-the-art.

However, validating programs on NISQ devices is difficult due to fluctuations

modeling by decomposing an application-specific circuit into a series of

a composite model for the original noisy quantum circuit as well as other

superconducting transmon devices running applications of GHZ-state preparation

find that the composite model works well across multiple circuit instances. In
addition, these characterizations are computationally efficient and offer a
trade-off in model complexity that can be tailored to the desired predictive
accuracy.

students also note interdisciplinary connections between electrodynamic

method to extract the diffuse $y_{\rm sz}$ signal. Our $Stack$ $First$ approach
makes the component separation a lot easier as the stacking greatly suppresses
the noise and CMB contributions while the dust foreground becomes homogeneous
in spectral-domain across the stacked patch. Thus one component, the CMB, is
removed while the rest of the foregrounds are made simpler even before
component separation algorithm is applied. We obtain the WHIM signal of $y_{\rm
whim}=(3.78\pm 0.37)\times 10^{-8}$ in the gas filaments, accounting for the
electron overdensity of $\sim 13$. We estimate the detection significance to be
$\gtrsim 10.2\sigma$. This excess $y_{\rm sz}$ signal is tracing the warm-hot
intergalactic medium and it could account for most of the missing baryons of
the Universe. We show that the $Stack$ $First$ approach is more robust to
systematics and produces a cleaner signal compared to the methods relying on
stacking the $y$-maps to detect weak tSZ signal currently being used by the
cosmology community.

that tissue homeostasis in the adult skin can be represented as a critical
branching process. The homeostatic condition requires that the proliferation
rate of the progenitor (P) cells (capable of cell division) is counterbalanced
by the loss rate due to the differentiation of a P cell into differentiated (D)
cells so that the total number of P cells remains constant. We consider the
two-branch and three-branch models of tissue homeostasis to establish
homeostasis as a critical phenomenon. It is first shown that some critical
branching process theorems correctly predict experimental observations. A
number of temporal signatures of the approach to criticality are investigated
based on simulation and analytical results. The analogy between a critical
branching process and mean-field percolation and sandpile models is invoked to
show that the size and lifetime distributions of the populations of P cells
have power-law forms. The associated critical exponents have the same
magnitudes as in the cases of the mean-field lattice statistical models. The
results indicate that tissue homeostasis provides experimental opportunities
for testing critical phenomena.

control theory and applications. Broadly speaking, if the system $\dot{x} =
f(x,u)$ is locally asymptotically stabilizable, then there exists a feedback
control $u(x)$ ensuring the convergence to an equilibrium for any trajectory
starting from a point sufficiently close to the equilibrium state. In this
paper, we develop a reasonably natural and general composition operator
approach to stabilizability. To begin with, we provide an extension of the
classical Hautus lemma to the generalized context of composition operators and
show that Brockett's theorem is still necessary for local asymptotic
stabilizability in this generalized framework. Further, we employ a powerful
version of the implicit function theorem--as given by Jittorntrum and
Kumagai--to cover stabilization without differentiability requirements in this
expanded context. Employing the obtained characterizations, we establish
relationships between stabilizability in the conventional sense and in the
generalized composition operator sense. This connection allows us to show that
the stabilizability of a control system is equivalent to the stability of an
associated system. That is, we reduce the question of stabilizability to that
of stability.

influence exotic correlated phenomena in solids, such as high-temperature

Fermi surfaces is generally difficult in the strongly correlated systems, a
direct link between the Lifshitz transition and quantum phenomena has been
elusive so far. Here, we report a marked impact of the pressure-induced
Lifshitz transition on thermoelectric performance for SnSe, a promising
thermoelectric material without strong electron correlation. By applying
pressure up to 1.6 GPa, we have observed a large enhancement of thermoelectric
power factor by more than 100% over a wide temperature range (10-300 K).
Furthermore, the high carrier mobility enables the detection of quantum
oscillations of resistivity, revealing the emergence of new Fermi pockets at
~0.86 GPa. The observed thermoelectric properties linked to the multi-valley
band structure are quantitatively reproduced by first-principles calculations,
providing novel insight into designing the SnSe-related materials for potential

an automatic clustering analysis with improved clustering retrievals. We
validated the {\it InfoGuide} hypothesis by capturing the traces of information
gain using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and comparing the clusters

internal metrics in artificially-generated, benchmarks, and real-world

variability studies on 15 minute time bins, and over three X-ray bands (3-7

VHE) gamma-ray bands (0.2-0.4 TeV, 0.4-0.8 TeV and >0.8 TeV). We detected
substantial flux variations on multi-hour and sub-hour timescales in all the
X-ray and VHE gamma-ray bands. The characteristics of the sub-hour flux
variations are essentially energy-independent, while the multi-hour flux
variations can have a strong dependence on the energy of the X-ray and the VHE
gamma rays. The three VHE bands and the three X-ray bands are positively
correlated with no time-lag, but the strength and the characteristics of the
correlation changes substantially over time and across energy bands. Our
findings favour multi-zone scenarios for explaining the achromatic/chromatic
variability of the fast/slow components of the light curves, as well as the
changes in the flux-flux correlation on day-long timescales. We interpret these
results within a magnetic reconnection scenario, where the multi-hour flux
variations are dominated by the combined emission from various plasmoids of
different sizes and velocities, while the sub-hour flux variations are
dominated by the emission from a single small plasmoid moving across the
magnetic reconnection layer.

  Data Compression",,,,,"cs.IT cs.DS math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper addresses the problem of data compression with local decoding and
local update. A compression scheme has worst-case local decoding $d_{wc}$ if
any bit of the raw file can be recovered by probing at most $d_{wc}$ bits of
the compressed sequence, and has update efficiency of $u_{wc}$ if a single bit
of the raw file can be updated by modifying at most $u_{wc}$ bits of the
compressed sequence. This article provides an entropy-achieving compression
scheme for memoryless sources that simultaneously achieves $ O(\log\log n) $
local decoding and update efficiency. Key to this achievability result is a
novel succinct data structure for sparse sequences which allows efficient local
decoding and local update. Under general assumptions on the local decoder and
update algorithms, a converse result shows that $d_{wc}$ and $u_{wc}$ must grow
as $ \Omega(\log\log n) $.

  Camera-based Batch Normalization",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fundamental difficulty in person re-identification (ReID) lies in
learning the correspondence among individual cameras. It strongly demands
costly inter-camera annotations, yet the trained models are not guaranteed to
transfer well to previously unseen cameras. These problems significantly limit
the application of ReID. This paper rethinks the working mechanism of
conventional ReID approaches and puts forward a new solution. With an effective
operator named Camera-based Batch Normalization (CBN), we force the image data
of all cameras to fall onto the same subspace, so that the distribution gap
between any camera pair is largely shrunk. This alignment brings two benefits.
First, the trained model enjoys better abilities to generalize across scenarios
with unseen cameras as well as transfer across multiple training sets. Second,
we can rely on intra-camera annotations, which have been undervalued before due
to the lack of cross-camera information, to achieve competitive ReID
performance. Experiments on a wide range of ReID tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

  Density Estimation",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modelling highly multi-modal data is a challenging problem in machine
learning. Most algorithms are based on maximizing the likelihood, which
corresponds to the M(oment)-projection of the data distribution to the model
distribution. The M-projection forces the model to average over modes it cannot
represent. In contrast, the I(information)-projection ignores such modes in the
data and concentrates on the modes the model can represent. Such behavior is
appealing whenever we deal with highly multi-modal data where modelling single
modes correctly is more important than covering all the modes. Despite this
advantage, the I-projection is rarely used in practice due to the lack of
algorithms that can efficiently optimize it based on data. In this work, we
present a new algorithm called Expected Information Maximization (EIM) for
computing the I-projection solely based on samples for general latent variable
models, where we focus on Gaussian mixtures models and Gaussian mixtures of
experts. Our approach applies a variational upper bound to the I-projection
objective which decomposes the original objective into single objectives for
each mixture component as well as for the coefficients, allowing an efficient
optimization. Similar to GANs, our approach employs discriminators but uses a
more stable optimization procedure, using a tight upper bound. We show that our
algorithm is much more effective in computing the I-projection than recent GAN
approaches and we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for modelling
multi-modal behavior on two pedestrian and traffic prediction datasets.

fraction of its star's, turbulence generated by gravitational instability (GI)
should feature significantly in the disk's evolution. At the same time, the
disk may be sufficiently ionised for magnetic fields to play some role in the
dynamics. Though usually neglected, the impact of magnetism on the GI may be
critical, with consequences for several processes: the efficiency of accretion,
spiral structure formation, fragmentation, and the dynamics of solids. In this
paper, we report on global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations
of a self-gravitating protoplanetary disk using the meshless finite mass (MFM)
Lagrangian technique. We confirm that GI spiral waves trigger a dynamo that
amplifies an initial magnetic field to nearly thermal amplitudes (plasma beta <
10), an order of magnitude greater than that generated by the
magneto-rotational instability alone. We also determine the dynamo's nonlinear
back reaction on the gravitoturbulent flow: the saturated state is
substantially hotter, with an associated larger Toomre parameter and weaker,
more 'flocculent' spirals. But perhaps of greater import is the dynamo's
boosting of accretion via a significant Maxwell stress; mass accretion is
enhanced by factors of several relative to either pure GI or pure MRI. Our
simulations use ideal MHD, an admittedly poor approximation in protoplanetary
disks, and thus future studies should explore the full gamut of non-ideal MHD.
In preparation for that, we exhibit a small number of Ohmic runs that reveal
that the dynamo, if anything, is stronger in a non-ideal environment. This work
confirms that magnetic fields are a potentially critical ingredient in
gravitoturbulent young disks, possibly controlling their evolution, especially
via their enhancement of (potentially episodic) accretion.

the peak shifts to smaller scale factors for negative values of $n$. This is
related to the fact that the growth of structures in the HI density field can
significantly slow down even before the onset of $\Lambda$ domination in
presence of a strong time evolution of the HI bias. We find that the shift is
linearly related to the index $n$. We obtain the best fit relation between

detection, such as disasters, and as a potential resource for crisis management
resource allocation. There have been some recent works on leveraging social
media sources for retrospective, after-the-fact event detection of large events
such as earthquakes or hurricanes. Similarly, there is a long history of using
traditional physical sensors such as climate satellites to perform regional
event detection. However, combining social media with corroborative physical
sensors for real-time, accurate, and global physical detection has remained
unexplored.
  This paper presents EventMapper, a framework to support event recognition of
small yet equally costly events (landslides, flooding, wildfires). EventMapper
integrates high-latency, high-accuracy corroborative sources such as physical
sensors with low-latency, noisy probabilistic sources such as social media
streams to deliver real-time, global event recognition. Furthermore,
EventMapper is resilient to the concept drift phenomenon, where machine
learning models require continuous fine-tuning to maintain high performance.
  By exploiting the common features of probabilistic and corroborative sources,
EventMapper automates machine learning model updates, maintenance, and
fine-tuning. We describe three applications built on EventMapper for landslide,
wildfire, and flooding detection.

accurately determine without making strong assumptions about mass loss,
convection, and rotation. Binaries would produce a wider range of RSG $M_{\rm

optical effects giving rise to a rich phenomenology, this regime introduces
significant theoretical challenges. One of the most important is the break-down
of the rotating-wave approximation which neglects all non-resonant terms in
light-matter interaction Hamiltonians. Consequently, a large part of the
quantum optical theoretical framework has to be revisited in order to
accurately account for all interaction terms in this regime. We give in this

guaranteed to decrease diversity. Better yet, when biological similarity is
quantified by $k$-mer co-occurrence (a popular notion in bioinformatics),
minimizing diversity actually reduces to one linear program that can utilize
multiple $k$-mer sizes to enhance performance. In proof-of-concept experiments,
we verify that the latter procedure can lead to significant gains when
taxonomically profiling a metagenomic sample, both in terms of reconstruction
accuracy and computational performance. Reproducible code is available at

Adversaries in a distributed system deliberately send erroneous data in order

proposed Lagrange Coded Computing (LCC) can be extremely low if the degree of
the polynomial is high. We propose three different schemes called \emph{coded

velocities (v sin i) to construct rotation-activity correlations (RAC) in K-M
dwarfs. The RAC slopes were used to argue that a transition between dynamo
modes occurs at a spectral type between M2 and M3. H17 suggested that the
dynamo transition corresponds to a transition to complete convection (TTCC). An
independent study of GAIA data led Jao et al (2018) to suggest that the TTCC
sets in near M3.0V, close to the H17 result. However, the changes in a star
which cause TTCC signatures in GAIA data might not lead to changes in CaII
emission at an identical spectral type: the latter are also affected by
magnetic effects which depend on certain properties of convection in the core.
Here, we use CaII emission fluxes in a sample of ~600 M dwarfs, and attempt to
narrow down the transition from one dynamo mode to another: rather than relying
on RAC slopes, we quantify how the CaII emission flux varies with spectral type
to identify steps where the flux decreases significantly across a narrow range
of spectral types. We suggest that the dynamo mode transition may be narrowed
down to between M2.1 and M2.3. This is close to, but earlier than, the TTCC
location identified by Jao et al (2018). We suggest that the transition in
dynamo mode may be related to the existence of a small convective core which
occurs for a finite time interval in certain low mass stars.

solve the perception, decision and control problems in an integrated way, which

However, existing end-to-end approaches are often lack of interpretability, and

propose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end
autonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A
sequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the
reinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask
can be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate
property in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the
behaviors of learned policy. The latent space also significantly reduces the
sample complexity of reinforcement learning. Comparison tests with a simulated
autonomous car in CARLA show that the performance of our method in urban
scenarios with crowded surrounding vehicles dominates many baselines including
DQN, DDPG, TD3 and SAC. Moreover, through masked outputs, the learned policy is
able to provide a better explanation of how the car reasons about the driving

retrieves the model-confident alignments from the predicted results and then
incorporates them as additional knowledge to resolve the remaining

holds in the general case, that is even if the compactification gives rise to a

the feature distribution across domains. In this work, we address the problem

core idea is to use feature-wise transformation layers for augmenting the image
features using affine transforms to simulate various feature distributions
under different domains in the training stage. To capture variations of the
feature distributions under different domains, we further apply a
learning-to-learn approach to search for the hyper-parameters of the
feature-wise transformation layers. We conduct extensive experiments and
ablation studies under the domain generalization setting using five few-shot

Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed feature-wise transformation

$\theta$, starting in a natural halfspace $H$, for the hyperplane at distance

distributed users aim to jointly train a machine learning model with the help
of a parameter server (PS). In each iteration of FL, users compute local
gradients, followed by transmission of the quantized gradients for subsequent
aggregation and model updates at PS. One of the challenges of FL is that of
communication overhead due to FL's iterative nature and large model sizes. One
recent direction to alleviate communication bottleneck in FL is to let users
communicate simultaneously over a multiple access channel (MAC), possibly
making better use of the communication resources.
  In this paper, we consider the problem of FL learning over a MAC. In
particular, we focus on the design of digital gradient transmission schemes
over a MAC, where gradients at each user are first quantized, and then
transmitted over a MAC to be decoded individually at the PS. When designing
digital FL schemes over MACs, there are new opportunities to assign different
amount of resources (such as rate or bandwidth) to different users based on a)
the informativeness of the gradients at each user, and b) the underlying
channel conditions. We propose a stochastic gradient quantization scheme, where
the quantization parameters are optimized based on the capacity region of the
MAC. We show that such channel aware quantization for FL outperforms uniform
quantization, particularly when users experience different channel conditions,
and when have gradients with varying levels of informativeness.

physically motivated model of galaxy formation that reproduces the observed
abundance of faint galaxies in the nearby Universe is also consistent with
available observational constraints on the reionization history. By interfacing
the Santa Cruz semi-analytic model for galaxy formation with an analytic
reionization model, we constructed a computationally efficient pipeline that
connects `ground-level' galaxy formation physics to `top-level'
cosmological-scale observables. Based on photometric properties of the galaxy
populations predicted up to $z=15$, we compute the reionization history of
intergalactic hydrogen. We quantify the three degenerate quantities that
influence the total ionizing photon budget, including the abundance of
galaxies, the intrinsic production rate of ionizing photons, and the LyC escape
fraction. We explore covariances between these quantities using a Markov chain
Monte Carlo method. We find that our locally calibrated model is consistent
with all currently available constraints on the reionization history, under
reasonable assumptions about the LyC escape fraction. We quantify the fraction

$M_\mathrm{BH} =(2.9 \pm 0.4) 10^9 M_\odot$; the mass models without a central

within the intrinsic scatter of the SMBH and galaxy scaling relations, unlike
three other galaxies hosting $\gtrsim 10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBHs in the MASSIVE

Gauss-Hermite expansion of the line-of-sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs),
which are used as constraints in the orbit modeling. The stellar orbits in the
mass models are further constrained to produce negligible $h_9$ through
$h_{12}$ to minimize spurious behavior in the LOSVDs. We show that truncating

(DM) self-interactions on the host halo and subhalos of Milky Way (MW)--mass
systems. We consider a generic self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) model
parameterized by the masses of a light mediator and the DM particle. The ratio
of these masses, $w$, sets the velocity scale above which momentum transfer due
to DM self-interactions becomes inefficient. We perform high-resolution zoom-in
simulations of an MW-mass halo for values of $w$ that span scenarios in which
self-interactions either between the host and its subhalos or only within
subhalos efficiently transfer momentum, and we study the effects of
self-interactions on the host halo and on the abundance, radial distribution,
orbital dynamics, and density profiles of subhalos in each case. The abundance
and properties of surviving subhalos are consistent with being determined
primarily by subhalo--host halo interactions. In particular, subhalos on radial
orbits in models with larger values of the cross section at the host halo
velocity scale are more susceptible to tidal disruption owing to mass loss from
ram pressure stripping caused by self-interactions with the host. This
mechanism suppresses the abundance of surviving subhalos relative to
collisionless DM simulations, with stronger suppression for larger values of
$w$. Thus, probes of subhalo abundance around MW-mass hosts can be used to
place upper limits on the self-interaction cross section at velocity scales of
$\sim 200\ \rm{km\ s}^{-1}$, and combining these measurements with the orbital
properties and internal dynamics of subhalos may break degeneracies among
velocity-dependent SIDM models.

optical computation can be achieved with ordinary laser light instead of single

algebra. Neither approach leads to a unique construction. Here, we find the
relation between these two approaches and introduce a unified approach, capable
of describing all momentum spaces, and identify the corresponding quantum group
of spacetime symmetries. We reproduce known results and get a few new ones. In
particular, we describe the three momentum spaces associated to the
$\kappa$-Poincar\'e group, which are half of a de Sitter, anti-de Sitter or
Minkowski space, and we identify what distinguishes them. Moreover, we find a
new momentum space with the geometry of a light cone, associated to a
$\kappa$-deformation of the Carroll group.

the most massive known planet host has a mass of only about $3M_{\odot}$.
However, planetary systems which survive the transformation of their host stars
into white dwarfs can be detected via photospheric trace metals, circumstellar
dusty and gaseous discs, and transits of planetary debris crossing our
line-of-sight. These signatures offer the potential to explore the efficiency
of planet formation for host stars with masses up to the core-collapse boundary
at $\approx 8M_{\odot}$, a mass regime rarely investigated in planet formation
theory. Here, we establish limits on where both major and minor planets must
reside around $\approx 6M_{\odot}-8M_{\odot}$ stars in order to survive into
the white dwarf phase. For this mass range, we find that intact terrestrial or
giant planets need to leave the main sequence beyond approximate minimum
star-planet separations of respectively about 3 and 6 au. In these systems,
rubble pile minor planets of radii 10, 1.0, and 0.1 km would have been shorn
apart by giant branch radiative YORP spin-up if they formed and remained
within, respectively, tens, hundreds and thousands of au. These boundary values
would help distinguish the nature of the progenitor of metal-pollution in white
dwarf atmospheres. We find that planet formation around the highest mass white
dwarf progenitors may be feasible, and hence encourage both dedicated planet
formation investigations for these systems and spectroscopic analyses of the
highest mass white dwarfs.

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in their X-ray flux. Despite being strong,
easily measurable signals, their physical origin has long remained elusive.
However, recent observational and theoretical work has greatly improved our
understanding. Here, we briefly review the basic phenomenology of the different
varieties of QPO in both black hole and neutron star systems before focusing
mainly on low frequency QPOs in black hole systems, for which much of the
recent progress has been made. We describe the detailed statistical properties
of these QPOs and review the physical models proposed in the literature, with
particular attention to those based on Lense-Thirring precession. This is a
relativistic effect whereby a spinning massive object twists up the surrounding
spacetime, inducing nodal precession in inclined orbits. We review the theory
describing how an accretion flow reacts to the Lense-Thirring effect, including
analytic theory and recent numerical simulations. We then describe recent
observational tests that provide very strong evidence that at least a certain
type of low frequency QPOs are a geometric effect, and good evidence that they
are the result of precession. We discuss the possibility of the spin axis of
the compact object being misaligned with the binary rotation axis for a large
fraction of X-ray binaries, as is required for QPOs to be driven specifically
by Lense-Thirring precession, as well as some outstanding gaps in our
understanding and future opportunities provided by X-ray polarimeters and/or
high throughput X-ray detectors.

mass, large-scale environment, substructure and redshift-space effects, making
this a hitherto unexplored probe of both primordial cosmology and galaxy
evolution. Using convenient summary statistics -- the width, median and a low
percentile of the VVF as functions of average tracer number density -- we
explore these effects for tracer populations in a suite of N-body simulations
of a range of dark matter models. Our summary statistics sensitively probe
primordial features such as small-scale oscillations in the initial matter
power spectrum (as arise in models involving collisional effects in the dark
sector), while being largely insensitive to a truncation of initial power (as
in warm dark matter models). For vanilla cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies,
the summary statistics display strong evolution and redshift-space effects, and
are also sensitive to cosmological parameter values for realistic tracer
samples. Comparing the VVF of galaxies in the GAMA survey with that of
abundance matched CDM (sub)haloes tentatively reveals environmental effects in
GAMA beyond halo mass (modulo unmodelled satellite properties). Our exploratory
analysis thus paves the way for using the VVF as a new probe of galaxy

is highly pulsed with an rms pulsed fraction of $53\%$. The pulse profile shape
consists of two peaks separated by half a rotational cycle, with a peak flux
ratio of $\sim$2. The flare spectrum is thermal with an average temperature of
2.1 keV. Phase resolved spectroscopy show that the two peaks possess the same
temperature, but differ in size. These observational results along with simple
light curve modeling indicate that two identical antipodal spots, likely the
magnetic poles, are heated simultaneously at the onset of the flare and for its
full duration. Hence, the origin of the flare has to be connected to the global
dipolar structure of the magnetar. This might best be achieved externally, via
twists to closed magnetospheric dipolar field lines seeding bombardment of
polar footpoint locales with energetic pairs. Approximately 1.86 hours
following the onset of the flare, a short burst with its own 3-minute thermal
tail occurred. The burst tail is also pulsating at the spin period of the

connection between the two phenomena. The burst may have been caused by a
magnetic reconnection event in the same twisted dipolar field lines anchored to
the surface hot spots, with subsequent return currents supplying extra heat to
these polar caps.

indicators for cosmology. The aim of this paper is to define tight criteria for
their proper identification starting from the main selection criterion
$R_{FeII} > 1 $, and to identify potential intruders not meeting the selection
criteria, but nonetheless selected as xA because of the coarseness of automatic
searches. Inclusion of the spurious xA sources may dramatically increase the
dispersion in the Hubble diagram of quasars obtained from virial luminosity
estimates. We studied a sample of 32 low-$z$ quasars originally selected from
the SDSS DR7 as xA. All of them show moderate-to-strong FeII emission and the
wide majority strong absorption features in their spectra are typical of fairly
evolved stellar populations. We performed a simultaneous fit of a host galaxy
spectrum, AGN continuum, FeII template and emission lines to spectra, using the
fitting technique based on ULySS, full spectrum fitting package. For sources in
our sample (of spectral types corresponding to relatively low Eddington ratio),
we found an overall consistency between narrow components of H$\beta$ and
[OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959, 5007 line shifts and the mean stellar velocity
obtained from the host galaxy fit (within $\lesssim |60|$ km/s). Only one
source in our sample qualify as xA source. We found high fraction of host
galaxy spectrum (in half of the sample even higher then 40\%). When absorption
lines are prominent, and the fraction of the host galaxy is high, SSP is
mimicking FeII, and that may result in a mistaken identification of FeII
spectral features. We have identified several stellar absorption lines that,
along with the continuum shape, may lead to an overestimate of $R_{FeII}$, and
therefore to the misclassification of sources as xA sources.

thereof) to a member from a particular social group (e.g., defined by gender or
race). Studies on implicit bias have shown that these unconscious stereotypes
can have adverse outcomes in various social contexts, such as job screening,
teaching, or policing. Recently, (Kleinberg and Raghavan, 2018) considered a
mathematical model for implicit bias and showed the effectiveness of the Rooney
Rule as a constraint to improve the utility of the outcome for certain cases of
the subset selection problem. Here we study the problem of designing
interventions for the generalization of subset selection -- ranking -- that
requires to output an ordered set and is a central primitive in various social
and computational contexts. We present a family of simple and interpretable
constraints and show that they can optimally mitigate implicit bias for a
generalization of the model studied in (Kleinberg and Raghavan, 2018).
Subsequently, we prove that under natural distributional assumptions on the
utilities of items, simple, Rooney Rule-like, constraints can also surprisingly
recover almost all the utility lost due to implicit biases. Finally, we augment

with negligible star formation but with a highly obscured active galactic
nucleus dominating the mid-infrared emission. Assuming it lies on the local
M-sigma relation it has an Eddington accretion rate of lambda_EDD~0.014. We
find that the lobe-derived jet power (a time-averaged measure) is an order of
magnitude greater than the hotspot-derived jet power (an instantaneous
measure). We propose that over the lifetime of the observed radio emission
(~300 Myr) the accretion has switched from an inefficient advection dominated
mode to a thin-disc efficient mode, consistent with the decrease in jet power.
We also suggest that the asymmetric radio morphology is due to its environment,

  Order-Preserving Matching Approach","11 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.CG cs.DB","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to increasing concerns of data privacy, databases are being encrypted
before they are stored on an untrusted server. To enable search operations on
the encrypted data, searchable encryption techniques have been proposed.
Representative schemes use order-preserving encryption (OPE) for supporting
efficient Boolean queries on encrypted databases. Yet, recent works showed the
possibility of inferring plaintext data from OPE-encrypted databases, merely
using the order-preserving constraints, or combined with an auxiliary plaintext
dataset with similar frequency distribution. So far, the effectiveness of such
attacks is limited to single-dimensional dense data (most values from the
domain are encrypted), but it remains challenging to achieve it on
high-dimensional datasets (e.g., spatial data) which are often sparse in
nature. In this paper, for the first time, we study data inference attacks on
multi-dimensional encrypted databases (with 2-D as a special case). We
formulate it as a 2-D order-preserving matching problem and explore both
unweighted and weighted cases, where the former maximizes the number of points
matched using only order information and the latter further considers points
with similar frequencies. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, and then
propose a greedy algorithm, along with a polynomial-time algorithm with
approximation guarantees. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that the data recovery rate is significantly enhanced compared
with the previous 1-D matching algorithm.

non-magnetic material is known as natural optical activity or optical
gyrotropy. The behavior of this effect in thin chiral conductors is of current
interest. For example, the low frequency limit of gyrotropy in chiral 3D
crystals, known as the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), is controlled by the
orbital magnetic moment of electrons, which has been proposed to be relevant to
current-induced switching in twisted bilayer graphene. We show that the GME is
not limited to bulk materials but also appears for quasi-2d systems with
minimal structure incorporated in the third direction. Starting from multi-band

Facility at more than two magnitudes and around three weeks prior to its
optical peak. We aim to conduct a detailed photometric and spectroscopic
follow-up campaign for AT 2019abn, with early discovery allowing for
significant pre-maximum observations of an intermediate luminosity red
transient (ILRT) for the first time. This work is based on the analysis of
u'BVi'z'H photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy using the Liverpool
Telescope, medium-resolution spectroscopy with the Gran Telescopio Canarias
(GTC), and near-infrared imaging with the GTC and the Nordic Optical Telescope.
We present the most detailed optical light curve of an ILRT to date, with
multi-band photometry starting around three weeks before peak brightness. The
transient peaked at an observed absolute magnitude of M_r' = -13.1, although it
is subject to significant reddening from dust in M51, implying an intrinsic
M_r' ~ -15.2. The initial light curve showed a linear, achromatic rise in
magnitude before becoming bluer at peak. After peak brightness, the transient
gradually cooled. This is reflected in our spectra, which at later times show
absorption from such species as Fe I, Ni I and Li I. A spectrum taken around
peak brightness shows narrow, low-velocity absorption lines, which we interpret
as likely to originate from pre-existing circumstellar material. We conclude
that while there are some peculiarities, such as the radius evolution, AT
2019abn fits in well overall with the ILRT class of objects and is the most
luminous member of the class seen to date.

star cluster in Eridanus 2 and to place constraints on the mass and abundance
of massive astrophysical compact halo objects (MACHOs) as a constituent of dark
matter. Methods. We present spectroscopic observations of the central square
arcminute of Eridanus 2 from MUSE-Faint, a survey of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies
with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope. We
derive line-of-sight velocities for possible member stars of the putative
cluster and for stars in the centre of Eridanus 2. We discuss the existence of
the cluster and determine new constraints for MACHOs using the Fokker-Planck
diffusion approximation. Results. Out of 182 extracted spectra, we identify 26
member stars of Eridanus 2, seven of which are possible cluster members. We
find intrinsic mean line-of-sight velocities of
$79.7^{+3.1}_{-3.8}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and
$76.0^{+3.2}_{-3.7}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the cluster and the bulk
of Eridanus 2, respectively, and intrinsic velocity dispersions of
${<}7.6\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ (68-$\%$ upper limit) and
$10.3^{+3.9}_{-3.2}\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, respectively. This
indicates the cluster most likely exists as a distinct dynamical population
hosted by Eridanus 2, without surplus of dark matter over the background
distribution. Among the member stars in the bulk of Eridanus 2, we find
possible carbon stars, alluding to the existence of an intermediate-age
population. We derive constraints on the fraction of dark matter that can
consist of MACHOs with a given mass between $1$-$10^5\,M_\mathrm{sun}$. For
dark matter consisting purely of MACHOs, the mass of the MACHOs must be less
than ${\sim}7.6\,M_\mathrm{sun}$ and ${\sim}44\,M_\mathrm{sun}$ at a $68$- and
$95$-$\%$ confidence level, respectively. (Abridged)

between relative stellar actinide abundances is most likely astrophysical in

inexpensive (~$675) and portable EMG control system by integrating low-cost
microcontrollers with an EMG acquisition device. We validated signal
acquisition by comparing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of our system with
that of a high-end research-grade system. We also demonstrate the ability to
use the low-cost control system for proportional and independent control of
various prosthetic hands in real-time. We found that the SNR of the low-cost
control system was statistically no worse than 44% of the SNR of a
research-grade control system. The RMSEs of predicted hand movements (from a
modified Kalman filter) were typically a few percent better than, and not more
than 6% worse than, RMSEs of a research-grade system for up to six degrees of
freedom when only relatively few (six) EMG electrodes were used. However, RMSEs
were generally higher than RMSEs of research-grade systems that utilize
considerably more (32) EMG electrodes, guiding future work towards increasing
electrode count. Successful instantiation of this low-cost control system

a participant is perfectly mimicking predetermined motions of a prosthesis

contralateral hand during identical bilateral movements (mirrored training). We
compared these approaches in non-amputee individuals, using an infrared camera
to track eight different joint angles of the hands in real-time. Aggregate data
revealed that mimicked training does not account for biomechanical coupling or
temporal changes in hand posture. Mirrored training was significantly more
accurate and precise at labeling hand kinematics. However, when training a
modified Kalman filter to estimate motor intent, the mimicked and mirrored
training approaches were not significantly different. The results suggest that
the mirrored training approach creates a more faithful but more complex

data provided by the state of NY, it is observed that the outages do not seem
to come from the same distribution. In some years, there is a huge spike in the
average duration per outage and this is because of catastrophic events.
Therefore, in this study we propose and test an alternative modeling for outage
events. This alternative scheme will be based on the premise that outages can
be broadly classified into two categories: regular and severe. Under this
taxonomy, it can still be assumed that each type of events follows a Poisson
Process but outages, in general, follow a Poisson Process which is truly a
superposition of these two types. A reinforcement learning approach is used to
solve the expansion planning problem and real location-specific data are used.
The results verify our initial hypothesis and show that the optimization
results are significantly affected by the outage modeling. To sum up, modeling
accurately the grid outage events and measuring directly the reliability
performance of an energy system during catastrophic failures could provide
invaluable tools and insights that could therefore be used for the best
possible preparation for this type of outages.

pneumothorax, is important for assisting radiologists in their clinical
workflow like triaging time-sensitive cases and screening for incidental
findings. While deep learning (DL) models has become a promising predictive
technology with near-human accuracy, they commonly suffer from a lack of
explainability, which is an important aspect for clinical deployment of DL
models in the highly regulated healthcare industry. For example, localizing
critical findings in an image is useful for explaining the predictions of DL
classification algorithms. While there have been a host of joint classification
and localization methods for computer vision, the state-of-the-art DL models
require locally annotated training data in the form of pixel level labels or
bounding box coordinates. In the medical domain, this requires an expensive
amount of manual annotation by medical experts for each critical finding. This
requirement becomes a major barrier for training models that can rapidly scale
to various findings. In this work, we address these shortcomings with an
interpretable DL algorithm based on multi-instance learning that jointly
classifies and localizes critical findings in CXR without the need for local
annotations. We show competitive classification results on three different
critical findings (pneumothorax, pneumonia, and pulmonary edema) from three
different CXR datasets.

Newton, can be demonstrated by the substitution $r\rightarrow r^{2}$ in the
classical/quantum radial equations of the Kepler/Hydrogen problems versus the
harmonic oscillator. This suggests a duality-type relationship between these
systems. However, when both radial and angular components of these systems are
included the possibility of a true duality seems to be remote. Indeed,
investigations that explored and generalized Newton's radial relation,
including algebraic approaches based on noncompact groups such as SO(4,2), have
never exhibited a full duality consistent with Newton's. On the other hand,
2T-physics predicts a host of dualities between pairs of a huge set of systems
that includes Newton's two systems. These dualities take the form of rather
complicated canonical transformations that relate the full phase spaces of
these respective systems in all directions. In this paper we focus on Newton's
case by imposing his radial relation to find an appropriate basis for
2T-physics dualities, and then construct the full duality. Using the techniques
of 2T-physics, we discuss the hidden symmetry of the actions (beyond the
symmetry of Hamiltonians) for the Hydrogen atom in $D$-dimensions and the
harmonic oscillator in $\bar{D}$ dimensions. The symmetries lead us to find the
one-to-one relation between the quantum states, including angular degrees of
freedom, for specific values of $\left( D,\bar{D}\right) $, and construct the
explicit quantum canonical transformation in those special cases. We find that
the canonical transformation has itself a hidden gauge symmetry that is crucial
for the respective phase spaces to be dual even when $D\neq\bar{D}$. In this
way we display the surprising beautiful symmetry of the full duality that
generalizes Newton's radial duality.

to model shock wave propagation through a one-dimensional chain of atoms. The
domain is divided into a purely atomistic ""window"" region containing the shock
wave flanked by boundary or ""continuum"" regions on either end. The dynamics of
the window atoms are governed by classic MD equations of motion while continuum
shock conditions are applied to the continuum atoms. Spurious wave reflections
are removed by employing a damping band method using the Langevin thermostat
applied locally to the continuum region. The moving window effect is achieved
by adding/removing atoms to/from the window and boundary regions, and thus the
shock wave front is focused at the center of the window region indefinitely. As
a result, the required domain size is very small allowing us to model shock
wave propagation for a long time. We simulate the shock through a
one-dimensional chain of copper atoms using either the Lennard-Jones, modified
Morse, or Embedded Atom Model (EAM) interatomic potential. We first perform
verification studies to ensure proper implementation of the thermostat,
potential functions, and damping band method, respectively. Next, we track the
propagating shock and compare the actual shock velocity and average particle
velocity to their corresponding analytical input values. From these
comparisons, we optimize the linear shock Hugoniot relation for the given
""lattice"" orientation and compare these results to those in literature. When
incorporated into the linear shock equation, these new Hugoniot parameters are
shown to produce a stationary shock wave front. Finally, we perform
one-dimensional moving window simulations of an unsteady, structured shock up
to a few nanoseconds and characterize the increase in the shock front's width.

  Algorithms and Applications to the Linear Convergence of Minimax Problems",,,,,"math.OC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been a long history of using ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
to understand the dynamics of discrete-time algorithms (DTAs). Surprisingly,
there are still two fundamental and unanswered questions: (i) it is unclear how
to obtain a \emph{suitable} ODE from a given DTA, and (ii) it is unclear the
connection between the convergence of a DTA and its corresponding ODEs. In this
paper, we propose a new machinery -- an $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE framework --
for analyzing the behavior of a generic DTA, which (partially) answers the
above two questions. The framework contains three steps: 1. To obtain a
suitable ODE from a given DTA, we define a hierarchy of $O(s^r)$-resolution
ODEs of a DTA parameterized by the degree $r$, where $s$ is the step-size of
the DTA. We present a principal approach to construct the unique
$O(s^r)$-resolution ODEs from a DTA; 2. To analyze the resulting ODE, we
propose the $O(s^r)$-linear-convergence condition of a DTA with respect to an
energy function, under which the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE converges linearly to
an optimal solution; 3. To bridge the convergence properties of a DTA and its
corresponding ODEs, we define the properness of an energy function and show
that the linear convergence of the $O(s^r)$-resolution ODE with respect to a
proper energy function can automatically guarantee the linear convergence of
the DTA. To better illustrate this machinery, we utilize it to study three
classic algorithms -- gradient descent ascent (GDA), proximal point method
(PPM) and extra-gradient method (EGM) -- for solving the unconstrained minimax
problem $\min_{x\in\RR^n} \max_{y\in \RR^m} L(x,y)$.

long-path-length cells, usually over dozens of cm, rendering the measures
costly and complex; meanwhile, the guidance for choosing the best formula to
describe solvent scattering has remained unsettled. Here we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate a simple, low-cost, and versatile spectrophotometric
method, recording sensitivity 10-4 dB/cm over 0.5 cm differential path length
based on using a standard double-beam spectrophotometer. We attest the method
reduces the path length by a factor of 100 while still making its closest
approach to the record-low measurements. Revisiting the present equations of
solvent scattering, we unfold that they all give similar-predictive-values,
revealing the criterion of choice merely on the formula's simple practicality.
Following the clarification of wavelengths over which light scattering dictates
the solvent's extinction, we identify that the discrepancies persist between
the calculated scattering coefficients and those measured results, suggesting
the need for improving solvent scattering theory to comprehend the phenomenon

all-sky search for small planets transiting bright stars. In the first year of
the TESS survey, steady progress was made in achieving the mission's primary
science goal of establishing bulk densities for 50 planets smaller than
Neptune. During that year, TESS's observations were focused on the southern
ecliptic hemisphere, resulting in the discovery of three mini-Neptunes orbiting
the star TOI-125, a V=11.0 K0 dwarf. We present intensive HARPS radial velocity
observations, yielding precise mass measurements for TOI-125b, TOI-125c and
TOI-125d. TOI-125b has an orbital period of 4.65 days, a radius of $2.726 \pm
0.075 ~\mathrm{R_{\rm E}}$, a mass of $ 9.50 \pm 0.88 ~\mathrm{M_{\rm E}}$ and
is near the 2:1 mean motion resonance with TOI-125c at 9.15 days. TOI-125c has
a similar radius of $2.759 \pm 0.10 ~\mathrm{R_{\rm E}}$ and a mass of $ 6.63
\pm 0.99 ~\mathrm{M_{\rm E}}$, being the puffiest of the three planets.
TOI-125d, has an orbital period of 19.98 days and a radius of $2.93 \pm
0.17~\mathrm{R_{\rm E}}$ and mass $13.6 \pm 1.2 ~\mathrm{M_{\rm E}}$. For
TOI-125b and TOI-125d we find unusual high eccentricities of $0.19\pm 0.04$ and
$0.17^{+0.08}_{-0.06}$, respectively. Our analysis also provides upper mass
limits for the two low-SNR planet candidates in the system; for TOI-125.04
($R_P=1.36 ~\mathrm{R_{\rm E}}$, $P=$0.53 days) we find a $2\sigma$ upper mass
limit of $1.6~\mathrm{M_{\rm E}}$, whereas TOI-125.05 ( $R_P=4.2^{+2.4}_{-1.4}
~\mathrm{R_{\rm E}}$, $P=$ 13.28 days) is unlikely a viable planet candidate
with upper mass limit $2.7~\mathrm{M_{\rm E}}$. We discuss the internal
structure of the three confirmed planets, as well as dynamical stability and
system architecture for this intriguing exoplanet system.

obstacles for varied obstacle size and damping. When the drive is applied in a
fixed direction, we find that the skyrmions are initially guided in the drive
direction but also move transverse to the drive due to the Magnus force. The
skyrmion Hall angle, which indicates the difference between the skyrmion
direction of motion and the drive direction, increases with drive in a series
of quantized steps as a result of the locking of the skyrmion motion to
specific symmetry directions of the obstacle array. On these steps, the
skyrmions collide with an integer number of obstacles to create a periodic
motion. The transitions between the different locking steps are associated with
jumps or dips in the velocity-force curves. In some regimes, the skyrmion Hall
angle is actually higher than the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle that would
appear in the absence of obstacles. In the limit of zero damping, the skyrmion
Hall angle is 90$^\circ$, and we find that it decreases as the damping
increases. For multiple interacting skyrmion species in the collective regime,
we find jammed behavior at low drives where the different skyrmion species are
strongly coupled and move in the same direction. As the drive increases, the
species decouple and each can lock to a different symmetry direction of the
obstacle lattice, making it possible to perform topological sorting in analogy
to the particle sorting methods used to fractionate different species of
colloidal particles moving over two-dimensional obstacle arrays.

nonlinear vortex line tension, vortex mass and a nonlinear Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(LO) viscous drag coefficient $\eta(v)$. We show that the LO decrease of

dependence of the surface resistance $R_i(H)$ caused by trapped vortices. At
low frequencies $R_i(H) $ exhibits a conventional increases with $H$, but as
$\omega$ increases, the surface resistance becomes a nonmonotonic function of
$H$ which decreases with $H$ at higher fields. The effects of frequency, pin
spacing and the mean free path $l_i $ on the field dependence of $R_{i}(H) $
were calculated. It is shown that, as the surface gets dirtier and $l_i$

which can be much smaller than the lower critical magnetic field. Our numerical
simulations also show that the LO decrease of $\eta(v)$ with $v$ can cause a
vortex bending instability at high field amplitudes and frequencies, giving
rise to the formation of dynamic kinks along the vortex. Measurements of
$R_i(H)$ caused by sparse vortices trapped perpendicular to the surface can
offer opportunities to investigate an extreme nonlinear dynamics of vortices
driven by strong current densities up to the depairing limit at low
temperatures. The behavior of $R_i(H)$ which can be tuned by varying the rf
frequency or concentration of nonmagnetic impurities is not masked by strong
heating effects characteristic of dc or pulse transport measurements.

input data on which the instructions operate is a basic principle of classical
computer architectures and programming. Replacing classical data with quantum
states enables fundamentally new computational capabilities with scaling
advantages for many applications, and numerous models have been proposed for
realizing quantum computation. However, within each of these models, the
quantum data are transformed by a set of gates that are compiled using solely
classical information. Conventional quantum computing models thus break the
instruction-data symmetry: classical instructions and quantum data are not
directly interchangeable. In this work, we use a density matrix exponentiation
protocol to execute quantum instructions on quantum data. In this approach, a
fixed sequence of classically-defined gates performs an operation that uniquely
depends on an auxiliary quantum instruction state. Our demonstration relies on
a 99.7% fidelity controlled-phase gate implemented using two tunable
superconducting transmon qubits, which enables an algorithmic fidelity
surpassing 90% at circuit depths exceeding 70. The utilization of quantum
instructions obviates the need for costly tomographic state reconstruction and
recompilation, thereby enabling exponential speedup for a broad range of

entanglement spectra, and universal quantum emulation.

reduce this overfitting, we show we can still risk overfitting to the
particular folds used. In this work, we aim to remedy this problem by
introducing dynamic fitness evaluations which approximate repeated

the linguistic features that we identify as discriminatory go along with the

results suggest that while humans tend to see censored blogposts as more
controversial and more likely to trigger action in real life than the
uncensored counterparts, they in general cannot make a better guess than our
model when it comes to `reading the mind' of the censors in deciding whether a
blogpost should be censored. We do not claim that censorship is only determined
by the linguistic features. There are many other factors contributing to
censorship decisions. The focus of the present paper is on the linguistic form

reconstruction. We show that it is possible to successfully reconstruct a
substantial part of the genome of a victim when the attacker knows the victim
has been added to the beacon in a recent update. We also show that even if
multiple individuals are added to the beacon during the same update, it is
possible to identify the victim's genome with high confidence using traits that
are easily accessible by the attacker (e.g., eye and hair color). Moreover, we
show how the reconstructed genome using a beacon that is not associated with a
sensitive phenotype can be used for membership inference attacks to beacons
with sensitive phenotypes (i.e., HIV+). The outcome of this work will guide
beacon operators on when and how to update the content of the beacon. Thus,
this work will be an important attempt at helping beacon operators and
participants make informed decisions.

network analysis. Its objective is to find a given number of seed nodes that
maximize the spread of information through a social network. Since it is an
NP-hard problem, many approximate/heuristic methods have been developed, and a
number of them repeat Monte Carlo (MC) simulations over and over to reliably
estimate the influence (i.e., the number of infected nodes) of a seed set. In
this work, we present an inductive machine learning method, called Monte Carlo
Simulator (MONSTOR), for estimating the influence of given seed nodes in social
networks unseen during training. To the best of our knowledge, MONSTOR is the
first inductive method for this purpose. MONSTOR can greatly accelerate
existing IM algorithms by replacing repeated MC simulations. In our
experiments, MONSTOR provided highly accurate estimates, achieving 0.998 or
higher Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients in unseen real-world
social networks. Moreover, IM algorithms equipped with MONSTOR are more
accurate than state-of-the-art competitors in 63% of IM use cases.

machine learning has increasingly caught attention from both academia and
industry. Algorithmic fairness ensures that the machine learning models do not
discriminate a particular demographic group of individuals (e.g., black and
female people). Given that MIA is indeed a learning model, it raises a serious
concern if MIA ``fairly'' treats all groups of individuals equally. In other
words, whether a particular group is more vulnerable against MIA than the other
groups. This paper examines the algorithmic fairness issue in the context of
MIA and its defenses. First, for fairness evaluation, it formalizes the
notation of vulnerability disparity (VD) to quantify the difference of MIA
treatment on different demographic groups. Second, it evaluates VD on four
real-world datasets, and shows that VD indeed exists in these datasets. Third,
it examines the impacts of differential privacy, as a defense mechanism of MIA,
on VD. The results show that although DP brings significant change on VD, it
cannot eliminate VD completely. Therefore, fourth, it designs a new mitigation
algorithm named FAIRPICK to reduce VD. An extensive set of experimental results
demonstrate that FAIRPICK can effectively reduce VD for both with and without

we report extremely tight correlations between the gravitational mass $M_{\rm
grav}$ and hot gas mass $M_{\rm gas}$ in galaxy clusters at the hot gas core
radius $r_c$ and at $2r_c$ (i.e. $M_{\rm grav}(r_c)$ vs $M_{\rm gas}(r_c)$ and
$M_{\rm grav}(2r_c)$ vs $M_{\rm gas}(2r_c)$). By using the X-ray data of 64
large galaxy clusters with different sizes and masses, we find that the
correlations can be described by a single relation $\log(M_{\rm

changes in the fundamentals that are expected to change equity prices. In this

of rational finance. We empirically show that market inefficiency attributable
to the volatility of excess return across time is caused by fitting an improper
distribution to the historical returns. Our results indicate that the variation
of gross excess returns is attributable to poorly fitting the tail of the
return distribution and that the puzzle disappears by employing a more
appropriate distribution for the return data. The new distribution that we
introduce in this paper that better fits the historical return distribution of
stocks explains the excess volatility in the market and thereby explains the
volatility puzzle. Failing to estimate the historical returns using the proper
distribution is only one possible explanation for the existence of the
volatility puzzle. However, it offers statistical models within the rational

Text-based computer games describe their world to the player through natural

games are of interest as they can be seen as a testbed for language
understanding, problem-solving, and language generation by artificial agents.
Moreover, they provide a learning environment in which these skills can be
acquired through interactions with an environment rather than using fixed
corpora. One aspect that makes these games particularly challenging for
learning agents is the combinatorially large action space. Existing methods for
solving text-based games are limited to games that are either very simple or
have an action space restricted to a predetermined set of admissible actions.
In this work, we propose to use the exploration approach of Go-Explore for
solving text-based games. More specifically, in an initial exploration phase,
we first extract trajectories with high rewards, after which we train a policy
to solve the game by imitating these trajectories. Our experiments show that
this approach outperforms existing solutions in solving text-based games, and
it is more sample efficient in terms of the number of interactions with the

and keypoint representations jointly. The structure learning is guided by
synthetic hand mask representations, which are directly computed from keypoint

of hand limbs and an anatomically inspired composition strategy of mask
synthesis. We conduct extensive studies on two public datasets - OneHand 10k

enforcing structure learning consistently improves pose estimation accuracy of
CPM baseline models, by 1.17% on the first dataset and 4.01% on the second one.

accreting SMBH binaries will have different X-ray spectra than single accreting
SMBHs, including harder or softer X-ray spectra, ripple-like profiles in the Fe
K-$\alpha$ line, and distinct peaks in the spectrum due to the separation of
the accretion disk into a circumbinary disk and mini-disks around each SMBH. We
obtained Chandra observations to test these models and assess whether these

all well fit by simple absorbed power law models, with the rest frame 2-10 keV
photon indices, $\Gamma$, and the X-ray-to-optical power slopes, $\alpha_{\rm

that these seven quasars are not truly sub-parsec binary SMBH systems, or it
may simply reflect that our sample size was too small to robustly detect any
differences. Alternatively, the X-ray spectral changes might only be evident at

2D maps holds for high-dimensional bistable systems that possess a unique
nonattracting chaotic set embedded in their basin boundaries. The condition for
roughness is that the cross-boundary Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_x$ {\bfac on
the nonattracting set} is not the maximal one. Furthermore, we provide a
formula for the generally noninteger co-dimension of the rough basin boundary,
which can be viewed as a generalization of the Kantz-Grassberger formula. This
co-dimension that can be at most unity can be thought of as a partial
co-dimension, and, so, it can be matched with a Lyapunov exponent. We show
{\bfac in 2D noninvertible- and 3D invertible minimal models,} that, formally,
it cannot be matched with $\lambda_x$. Rather, the partial dimension
$D_0^{(x)}$ that $\lambda_x$ is associated with in the case of rough boundaries
is trivially unity. Further results hint that the latter holds also in higher
dimensions. This is a peculiar feature of rough fractals. Yet, $D_0^{(x)}$
cannot be measured via the uncertainty exponent along a line that traverses the
boundary. Indeed, one cannot determine whether the boundary is a rough or a
filamentary fractal by measuring fractal dimensions. Instead, one needs to

of research has recently made great advances thanks to deep learning. A recent
method, the deep Support Vector Data Description (deep SVDD), which is inspired
by the classic kernel-based Support Vector Data Description (SVDD), is capable
of simultaneously learning a feature representation of the data and a
data-enclosing hypersphere. The method has shown promising results in both
unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. However, deep SVDD suffers from
hypersphere collapse -- also known as mode collapse, if the architecture of the
model does not comply with certain architectural constraints, e.g. the removal
of bias terms. These constraints limit the adaptability of the model and in
some cases, may affect the model performance due to learning sub-optimal
features. In this work, we consider two regularizers to prevent hypersphere
collapse in deep SVDD. The first regularizer is based on injecting random noise
via the standard cross-entropy loss. The second regularizer penalizes the
minibatch variance when it becomes too small. Moreover, we introduce an
adaptive weighting scheme to control the amount of penalization between the
SVDD loss and the respective regularizer. Our proposed regularized variants of
deep SVDD show encouraging results and outperform a prominent state-of-the-art
method on a setup where the anomalies have no apparent geometrical structure.

Communication-efficient and statistically optimal procedures are developed. In

multivariate case, the minimax rate depends on the specific allocations of the
communication budgets among the local machines.
  Although optimal estimation of a Gaussian mean is relatively simple in the

both in terms of the optimal procedure design and lower bound argument. The

Prevailing image retrieval works target at the discriminative feature learning,
while little attention is paid to how to accelerate the model inference, which
should be taken into consideration in real-world practice. The challenge of
pruning image retrieval models is that the middle-level feature should be
preserved as much as possible. Such different requirements of the retrieval and
classification model make the traditional pruning methods not that suitable for
our task. To solve the problem, we propose a new Progressive Local Filter
Pruning (PLFP) method for image retrieval acceleration. Specifically, layer by
layer, we analyze the local geometric properties of each filter and select the
one that can be replaced by the neighbors. Then we progressively prune the
filter by gradually changing the filter weights. In this way, the
representation ability of the model is preserved. To verify this, we evaluate
our method on two widely-used image retrieval datasets,i.e., Oxford5k and
Paris6K, and one person re-identification dataset,i.e., Market-1501. The
proposed method arrives with superior performance to the conventional pruning

have further classified 49 variables as PMS stars (17 Class\,{\sc ii} and 32
Class\,{\sc iii}) and 17 as main-sequence (MS)/field star variables. A larger
fraction of MS/field variables (88\%) show periodic variability as compared to
the PMS variables (59\%). The ages and masses of the PMS variable stars are
found to be comparable with those of T-Tauri stars. Their variability
amplitudes show an increasing trend with the near-IR/mid-IR excess. The period
distribution of the PMS variables shows two peaks, one near $\sim$1.5 days and
the other near $\sim$4.5 days. It is found that the younger stars with thicker
discs and envelopes seem to rotate slower than their older counterparts. These
properties of the PMS variables support the disc-locking mechanism. Both the
period and amplitude of PMS stars show decrease with increasing mass probably
due to the effective dispersal of circumstellar discs in massive stars. Our
results favour the notion that cool spots on weak line T-Tauri stars are
responsible for most of their variations, while hot spots on classical T-Tauri
stars resulting from variable mass accretion from an inner disc contribute to
their larger amplitudes and irregular behaviours.

In order to accomplish this, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

form with low- and high-energy cutoffs $\rm \gamma_{min}'$ and $\rm

crossing-free geometric graphs into directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The DAGs
allow efficient counting, enumeration, random sampling, and optimization. Our
algorithms rely on Wettstein's framework to compile several crossing-free
geometric graphs. One of the remarkable contributions of Wettstein is to allow
dealing with geometric graphs with connectivity, since it is known to be
difficult to efficiently represent geometric graphs with such global property.
To achieve this, Wettstein proposed specialized techniques for crossing-free
spanning trees and crossing-free spanning cycles and invented compiling
algorithms running in $\mathrm{O}(7.044^n)$ time and $\mathrm{O}(5.619^n)$
time, respectively.
  Our first contribution is to propose a technique to deal with the
connectivity constraint more simply and efficiently. It makes the design and
analysis of algorithms easier, and yields improved time complexity. Our
algorithms achieve $\mathrm{O}(6^n)$ time and $\mathrm{O}(4^n)$ time for
compiling crossing-free spanning trees and crossing-free spanning cycles,
respectively. As the second contribution, we propose an algorithm to optimize
the area surrounded by crossing-free spanning cycles. To achieve this, we
modify the DAG so that it has additional information. Our algorithm runs in
$\mathrm{O}(4.829^n)$ time to find an area-minimized (or maximized)
crossing-free spanning cycle of a given point set. Although the problem was
shown to be NP-complete in 2000, as far as we know, there were no known
algorithms faster than the obvious $\mathrm{O}(n!)$ time algorithm for 20
years.

densities. The median reddening is E(B-V) ~ 0.77 +/- 0.10 for type-1 to
type-1.9 AGNs with reported column densities. This is notably higher than the
median reddening of AGNs from the SDSS. We attribute this to the selection bias
of the SDSS towards blue AGNs. For other AGNs we find evidence of a publication
bias against reporting low column densities. We find a significant correlation
between N_H and E(B-V) but with a large scatter of +/- 1 dex (without
accounting for uncertainties in measurements). On average the X-ray columns are
consistent with those predicted from E(B-V) for a solar neighbourhood
dust-to-gas ratio. We argue that the large scatter of column densities and
reddenings can be explained by X-ray column-density variability. For AGNs with
detectable broad-line regions (BLRs) that have undergone significant changes of
Seyfert type (changing-look AGNs) we do not find any statistically significant
differences in N_H or E(B-V) compared to standard type-1 to type-1.9 AGNs.
There is no evidence for any type-1 AGNs being Compton-thick. We also analyze
type-2 AGNs and find no significant correlation between N_H and narrow-line
region reddening. The median column density of LINERs is 22.68 +/- 0.75
compared to a column density of 22.90 +/- 0.28 for type-2s. We find the
majority of low column density type-2s are LINERs, but N_H is probably
underestimated because of scattered X-ray light diluting the photoelectric
edge.

This design decision causes the trace of all DNS resolutions to be exposed to a
third-party resolver, different than the one specified by the user's access
network. In this work we propose K-resolver, a DNS resolution mechanism that
disperses DNS queries across multiple DoH resolvers, reducing the amount of
information about a user's browsing activity exposed to each individual
resolver. As a result, none of the resolvers can learn a user's entire web
browsing history. We have implemented a prototype of our approach for Mozilla
Firefox, and used it to evaluate the performance of web page load time compared
to the default centralized DoH approach. While our K-resolver mechanism has
some effect on DNS resolution time and web page load time, we show that this is
mainly due to the geographical location of the selected DoH servers. When more
well-provisioned anycast servers are available, our approach incurs negligible
overhead while improving user privacy.

the same law for all the significant eigenvalues with 2 regimes; ii) a
universal law seems to govern the weights of all the ""Maximum variance""

proportional to the ranking based on the financial studied criteria; iii) the
volatility of the volatility of the ""Maximum Variance"" portfolios, which are
not orthogonal, could be enough to explain a large part of the diffusion of the

with the decline of the stock market) occurs only for the first mode and cannot
be generalized for other factors of risk. The leverage effect on the beta,
which is the sensitivity of stocks with the market mode, makes variable the

standard Poisson distribution. We derive some properties of gfPd and more
specifically we study moments, limiting behavior and other features of fPd. The
skewness suggests that fPd can be left-skewed, right-skewed or symmetric; this
makes the model flexible and appealing in practice. We apply the model to real
big count data and estimate the model parameters using maximum likelihood.
Then, we turn to the very general class of weighted Poisson distributions
(WPD's) to allow both overdispersion and underdispersion. Similarly to Kemp's
generalized hypergeometric probability distribution, which is based on
hypergeometric functions, we analyze a class of WPD's related to a
generalization of Mittag--Leffler functions. The proposed class of
distributions includes the well-known COM-Poisson and the hyper-Poisson models.
We characterize conditions on the parameters allowing for overdispersion and
underdispersion, and analyze two special cases of interest which have not yet
appeared in the literature.

gamma rays in the region is presented. The diameter of the GeV region found is
~2.8$^{\circ}$, larger than the latest estimate of the SNR size from radio
data. The gamma-ray emission covers most of the known shell and extends further
to the north and east of the bulk of the radio emission. The photon spectrum in
the 0.5--500 GeV range can be described by a simple power law, $\frac{dN}{dE}
\propto E^{-\Gamma}$, with a spectral index of $\Gamma = 1.86\pm 0.03_{stat}

introduced in different fields such as network monitoring, fraud detection, and

often need a long off-line period to build a model or network for the target
data. Providing real-time and proactive anomaly detection for streaming time
series without human intervention and domain knowledge is highly valuable since
it greatly reduces human effort and enables appropriate countermeasures to be
undertaken before a disastrous damage, failure, or other harmful event occurs.
However, this issue has not been well studied yet. To address it, this paper
proposes RePAD, which is a Real-time Proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for
streaming time series based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). RePAD utilizes
short-term historic data points to predict and determine whether or not the
upcoming data point is a sign that an anomaly is likely to happen in the near
future. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold over time, RePAD is
able to tolerate minor pattern change in time series and detect anomalies
either proactively or on time. Experiments based on two time series datasets
collected from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark demonstrate that RePAD is able to
proactively detect anomalies and provide early warnings in real time without
human intervention and domain knowledge.

systems. As our starting point, we consider quantum jump trajectories, which
emerge, physically, from continuous quantum measurements, or, formally, from
the unraveling of Markovian quantum master equations. If the stochastically
evolving quantum trajectories are ensemble-averaged at specific times, the
resulting quantum states are solutions to the associated quantum master
equation. We demonstrate that quantum trajectories can also be
ensemble-averaged at specific jump counts. The resulting jumptime-averaged
quantum states are then solutions to a discrete, deterministic evolution
equation, with time replaced by the jump count. This jumptime evolution
represents a trace-preserving quantum dynamical map if and only if the
associated open system does not exhibit dark states. In the presence of dark
states, on the other hand, jumptime-averaged states may decay into the dark
states and the jumptime evolution may eventually terminate. Jumptime-averaged
quantum states and the associated jumptime evolution are operationally
accessible in continuous measurement schemes, when quantum jumps are detected
and used to trigger the readout measurements. We illustrate the jumptime
evolution with the examples of a two-level system undergoing relaxation or

existence of a divot at missing 7 sums (the probability of missing exactly 7

these graph invariants for $\mathcal{P}_e(G)$ when $G$ is any finite group, and
then determine them when $G$ is a finite abelian $p$-group, $U_{6n} = \langle

properties for single-crystal ceramics. Combining experiments and ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) atomistic simulations at room temperature, we
demonstrate that both the hardness and toughness of single-crystal
NaCl-structure VNx/MgO(001) thin films are simultaneously enhanced through the
incorporation of anion vacancies. Nanoindentation results show that VN0.8, here
considered as representative understoichiometric VNx system, is ~20% harder, as
well as more resistant to fracture than stoichiometric VN samples. AIMD
modeling of VN and VN0.8 supercells subjected to [001] and [110] elongation
reveal that the tensile strengths of the two materials are similar.
Nevertheless, while the stoichiometric VN phase systematically cleaves in a
brittle manner at tensile yield points, the understoichiometric compound
activates transformation-toughening mechanisms that dissipate accumulated
stresses. AIMD simulations also show that VN0.8 exhibits an initially greater
resistance to both {110}<1-10> and {111}<1-10> shear deformation than VN.
However, for progressively increasing shear strains, the VN0.8 mechanical
behavior gradually evolves from harder to more ductile than VN. The transition
is mediated by anion vacancies, which facilitate {110}<1-10> and {111}<1-10>
lattice slip by reducing activation shear stresses by as much as 35%.
Electronic-structure analyses show that the two-regime hard/tough mechanical
response of VN0.8 primarily stems from its intrinsic ability to transfer d
electrons between 2nd-neighbor and 4th-neighbor (i.e., across vacancy sites)
V-V metallic states. Our work offers a route for electronic-structure design of
hard materials in which a plastic mechanical response is triggered with
loading.

(IAM) and is widely used by government agencies to value climate policy
impacts. While there is an ongoing debate about obtained numerical estimates
and related uncertainties, little attention has been paid so far to the SCC
calculation method itself.
  This work attempts to fill the gap by providing theoretical background and
economic interpretation of the SCC calculation approach implemented in the
open-source IAM DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy). Our
analysis indicates that the present calculation method provides an
approximation that might work pretty well in some cases, while in the other
cases the estimated value substantially (by the factor of four) deviates from
the ""true"" value. This deviation stems from the inability of the present
calculation method to catch the linkages between two key IAM's components --
complex interconnected systems -- climate and economy, both influenced by
emission abatement policies. Within the modeling framework of DICE, the
presently estimated SCC valuates policy-uncontrolled emissions against
economically unjustified consumption, which makes it irrelevant for application
in climate-economic policies and, therefore, calls for a replacement by a more
appropriate indicator.
  An apparent SCC alternative, which can be employed for policy formulation is
the direct output of the DICE model -- the socially optimal marginal abatement
cost (SMAC), which corresponds to technological possibilities at optimal level
of carbon emissions abatement. In policy making, because of the previously
employed implicit approximation, great attention needs to be paid to the use of
SCC estimates obtained earlier.

energy system of Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN). ZENs are neighborhoods who
aim to have net zero emissions during their lifetime. While previous work has
used and studied clustering for designing the energy system of neighborhoods,
no article dealt with neighborhoods such as ZEN, which have high requirements
for the solar irradiance time series, include a CO2 factor time series and have
a zero emission balance limiting the possibilities. To this end several methods
are used and their results compared. The results are on the one hand the
performances of the clustering itself and on the other hand, the performances
of each method in the optimization model where the data is used. Various
aspects related to the clustering methods are tested. The different aspects
studied are: the goal (clustering to obtain days or hours), the algorithm
(k-means or k-medoids), the normalization method (based on the standard
deviation or range of values) and the use of heuristic. The results highlight
that k-means offers better results than k-medoids and that k-means was
systematically underestimating the objective value while k-medoids was
constantly overestimating it. When the choice between clustering days and hours
is possible, it appears that clustering days offers the best precision and
solving time. The choice depends on the formulation used for the optimization
model and the need to model seasonal storage. The choice of the normalization
method has the least impact, but the range of values method show some
advantages in terms of solving time. When a good representation of the solar
irradiance time series is needed, a higher number of days or using hours is
necessary. The choice depends on what solving time is acceptable.

compute the p-norm version of Lagrangian descriptors, not for the points on the

time of the popular BERT model, while maintaining the accuracy. It works by: a)
exploiting redundancy pertaining to word-vectors (intermediate encoder outputs)
and eliminating the redundant vectors. b) determining which word-vectors to
eliminate by developing a strategy for measuring their significance, based on
the self-attention mechanism. c) learning how many word-vectors to eliminate by
augmenting the BERT model and the loss function. Experiments on the standard
GLUE benchmark shows that PoWER-BERT achieves up to 4.5x reduction in inference
time over BERT with <1% loss in accuracy. We show that PoWER-BERT offers
significantly better trade-off between accuracy and inference time compared to
prior methods. We demonstrate that our method attains up to 6.8x reduction in
inference time with <1% loss in accuracy when applied over ALBERT, a highly
compressed version of BERT. The code for PoWER-BERT is publicly available at

both algorithms have constant performance bounds from the offline optimum.
Numerical results acquired with Google cluster-usage traces indicate that the

conditions change within one set (e.g., reference: day, query: traversal

suddenly look more similar than same places under different conditions and
state-of-the-art approaches like CNN-based descriptors fail. This paper
discusses this practically very important problem of in-sequence condition
changes and defines a hierarchy of problem setups from (1) no in-sequence

Albany test site in Western Australia considering unidirectional irregular
waves. Two objective functions are considered: (i) maximisation of the annual
average power output, and (ii) minimisation of the levelised cost of energy
(LCoE) for a given sea site. The LCoE calculation is approximated as a ratio of
the produced energy to the significant mass of the system that includes the
mass of the buoy and anchor system. Six different heuristic optimisation
methods are applied in order to evaluate and compare the performance of the
best known evolutionary algorithms, a swarm intelligence technique and a
numerical optimisation approach. The results demonstrate that if we are
interested in maximising energy production without taking into account the cost
of manufacturing such a system, the buoy should be built as large as possible
(20 m radius and 30 m height). However, if we want the system that produces
cheap energy, then the radius of the buoy should be approximately 11-14~m while
the height should be as low as possible. These results coincide with the
overall design that Carnegie Clean Energy has selected for its CETO 6

domains. Assuming that each of the kink reacts independently from the other
ones to the external ac field, we demonstrate that internal deformations of
such a kink give rise to the nonlinear response.

2P/Encke, various asteroids were proposed to be members of the complex and thus
possible parent bodies of Taurid meteoroids. Studies of physical properties of
Taurid meteoroids can provide constrains on their source. We used a well
defined orbital sample of 16 Taurid fireballs with detailed radiometric light
curves. The sample represented meteoroids of initial masses from 8 grams to 650
kg (diameters 1 - 70 cm). The semi-empirical fragmentation model was used to
study their atmospheric fragmentation and derive strength distribution within
the meteoroids. It was found that small meteoroids are stronger than large
ones. When considering Taurid material as a whole, the majority has a very low
strength of less than 0.01 MPa and a density less than 1000 kg/m3. The low
strength material exists mostly as large bodies (>10 cm). If encountered in
smaller bodies, it forms only a minor part. Stronger materials up to 0.3 MPa
exist in Taurids as well, but the stronger material the rarer it is. Strong
material forms small inclusions in large bodies or exists as small (cm-sized)
separate bodies. These properties strongly suggest cometary origin of Taurids.

transport in a multicomponent isothermal compressible fluid. The diffusion
fluxes obey the Fick-Onsager or Maxwell-Stefan closure approach. Mechanical
forces result into one single convective mixture velocity, the barycentric one,
which obeys the Navier-Stokes equations. The thermodynamic pressure is defined
by the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Chemical potentials and pressure are derived from
a thermodynamic potential, the Helmholtz free energy, with a bulk density
allowed to be a general convex function of the mass densities of the
constituents. The resulting PDEs are of mixed parabolic--hyperbolic type. We
prove two theoretical results concerning the well-posedness of the model in
classes of strong solutions: 1. The solution always exists and is unique for
short--times and 2. If the initial data are sufficiently near to an equilibrium
solution, the well-posedness is valid on arbitrary large, but finite time
intervals. Both results rely on a contraction principle valid for systems of
mixed type that behave like the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The
linearised parabolic part of the operator possesses the self map property with
respect to some closed ball in the state space, while being contractive in a
lower order norm only. In this paper, we implement these ideas by means of
precise a priori estimates in spaces of exact regularity.

  estimators",,,"10.1002/sim.8792",,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Inferring the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome in an observational
study requires adjusting for observed baseline confounders to avoid bias.
However, adjusting for all observed baseline covariates, when only a subset are
confounders of the effect of interest, is known to yield potentially
inefficient and unstable estimators of the treatment effect. Furthermore, it
raises the risk of finite-sample bias and bias due to model misspecification.
For these stated reasons, confounder (or covariate) selection is commonly used
to determine a subset of the available covariates that is sufficient for
confounding adjustment. In this article, we propose a confounder selection
strategy that focuses on stable estimation of the treatment effect. In
particular, when the propensity score model already includes covariates that
are sufficient to adjust for confounding, then the addition of covariates that
are associated with either treatment or outcome alone, but not both, should not
systematically change the effect estimator. The proposal, therefore, entails
first prioritizing covariates for inclusion in the propensity score model, then
using a change-in-estimate approach to select the smallest adjustment set that
yields a stable effect estimate. The ability of the proposal to correctly
select confounders, and to ensure valid inference of the treatment effect
following data-driven covariate selection, is assessed empirically and compared
with existing methods using simulation studies. We demonstrate the procedure
using three different publicly available datasets commonly used for causal
inference.

shown to be fixed-parameter tractable due to its relation with a known problem,
Test Cover. By a reduction to the well-studied d-hitting set problem, we give a
polynomial (with respect to k) kernel for the case when the set sizes are
bounded by d. This also helps solving Tracking Shortest Paths when the input

speed follows Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The recent development of
super-resolution techniques has pushed the limits of spatial resolution.
However, these methods typically require complicated setups, long acquisition
time and are still not applicable for deep-tissue bioimaging. Here we report
imaging through an ultra-thin fiber probe with a spatial resolution beyond the
Abbe limit and a temporal resolution beyond the Nyquist limit simultaneously in
a simple and compact setup. We use the random nature of mode coupling in a
multimode fiber, the sparsity constraint and compressive sensing
reconstruction. The new approach of super-resolution endo-microscopy does not
use any specific properties of the fluorescent label such as depletion or
stochastic activation of the molecular fluorescent state and therefore could be
used for label-free imaging. We demonstrate a spatial resolution more than 2
times better than the diffraction limit and an imaging speed 20 times faster

obtaining many known methods as a special case, the list including accelerated
gradient method, composite optimization methods, level-set methods, Bregman
proximal methods. The idea of the framework is based on constructing an inexact
model of the main problem component, i.e. objective function in optimization or
operator in variational inequalities. Besides reproducing known results, our
framework allows constructing new methods, which we illustrate by constructing
a universal conditional gradient method and a universal method for variational
inequalities with a composite structure. This method works for smooth and
non-smooth problems with optimal complexity without a priori knowledge of the
problem's smoothness. As a particular case of our general framework, we
introduce relative smoothness for operators and propose an algorithm for
variational inequalities (VIs) with such operators. We also generalize our
framework for relatively strongly convex objectives and strongly monotone
variational inequalities.
  This paper is an extended and updated version of [arXiv:1902.00990]. In

economical to replace the whole system if it fails. At any inspection time, the

a promising system as very sharp and well defined one dimensional contacts can
be created between a metal and a semiconductor, that can become a quantum dot
if the size becomes sufficiently small. In the search for high performance
devices without variability, it is of high interest to allow deterministic
fabrication of nanowire quantum dots, avoiding sample variability and obtaining
atomic scale precision on the fabricated dot size. In this paper, we present a
reliable fabrication process to produce sub-10 nm Ge quantum dots (QDs), using
a combination of ex-situ thermal annealing via rapid thermal annealing (RTA)
and in-situ Joule heating technique in a transmission electron microscope
(TEM). First we present in-situ direct joule heating experiments showing how
the heating electrode could be damaged due to the formation of Al crystals and
voids at the vicinity of the metal/NW contact, likely related with
electro-migration phenomena. We show that the contact quality can be preserved
by including an additional ex-situ RTA step prior to the in-situ heating. The
in-situ observations also show in real-time how the exchange reaction initiates
simultaneously from several locations underneath the Al contact pad, and the Al
crystal grows gradually inside the initial Ge NW with the growth interface
along a Ge(111) lattice plane. Once the reaction front moves out from
underneath the contact metal, two factors jeopardize an atomically accurate
control of the Al/Ge reaction interface. We observed a local acceleration of
the reaction interface due to the electron beam irradiation in the transmission
electron microscope as well as the appearance of large jumps of the interface
in unpassivated Ge wires while a smooth advancement of the reaction interface
was observed in wires with an Al2O3 protecting shell on the surface. Carefully
controlling all aspects of the exchange reaction, we demonstrate a fabrication
process combining ex-situ and in-situ heating techniques to precisely control
and produce axial Al/Ge/Al NW heterostructures with an ultra-short Ge segment
down to 8 nanometers. Practically, the scaling down of Ge segment length is
only limited by the microscope resolution.

magnetization state is either defined by the helicity of many incoming laser
pulses, or toggled by a single pulse. What has thus far been elusive, yet
essential for applications, is the deterministic writing of a specific
magnetization state with a single laser pulse. In this work we experimentally
demonstrate such a mechanism by making use of a spin polarized current which is
optically generated in a ferromagnetic reference layer, assisting or hindering
switching in an adjacent Co/Gd bilayer. We show deterministic writing of an
'up' and 'down' state using a sequence of 1 or 2 pulses, respectively.

transient heat conduction problems. The approach consists of a meshless Fragile
Points Method (FPM) being utilized for spatial discretization, and a Local
Variational Iteration (LVI) scheme for time discretization. Anisotropy and
nonhomogeneity do not give rise to any difficulties in the present
implementation. The meshless FPM is based on a Galerkin weak-form formulation
and thus leads to symmetric matrices. Local, very simple, polynomial and
discontinuous trial and test functions are employed. In the meshless FPM,
Interior Penalty Numerical Fluxes are introduced to ensure the consistency of
the method. The LVIM in the time domain is generated as a combination of the
Variational Iteration Method (VIM) applied over a large time interval and
numerical algorithms. A set of collocation nodes are employed in each finitely
large time interval. The FPM + LVIM approach is capable of solving transient
heat transfer problems in complex geometries with mixed boundary conditions,
including pre-existing cracks. Numerical examples are presented in 2D and 3D
domains. Both functionally graded materials and composite materials are
considered. It is shown that, with suitable computational parameters, the FPM +
LVIM approach is not only accurate, but also efficient, and has reliable
stability under relatively large time intervals. The present methodology
represents a considerable improvement to the current state of science in
computational transient heat conduction in anisotropic nonhomogeneous media.

the optimal TSM control is fully inline with the Fuller's problem of optimal

the weak interaction between the quarks inside nucleons and nuclei and the
study of PVTC effects opens a window on the quark-quark weak interaction. The
PVTV interaction is sensitive to more exotic interactions at the fundamental
level, in particular to strong CP violation in the Standard Model Lagrangian,

studying various asymmetries in polarized scattering of nuclear systems, or by
measuring the presence of non-vanishing permanent electric dipole moments of
nucleons, nuclei and diamagnetic atoms and molecules. In this contribution, we
review the derivation of the nuclear PVTC and PVTV interactions within various

theory, which allows for a more strict connection with the fundamental

unified view of heterogeneous datasets, either by materializing integrated data

the specific case of tabular datasets represented as several CSV or Excel
files, query translation approaches have been applied by considering each
source as a single table that can be loaded into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Nevertheless, constraints over these tables are not
represented; thus, neither consistency among attributes nor indexes over tables
are enforced. As a consequence, efficiency of the SPARQL-to-SQL translation
process may be affected, as well as the completeness of the answers produced
during the evaluation of the generated SQL query. Our work is focused on
applying implicit constraints on the OBDA query translation process over
tabular data. We propose Morph-CSV, a framework for querying tabular data that
exploits information from typical OBDA inputs (e.g., mappings, queries) to
enforce constraints that can be used together with any SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA
engine. Morph-CSV relies on both a constraint component and a set of constraint
operators. For a given set of constraints, the operators are applied to each
type of constraint with the aim of enhancing query completeness and
performance. We evaluate Morph-CSV in several domains: e-commerce with the BSBM
benchmark; transportation with a benchmark using the GTFS dataset from the
Madrid subway; and biology with a use case extracted from the Bio2RDF project.
We compare and report the performance of two SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA engines,
without and with the incorporation of MorphCSV. The observed results suggest
that Morph-CSV is able to speed up the total query execution time by up to two
orders of magnitude, while it is able to produce all the query answers.

considering the interactions between traveler choice behavior and operators'

networks. We propose a modeling framework for dynamic integrated
mobility-on-demand service operation policy evaluation with two service

constrained dynamic pricing model is proposed to maximize operator profit,
taking into account the correlated structure of different modes of transport.
User willingness to pay is considered as a stochastic constraint, resulting in
a more realistic ticket price setting while maximizing operator profit. Unlike
most studies, which assume that travel demand is known, we propose a demand
learning process to calibrate customer demand over time based on customers'
historical purchase data. We evaluate the proposed methodology through
simulations under different scenarios on a test network by considering the
interactions of supply and demand in a multimodal market. Different scenarios
in terms of customer arrival intensity, vehicle capacity, and the variance of
user willingness to pay are tested. Results suggest that the proposed

for explaining the statistical results of an EPRB-like experiment is proposed.
This perspective is top-down instead of bottom-up. Rather than beginning with
an inequality derivation, a hierarchy of model types is constructed, each
distinguished by appropriately parameterized conditional probabilities. This
hierarchy ranks the ""classical"" model types in terms of their ability to
reproduce QM statistics or not. The analysis goes beyond the usual
consideration of model types that ""fall short"" (i.e., satisfy all of the CHSH
inequalities) to ones that are ""excessive"" (i.e., not only violate CHSH but
even exceed a Tsirelson bound). This approach clearly shows that
noncontextuality is the most general property of an operational model that
blocks replication of at least some QM statistical predictions. Factorizability
is naturally revealed to be a special case of noncontextuality. The same is
true for the combination of remote context independence and outcome determinism
(RCI+OD). It is noncontextuality that determines the dividing line between
""classical"" model instances that satisfy the CHSH inequalities and those that
don't. Outcome deterministic operational models are revealed to be the
""building blocks"" of all the rest, including quantum mechanical, noncontextual,
and contextual ones. The set of noncontextual model instances is exactly the
convex hull of all 16 RCI+OD model instances, and furthermore, the set of all
model instances, including all QM ones, is equal to the convex hull of the 256
OD model instances. It is shown that, under a mild assumption, the construction
of convex hulls of finite ensembles of OD model instances is (mathematically)
equivalent to the traditional hidden variables approach. Plots and figures
provide visual affirmation of many of the results.

special cases, this boundary treatment method naturally applies to explicit
methods as well. In this paper, we examine this boundary treatment method for
the case of explicit RK schemes of arbitrary order applied to hyperbolic
conservation laws. We show that the method not only preserves the accuracy of
explicit RK schemes but also possesses good stability. This compares favourably
to the inverse Lax-Wendroff method in \cite{TS2010,TWSN2012} where analysis and
numerical experiments have previously verified the presence of order reduction
\cite{TS2010,TWSN2012}. In addition, we demonstrate that our method performs
well for strong-stability-preserving (SSP) RK schemes involving negative
coefficients and downwind spatial discretizations. It is numerically shown that
when boundary conditions are present and the proposed boundary treatment is
used, that SSP RK schemes with negative coefficients still allow for larger
time steps than schemes with all non-negative coefficients. In this regard, our
boundary treatment method is an effective supplement to SSP RK schemes
with/without negative coefficients for initial-boundary value problems for
hyperbolic conservation laws.

extension of the classical stochastic MAB model. In the BL-MAB model, the set
of available arms grows (or balloons) over time. In contrast to the classical
MAB setting where the regret is computed with respect to the best arm overall,
the regret in a BL-MAB setting is computed with respect to the best available
arm at each time. We first observe that the existing stochastic MAB algorithms
result in linear regret for the BL-MAB model. We prove that, if the best arm is
equally likely to arrive at any time instant, a sub-linear regret cannot be
achieved. Next, we show that if the best arm is more likely to arrive in the
early rounds, one can achieve sub-linear regret. Our proposed algorithm
determines (1) the fraction of the time horizon for which the newly arriving
arms should be explored and (2) the sequence of arm pulls in the exploitation
phase from among the explored arms. Making reasonable assumptions on the
arrival distribution of the best arm in terms of the thinness of the
distribution's tail, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear
instance-independent regret. We further quantify explicit dependence of regret
on the arrival distribution parameters. We reinforce our theoretical findings
with extensive simulation results. We conclude by showing that our algorithm
would achieve sub-linear regret even if (a) the distributional parameters are
not exactly known, but are obtained using a reasonable learning mechanism or
(b) the best arm is not more likely to arrive early, but a large fraction of
arms is likely to arrive relatively early.

management solutions for a DC motor-driven resonant actuator developed for

in parallel with a torsional spring, drives reciprocal wing motion. Compared to
the gearmotor alone, this design increased torque and power density by 161.1%
and 666.8%, respectively, while decreasing the drawn current by 25.8%.
Characterization of the actuator, isolated from nonlinear aerodynamic loading,
results in standard metrics directly comparable to other actuators. The
micro-motor, selected for low weight considerations, operates at high power for
limited duration due to thermal effects. To predict system performance, a
lumped parameter thermal circuit model was developed. Critical model parameters
for this micro-motor, two orders of magnitude smaller than those previously
characterized, were identified experimentally. This included the effects of
variable winding resistance, bushing friction, speed-dependent forced
convection, and the addition of a heatsink. The model was then used to
determine a safe operation envelope for the vehicle and to design a
weight-optimal heatsink. This actuator design and thermal modeling approach

  Reconstruction Ratio",,"Risk 2020",,,"q-fin.ST cs.LG q-fin.PM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Detecting changes in asset co-movements is of much importance to financial
practitioners, with numerous risk management benefits arising from the timely
detection of breakdowns in historical correlations. In this article, we propose
a real-time indicator to detect temporary increases in asset co-movements, the
Autoencoder Reconstruction Ratio, which measures how well a basket of asset
returns can be modelled using a lower-dimensional set of latent variables. The
ARR uses a deep sparse denoising autoencoder to perform the dimensionality
reduction on the returns vector, which replaces the PCA approach of the
standard Absorption Ratio, and provides a better model for non-Gaussian
returns. Through a systemic risk application on forecasting on the CRSP US
Total Market Index, we show that lower ARR values coincide with higher
volatility and larger drawdowns, indicating that increased asset co-movement
does correspond with periods of market weakness. We also demonstrate that
short-term (i.e. 5-min and 1-hour) predictors for realised volatility and
market crashes can be improved by including additional ARR inputs.

observable 3D environments are an ongoing challenge in Deep Reinforcement
Learning. We present EgoMap, a spatially structured neural memory architecture.
EgoMap augments a deep reinforcement learning agent's performance in 3D
environments on challenging tasks with multi-step objectives. The EgoMap
architecture incorporates several inductive biases including a differentiable
inverse projection of CNN feature vectors onto a top-down spatially structured
map. The map is updated with ego-motion measurements through a differentiable
affine transform. We show this architecture outperforms both standard recurrent
agents and state of the art agents with structured memory. We demonstrate that
incorporating these inductive biases into an agent's architecture allows for
stable training with reward alone, circumventing the expense of acquiring and
labelling expert trajectories. A detailed ablation study demonstrates the
impact of key aspects of the architecture and through extensive qualitative
analysis, we show how the agent exploits its structured internal memory to
achieve higher performance.

  Water Turbidity and Bottom Composition using Multispectral Imagery",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we introduce a semi-analytical model for bathymetry, water
turbidity and bottom composition; which is primarily based on the physics-based
model, HOPE, of Lee et al. Unlike the model of Lee, which was originally
designed to use hyperspectral imagery, our model is specifically designed to
use multispectral satellite imagery. In particular, we adapt to the greatly
decreased spectral resolution by introducing temporal and spatial assumptions
on the depth and water turbidity. We validate the extensions to the Lee et al
model with a 260 km2 case study in the area of the Murion Islands off Western
Australia, where we compare the atmospherically-corrected LANDSAT-8 derived
bathymetry against a 2011 single-beam sonar survey by Transport Western
Australia. The model validates well against the single-beam sonar survey, with
R^2 = 0.85, a mean absolute error of 1.17 m and a mean relative error of 7.52%.
This indicates the model could be widely applicable to LANDSAT-8 imagery.

  Principles: Integrative Perspective (s) of Managers and Shariah Scholars","38 pages, 01 figure",,,,"q-fin.GN","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Islamic banks being commercial entities strive to earn profit within shariah
ambit. Therefore, they seem to be basing themselves upon two knowledge streams
namely i) Islamic jurisprudence principles, and ii) banking principles. Islamic
jurisprudence principles primarily aim at bringing shariah compliance while
banking principles focus profitability. These principles, making two schools of
thought in the discipline, however, have their unique philosophies, principles,
and practices, which are now gradually diffusing into an emergent set of
governance principles basing the contemporary Islamic banking theory and
practice. Governance systems of Islamic banks have elements of both
conventional as well as Shariah, and need to have principles having components
of banking and shariah sufficiently diffused for their successful operations in
a longer term. Aim of this research is to review the literature about the
knowledge diffusion process of islamic banking principles which guides the
governance of Islamic banks. This study review the literature using a method in
which focus remain on bridging different areas which in this case are knowledge
diffusion and islamic banking governance principles.

Towards this, we propose a method that obtains gradient-based certainty

learning methods that we further improve by using the gradients for these
estimates. These have two-fold benefits: a) improvement in obtaining the
certainty estimates that correlate better with misclassified samples and b)
improved attention maps that provide state-of-the-art results in terms of
correlation with human attention regions. The improved attention maps result in
consistent improvement for various methods for visual question answering.
Therefore, the proposed technique can be thought of as a recipe for obtaining
improved certainty estimates and explanations for deep learning models. We
provide detailed empirical analysis for the visual question answering task on
all standard benchmarks and comparison with state of the art methods.

  Molecular Dynamics Simulations: Application to Alkanes",,,,,"physics.chem-ph cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  United-Atom (UA) force fields are usually constructed using a
Boltzmann-inverse method based on distributions obtained from Monte-Carlo
simulations. A new method of constructing UA force fields from All-Atom (AA)
molecular dynamics simulations is proposed. In this method, one determines time
correlations between oscillators of the same type: between a CC bond and the
connected CH bonds; between a valence angle CCC and all valence angles sharing
at least one hydrogen with it; between a dihedral angle CCCC and the dihedral
angles sharing the two central carbons with it. In the case of no correlation
between lengths or angles, energies of the oscillators are independent. In this
case, the AA and UA components of the force fields are identical. When a
correlation is total, the UA potential of an object is the sum of the energies
of the oscillators coupled to it. Partial correlations are also possible.
Several kinematic matching tests of the AA molecule with the corresponding UA
molecule are considered: mean periods of vibration of the oscillators; energies
associated with presence probabilities; mean end-to-end lengths of the
molecules. The method is, as an example, applied to aliphatic molecules,
simulated with the OPLS-AA force field.
