off mass spectrum of particles being involved in the DV events at the LHC. We
demonstrate that our method neatly works under a limited statistics, detector
resolution and smearing effects. The signature of DV at the LHC can come from
either highly suppressed phase-space or a feeble coupling of particle decay

these two cases and thus extract information of dominant freeze-in processes in

entanglement in that they cannot be converted into each other by local quantum
operations only, and fully understanding mathematical structures of different
types of multipartite entanglement is a very challenging task. In this paper,
from the viewpoint of Hardy's nonlocality, we compare W and GHZ states and show
a couple of crucial different behaviors between them. Particularly, by
developing a geometric model for the Hardy's nonlocality problem of W states,
we derive an upper bound for its maximal violation probability, which turns out
to be strictly smaller than the corresponding probability of GHZ state. This
gives us a new comparison between these two quantum states, and the result is
also consistent with our intuition that GHZ states is more entangled.
Furthermore, we generalize our approach to obtain an asymptotic
characterization for general $N$-qubit W states, revealing that when $N$ goes
up, the speed that the maximum violation probabilities decay is exponentially
slower than that of general $N$-qubit GHZ states. We provide some numerical
simulations to verify our theoretical results.

Specifically, we exhibit CNF formulas that can be refuted in quadratic length

require monotone Boolean formulas of exponential size. Previously only a
non-explicit separation was known.
  An important technical ingredient, which may be of independent interest, is
that we show that the Nullstellensatz degree of refuting the pebbling formula
over a DAG G over any field coincides exactly with the reversible pebbling
price of G. In particular, this implies that the standard decision tree

sign-alternating dispersion a scheme for high-quality nonlinear pulse

to incremental time-harmonic dynamic motion, superimposed to a given state of
axial loading of arbitrary magnitude. In contrast to the quasi-static energy
match (addressed in Part I of the present study), the vibrational properties of
the lattice are directly represented by the acoustic tensor of the equivalent
solid (without passing through the constitutive tensor). The acoustic tensor is
shown to be independent of the rods' rotational inertia and allows the analysis
of strong ellipticity of the equivalent continuum, evidencing coincidence with
macro-bifurcation in the lattice. On the other hand, micro-bifurcation
corresponds to a vibration of vanishing frequency of the lowest dispersion
branch of the lattice, occurring at finite wavelength. Dynamic homogenization
reveals the structure of the acoustic branches close to ellipticity loss and
the analysis of forced vibrations (both in physical space and Fourier space)
shows low-frequency wave localizations. A comparison is presented between
strain localization occurring near ellipticity loss and forced vibration of the
lattice, both corresponding to the application of a concentrated pulsating
force. The comparison shows that the homogenization technique allows an almost
perfect representation of the lattice, with the exception of cases where
micro-bifurcation occurs, which is shown to leave the equivalent solid
unaffected. Therefore, the presented results pave the way for the design of
architected cellular materials to be used in applications where extreme

localized on Randall-Sundrum (RS)-like thick branes, namely, the thick branes
embedded in asymptotic Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. In order to localize a
vector field on the RS-like thick brane, an extra coupling term should be
introduced. In this paper, we generalize the geometrical coupling mechanism by
adding two mass terms ($\alpha Rg^{MN}A_{M}A_{N}+\beta R^{MN}A_{M}A_{N}$) into
the action. We decompose the fundamental vector field $A_{M}$ into three parts:
transverse vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$, scalar parts $\phi$ and $A_{5}$. Then,
we find that the transverse vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ decouples from the
scalar parts. In order to eliminate the tachyonic modes of $\hat{A}_{\mu}$, the
two coupling parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ should satisfy a relation.
Combining the restricted condition, we can get a combination parameter as
$\gamma=\frac{3}{2}\pm\sqrt{1+12\alpha}$. Only if $\gamma>1/2$, the zero mode
of $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ can be localized on the RS-like thick brane. We also
investigate the resonant character of the vector part $\hat{A}_{\mu}$ for the
general RS-like thick brane with the warp factor $A(z)=-\ln(1+k^2z^2)/2$ by
choosing the relative probability method. The result shows that, only for
$\gamma>3$, the massive resonant Kaluza-Klein modes can exist. The number of
resonant Kaluza-Klein states increases with the combination parameter $\gamma$,
and the lifetime of the first resonant state can be long enough as the age of
our universe. This indicates that the vector resonances might be considered as
one of the candidates of dark matter.

not an easy task because there could be no observable node degree changes.
Fixing or correcting such malfunctions is even harder as almost no work can

  To solve the problems, we design and implement A3, an automatic
topology-aware malfunction detection and fixation system. A3 innovatively
formulates the problem of finding minimal fixation to the problem of computing
minimum graph difference (NP-hard) and solves it in O(k^6) and O(k^3) for any
less than k/2 and k/4 undirected link malfunctions for FatTree, respectively.
Our evaluation demonstrates that for less than k/2 undirected link
malfunctions, A3 is 100% accurate for malfunction detection and provides the
minimum fixation result. For greater or equal to k/2 undirected link
malfunctions, A3 still has accuracy of about 100% and provides the near optimal

numerically exact method based on variational matrix product states. A rich
phase diagram is found in the anisotropy-coupling strength plane by calculating
several observables. There are three distinct quantum phases: a delocalized
phase with even parity (phase I), a delocalized phase with odd parity (phase
II), and a localized phase with broken $Z_2$ symmetry (phase III), which
intersect at a quantum tricritical point. The competition between those phases
would give overall picture of the phase diagram. For small power of the
spectral function of the bosonic bath, the quantum phase transition (QPT) from
phase I to III with mean-field critical behavior is present, similar to the
isotropic SBM. The novel phase diagram full with three different phases can be
found at large power of the spectral function: For highly anisotropic case, the
system experiences the QPTs from phase I to II via 1st-order, and then to the
phase III via 2nd-order with the increase of the coupling strength. For low
anisotropic case, the system only experiences the continuous QPT from phase I
to phase III with the non-mean-field critical exponents. Very interestingly, at
the moderate anisotropy, the system would display the continuous QPTs for
several times but with the same critical exponents. This unusual reentrance to
the same localized phase is discovered in the light-matter interacting systems.
The present study on the anisotropic SBM could open an avenue to the rich
quantum criticality.

between the contributions of three grammatical classes (or ``tags,'' namely,
{\it nouns}, {\it verbs}, and {\it others}), and analyze the progressive
appearance of new words of each tag along each individual text. While the
power-law relation prescribed by Heaps' law is satisfactorily fulfilled by
total vocabulary sizes and text lengths, the appearance of new words in each
text is on the whole well described by the average of random shufflings of the
text, which does not obey a power law. Deviations from this average, however,
are statistically significant and show a systematic trend across the corpus.
Specifically, they reveal that the appearance of new words along each text is
predominantly retarded with respect to the average of random shufflings.
Moreover, different tags are shown to add systematically distinct contributions
to this tendency, with {\it verbs} and {\it others} being respectively more and
less retarded than the mean trend, and {\it nouns} following instead this
overall mean. These statistical systematicities are likely to point to the
existence of linguistically relevant information stored in the different
variants of Heaps' law, a feature that is still in need of extensive
assessment.

analytical (I stay away from semigroup theory). Personally, I tend to find that
the intuition lies with the former and not the latter. This manuscript is
geared towards those interested in the use of Markov chains as models of
real-life phenomena. For this reason, I focus on the type of chains most
commonly encountered in practice (time-homogeneous, minimal, and
right-continuous in the discrete topology) and choose a starting point very
familiar to this audience: the (Kendall-) Gillespie Algorithm commonly used to
simulate these chains. In order to keep the prerequisite knowledge and
technical complications to a minimum, I take a 'bare-bones' approach that keeps
the focus on chains (instead of more general processes) to an almost
pathological degree: I use the 'jump and hold' structure of chains extensively;
almost no martingale theory; minimal coupling; no stochastic calculus; and,
even though regeneration and renewal (of course!) feature in the manuscript,
they do so exclusively in the context of chains. I have also taken some extra
steps to avoid imposing certain assumptions encountered in other texts that
sometimes prove to be stumbling blocks in practice (e.g., irreducibility of the
state space, boundedness of test functions and of stopping times). For more

The angular resolution of the observations is set by the synthesized beam
(1.4x2.1as). The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork regions and
also elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops
as confirmed by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best
with the SDO/AIA 171, 131 and 304 channels in that they exhibit network
features and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints of large-scale
loops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band
3. The brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about
8000-9000K and in extreme moments up to 10 000K. ALMA Band 3 interferometric
observations from early observing cycles already reveal temperature differences
in the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the
correlation with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests though that the
radiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might have contributions from a larger range of
atmospheric heights than previously assumed but the exact formation height of
Band 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness
temperature scale as set by Total Power measurements remains less certain and
must be improved in the future. Despite these complications and the limited
angular resolution, ALMA Band 3 observations have large potential for
quantitative studies of the small-scale structure and dynamics of the solar
chromosphere.

when the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) was accreted. Accreted GES stars and
progenitor stars born prior to the merger make up the bulk of the inner halo.
Even though these two main populations of halo stars have similar $durations$
of star formation prior to their merger, they differ in [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]
space, with the GES population bending to lower [$\alpha$/Fe] at a relatively
low value of [Fe/H]. We use cosmological simulations of a 'Milky Way' to argue
that the different tracks of the halo stars through the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]
plane are due to a difference in their star formation history and efficiency,
with the lower mass GES having its low and constant star formation regulated by
feedback whilst the higher mass main progenitor has a higher star formation
rate prior to the merger. The lower star formation efficiency of GES leads to
lower gas pollution levels, pushing [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks to the left. In
addition, the increasing star formation rate maintains a higher relative
contribution of Type~II SNe to Type~Ia SNe for the main progenitor population
that formed during the same time period, thus maintaining a relatively high
[$\alpha$/Fe]. Thus the different positions of the downturns in the
[$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane for the GES stars are not reflective of different
star formation durations, but instead reflect different star formation

this model is to condition on conjectures about the hardness of some specific

cycle or two cycles, usually called the one cycle vs. two cycles problem. This
is unlike the traditional arguments based on conjectures about complexity
classes (e.g., $\textsf{P} \neq \textsf{NP}$), which are often more robust in
the sense that refuting them would lead to groundbreaking algorithms for a
whole bunch of problems.
  In this paper we present connections between problems and classes of problems
that allow the latter type of arguments. These connections concern the class of
problems solvable in a sublogarithmic amount of rounds in the MPC model,
denoted by $\textsf{MPC}(o(\log N))$, and some standard classes concerning
space complexity, namely $\textsf{L}$ and $\textsf{NL}$, and suggest

cosmological implications of the non-trivial dynamics which may arise within
such dark sectors, focusing on decay processes which take place entirely among
the dark constituents. First, we demonstrate that such decays can leave
dramatic imprints on the resulting dark-matter phase-space distribution. In
particular, this distribution need not be thermal -- it can even be
multi-modal, exhibiting a non-trivial pattern of peaks and troughs as a
function of momentum. We then proceed to show how these features can induce
modifications to the matter power spectrum. Finally, we assess the extent to
which one can approach the archaeological ""inverse"" problem of deciphering the
properties of an underlying dark sector from the matter power spectrum. Indeed,
one of the main results of this paper is a remarkably simple conjectured
analytic expression which permits the reconstruction of many of the important
features of the dark-matter phase-space distribution directly from the matter
power spectrum. Our results therefore provide an interesting toolbox of methods
for learning about, and potentially constraining, the features of non-minimal

Community Survey. The effect of changing neighborhood demographics on bus
ridership are modeled using Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics data. At a
point in time, neighborhoods with high proportions of non-white, carless, and
most significantly, high-school-educated residents are the most likely to have
high ridership. Over time, white neighborhoods are losing the most ridership
across all four cities. In Miami and Atlanta, places with high concentrations
of residents with college education and without access to a car also lose
ridership at a faster rate. In Minneapolis/St-Paul, the proportion of
college-educated residents is linked to ridership gain. The sign and

time-consuming simulations in hydration site predictions, we developed two
different types of deep neural-network models aiming to predict hydration site

interactions between certain molecular probes placed on regular 3D grids,
encompassing the binding pocket, with the static protein. These molecular
interaction fields are mapped to the corresponding 3D image of hydration
occupancy using a neural network based on an U-Net architecture. In a second
approach, hydration occupancy and thermodynamics were predicted point-wise
using a neural network based on fully-connected layers. In addition to direct
protein interaction fields, the environment of each grid point was represented
using moments of a spherical harmonics expansion of the interaction properties
of nearby grid points. Application to structure-activity relationship analysis
and protein-ligand pose scoring demonstrates the utility of the predicted
hydration information.

scheme to enable automatic responses for multiple requests of entanglement
generation between source-terminal stations on a quantum lattice network with
finite edge capacities. Multiple connection paths are exploited for each
connection request while entanglement fidelity is ensured for each path by
performing entanglement purification. The routing scheme is highly modularized
with a flexible nature, embedding quantum operations within the algorithmic
workflow, whose performance is evaluated from multiple perspectives. In
particular, three algorithms are proposed and compared for the scheduling of
capacity allocation on the edges of quantum network. Embodying the ideas of
proportional share and progressive filling that have been well-studied in
classical routing problems, we design a new scheduling algorithm, the
propagatory update method, which in certain aspects overrides the two
algorithms based on classical heuristics in scheduling performances. The
general solution scheme paves the road for effective design of efficient

Aperture prism
spectroscopy in particular is an important tool for large-scale survey
observations. The ongoing ESA space mission Gaia is the currently most relevant
example. In this work we analyse the fundamental limitations of the calibration
of low-resolution spectrophotometric observations and introduce a calibration
method that avoids simplifying assumptions on the smearing effects of the line
spread functions. To this aim, we developed a functional analytic mathematical
formulation of the problem of spectrophotometric calibration. In this
formulation, the calibration process can be described as a linear mapping
between two suitably constructed Hilbert spaces, independently of the
resolution of the spectrophotometric instrument. The presented calibration
method can provide a formally unusual but precise calibration of low-resolution
spectrophotometry with non-negligible widths of line spread functions. We used
the Gaia spectrophotometric instruments to demonstrate that the calibration
method of this work can potentially provide a significantly better calibration
than methods neglecting the smearing effects of the line spread functions.

\emph{ab initio} techniques, we benchmark the performance of fcc Ru. We find
that the phonon-limited bulk resistivity of the fcc Ru is less than half of
that of hcp Ru, a feature we trace back to the stronger electron-phonon
coupling elements that are geometrically inherited from the modified Fermi
surface shape of the fcc crystal. Despite this benefit of the fcc phase, high
grain boundary scattering results in increased resistivity compared to Cu-based
interconnects with similar average grain size. We find, however, that the line
resistance of fcc Ru is lower than that of Cu below 21 nm line width due to the
conductor volume lost to adhesion and wetting liners. In addition to studying
bulk transport properties, we evaluate the performance of adhesion liners for
fcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for fcc Ru to bind
directly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as
TaN and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition
technique, we find that the vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru
can be up to eight times lower than that calculated for conventional liners
used for Cu interconnects. Our calculations, therefore, suggest that the
formation of the fcc phase of Ru may be a beneficial for advanced,

velocities obtained with the HARPS-N spectrograph, installed on the Telescopio

($R_{b}=1.613\pm0.071 R_{\oplus}$) transiting the star on a short-period orbit
($P_{\rm b}=0.719573\pm0.000021$ d). From our radial velocity measurements, we
constrained the mass of HD 80653 b to $M_{b}=5.60\pm0.43 M_{\oplus}$. We also
detected a clear long-term trend in the radial velocity data. We derived the
fundamental stellar parameters and determined a radius of
$R_{\star}=1.22\pm0.01 R_{\odot}$ and mass of $M_{\star}=1.18\pm0.04

density ($\rho_{b} = 7.4 \pm 1.1$ g cm$^{-3}$) of the planet is consistent with
an Earth-like composition of rock and iron with no thick atmosphere. Our
analysis of the K2 photometry also suggests hints of a shallow secondary
eclipse with a depth of 8.1$\pm$3.7 ppm. Flux variations along the orbital
phase are consistent with zero. The most important contribution might come from
the day-side thermal emission from the surface of the planet at $T\sim3480$ K.

Their physical origin remains unknown, but dozens of possible models have been
postulated. Some FRB sources exhibit repeat bursts. Though over a hundred FRB
sources have been discovered to date, only four have been localised and
associated with a host galaxy, with just one of the four known to repeat. The
properties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, provide
important clues about their physical origins. However, the first known
repeating FRB has been localised to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy,
and the apparently non-repeating sources to higher-metallicity, massive
elliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and
apparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins. Here we
report the precise localisation of a second repeating FRB source, FRB
180916.J0158+65, to a star-forming region in a nearby (redshift $z = 0.0337 \pm
0.0002$) massive spiral galaxy, whose properties and proximity distinguish it
from all known hosts. The lack of both a comparably luminous persistent radio
counterpart and a high Faraday rotation measure further distinguish the local
environment of FRB 180916.J0158+65 from that of the one previously localised
repeating FRB source, FRB 121102. This demonstrates that repeating FRBs have a
wide range of luminosities, and originate from diverse host galaxies and local
environments.

a simple runaway greenhouse (RGH) parameterization to explore the effects of
these two parameters on the climate of Earth-like aqua planets - completely
ocean-covered planets - orbiting F-, G-, K-, and M-dwarf stars. We find that
the range of instellations for which planets exhibit habitable surface
conditions throughout an orbit decreases with increasing eccentricity. However,
the appearance of temporarily habitable conditions during an orbit creates an
eccentric habitable zone (EHZ) that is sensitive to orbital eccentricity and
obliquity, planetary latitude, and host star spectral type. We find that the
fraction of a planet's orbit over which it exhibits habitable surface
conditions is larger on eccentric planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, due to the
lower broadband planetary albedos of these planets. Planets with larger
obliquities have smaller EHZs, but exhibit warmer climates if they do not enter
a snowball state during their orbits. We also find no transient runaway
greenhouse state on planets at all eccentricities. Rather, planets spend their
entire orbits either in a RGH or not. For G-dwarf planets receiving 100% of the
modern solar constant and with eccentricities above 0.55, an entire Earth ocean
inventory can be lost in 3.6 Gyr. M-dwarf planets, due to their larger incident
XUV flux, can become desiccated in only 690 Myr with eccentricities above 0.38.
This work has important implications for eccentric planets that may exhibit
surface habitability despite technically departing from the traditional
habitable zone as they orbit their host stars.

investigation down to a MBHB mass ratio of $q=m_2/m_1=10^{-4}$, where $m_1$ and
$m_2$ are the masses of the primary and secondary hole respectively. Contrary
to a simple extrapolation from higher mass ratios, we find that for $q\lesssim
10^{-3}$ the eccentricity growth rate becomes negative, i.e., the binary {\it
circularises} as it shrinks. This behaviour is due to the subset of interacting
stars captured in metastable counter-rotating orbits; those stars tend to
extract angular momentum from the binary, promoting eccentricity growth for
$q>10^{-3}$, but tend to inject angular momentum into the binary driving it
towards circularisation for $q<10^{-3}$. The physical origin of this behaviour
requires a detailed study of the orbits of this subset of stars and is
currently under investigation. Our findings might have important consequences
for intermediate MBHs (IMBHs) inspiralling onto MBHs (e.g. a putative $10^3\rm

in a flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, published in Grillo et al. (2018), we confirm
the relevance of the longest measurable time delay, between SX and S1, and an
approximately linear relation between its value and that of $H_{0}$. We perform
true blind tests by considering a range of time delays around its original
estimate of $345 \pm 10$ days, as an accurate measurement of this time delay
was not known at the time of analysis and writing. We investigate separately
the impact of a constant sheet of mass at the cluster redshift, of a power-law
profile for the mass density of the cluster main halo and of some scatter in
the cluster member scaling relations. Remarkably, we find that these systematic
effects do not introduce a significant bias on the inferred values of $H_{0}$
and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and that the statistical uncertainties dominate the total
error budget: a 3% uncertainty on the time delay of image SX translates into
approximately 6% and 40% (including both statistical and systematic $1\sigma$)
uncertainties for $H_{0}$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$, respectively. Furthermore, our
model accurately reproduces the extended surface brightness distribution of the
supernova host, covering more than $3 \times 10^{4}$ $HST$ pixels. We also
present the interesting possibility of measuring the value of the
equation-of-state parameter $w$ of the dark energy density, currently with a
30% uncertainty. We conclude that time-delay cluster lenses have the potential

trace the deficit of star formation to high redshifts, where the slope of the
star formation rate to stellar mass relation is consistent with observations,

rate density and stellar mass density that is systematically offset from
observations. However, the less luminous or lower stellar mass objects have
luminosities and stellar masses that agree fairly well with observational data.
We explore the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, a key quantity that is difficult to
measure at high redshifts and that models do not consistently predict. In CROC,
the stellar-to-halo mass ratio {\it decreases} with redshift, a trend opposite
to some abundance matching studies. These discrepancies uncover where future
effort should be focused in order to improve the fidelity of modeling cosmic
reionization. We also compare the CROC galaxy bias with observational

shapes: profiles exhibiting a (i) peak within $2.5$ half-mass radii and a
subsequent decrease (ii) continuous increase that plateaus at larger radii
typically with a high amplitude (iii) completely flat behaviour typically with
low amplitude, in agreement with observations. This shows that the kinematic
state of the stellar component can vary significantly with radius, suggesting a
distinct interplay between in-situ star formation and ex-situ accretion of
stars. Following the evolution of our sample through time, we provide evidence
that the accretion history of galaxies with decreasing profiles is dominated by
the anisotropic accretion of low mass satellites that get disrupted beyond $
\sim 2.0$ half-mass radii, building up a stellar halo with non-ordered motion
while maintaining the central rotation already present at $z=2$. In fact, at
$z=2$ decreasing profiles are the predominant profile class. Hence, we can
predict a distinct formation pathway for galaxies with a decreasing profile and
show that the centre resembles an old embedded disk. Furthermore, we show that
the radius of the kinematic transition provides a good estimation for the
transition radius from in-situ stars in the centre to accreted stars in the

the antiproton to positron ratio requires that positrons be uncooled up to a

Galaxy too quickly to reproduce the observed antiproton flux. We further show
that this result rules out also more complex secondary production scenarios

in-spiral of GCs. The masses, sizes and metallicities of the two NSCs place
them among other NSCs, but also among the known UCDs of the Centaurus group.
This indicates that NSCs might constitute the progenitors of a part of the
low-mass UCDs, although their properties are almost indistinguishable from
typical GCs.

constructs a spatial interaction matrix (precision matrix) that accounts for

The SLI approach does not require matrix inversion for parameter estimation,

procedures that are significantly less intensive computationally than kriging.
The precision matrix involves compact kernel functions (spherical, quadratic,
etc.) which enable the application of sparse matrix methods, thus improving
computational time and memory requirements. We investigate the proposed SLI
method with a data set that includes approximately 11500 drill-hole data of
coal thickness from Campbell County (Wyoming, USA). We also compare SLI with
ordinary kriging (OK) in terms of estimation performance, using cross
validation analysis, and computational time. According to the validation

utilizes the spatial structure to achieve parsimony of autoregressive matrices
at two levels. The first level ensures the sparsity of the autoregressive
matrices using a lagged-neighborhood scheme. The second level performs a
spatial clustering of the non-zero autoregressive coefficients such that nearby
locations share similar coefficients. This model is interpretable and can be
used to identify geographical subregions, within each of which, the time series
share similar dynamical behavior with homogeneous autoregressive coefficients.
The model parameters are obtained using the penalized maximum likelihood with
an adaptive fused Lasso penalty. The estimation procedure is easy to implement
and can be tailored to the need of a modeler. We illustrate the performance of
the proposed estimation algorithm in a simulation study. We apply our model to

amplitude variations with a period of approximately 3.3 years, thought to be
similar to the Blazhko variations in RR Lyrae stars. We obtained an {\it

X-rays. Rather than the X-ray burst and rapid decline near maximum radius seen
in $\delta$ Cephei itself, the X-ray flux in V473 Lyr remained constant for a
third of the pulsation cycle covered by the observation. Thus the X-rays are
most probably not produced by the changes around the pulsation cycle. The X-ray
spectrum is soft (kT = 0.6 keV), with
  X-ray properties which are consistent with a young low mass companion.
Previously there was no evidence of a companion in radial velocities or in {\it
Gaia} and {\it Hipparcos} proper motions. While this rules out companions which
are very close or very distant, a binary companion at a separation between 30
and 300 AU is possible. This is an example of an X-ray observation revealing
evidence of a low mass companion, which is important in completing the mass
ratio statistics of binary Cepheids. Furthermore, the detection of a young
X-ray bright companion is a further indication that the Cepheid (primary) is a
Population I star, even though its pulsation behavior differs from other
classical Cepheids.

representative one-hour dataset under a stable atmosphere is selected for the
characterization, including the inflow turbulent data measured from the
meteorological tower, high-resolution blade strain measurement at different
circumferential and radiation positions along the blade, and the wind turbine
operational conditions. The results indicate that the turbulent inflow
modulates the turbine blade structural response in three representative
frequency ranges: a lower frequency range (corresponding to modulations due to
large eddies in the atmosphere), a higher frequency range (corresponding to
flow structures in scales smaller than the rotor diameter), and an
intermediate-range in between. The blade structure responds strongly to the
turbulent inflow in the lower and intermediate ranges, while it is primarily
dominated by the rotation effect and other high-frequency characteristics of
wind turbines in the higher frequency range. Moreover, the blade structural
behaviors at different azimuth angles, circumferential and radial locations
along the blade are also compared, suggesting the comparatively high
possibility of structural failure at certain positions. Further, the present
study also uncovers the linkage between the turbulent inflow and blade
structural response using temporal correlation. The derived findings provide
insights into the development of advanced control strategies or blade design to
mitigate the structural impact and increase blade longevity for the safer and
more efficient operation of large-scale wind turbines.

non-isothermal DEM distribution with a dominant component centered around 0.9
MK and a secondary smaller component at 1.5 - 2.0 MK. We find that deconvolving
the data with the instrument point spread function (PSF) to account for
long-range scattered light reduces the secondary hot component. Using the 2012
Venus transit and a 2013 lunar eclipse to test the efficiency of this
deconvolution, significant amounts of residual stray light are found for the
occulted areas. Accounting for this stray light in the error budget of the
different AIA filters further reduces the secondary hot emission, yielding CH
DEM distributions that are close to isothermal with the main contribution
centered around 0.9 MK. Based on these DEMs, we analyze the evolution of the
emission measure (EM), density, and averaged temperature during the CH's
lifetime. We find that once the CH is clearly observed in EUV images, the bulk
of the CH plasma reveals a quite constant state, i.e. temperature and density
reveal no major changes, whereas the total CH area and the photospheric
magnetic fine structure inside the CH show a distinct evolutionary pattern.

set-covering formulations via dual optimal inequalities (DOI). DOI use
knowledge of the dual solution space to derive inequalities that might be
violated by intermediate solutions to a restricted master problem, and as such
are efficient at reducing the number of iterations and the oscillations of the
dual variables commonly observed in column generation procedures. We study two
novel classes of DOI which are referred to as Flexible DOI (F-DOI) and
Smooth-DOI (S-DOI), respectively (and jointly as SF-DOI). F-DOI provide rebates
for covering items more than necessary. S-DOI describe the payment of a penalty
to permit the under-coverage of items in exchange for the over-inclusion of
other items. Unlike other classes of DOI from the literature, the S-DOI and
F-DOI rely on very little to no problem-specific knowledge, and as such have
the potential to be applied to a vast number of problem domains. In particular,
we illustrate the efficiency of the new inequalities by embedding them within a
column generation solver for the single source capacitated facility location
problem (SSCFLP). A speed-up of a factor of up to 130x can be observed as when
compared to a non-stabilized variant of the same CG procedure to achieve the
linear relaxation lower bound on problems with dense columns and structured

clear evidence that the nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor interactions within
the Mn square lattice layer ($J_1$ and $J_2$) are both antiferromagnetic (AFM).
However, for all compounds studied the competing interactions have a ratio of
$2J_2/J_1 < 1$, which favors the square lattice checkerboard AFM structure over
the stripe AFM structure. The inter-plane coupling $J_c$ in all three systems
is on the order of $\sim 3\times10^{-4}J_1$, rendering the magnetic properties
of these systems with quasi-two-dimensional character. The substitution of Sb

reflected in the decrease of the N{\'e}el temperature, $T_{\rm N}$. Although
BaMnAsF shares the MnAs sheets as LaMnAsO, their $J_1$ and $J_2$ values are

forecasting and analysis of the dynamics of these processes. Within this task
lie important research questions including how to determine the qualitative
properties of the dynamics and how best to estimate quantitative indicators.
  These questions can be studied both empirically and theoretically. In the
empirical approach, one considers the real data represented by time series,
identifies patterns of their dynamics, and then forecasts short- and long-term
behavior of the process. The second approach is based on postulating the laws
of dynamics for the process, deriving mathematical dynamic models based on
these laws, and conducting subsequent analytical investigation of the dynamics
generated by the models.
  To implement these approaches, both numerical and analytical methods can be
used. It should be noted that while numerical methods make it possible to study
complex models, the possibility of obtaining reliable results using them is
significantly limited due to calculations being performed only over finite-time
intervals, numerical errors, and the unbounded space of initial data sets. In
turn, analytical methods allow researchers to overcome these problems and to
obtain exact qualitative and quantitative characteristics of the process
dynamics. However, their effective applications are often limited to
low-dimensional models. In this paper, we develop analytical methods for the
study of deterministic dynamic systems. These methods make it possible not only
to obtain analytical stability criteria and to estimate limiting behavior, but
also to overcome the difficulties related to implementing reliable numerical
analysis of quantitative indicators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed methods using the mid-size firm model suggested recently by V.I.

due to competing bond lengths (C-C, C-B, C-N, B-N, etc.) at the domain boundary
also introduce states in the gap and this is particularly evident in sheets

couplings is the nonlinear and nonlocal dependence of the exchange couplings on
gate voltages. Through a combination of electrostatic simulation and
theoretical modeling, we show that this challenge arises primarily due to
lateral shifts of the quantum dots during gate pulses. Building on this
insight, we develop two models, which can be used to predict the confinement
gate voltages for a desired set of exchange couplings. Although the model
parameters depend on the number of exchange couplings desired (suggesting that
effects in addition to lateral wavefunction shifts are important), the models
are sufficient to enable simultaneous and independent control of all three
exchange couplings in a quadruple quantum dot. We demonstrate two-, three-, and
four-spin exchange oscillations, and our data agree with simulations.

correlations, with halos having smaller than average central galaxies tending
to also have smaller total stellar mass and a larger number of satellite
galaxies. Marginalizing over total halo mass, we find the satellite galaxy

Despite its ecological importance, we do not have a unified theoretical account

criterion that predicts disparate non-straight-line walking phenomena, with
straight-line walking as a special case. We first characterized the metabolic
cost of turning, deriving the cost landscape as a function of turning radius
and rate. We then generalized this cost landscape to arbitrarily complex
trajectories, allowing the velocity direction to deviate from body orientation
(holonomic walking). We used this generalized optimality criterion to
mathematically predict movement patterns in multiple contexts of varying
complexity: walking on prescribed paths, turning in place, navigating an angled
corridor, navigating freely with end-point constraints, walking through doors,
and navigating around obstacles. In these tasks, humans moved at speeds and
paths predicted by our optimality criterion, slowing down to turn and never
using sharp turns. We show that the shortest path between two points is,
counterintuitively, often not energy optimal, and indeed, humans do not use the
shortest path in such cases. Thus, we have obtained a unified theoretical
account that predicts human walking paths and speeds in diverse contexts. Our
model focuses on walking in healthy adults; future work could generalize this

lead to stable diffeomorphism invariants and can therefore not distinguish
homeomorphic closed oriented smooth 4-manifolds and homotopy equivalent simply
connected closed oriented smooth 4-manifolds. We show that all currently known
4-dimensional field theories are semisimple, including unitary field theories,
and once-extended field theories which assign algebras or linear categories to
2-manifolds. As an application, we compute the value of a semisimple field
theory on a simply connected closed oriented 4-manifold in terms of its Euler
characteristic and signature. Moreover, we show that a semisimple 4-dimensional
field theory is invariant under $\mathbb{C}P^2$-stable diffeomorphisms if and
only if the Gluck twist acts trivially. This may be interpreted as the absence
of fermions amongst the `point particles' of the field theory. Such
fermion-free field theories cannot distinguish homotopy equivalent 4-manifolds.
Throughout, we illustrate our results with the Crane-Yetter-Kauffman field
theory associated to a ribbon fusion category. As an algebraic corollary of our
results applied to this field theory, we show that a ribbon fusion category
contains a fermionic object if and only if its Gauss sums vanish.

cyberattack-resilient load forecasting for electric utilities is both more
necessary and more challenging than ever. In this paper, we propose an
adversarial machine learning (AML) approach, which can respond to a wide range
of attack behaviors without detecting outliers. It strikes a balance between
enhancing a system's robustness against cyberattacks and maintaining a
reasonable degree of forecasting accuracy when there is no attack. Attack
models and configurations for the adversarial training were selected and
evaluated to achieve the desired level of performance in a simulation study.
The results validate the effectiveness and excellent performance of the
proposed method.

of rigid particles under external shear. This ubiquitous phenomenon has been
documented in a broad variety of multiphase particulate systems, while its
microscopic origin has been successively attributed to hydrodynamic
interactions and frictional contact between particles. The relative
contribution of these two phenomena to the magnitude of shear thickening is
still highly debated and we report here a discriminating experimental study
using a model shear-thickening suspension that allows us to tune independently
both the surface chemistry and the surface roughness of the particles. We show
here that both properties matter when it comes to continuous shear thickening
(CST) and that the presence of hydrogen bonds between the particles is
essential to achieve discontinuous shear thickening (DST) by enhancing solid
friction between closely contacting particles. Moreover, a simple argument
allows us to predict the onset of CST, which for these very rough particles
occurs at a critical volume fraction much lower than that previously reported
in the literature. Finally, we demonstrate how mixtures of particles with
opposing surface chemistry make it possible to finely tune the shear-thickening
response of the suspension at a fixed volume fraction, paving the way for a
fine control of the shear-thickening transition in engineering applications.

Over the years darknets traditionally are used for criminogenic activities and
famously acclaimed to promote cybercrime, procurements of illegal drugs, arms

censorship of digital communications, and strict policies prompted journalists

infers edges and nodes, allowing to simultaneously exploit and refine the rich,

opened up possibilities for an extreme level of quantum-state control. In this
paper, we investigate one such control protocol that demonstrates the resonant
amplification of quasimomentum pairs from a Bose-Einstein condensate by the
periodic modulation of the two-body s-wave scattering length. This shows a
capability to selectively amplify quantum fluctuations with a predetermined
momentum, where the momentum value can be spectroscopically tuned. A classical
external field that excites pairs of particles with the same energy but
opposite momenta is reminiscent of the coherently-driven nonlinearity in a
parametric amplifier crystal in nonlinear optics. For this reason, it may be
anticipated that the evolution will generate a squeezed matter-wave state in
the quasiparticle mode on resonance with the modulation frequency. Our model
and analysis is motivated by a recent experiment by Clark et al. that observed
a time-of-flight pattern similar to an exploding firework. Since the drive is a
highly coherent process, we interpret the observed firework patterns as arising
from a monotonic growth in the two-body correlation amplitude, so that the jets
should contain correlated atom pairs with nearly equal and opposite momenta. We
propose a potential future experiment based on applying Ramsey interferometry
to experimentally probe these pair correlations.

interstate conflicts on fiscal capacity in which fighting an external threat is

lead to civil wars. The theory identifies conditions under which an increased
risk of external conflict decreases the chance of civil war, which in turn
results in a government with a longer political life and with more incentives
to invest in fiscal capacity. These conditions depend on the cohesiveness of
institutions, but in a non-trivial and novel way: a higher risk of an external
conflict that results in lower political turnover, but that also makes a
foreign invasion more likely, contributes to state-building only if
institutions are sufficiently incohesive.

perspective by taking advantage of the social nature of people. We make use of
a zero-determinant (ZD) strategy for rewarding cooperation and sanctioning
defection. After proving cooperation is the dominant strategy for ZD players,
we optimize their deployment to facilitate cooperation over the whole system.
To further speed up cooperation, we derive a ZD alliance strategy for
sequential multiple-player repeated games to empower ZD players with higher
controllable leverage, which undoubtedly enriches the theoretical system of ZD
strategies and broadens their application domain. Our approach is stateless and
stable, which contributes to its scalability. Extensive simulations based on a

magnetic recording devices. This outcome results from advances in physics that
allow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal
processing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes
are used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced
binary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for
data storage and data transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained
codes that support non-binary physical substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the
currently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new
codes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These
codes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical
source of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of
parasitic capacitances in and across floating gate transistors, resulting in
charge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to
neighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called
$q$-ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes
codes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO
codes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$, of levels
per cell. For $q \geq 4$, we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater
than $0.95 \log_2 q$ information bits per coded symbol. The complexity of
encoding and decoding is modest, and reconfiguring a code is as easy as
reprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable encoding-decoding
complexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing development of
M/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the

methods can be extended to examine a more general notion of autocorrelation.

Learning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification

problems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount

highly subjective to the perception of the annotator.
  We address the first issue of feature selection by exploiting the use of
traditional MFCC features in Convolutional Neural Network. Our experiments show
that Emo-CNN consistently and significantly outperforms the popular existing
methods over multiple datasets. It achieves 90.2% categorical accuracy on the
Emo-DB dataset. To tackle the second and the more significant problem of
subjectivity in stress labels, we use Lovheim's cube, which is a 3-dimensional

these neurotransmitters and the positions of emotions in 3D space. The learnt
emotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three
component PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human

transform chemical energy to motion. Hence living systems exert active stresses
on the complex environments in which they reside. One recurring aspect of this
complexity is the viscoelasticity of the medium surrounding living systems:
bacteria secrete their own viscoelastic extracellular matrix, and cells
constantly deform, proliferate, and self-propel within viscoelastic networks of
collagen. It is therefore imperative to understand how active matter modifies,
and gets modified by, viscoelastic fluids. Here, we present a two-phase model
of active nematic matter that dynamically interacts with a passive viscoelastic
polymeric phase and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to
illustrate its applicability. Motivated by recent experiments we first study
the suppression of cell division by a viscoelastic medium surrounding the cell.
We further show that the self-propulsion of a model keratocyte cell is modified
by the polymer relaxation of the surrounding viscoelastic fluid in a
non-uniform manner and find that increasing polymer viscosity effectively
suppresses the cell motility. Lastly, we explore the hampering impact of the
viscoelastic medium on the generic hydrodynamic instabilities of active
nematics by simulating the dynamics of an active stripe within a polymeric
fluid. The model presented here can provide a framework for investigating more
complex dynamics such as the interaction of multicellular growing systems with
viscoelastic environments.

approaches model the interactions through the spatial relations between the

since the training stage of the interactions lacks effective supervision. As a
result, these models are far from promising. More intuitively, we transform the
problem into calculating the interaction-aware drivable spaces and propose the
CNN-based VisionNet for trajectory prediction. The VisionNet accepts a sequence
of motion states, i.e., location, velocity, and acceleration, to estimate the
future drivable spaces. The reified interactions significantly increase the
interpretation ability of the VisionNet and refine the prediction. To further
advance the performance, we propose an interactive loss to guide the generation
of the drivable spaces. Experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed VisionNet.

Telescope (EHT) observations of supermassive black holes. The two simulations
differ only in whether the initial angular momentum of the plasma is aligned
with the rapid (a = 0.9) spin of the black hole. Both have low net magnetic
flux. Ray tracing is employed to generate resolved images of the synchrotron
emission. When using parameters appropriate for Sgr A* and assuming a viewing
angle aligned with the black hole spin, we find the most prominent difference
is that the central shadow in the image is noticeably eccentric in tilted
models, with the ring of emission relatively unchanged. Applying this procedure
to M87 with a viewing angle based on the large-scale jet, we find that adding
tilt increases the angular size of the ring for fixed black hole mass and
distance, while at the same time increasing the number of bright spots in the
image. Our findings illustrate observable features that can distinguish tilted
from aligned flows. They also show that tilted models can be viable for M87,
and that not accounting for tilt can bias inferences of physical parameters.

angular momentum misalignment, which is likely generic at the low accretion
rates appropriate for EHT targets.

that if the tensor is compressed by a subgaussian linear mapping, then the
tensor is recoverable if the number of measurements is on the same order of
magnitude as that of the model parameters---without strong assumptions on the
latent factors. Our proof is based on deriving a \textit{restricted isometry
property} (R.I.P.) under the CPD model via set covering techniques, and thus
exhibits a flavor of classic compressive sensing. The new recoverability result
enriches the understanding to the compressed CP tensor recovery problem; it
offers theoretical guarantees for recovering tensors whose elements are not
necessarily continuous or sparse.

not allow us to quantify the signaling strength of individual instances of a

assess the distribution of ambiguity for signals, or to identify words that

Delta s (or 'delta-softmax'), to quantify signaling strength. Ranging between

high-resolution (HR) image from a given low-resolution (LR) image via learning
on LR-HR image pairs. The SR methods learned on synthetic data do not perform
well in real-world, due to the domain gap between the artificially synthesized
and real LR images. Some efforts are thus taken to capture real-world image
pairs. The captured LR-HR image pairs usually suffer from unavoidable
misalignment, which hampers the performance of end-to-end learning, however.
Here, focusing on the real-world SR, we ask a different question: since
misalignment is unavoidable, can we propose a method that does not need LR-HR
image pairing and alignment at all and utilize real images as they are? Hence
we propose a framework to learn SR from an arbitrary set of unpaired LR and HR
images and see how far a step can go in such a realistic and ""unsupervised""
setting. To do so, we firstly train a degradation generation network to
generate realistic LR images and, more importantly, to capture their
distribution (i.e., learning to zoom out). Instead of assuming the domain gap
has been eliminated, we minimize the discrepancy between the generated data and
real data while learning a degradation adaptive SR network (i.e., learning to
zoom in). The proposed unpaired method achieves state-of-the-art SR results on
real-world images, even in the datasets that favor the paired-learning methods
more.

that the STF salt should have a band structure with Dirac cones under ambient

incorporated in LIP, which can be viewed as explicit modeling of the
adversary's background knowledge. It enables the design of privacy-preserving
mechanisms leveraging the prior distribution, which can potentially achieve a
better utility-privacy tradeoff than context-free notions such as Local
Differential Privacy (LDP). We present an optimization framework to minimize
the mean square error in the data aggregation while protecting the privacy of
each individual user's input data or a correlated latent variable while
satisfying LIP constraints. Then, we study two different types of applications:
(weighted) summation and histogram estimation and derive the optimal
context-aware data perturbation parameters for each case, based on randomized
response type of mechanism. We further compare the utility-privacy tradeoff
between LIP and LDP and theoretically explain why the incorporation of prior
knowledge enlarges feasible regions of the perturbation parameters, which
thereby leads to higher utility. We also extend the LIP-based privacy
mechanisms to the more general case when exact prior knowledge is not
available. Finally, we validate our analysis by simulations using both
synthetic and real-world data. Results show that our LIP-based privacy
mechanism provides better utility-privacy tradeoffs than LDP, and the advantage
of LIP is even more significant when the prior distribution is more skewed.

procedures. Recently, deep learning networks have been widely used for various
medical image segmentation tasks, with U-Net and generative adversarial nets
(GANs) being some of the commonly used ones. Foreground-background class
imbalance is a common occurrence in medical images, and U-Net has difficulty in
handling class imbalance because of its cross entropy (CE) objective function.
Similarly, GAN also suffers from class imbalance because the discriminator
looks at the entire image to classify it as real or fake. Since the
discriminator is essentially a deep learning classifier, it is incapable of
correctly identifying minor changes in small structures. To address these
issues, we propose a novel context based CE loss function for U-Net, and a
novel architecture Seg-GLGAN. The context based CE is a linear combination of
CE obtained over the entire image and its region of interest (ROI). In
Seg-GLGAN, we introduce a novel context discriminator to which the entire image
and its ROI are fed as input, thus enforcing local context. We conduct
extensive experiments using two challenging unbalanced datasets: PROMISE12 and
ACDC. We observe that segmentation results obtained from our methods give
better segmentation metrics as compared to various baseline methods.

outlyingness. It has proved very useful and a wide range of methods have been
developed based on the concept.
  To address the well-known computational challenges associated with the depth
concept, we suggest to estimate Tukey depth contours using recently developed
incremental quantile estimators. The suggested algorithm can estimate depth
contours when the dataset in known in advance, but also recursively update and
even track Tukey depth contours for dynamically varying data stream
distributions. Tracking was demonstrated in a real-life data example where
changes in human activity was detected in real-time from accelerometer
observations.

deeper, more accurate, and efficient to train if they contain shorter
connections between layers close to the input and those close to the output. In
this paper, we embrace this observation and introduce the Dense Convolutional
Network (DenseNet), which connects each layer to every other layer in a
feed-forward fashion.Whereas traditional convolutional networks with L layers
have L connections - one between each layer and its subsequent layer - our
network has L(L+1)/2 direct connections. For each layer, the feature-maps of
all preceding layers are used as inputs, and its own feature-maps are used as
inputs into all subsequent layers. DenseNets have several compelling
advantages: they alleviate the vanishing-gradient problem, encourage feature
reuse and substantially improve parameter efficiency. We evaluate our proposed
architecture on four highly competitive object recognition benchmark tasks
(CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet). DenseNets obtain significant
improvements over the state-of-the-art on most of them, whilst requiring less
parameters and computation to achieve high performance.

variety of wireless solutions that utilize Received Signal Strength Indicators

estimation. Specifically, a mobile application is developed along with three
Bayesian filtering techniques to improve the BLE beacon proximity estimation
accuracy. This includes a Kalman filter, a particle filter, and a
Non-parametric Information (NI) filter. Since the RSSI is heavily influenced by
the environment, experiments were conducted to examine the performance of
beacons from three popular vendors in two different environments. The error is
compared in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error
(RMSE). According to the experimental results, Bayesian filters can improve
proximity estimation accuracy up to 30 % in comparison with traditional
filtering, when the beacon and the receiver are within 3 m.

studies the entrainment flow of a viscous jet emerging from a plane wall into a
half space. Methods are developed to find physically meaningful similarity
solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with finite values of mass and
momentum fluxes and having no characteristic size. Two models are considered:
flow dominated by momentum flux and flow dominated by mass flux. A new
one-parameter set of momentum-dominated similarity solutions is found. Two
linearly independent mass-dominated similarity solutions are found. Algorithms
are proposed to evaluate the parameters of the similarity models from the mass
and momentum balances. Distributions of flow parameters and stresses at the
wall are calculated for the similarity models. They are compared with the
corresponding distributions obtained by computational fluid dynamics for a more
realistic model with a finite size of the jet origin and competitive influence
of the mass and momentum fluxes. Such comparison validates the mass-dominated
similarity model at the jet Reynolds number Re <= 10 and the momentum-dominated
similarity model at Re >= 30. The obtained results are applied to the problem
of evaporation at selective laser melting. It is shown that the theoretically
estimated flow velocity corresponds to the experimentally observed one. The
theory explains formation of the experimentally observed denuded zone and its

geometrical features, unstructured meshes must be used and this unavoidably
increases the degrees of freedom and therefore makes the construction of
slave/master pairs more demanding. In this work, we introduce an implicit
material point method designed to bypass the meshing of bodies by employing
level set functions to represent boundaries at structured grids. This implicit
function representation provides an elegant mean to link an unbiased
intermediate reference surface with the true boundaries by closest point
projection as shown in leichner et al. (2019). We then enforce the contact
constraints by a penalty method where the Coulomb friction law is implemented
as an elastoplastic constitutive model such that a return mapping algorithm can
be used to provide constitutive updates for both the stick and slip states. To
evolve the geometry of the contacts properly, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation is
solved incrementally such that the level set and material points are both
updated accord to the deformation field. To improve the accuracy and regularity
of the numerical integration of the material point method, a moving least
square method is used to project numerical values of the material points back
to the standard locations for Gaussian-Legendre quadrature. Several benchmarks
are used to verify the proposed model. Comparisons with discrete element

substructures identified in the peculiar star-forming galaxy NGC5474, based on
Hubble Space Telescope resolved photometry from the LEGUS survey. NGC5474 is a
satellite of the giant spiral M101, and is known to have a prominent bulge that
is significantly off-set from the kinematic center of the underlying HI and
stellar disc. The youngest stars (age~ 100 Myr) trace a flocculent spiral
pattern extending out to ~8 kpc from the center of the galaxy. On the other
hand intermediate-age (age > 500 Myr) and old (age > 2 Gyr) stars dominate the
off-centred bulge and a large substructure residing in the South Western part
of the disc and not correlated with the spiral arms (SW over-density). The old
age of the stars in the SW over-density suggests that this may be another
signature of the dynamical interaction/s that have shaped this anomalous
galaxy. We suggest that a fly by with M101, generally invoked as the origin of
the anomalies, may not be sufficient to explain all the observations. A more
local and more recent interaction may help to put all the pieces of this
galactic puzzle together.

that offer a rare glimpse into the physical processes that govern accretion on
compact objects, massive-star winds, and stellar evolution. In a subset of the
HMXBs, the compact objects accrete matter solely from winds of massive donor
stars. These so-called wind-fed HMXBs are divided in persistent HMXBs and
supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs) according to their X-ray properties.
While it has been suggested that this dichotomy depends on the characteristics
of stellar winds, they have been poorly studied. With this investigation, we
aim to remedy this situation by systematically analyzing donor stars of
wind-fed HMXBs that are observable in the UV, concentrating on those with
neutron star (NS) companions. We obtained Swift X-ray data, HST UV spectra, and
additional optical spectra for all our targets. Our multi-wavelength approach
allows us to provide stellar and wind parameters for six donor stars (four
wind-fed systems and two OBe X-ray binaries). The wind properties are in line
with the predictions of the line-driven wind theory. Three of the donor stars
are in an advanced evolutionary stage, while for some of the stars, the
abundance pattern indicates that processed material might have been accreted.
When passing by the NS in its tight orbit, the donor star wind has not yet
reached its terminal velocity but it is still significantly slower; its speed
is comparable with the orbital velocity of the NS companion. There are no
systematic differences between the two types of wind-fed HMXBs (persistent
versus transients) with respect to the donor stars. For the SFXTs in our
sample, the orbital eccentricity is decisive for their transient X-ray nature.
Based on the orbital parameters and the further evolution of the donor stars,
the investigated HMXBs will presumably form Thorne-\.Zytkow objects in the
future.

photon detections are powerful tools in many quantum optical experiments and
other areas of applied physics. Using TCSPC, e.g., for the purpose of

losses and pile-up. We show that this limitation can be lifted by reducing the
dead-time of the timing electronics to the absolute minimum imposed by the
speed of the detector signals while maintaining high temporal resolution. A
complementing approach to speedy data acquisition is parallelization by means
of simultaneous readout of many detector channels. This puts high demands on
the data throughput of the TCSPC system, especially in time tagging of
individual photon arrivals. Here, we present a new design approach, supporting
up to 16 input channels, an extremely short dead-time of 650 ps, very high time
tagging throughput, and a timing resolution of 80 ps. In order to facilitate
remote synchronization of multiple such instruments with highest precision, the
new TCSPC electronics provide an interface for White Rabbit fiber optic
networks. Beside fundamental research in the field of astronomy, such remote
synchronization tasks arise routinely in quantum communication networks with
node to node distances on the order of tens of kilometers. In addition to
showing design features and benchmark results of new TCSPC electronics, we
present application results from spectrally resolved and high-speed

pulse-pile-up occurring in the detector signals at high photon flux can be

considered by Ferrari, Goldstein and Lebowitz (Progr. Phys., 1985) as a test
for the validity of the Einstein relation in microscopic systems.
  The main thrust of this work is an exact solution for the steady state of
this exclusion process. We show that the stationary probabilities factorize and
give an exact formula for the nonequilibrium partition function. Perhaps
surprisingly, we find that the nonequilibrium free energy in the steady state
is not well-defined for this system in the thermodynamic limit for any values
of $p$ and $q$ if $p \neq q$. We provide formulas for the current and two-point
correlations. When the tracer particle performs asymmetric exclusion ($q=0$),
the results are shown to simplify significantly and we find an unexpected
connection with the combinatorics of set partitions. Finally, we study the
system from the point of view of the tracer particle, the so-called environment
process. In the environment process, we show that the density of particles
decays exponentially with the scaled position in front of the tracer particle

are investigated in a turbulent flow with and without stable stratification
through the time evolution equation of the TNTI area. We show that both terms
have broad distributions and may locally contribute to either production or
destruction. On average, however, the area growth is driven by stretching,
which is approximately balanced by destruction by the curvature/propagation
term. To investigate the contribution of different length scales to these
processes, we apply spatial filtering to the data. In doing so, we find that
the averages of the stretching and the curvature/propagation terms balance out
across spatial scales of TNTI wrinkles and this scale-by-scale balance is
consistent with an observed scale invariance of the nearby coherent vortices.
Through a conditional analysis, we demonstrate that the TNTI area production
(destruction) localizes at the front (lee) edge of the vortical structures in
the interface proximity. Finally, we show that while basic mechanisms remain
the same, increasing stratification reduces the rates at which TNTI surface
area is produced as well as destroyed. We provide evidence that this reduction
is largely connected to a change in the multiscale geometry of the interface,
which tends to flatten in the wall-normal direction at all active length scales

oscillations of the candidate topological nodal line semimetal CaAgAs using
torque measurements in magnetic fields up to 45 T. Our results are compared
with calculations for a toroidal Fermi surface originating from the nodal ring.
We find evidence of a nontrivial Berry phase shift only in one of the

semi-classical electronic Landau orbit which links with the nodal ring when the
magnetic field lies in the mirror (ab) plane. Furthermore, additional Berry
phase accumulates while rotating the magnetic field for the second orbit in the
same orientation which does not link with the nodal ring. These effects are
expected in CaAgAs due to the lack of inversion symmetry. Our study
experimentally demonstrates that CaAgAs is an ideal platform for exploring the
physics of nodal line semimetals and our approach can be extended to other
materials in which trivial and nontrivial oscillations are present.

paradigm shift in the way models are trained. The lucrative benefits of
improved accuracy and reduced training time have shown promise in training
models with constrained computational resources and fewer training samples.
Specifically, publicly available text-based models such as GloVe and BERT that
are trained on large corpus of datasets have seen ubiquitous adoption in
practice. In this paper, we ask, ""can transfer learning in text prediction
models be exploited to perform misclassification attacks?"" As our main
contribution, we present novel attack techniques that utilize unintended
features learnt in the teacher (public) model to generate adversarial examples
for student (downstream) models. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the
first work to show that transfer learning from state-of-the-art word-based and
sentence-based teacher models increase the susceptibility of student models to
misclassification attacks. First, we propose a novel word-score based attack
algorithm for generating adversarial examples against student models trained
using context-free word-level embedding model. On binary classification tasks
trained using the GloVe teacher model, we achieve an average attack accuracy of
97% for the IMDB Movie Reviews and 80% for the Fake News Detection. For
multi-class tasks, we divide the Newsgroup dataset into 6 and 20 classes and
achieve an average attack accuracy of 75% and 41% respectively. Next, we
present length-based and sentence-based misclassification attacks for the Fake
News Detection task trained using a context-aware BERT model and achieve 78%

designing training techniques that are robust to unintended feature learning,

is referred to as the test oracle problem and is one of the key remaining

  To achieve this, we use supervised learning over test execution traces. We
label a small fraction of the execution traces with their verdict of pass or
fail. We use the labelled traces to train a neural network (NN) model to learn
to distinguish runtime patterns for passing versus failing executions for a
given program. Our approach for building this NN model involves the following
steps, 1. Instrument the program to record execution traces as sequences of
method invocations and global state, 2. Label a small fraction of the execution
traces with their verdicts, 3. Designing a NN component that embeds information
in execution traces to fixed length vectors, 4. Design a NN model that uses the
trace information for classification, 5. Evaluate the inferred classification
model on unseen execution traces from the program.

show that the proposed neural network model is highly effective as a test

upturn, an unexpected excess of ultraviolet flux from a hot stellar component,
seen in the spectra of many early-type galaxies, arises from processes internal
to individual galaxies with no measurable influence from the galaxies' larger
environment. We first define a clean sample of passive galaxies without a
significant contribution to their UV flux from low-level star formation. We
confirm that galaxies with the optical colours of red sequence galaxies often
have signs of residual star formation, which, without other information, would
prevent a convincing demonstration of the presence of UV upturns. However, by
including (NUV$-u$) and {\it WISE} (W2-W3) colours, and FUV data where it
exists, we can convincingly constrain samples to be composed of
non-star-forming objects. Using such a sample, we examine GALEX photometry of
low redshift GAMA galaxies in a range of low-density environments, from groups
to the general field, searching for UV upturns. We find a wide range of
(NUV$-r$) colours, entirely consistent with the range seen -- and attributed to
the UV upturn -- in low-redshift red sequence cluster galaxies. The range of
colours is independent of group multiplicity or velocity dispersion, with
isolated passive galaxies just as likely to have blue UV-to-optical colours,
implying significant upturn components, as those in richer groups and in the
previous data on clusters. This is supported by equivalent results for
(FUV$-r$) colours which are clear indicators of upturn components.

unprocessed data set with a given related, but different labelled data set.
Subspace alignment (SA), a representative DA algorithm, attempts to find a
linear transformation to align the subspaces of the two different data sets.
The classifier trained on the aligned labelled data set can be transferred to
the unlabelled data set to predict the target labels. In this paper, two
quantum versions of the SA are proposed to implement the DA procedure on
quantum devices. One method, the quantum subspace alignment algorithm (QSA),
achieves quadratic speedup in the number and dimension of given samples. The
other method, the variational quantum subspace alignment algorithm (VQSA), can
be implemented on the near term quantum devices through a variational hybrid
quantum-classical procedure. The results of the numerical experiments on
different types of datasets demonstrate that the VQSA can achieve competitive
performance compared with the corresponding classical algorithm.

from the reference high-resolution Saturn simulation obtained by global climate
modelling in Part II. In the steady state of this reference simulation,
strongly energetic, zonally dominated, large-scale structures emerge, which
scale with the Rhines scale. Spectral analysis reveals a strong anisotropy in
the kinetic energy spectra, consistent with the zonostrophic turbulent flow
regime. By computing spectral energy and enstrophy fluxes we confirm the
existence of a double cascade scenario related to 2D-turbulent theory. To
diagnose the relevant 3D dynamical mechanisms in Saturn's turbulent atmosphere,
we run a set of four simulations using an idealized version of our Global
Climate Model devoid of radiative transfer, with a well-defined Taylor-Green
forcing and over several rotation rates (4, 1, 0.5, and 0.25 times Saturn's
rotation rate). This allows us to identify dynamics in three distinctive
inertial ranges: (1) a ``residual-dominated'' range, in which non-axisymmetric
structures dominate with a -5/3 spectral slope; (2) a ``zonostrophic inertial''
range, dominated by axisymmetric jets and characterized by the pile-up of
strong zonal modes with a steeper, nearly -3, spectral slope; and (3) a
``large-scale'' range, beyond Rhines' typical length scale, in which the
reference Saturn simulation and our idealized simulations differ. In the latter
range, the dynamics is dominated by long-lived zonal modes 2 and 3 when a
Saturn-like seasonal forcing is considered (reference simulation), and a steep
energetic decrease with the idealized Taylor-Green forcing. Finally,
instantaneous spectral fluxes show the coexistence of upscale and downscale
enstrophy/energy transfers at large scales, specific to the regime of
zonostrophic turbulence in a 3D atmosphere.

consisting of an IoT device that aims to update its measurement to a
destination using cognitive radio technique. Specifically, the IoT device as a
secondary user (SIoT), seeks and exploits the spectrum opportunities of the
licensed band vacated by its primary user (PU) to deliver status updates
without causing visible effects to the licensed operation. In this context, the
SIoT should carefully make use of the licensed band and schedule when to
transmit to maintain the timeliness of the status update. We adopt a recent
metric, Age of Information (AoI), to characterize the timeliness of the status
update of the SIoT. We aim to minimize the long-term average AoI of the SIoT
while satisfying the collision constraint imposed by the PU by formulating a
constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. We first prove the
existence of optimal stationary policy of the CMDP problem. The optimal
stationary policy (termed age-optimal policy) is shown to be a randomized
simple policy that randomizes between two deterministic policies with a fixed
probability. We prove that the two deterministic policies have a threshold
structure and further derive the closed-form expression of average AoI and
collision probability for the deterministic threshold-structured policy by
conducting Markov Chain analysis. The analytical expression offers an efficient
way to calculate the threshold and randomization probability to form the
age-optimal policy. For comparison, we also consider the throughput
maximization policy (termed throughput-optimal policy) and analyze the average
AoI performance under the throughput-optimal policy in the considered system.
Numerical simulations show the superiority of the derived age-optimal policy
over the throughput-optimal policy. We also unveil the impacts of various
system parameters on the corresponding optimal policy and the resultant average
AoI.

The desired properties of a bootstrap test can be derived, that are asymptotic

every locally compact group $G$, there exists a critical constant $p_G \in
[0,\infty]$ such that $G$ admits a continuous affine isometric action on an
$L_p$ space ($0<p<\infty$) with unbounded orbits if and only if $p \geq p_G$. A
similar result holds for the existence of proper continuous affine isometric
actions on $L_p$ spaces. Using a representation of cohomology by harmonic
cocycles, we also show that such unbounded orbits cannot occure when the linear
part comes from a measure preserving action, or more generally a
state-preserving action on a von Neumann algebra and $p>2$. We also prove the
stability of this critical constant $p_G$ under $L_p$ measure equivalence,
answering a question of Fisher. We use this to show that for every connected
semisimple Lie group $G$ and for every lattice $\Gamma < G$, we have
$p_\Gamma=p_G$.

signalized traffic operations management. Specifically, we focus on predicting
sensor states in high-resolution (second-by-second). This contrasts with
traditional traffic forecasting problems, which have focused on predicting
aggregated traffic variables, typically over intervals that are no shorter than
5 minutes. Our contributions can be summarized as offering three insights:
first, we show how the prediction problem can be modeled as a matrix completion
problem. Second, we employ a block-coordinate descent algorithm and demonstrate
that the algorithm converges in sub-linear time to a block coordinate-wise
optimizer. This allows us to capitalize on the ""bigness"" of high-resolution
data in a computationally feasible way. Third, we develop an ensemble learning
(or adaptive boosting) approach to reduce the training error to within any
arbitrary error threshold. The latter utilizes past days so that the boosting
can be interpreted as capturing periodic patterns in the data. The performance
of the proposed method is analyzed theoretically and tested empirically using
both simulated data and a real-world high-resolution traffic dataset from Abu

and nonlinear stability criteria without solving an eigenvalue problem. In a
magnetically confined plasma, the available energy is determined by the density

what constraints limit the possible forms of plasma motion, such as the
conservation of adiabatic invariants and the requirement that the transport be
ambipolar. A general method based on Lagrange multipliers is devised to
incorporate such constraints in the calculation of the available energy, and
several particular cases are discussed. In particular, it is shown that it is

language processing tasks including named entity recognition. The shortcoming
is that a large amount of manually-annotated data is usually required. Previous
studies have demonstrated that active learning could elaborately reduce the
cost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. In
real applications we found existing uncertainty-based active learning
strategies have two shortcomings. Firstly, these strategies prefer to choose
long sequence explicitly or implicitly, which increase the annotation burden of
annotators. Secondly, some strategies need to invade the model and modify to
generate some additional information for sample selection, which will increase
the workload of the developer and increase the training/prediction time of the
model. In this paper, we first examine traditional active learning strategies
in a specific case of BiLstm-CRF that has widely used in named entity
recognition on several typical datasets. Then we propose an uncertainty-based
active learning strategy called Lowest Token Probability (LTP) which combines
the input and output of CRF to select informative instance. LTP is simple and
powerful strategy that does not favor long sequences and does not need to
invade the model. We test LTP on multiple datasets, and the experiments show
that LTP performs slightly better than traditional strategies with obviously
less annotation tokens on both sentence-level accuracy and entity-level

pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the

Fast Neural Network Adaptation (FNA) method, which can adapt both the

conduct FNA on MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for both segmentation and

However, the state-of-the-art NIR sensors made of germanium (Ge) suffer from
rather poor response, largely due to high reflection from the illuminated

sensors by implementing nanostructures to the wafer surfaces. The absorbance of
nanostructured Ge wafers is measured to be >99 % in the whole UV-VIS-NIR
spectrum up to 1600 nm wavelength, which is a significant improvement to bare
Ge wafers that reach absorption of only 63 % in maximum. The process is shown
to be capable of producing uniform nanostructures covering full 100-mm-diameter
substrates as well as wafers with etch mask openings of different sizes and

results imply that nanostructured Ge has potential to revolutionize the

before the emergence of genetic encoding, reaction networks of diverse small
chemicals might have manifested key properties of life, namely self-propagation
and adaptive evolution. To explore this possibility, we formalize the dynamics
of chemical reaction networks within the framework of chemical ecosystem
ecology. To capture the idea that life-like chemical systems are maintained out
of equilibrium by fluxes of energy-rich food chemicals, we model chemical
ecosystems in well-mixed containers that are subject to constant dilution by a
solution with a fixed concentration of food chemicals. Modelling all chemical
reactions as fully reversible, we show that seeding an autocatalytic cycle (AC)
with tiny amounts of one or more of its member chemicals results in logistic
growth of all member chemicals in the cycle. This finding justifies drawing an
instructive analogy between an AC and the population of a biological species.
We extend this finding to show that pairs of ACs can show competitive,
predator-prey, or mutualistic associations just like biological species.
Furthermore, when there is stochasticity in the environment, particularly in
the seeding of ACs, chemical ecosystems can show complex dynamics that can
resemble evolution. The evolutionary character is especially clear when the
network architecture results in ecological precedence (survival of the first),
which makes the path of succession historically contingent on the order in
which cycles are seeded. For all its simplicity, the framework developed here
is helpful for visualizing how autocatalysis in prebiotic chemical reaction
networks can yield life-like properties. Furthermore, chemical ecosystem
ecology could provide a useful foundation for exploring the emergence of
adaptive dynamics and the origins of polymer-based genetic systems.

of subhalos in our own Galaxy not massive enough to retain baryons and become
visible. Yet, some of them may shine in gamma rays provided that the dark
matter (DM) is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), that would
self-annihilate and would appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources (unIDs) in
gamma-ray catalogs. Indeed, unIDs have proven to be competitive targets for DM
searches with gamma rays. In this work, we focus on the three high-latitude
($|b|\geq 10^\circ$) sources present in the 2HWC catalog of the High Altitude
Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory with no associations at other wavelenghts.
Indeed, only one of these sources, 2HWC J1040+308, is found to be above the
HAWC detection threshold when considering 760 days of data, a factor 1.5 more
exposure time than in the original 2HWC catalog. Other instruments such as
Fermi-LAT or VERITAS at lower energies do not detect this source. Also, this
unID is reported as spatially extended, making it even more interesting in a DM
search context. While waiting for more data that may shed further light on the
nature of this source, we set competitive upper limits on the annihilation
cross section by comparing this HAWC unID to expectations based on
state-of-the-art N-body cosmological simulations of the Galactic subhalo
population. We find these constraints to be particularly competitive for heavy
WIMPs, i.e., masses above $\sim 25$ (40) TeV in the case of the $b\bar{b}$
($\tau^+\tau^-$) annihilation channel, reaching velocity-averaged cross section
values of $2\cdot10^{-25}$ ($5\cdot10^{-25}$) $cm^3s^{-1}$. Although far from
the thermal relic cross section value, the obtained limits are independent and
nicely complementary to those from radically different DM analyses and targets,
demonstrating again the high potential of this DM search approach.

parametrization for automatically selected patches of input triangles, which
makes each patch amenable to remeshing by standard finite element meshing
algorithms. Using only geometrical arguments, we prove that a discrete

parameter space is such that all parametric triangles have a positive area. We
then derive a non-standard linear discretization scheme based on mean value
coordinates to compute such one-to-one parametrizations, and show that the
scheme does not discretize a Laplacian on a structured mesh. The proposed
pipeline is implemented in the open source mesh generator Gmsh, where the
creation of suitable patches is based on triangulation topology and
parametrization quality, combined with feature edge detection. Several examples
illustrate the robustness of the resulting implementation.

confinement, the pressure tensor and the heat flux contain, in addition to the
terms associated to the motion of the particles, collisional transfer
contributions, similar to those that appear beyond the dilute limit. The
complexity of these terms, and of the kinetic equation itself, compromise the
potential of the equation to describe the rich phenomenology observed in this
kind of systems. For this reason, a simpler model equation based on the
Boltzmann equation is proposed. The model is formulated to keep the main
properties of the underlying equation, and it is expected to provide relevant
information in more general states than the original equation. As an
illustration, the solution describing a macroscopic state with uniform
temperature, but a density gradient perpendicular to the plates is considered.
This is the equilibrium state for an elastic system, and the inhomogeneous
cooling state for the case of inelastic hard spheres. The results are in good
agreement with previous results obtained directly from the Boltzmann equation.

invalidate static analysis assumptions: programmable linking breaks reasoning
about method resolution while dynamically generated code is, by definition, not

predictively model uses of invokedynamic while also cooperating with extra

an existing static analysis and helps eliminate all unsoundness in the handling

limited number of strong, characteristic, bands at different wavelengths.
  Distortion is only one instance of ``defects'' that enrich the vis/UV

in interstices, impurities, dangling bonds. The accumulation of these result in
an ``amorphous'' structural state. Several examples of known amorphous

can offload the traffic in their coverage areas from the BS. We consider the
joint optimization of the abovementioned file placement and delivery within a
finite lifetime subject to the cache space constraint. Within the lifetime, the
allocation of multicast power and symbol number for each file transmission at
the BS is formulated as a dynamic programming problem with a random stage
number. Note that there are no existing solutions to this problem. We develop
an asymptotically optimal solution framework by transforming the original
problem to an equivalent finite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) with a
fixed stage number. A novel approximation approach is then proposed to address
the curse of dimensionality, where the analytical expressions of approximate
value functions are provided. We also derive analytical bounds on the exact
value function and approximation error. The approximate value functions depend
on some system statistics, e.g., requesting users' distribution. One
reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for the scenario where these
statistics are unknown.

to make the columns of the factor matrix sparse, thereby achieving a purpose of
low rank, which means no Singular Value Decompositions (SVD) are required and
the computational complexity of each step is greatly reduced. We obtain
affinity matrices by using different LRR models and then performing cluster
testing on different sets of synthetic noisy data and real data, respectively.
Compared with traditional models and algorithms, the proposed method is faster
and more robust to noise, so the final clustering results are better. Moreover,
the numerical results show that our algorithm converges fast and only requires

to steepening of the photon index. However, the variation of the coronal
temperature with flux has been difficult to measure due to the presence of
complex reflection component in the hard X-rays and the lack of high-quality
data at that energy band. Recently, a 200 ks {\it NuSTAR} observation of Ark

shows that the coronal temperature decreased from $\sim 17$ to $\sim 14$ keV as

is performed in this work for turbulent Couette flow at low Reynolds number.
Data from a direct numerical simulation of a minimal flow unit, at Reynolds
number 400, is post-processed using Fourier analysis in both time and space,
leading to the covariance matrix of the velocity. From the same data, we
computed the non-linear terms of the Navier-Stokes equations (treated as
forcing in the present formulation), which allowed us to compute the covariance
matrix of the forcing for this case. The two covariances are related exactly by
the resolvent operator; based on this, we explore the recovery of the velocity
statistics from the statistics of the forcing as a function of the components
of the forcing term. This is carried out for the dominant structures in this
flow, which participate in the self-sustaining cycle of turbulence: (i)
streamwise vortices and streaks, and (ii) spanwise coherent fluctuations of
spanwise velocity. The present results show a dominance by four of the
non-linear terms for the prediction of the full statistics of streamwise
vortices and streaks; a single term is seen to be dominant for spanwise
motions. A relevant feature observed in these cases is that forcing terms have
significant coherence in space; moreover, different forcing components are also

various timespans. Eight candidate planets require additional observation to be
confirmed. We also confirm three previously reported planets. Among the new
planets, GJ 180 d and GJ 229A c are super-Earths located in the conservative
habitable zones of their host stars. We investigate their dynamical stability
using the Monte Carlo approach and find both planetary orbits are robust to the
gravitational perturbations of the companion planets. Due to their proximity to
the Sun, the angular separation between the host stars and the potentially
habitable planets in these two systems is 25 and 59 mas, respectively. They are
thus good candidates for future direct imaging by JWST and E-ELT. In addition
we find GJ 433 c, a cold super-Neptune belonging to an unexplored population of
Neptune-like planets. With a separation of 0.5 as from its host star, GJ 433 c
is probably the first realistic candidate for direct imaging of cold Neptunes.
A comprehensive survey of these planets is important for the studies of planet

framework for modeling linear or non-linear long range dependent time series.
We investigate the spectral estimation, either pointwise or broadband, of long
range dependent discrete-time trawl processes. The difficulty arising from the
variety of seed processes and of trawl sequences is twofold. First, the
spectral density may take different forms, often including smooth additive
correction terms. Second, trawl processes with similar spectral densities may
exhibit very different statistical behaviors. We prove the consistency of our
estimators under very general conditions and we show that a wide class of trawl
processes satisfy them. This is done in particular by introducing a weighted
weak dependence index that can be of independent interest. The broadband
spectral estimator includes an estimator of the long memory parameter. We
complete this work with numerical experiments to evaluate the finite sample

physical properties of radio jets as function of their radio power will be
discussed together with the advance made in understanding the life-cycle of
radio sources. The evolutionary stage (e.g. newly born, dying, restarted) of
the radio AGN can be derived from their morphology and properties of the radio
spectra. The possibilities offered by the new generation of low-frequency radio
telescopes make it possible to derive (at least to first order) the time-scale

the program diverges from its ideal execution assuming real arithmetic. This
phenomenon is caused by the presence of round-off errors that affect the
evaluation of arithmetic expressions occurring in conditional statements.
Unstable tests may lead to significant errors in safety-critical applications
that depend on numerical computations. Writing programs that take into
consideration test instability is a difficult task that requires expertise on
finite precision computations and rounding errors. This paper presents a
toolchain to automatically generate and verify a provably correct test-stable

input is a real-valued program written in the Prototype Verification System
(PVS) specification language and the output is a transformed floating-point C
program annotated with ANSI/ISO C Specification Language (ACSL) contracts.
These contracts relate the floating-point program to its functional
specification in real arithmetic. The transformed program detects if unstable

approach that combines the Frama-C analyzer, the PRECiSA round-off error
estimator, and PVS is proposed to automatically verify that the generated

unsuitable for rural communities where Internet infrastructure is lacking, and
power outages are frequent. This paper explores the rural connectivity problem
in the context of remote patient monitoring and analyzes the feasibility of
utilizing a delay tolerant network (DTN) architecture that leverages the social
behaviors of rural community members to enable out-of-range monitoring of
patients in rural communities without local transportation systems. The
feasibility is characterized using delivery latency and delivery rate with the
number of participants and the number of sources as variables. The architecture
is evaluated for Owingsville, KY using U.S. Census Bureau, the National Cancer
Institute's, and IPUMS ATUS sample data. The findings show that within a 24
hour window, there is an exponential relationship between the number of
participants in the network and the delivery rate with a minimal delivery of
38.7%, a maximal delivery rate of a 100% and an overall average delivery rate
of 89.8%.

is a gut related disorder where the deviations from the healthy gut microbiome

algorithms, i) to generate a classification model that aids IBD diagnosis, ii)
to discover IBD associated biomarkers, iii) to find subgroups of IBD patients
using k means and hierarchical clustering. To deal with the high dimensionality
of features, we applied robust feature selection algorithms such as Conditional

our experiments with 10 fold cross validation, XGBoost had a considerable

tackle the challenge of dynamically representing users' interests based on

applied to any existing deep CTR models by leveraging the additional

Logs help practitioners understand system runtime behaviors and diagnose field

needed to assist practitioners in their software operation and maintenance
efforts. Typically, the first step of automated log analysis is log parsing,
i.e., converting unstructured raw logs into structured data. However, log
parsing is challenging, because logs are produced by static templates in the
source code (i.e., logging statements) yet the templates are usually
inaccessible when parsing logs. Prior work proposed automated log parsing
approaches that have achieved high accuracy. However, as the volume of logs
grows rapidly in the era of cloud computing, efficiency becomes a major concern
in log parsing. In this work, we propose an automated log parsing approach,
Logram, which leverages n-gram dictionaries to achieve efficient log parsing.
We evaluated Logram on 16 public log datasets and compared Logram with five
state-of-the-art log parsing approaches. We found that Logram achieves a
similar parsing accuracy to the best existing approaches while outperforms
these approaches in efficiency (i.e., 1.8 to 5.1 times faster than the second
fastest approaches). Furthermore, we deployed Logram on Spark and we found that
Logram scales out efficiently with the number of Spark nodes (e.g., with
near-linear scalability) without sacrificing parsing accuracy. In addition, we
demonstrated that Logram can support effective online parsing of logs,
achieving similar parsing results and efficiency with the offline mode.

neurologic, and developmental disorders in children. In this paper we present
an automated segmentation and surface extraction pipeline designed to
accommodate clinical MRI studies of infant brains in a population 0-2
year-olds. The algorithm relies on a single channel of T1-weighted MR images to
achieve automated segmentation of cortical and subcortical brain areas,
producing volumes of subcortical structures and surface models of the cerebral
cortex. We evaluated the algorithm both qualitatively and quantitatively using
manually labeled datasets, relevant comparator software solutions cited in the
literature, and expert evaluations. The computational tools and atlases
described in this paper will be distributed to the research community as part
of the FreeSurfer image analysis package.

crafted geometric manipulation in the input domain can fool deep face
recognition models. We propose three different approaches to generate
manipulated faces in which two of them perform the manipulations via

the manipulated faces provides a more robust landmark detection approach which
is able to capture more important deformations and variations of the face

review highlights core characteristics of quantum mechanics. One is statistical
balance in the collective response of an ensemble of identically prepared
systems, to differing measurement types. Another is that states are
mathematical terms prescribing probability aspects of future events, relating
to an ensemble of systems, in various situations. These characteristics then
yield helpful insights on entanglement, measurement, and widely-discussed
experiments and analyses. The review concludes by considering how these
insights are supported, illustrated and developed by some specific approaches
to understanding quantum mechanics. The review uses non-mathematical language
precisely (terms defined) and rigorously (consistent meanings), and uses only
such language. A theory more descriptive of independent reality than is quantum
mechanics may yet be possible. One step in the pursuit of such a theory is to
reach greater consensus on how to understand quantum mechanics. This review
aims to contribute to achieving that greater consensus, and so to that pursuit.

a field of ellipses, indicating at each point of a geographical map the

extensively, from a mathematical viewpoint, the distortion of mappings from the

equal to about 400 C. XRD graph reveals that the grown films were
polycrystalline in nature with a dominant peak corresponding to (0 0 2) plane.
Despite the difference in the ionic radii of the Na and Zn, an angle shift in

restricting the DoF (degrees of freedom) of the latched ""dummy"" platform.
Since, the robotic boat may drive it in narrow water canals and must prevent it
from drifting and hitting the wall.
  This novel adaptive latching mechanism is based on the ball and socket joint
that allows rotation and free movements in two planes at the same time. It
consists of two parts: the male part that includes a bearing stud (ball)
integrated on the floating bin ""dummy"" and the female part located on the

the male ball into an actuated receptor that traps the ball, creating the

VLSI implementations with analog resistive memory, by which ultra-high energy
efficiency can be achieved. We also propose several techniques to improve the
performance on a recognition task, and show that the classification accuracy of
the proposed algorithm is as high as that of the state-of-the-art temporal
coding SNN algorithms on the MNIST dataset. Finally, we discuss the robustness
of the proposed SNNs against variations that arise from the device
manufacturing process and are unavoidable in analog VLSI implementation. We
also propose a technique to suppress the effects of variations in the
manufacturing process on the recognition performance.

images using a deep learning-based approach. Segmentation of such lesions can
present a pivotal step towards enhanced therapy planning and validation, as
well as intervention support during minimally invasive and image-guided
surgeries like radiofrequency ablations. For this purpose, we used a U-Net like
architecture trained with 40 clinical cases including both, lytic and sclerotic
lesion types and various MR sequences. Our proposed method was evaluated with
regards to various factors influencing the segmentation quality, e.g. the used
MR sequences and the input dimension. We quantitatively assessed our
experiments using Dice coefficients, sensitivity and specificity rates.
Compared to expertly annotated lesion segmentations, the experiments yielded
promising results with average Dice scores up to 77.6% and mean sensitivity
rates up to 78.9%. To our best knowledge, our proposed study is one of the
first to tackle this particular issue, which limits direct comparability with
related works. In respect to similar deep learning-based lesion segmentations,
e.g. in liver MR images or spinal CT images, our experiments showed similar or
in some respects superior segmentation quality. Overall, our automatic approach
can provide almost expert-like segmentation accuracy in this challenging and
ambitious task.

the frequency domain. Generally, the formulas of the elasticity tensor in the
perfectly matched layers are derived from the transformed momentum equation. In
this note, we proved that the transformed elasticity tensor derived in this way
lost its symmetry. Therefore, these formulas are inconsistency in theory and
it's hard to explain its numerical performance. We present a new symmetrical
formula of elasticity tensor from the weak form. So the theory of elasticity is

migration is the recommended approach. The existence of an inverse of the
forward modelling operator would considerably reduce the number of required
iterations. In the context of the extended model, such a pseudo-inverse exists,
built as a weighted version of the adjoint and accounts for the deconvolution,
geometrical spreading and uneven illumination. The application of the
pseudo-inverse Born modelling is based on constant density acoustic media,
which is a limiting factor for practical applications. To consider density
perturbation, we propose and investigate two approaches. The first one is a
generalization of a recent study proposing to recover acoustic perturbations
from angle-dependent response of the pseudo-inverse Born modelling operator.
The new version is based on weighted least-squares objective function. The
method not only provides more robust results, but also offers the flexibility
to include constrains in the objective function in order to reduce the
parameters cross-talk. We also propose an alternative approach based on Taylor
expansion that does not require any Radon transform. Numerical examples based
on simple and the Marmousi2 models using correct and incorrect background
models for the variable density Born modelling, verify the effectiveness of the
weighted least-squares method when compared with the other two approaches. The
Taylor expansion approach appears to contain too many artifacts for a
successful applicability.

between experiments were made using a universal reference scale based on the
relative difference to simulated proton and iron initiated air showers. We have
applied a cross-calibration of energy scales between experiments based on the
isotropic flux of cosmic rays as a reference. Above 10 PeV, most experimental
data show a muon excess with respect to simulated air showers, including those
performed with the recent post-LHC high-energy interaction models. The

states in strongly-connected trackable weak models. Here, a weak model is a
directed graph in which each node is assigned a set of colors which may be
emitted when that node is visited. A hypothesis is a node sequence which is
consistent with a given color sequence. A weak model is said to be trackable if
the worst case number of such hypotheses grows as a polynomial in the sequence
length. We show that the number of hypotheses in strongly-connected trackable
models is bounded by a constant and give an expression for this constant. We
also consider the problem of reconstructing which branch was taken at a node
with same-colored out-neighbors, and show that it is always eventually possible
to identify which branch was taken if the model is strongly connected and
trackable. We illustrate these properties by assigning transition probabilities
and employing standard tools for analyzing Markov chains. In addition, we
present new results for the entropy rates of weak models according to whether
they are trackable or not. These theorems indicate that the combination of
trackability and strong connectivity dramatically simplifies the task of
reconstructing which nodes were visited. This work has implications for any
problem which can be described in terms of an agent traversing a colored graph,
such as the reconstruction of hidden states in a hidden Markov model (HMM).

  Cholesky Factorization",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Geostatistics represents one of the most challenging classes of scientific
applications due to the desire to incorporate an ever increasing number of
geospatial locations to accurately model and predict environmental phenomena.
For example, the evaluation of the Gaussian log-likelihood function, which
constitutes the main computational phase, involves solving systems of linear
equations with a large dense symmetric and positive definite covariance matrix.
Cholesky, the standard algorithm, requires O(n^3) floating point operators and
has an O(n^2) memory footprint, where n is the number of geographical
locations. Here, we present a mixed-precision tile algorithm to accelerate the
Cholesky factorization during the log-likelihood function evaluation. Under an
appropriate ordering, it operates with double-precision arithmetic on tiles
around the diagonal, while reducing to single-precision arithmetic for tiles
sufficiently far off. This translates into an improvement of the performance
without any deterioration of the numerical accuracy of the application. We rely
on the StarPU dynamic runtime system to schedule the tasks and to overlap them
with data movement. To assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed
mixed-precision algorithm, we use synthetic and real datasets on various shared
and distributed-memory systems possibly equipped with hardware accelerators. We
compare our mixed-precision Cholesky factorization against the double-precision
reference implementation as well as an independent block approximation method.
We obtain an average of 1.6X performance speedup on massively parallel
architectures while maintaining the accuracy necessary for modeling and
prediction.
