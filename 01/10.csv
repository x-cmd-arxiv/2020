segments that were observed simultaneously and, if combined, cover the range
between $\sim$300 nm and $\sim$2.45 $\mu$m at a spectral resolving power close
to $R=10\,000$. The spectra were corrected for instrument transmission and
telluric absorption, and they were also corrected for wavelength-dependent
flux-losses in 85% of the cases. On average, synthesized broad-band colors
agree with those of the MILES library and of the combined IRTF and Extended
IRTF libraries to within $\sim\!1$%. The scatter in these comparisons indicates
typical errors on individual colors in the XSL of 2$-$4 %. The comparison with
2MASS point source photometry shows systematics of up to 5% in some colors,
which we attribute mostly to zero-point or transmission curve errors and a
scatter that is consistent with the above uncertainty estimates. The final
spectra were corrected for radial velocity and are provided in the rest-frame
(with wavelengths in air). The spectra cover a large range of spectral types
and chemical compositions (with an emphasis on the red giant branch), which
makes this library an asset when creating stellar population synthesis models

outside a compact subset of the interval $(0,1)$ (to avoid boundary
contributions which are incompatible with inviscid damping). We also assume

then the velocity field $u$ converges strongly to a nearby shear flow as the
time goes to infinity. This is the first nonlinear asymptotic stability result

explicitly addresses these practical metrics by considering the

the number of parameters on the HardNet model, 13 times reduction in the
computational complexity, while sacrificing less than 1% on the overall

an intriguing open question whether there exists an $O(1)$-competitive

under the reweighted or matched distribution, P . The choice of P is important
and can impact the interpretation of the effect estimate and the variance of

distribution that simultaneously maximizes coverage and minimizes variance of

generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model called the Counterfactual
$\chi$-GAN (cGAN), which also learns feature-balancing weights and supports
unbiased causal estimation in the absence of unobserved confounding. Our model
minimizes the Pearson $\chi^2$ divergence, which we show simultaneously
maximizes coverage and minimizes the variance of importance sampling estimates.

objects since the beginning of exoplanet characterization. Transmission
observations of this system between the mid infrared and the far ultraviolet
have revealed the signature of atomic, molecular, and possibly aerosol species
in the lower atmosphere of the planet, as well as escaping hydrogen and metals
in the upper atmosphere. From a re-analysis of near-ultraviolet (NUV)
transmission observations of HD 209458b, we detect ionized iron (Fe II)
absorption in a 100 A-wide range around 2370 A, lying beyond the planetary
Roche lobe. However, we do not detect absorption of equally strong Fe II lines
expected to be around 2600 A. Further, we find no evidence for absorption by
neutral magnesium (Mg I), ionized magnesium (Mg II), nor neutral iron (Fe I).
These results avoid the conflict with theoretical models previously found by
Vidal-Madjar et al. (2013), which detected Mg I but did not detect Mg II from
this same data set. Our results indicate that hydrodynamic escape is strong
enough to carry atoms as heavy as iron beyond the planetary Roche lobe, even
for planets less irradiated than the extreme ultra-hot-Jupiters such as
WASP-12b and KELT-9b. The detection of iron and non-detection of magnesium in
the upper atmosphere of HD 209458b can be explained by a model in which the
lower atmosphere forms (hence, sequesters) primarily magnesium-bearing
condensates, rather than iron condensates. This is suggested by current
microphysical models. The inextricable synergy between upper- and
lower-atmosphere properties highlights the value of combining observations that
probe both regions.

that simultaneously focus incident radiation of selected wavelengths at
predefined locations with larger focal depths compared to traditional Fresnel
lenses. In addition, the proposed devices are polarization insensitive and
maintain a large focusing efficiency over a broad spectral band. Specifically,
here we discuss and characterize modulated axilens configurations designed for
long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) in the $6~\mu$m--12~$\mu$m wavelength range and
in the $4~\mu$m--6~$\mu$m mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) range. These devices
are ideally suited for monolithic integration atop the substrate layers of
infrared focal plane arrays (IR-FPAs) and for use as compact
microspectrometers. We systematically study their focusing efficiency, spectral
response, and cross talk ratio, and we demonstrate linear control of
multi-wavelength focusing on a single plane. Our design method leverages
Rayleigh-Sommerfeld (RS) diffraction theory and is validated numerically using
the Finite Element Method (FEM). Finally, we demonstrate the application of
spatially modulated axilenses to the realization of compact, single-lens
spectrometer. By optimizing our devices, we achieve a minimum distinguishable
wavelength interval of $\Delta\lambda=240nm$ at $\lambda_0=8{\mu}m$ and
$\Delta\lambda=165nm$ at $\lambda_0=5{\mu}m$. The proposed devices add
fundamental spectroscopic capabilities to compact imaging devices for a number
of applications ranging from spectral sorting to LWIR and MWIR phase contrast

ratio). Within our observed sample, we found a wide range of specific accretion
rates. After correcting the observed sample for the varying sensitivity of
3XMM, we found further evidence for a wide range of X-ray luminosities and
specific accretion rates, described by a power law. Using this corrected AGN
sample we also define an AGN fraction describing their relative incidence

mass (up to $\approx$ 6%) for galaxies with X-ray luminosities between $10^{39}

interacts with the flow field in the nozzle, the mass flow and the spray

the associated processes have not yet been studied in detail. In this paper, we
investigate the process of cloud cavitation shedding, the re-entrant jet and
condensation shocks in a scaled-up generic step nozzle with injection into gas
using implicit Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). For modeling of the cavitating
liquid we employ a barotropic equilibrium cavitation model, embedded in a

of a watchful adversary, Willie, who tries to determine if a transmission took
place or not. While covert communication in a basic, vanilla setting where all
variables are known to Willie, results in the well-known square-root law, when
a jammer is present and assists Alice by creating uncertainty in Willie's
decoder, a strictly positive transmission rate is possible.
  In this work, we analyze the case where the jammer is equipped with multiple
antennas. Specifically, we analyze the effect of multiple antennas at the
jammer on Alice's transmission power and consequently on the transmission rate.
We consider both cases, one in which the channel knowledge is known and one in
which it is unknown by the jammer. We formulate several optimization problems
for the transmission strategies of the jammer, to maximize his assistance to
Alice, in terms of maximizing a ratio between Willie's and Bob's noise
variances.
  When the channel information is known to the jammer, we show that the optimal
strategy of the jammer is to perform beamforming towards a single direction
with all his available power. This direction though, is not trivial, since it
reflects an optimal tradeoff point between minimizing the interference at Bob
and maximizing the interference at Willie. When the channel knowledge is
unknown, we show that the optimal strategy of the jammer is either to transmit

counter-rotating accretion discs, the average process efficiency reaches up to

We identify a strong correlation between efficient electromagnetic energy
extraction and the quasi-stationary setting of ideal conditions for the

velocity and fulfillment of the so-called Znajek condition). Remarkably, the

entropy ${\mathcal{S}_1}(A)$ of a subsystem $A$, with Hilbert space dimension
$N_A$, scales as $\overline{\mathcal{S}_1}(A)\sim D\ln N$ for small fractal
dimensions $D$, $N^D< N_A$. Remarkably, $\overline{\mathcal{S}_1}(A)$ saturates
at its thermal (Page) value at infinite temperature,
$\overline{\mathcal{S}_1}(A)\sim \ln N_A$ at larger $D$. Consequently, we
provide an example when the entanglement entropy takes an ergodic value even
though the wave function is highly non-ergodic. Finally, we generalize our
results to Renyi entropies $\mathcal{S}_q(A)$ with $q>1$ and to genuine
multifractal states and also show that their fluctuations have ergodic behavior
in narrower vicinity of the ergodic state, $D=1$.

in situ and accreted subgroups in chemical space match those of their field

similar chemical enrichment histories; (iii) The chemical compositions of the
GCs associated with the low orbital energy subgroup defined by Massari and

metallicity end, the distinction between accreted and in situ populations is
blurred; (iv) Regarding the status of GCs whose origin is ambiguous, we
conclude the following: the position in Si-Fe plane suggests an in situ}origin

and (2) mass dominance compared to other progenitors. We find that the main
progenitor of a MW/M31-mass galaxy emerged typically at z ~ 3-4 (11.6-12.2 Gyr

in a single main progenitor at z < 5 (< 12.6 Gyr ago). Compared with isolated

properties. At variance with intermediate-age and old OCs, for which a
significant number of studies is now available, clusters younger than 150 Myr
have been mostly overlooked in terms of their chemical composition, with few
exceptions. On the other hand, previous investigations seem to indicate an
anomalous behaviour of young clusters, which includes slightly sub-solar iron
(Fe) abundances and extreme, unexpectedly high barium (Ba) enhancements. In a
series of papers, we plan to expand our understanding of this topic and
investigate whether these chemical peculiarities are instead related to
abundance analysis techniques. We present a new determination of the
atmospheric parameters for 23 dwarf stars observed by the Gaia-ESO survey in
five young OCs (younger than 150 Myr) and one star-forming region (NGC 2264).
We exploit a new method based on titanium (Ti) lines to derive the
spectroscopic surface gravity, and most importantly, the microturbulence
parameter. A combination of Ti I and Fe I lines is used to obtain effective
temperatures. We also infer the abundances of Fe II, Ti II, Na I, Mg I, Al I,
Si I, Ca I, Cr I and Ni I. Our findings are in fair agreement with Gaia-ESO
iDR5 results for effective temperatures and surface gravities, but suggest that
for very young stars, the microturbulence parameter is over-estimated when Fe
lines are employed. This affects the derived chemical composition and causes
the metal content of very young clusters to be under-estimated. Our clusters
display a metallicity [Fe/H] between +0.04 and +0.12; they are not more metal
poor than the Sun. Although based on a relatively small sample size, our
explorative study suggests that we may not need to call for ad hoc explanations
to reconcile the chemical composition of young OCs with Galactic chemical
evolution models.

attenuation curves in galaxies is one of the fundamental questions of
extragalactic astrophysics, with a great practical significance for deriving
the physical properties of galaxies, such as the star formation rate and
stellar mass. Attenuation curves result from a combination of dust grain
properties, dust content, and the spatial arrangement of dust and different
populations of stars. In this review we assess the current state of the field,
paying particular attention to the importance of extinction curves as the
building blocks of attenuation laws. We introduce a quantitative framework to
characterize and compare extinction and attenuation curves, present a
theoretical foundation for interpreting empirical results, overview an array of
observational methods, and review the observational state of the field at both
low and high redshift. Our main conclusions are: Attenuation curves exhibit a
large range of slopes, from curves with shallow (Milky Way-like) slopes to
those exceeding the slope of the SMC extinction curve. The slopes of the curves
correlate strongly with the effective optical opacities, in the sense that
galaxies with low dust column density (lower visual attenuation) tend to have
steeper slopes, whereas the galaxies with high dust column density have
shallower (grey) slopes. Galaxies appear to exhibit a diverse range of 2175A UV
bump strengths, but on average have suppressed bumps compared to the average
Milky Way extinction curve. Theoretical studies indicate that variations in
bump strength may result from similar geometric and radiative transfer effects
that drive the correlation between the slope and the dust column.

quantum Fisher information analytically, which is associated with the minimum
lower bound for the precision of estimation of the parameter driving the phase
transition. We compare it with the Fisher information for a specific
experimental scenario where photoncounting-like measurements are employed. We
find how quantum criticality and squeezing are useful resources in the
metrological scenario. Second, we obtain the quantum Fisher information for the
out of equilibrium transition in the dissipative non-equilibrium steady state
(NESS), and investigate how the presence of dissipation affects the parameter
estimation. In this scenario, it is known that the critical point is shifted by
an amount which depends on the dissipation rate. This is used here to design
high precision protocols for a whole range of the transition-driving parameter
in the ordered phase. In fact, for certain values of the parameter being

efficient friction. Together with robust no free lunch with vanishing risk, it
rules out strategies of infinite variation, as they usually appear in
frictionless markets. In this paper, we show how the models with and without
transaction costs can be unified.
  The bid and the ask price of a risky asset are given by c\'adl\'ag processes
which are locally bounded from below and may coincide at some points. In a
first step, we show that if the bid-ask model satisfies ""no unbounded profit
with bounded risk"" for simple strategies, then there exists a semimartingale
lying between the bid and the ask price process.
  In a second step, under the additional assumption that the zeros of the
bid-ask spread are either starting points of an excursion away from zero or
inner points from the right, we show that for every bounded predictable
strategy specifying the amount of risky assets, the semimartingale can be used
to construct the corresponding self-financing risk-free position in a
consistent way. Finally, the set of most general strategies is introduced,
which also provides a new view on the frictionless case.

competitive perspective where both AV and PT operators are profit-oriented with
dynamic adjustable supply strategies under five regulatory structures regarding
whether the AV operator is allowed to change the fleet size and whether the PT
operator is allowed to adjust headway. Four out of the five scenarios are
constrained competition while the other one focuses on unconstrained
competition to find the Nash Equilibrium. We evaluate the competition process
as well as the system performance from the standpoints of four stakeholders --
the AV operator, the PT operator, passengers, and the transport authority. We
also examine the impact of PT subsidies on the competition results including
both demand-based and supply-based subsidies. A heuristic algorithm is proposed
to update supply strategies for AV and PT based on the operators' historical
actions and profits. An agent-based simulation model is implemented in the
first-mile scenario in Tampines, Singapore. We find that the competition can
result in higher profits and higher system efficiency for both operators
compared to the status quo. After the supply updates, the PT services are
spatially concentrated to shorter routes feeding directly to the subway station
and temporally concentrated to peak hours. On average, the competition reduces
the travel time of passengers but increases their travel costs. Nonetheless,
the generalized travel cost is reduced when incorporating the value of time.
With respect to the system efficiency, the bus supply adjustment increases the
average vehicle load and reduces the total vehicle kilometer traveled measured
by the passenger car equivalent (PCE), while the AV supply adjustment does the
opposite.

rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), that has been shown to achieve higher

maximization are two conflicting objectives, the study of the tradeoff between

galaxies separated in dense complexes, the superclusters of galaxies, and
almost empty voids. The superclusters are young structures that did not have
time to evolve into dynamically relaxed systems through the age of the
Universe. Internally, they are very irregular, with dense cores, filaments and
peripheral systems of galaxies. We propose a methodology to map the internal
structure of superclusters of galaxies using pattern recognition techniques.
Our approach allows to: i) identify groups and clusters in the LSS distribution
of galaxies; ii) correct for the ""fingers of God"" projection effect, caused by
the partial knowledge of the third space coordinate; iii) detect filaments of
galaxies and trace their skeletons. In this paper, we present the algorithms,
discuss the optimization of the free parameters and evaluate the results of its
application. With this methodology, we have mapped the internal structure of 42
superclusters in the nearby universe (up to $z=0.15$).

both online and offline commerce. In physical retail, product placement is an
effective way to connect consumers with products. However, selecting product
locations within a store can be a tedious process. Moreover, learning important
spatial patterns in offline retail is challenging due to the scarcity of data
and the high cost of exploration and experimentation in the physical world. To
address these challenges, we propose a stochastic model of spatial demand in
physical retail. We show that the proposed model is more predictive of demand
than existing baselines. We also perform a preliminary study into different
automation techniques and show that an optimal product allocation policy can be
learned through Deep Q-Learning.

and sometimes necessity, for this new resource to provide ancillary services
such as frequency support. Recent efforts toward this goal focused mainly on
the large-scale PV plants with identical subsystems but cannot handle
distributed PV systems with diversities. Therefore, directly applying them to
distributed PV requires repetitive control design for each unit, and thus
implies huge design efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency
support control scheme focusing on the distributed PV to overcome the above
limitation. Considering the diversities, we first derive a reduced-order
aggregate model to represent the overall dynamic behaviors of a group of
distributed PV. Using this model, we can then design one single frequency
support controller for a large number of distributed PV without excessive
design computational efforts. This controller aims at controlling the PV total
output to provide frequency support to the grid. We also supplement it with the
proposed inversion method to obtain individual PV's control signals from the
aggregate one. The proposed reduced-order aggregate model is validated against
a group of distributed PV systems represented by the detailed nonlinear models.
We also demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed control scheme, including
both controller and the inversion method, through time-domain simulations using
a standard test system.

of defenders, each responsible for securing a subset of the assets against an
attacker. The interdependencies between the assets are captured by an attack
graph, where an edge from one asset to another indicates that if the former
asset is compromised, an attack can be launched on the latter asset. Each edge
has an associated probability of successful attack, which can be reduced via
security investments by the defenders. In such scenarios, we investigate the
security investments that arise under certain features of human decision-making
that have been identified in behavioral economics. In particular, humans have
been shown to perceive probabilities in a nonlinear manner, typically
overweighting low probabilities and underweighting high probabilities. We show
that suboptimal investments can arise under such weighting in certain network
topologies. We also show that pure strategy Nash equilibria exist in settings
with multiple (behavioral) defenders, and study the inefficiency of the
equilibrium investments by behavioral defenders compared to a centralized
socially optimal solution.

Here we
report on the first follow-up NuSTAR observation of the source, which shows
variability spanning two orders of magnitude in count rate on timescales of
~10-100 s. The power-spectrum of the source does not show any quasi-periodic
oscillations or periodicity, but has a large fractional rms amplitude of
147%$\pm3$%, exhibiting a number of large flares throughout the observation.
The hardness ratio (defined as $R_{10-79 \rm keV}/R_{3-10 \rm keV}$) of the
flares tends to be soft, while the source spans a range of hardness ratios
during non-flaring periods. The X-ray spectrum of the source shows strong
reflection features, which become more narrow and peaked during the non-flaring
intervals. We fit an absorbed relativistic reflection model to the source
spectra to place physical constraints on the system. Most notably, we find that
the source exhibits a large and varying intrinsic absorbing column density
($N_{\rm H}=1.4-4.2\times10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$). This large intrinsic absorption
is further supported by the energy spectra extracted from two flares observed
simultaneously by NuSTAR and NICER. We find that the inner accretion disk of
the source has a low inclination, $i<29^{\circ}$ ( 3$\sigma$ upper-limit),
while the iron abundance in the disk is close to solar, $A_{\rm Fe}=1.0\pm0.3$.
We set a 90% confidence upper limit on the inner radius of the accretion disk
of $r_{\rm in}<8 \ r_{\rm ISCO}$, and, by fixing $r_{\rm in}$ to be at $r_{\rm
ISCO}$, a 90% confidence lower-limit on the spin of the black hole of
$a^{*}>0.0$. Lastly, we compare the properties of Swift J1858.6$-$0814 to those
of V404 Cygni and V4641 Sgr, which both show rapid flaring and a strong and
variable absorption.

theories, notable examples are Brans-Dicke and $R\phi^2$. ST theories with {\em
derivative} coupling can also be reduced to an Einstein frame by disformal
transformations, but, as a rule, their scalar sector will contain higher
derivative terms. Here we draw attention to a new Palatini kinetically coupled
theory which can be reduced to pure MES by an invertible disformal
transformation. This theory can then be converted into the Jordan frame of
another ST, $R\phi^2$, which also admits an invertible transformation to MES.
Two theories, each of which is dual to MES, will be {\em sequentially dual} to
each other and can be considered as two different Jordan frames of the same
theory. Both chosen theories violate null energy condition. Transforming the
same singular MES solutions, we find the desingularization signs in both Jordan
frames, but these are more pronouned in the framework of kinetic theory,

collaborative learning framework where a model is first trained across a set of

adapted to learn a new task at the target edge node, using a few samples only.
Further, we investigate the convergence of the proposed federated meta-learning
algorithm under mild conditions on node similarity and the adaptation
performance at the target edge. To combat against the vulnerability of
meta-learning algorithms to possible adversarial attacks, we further propose a
robust version of the federated meta-learning algorithm based on
distributionally robust optimization, and establish its convergence under mild
conditions. Experiments on different datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed Federated Meta-Learning based framework.

fault injection attacks is essential for modern data storage, communication,
and computation systems that are susceptible to fault injection attacks. The
robustness of a CC against voltage glitch attacks increases with an on-chip
voltage regulator that considers the impact of topology and component selection
on the fault injection robustness. With an emphasis on increasing the number of
phases in a multiphase voltage regulator and component selection, an on-chip
voltage regulator with multiphase configuration and an optimal operating point
is proposed as a lightweight countermeasure to minimize injected glitches.
Furthermore, an infective countermeasure is added to the on-chip multiphase
voltage regulator that contaminates the computation of the cryptographic
algorithm when a voltage glitch reaches to the CC. By increasing the number of
phases from 1 to 16, the confrontation with fault attacks increases by 52.45%,
which is equal to 91.82% if the number of phases increases to 32. Using the
infective countermeasure for fault resiliency, the security-enhanced CC
provides a robust and resilient solution against fault attacks that improve the
security and availability of the device.

most HRI researchers do not adopt best practices when analyzing Likert data. We

During these years, only 3 of the 110 papers applied proper statistical testing

roads (the ""risky road"") is stochastic and may change over time. This generates
room for experimentation. A central planner may wish to induce some of the
(finite number of atomic) agents to use the risky road even when the expected
cost of travel there is high in order to obtain accurate information about the
state of the road. Since agents are strategic, we show that in order to
generate incentives for experimentation the central planner however needs to
limit the number of agents using the risky road when the expected cost of
travel on the risky road is low. In particular, because of congestion, too much
use of the risky road when the state is favorable would make experimentation no
longer incentive compatible. We characterize the optimal incentive compatible
recommendation system, first in a two-stage game and then in an
infinite-horizon setting. In both cases, this system induces only partial,
rather than full, information sharing among the agents (otherwise there would
be too much exploitation of the risky road when costs there are low).

readily available everywhere. This paper introduces a method that not only
naturally deals with the complexity of the signal type but does so in the

supermassive black hole, are generally imagined as leading either to the star's
complete disruption or to its passage directly into the black hole. In the
former case it is widely believed that in all cases the bound portion of the
debris quickly ""circularizes"" due to relativistic apsidal precession, i.e.,
forms a compact accretion disk, and emits a flare of standardized lightcurve
and spectrum. We show here that TDEs are more diverse and can be grouped into
several distinct categories on the basis of stellar pericenter distance $r_p$;
we calculate the relative frequency of these categories. In particular, because
rapid circularization requires $r_p \lesssim 10r_g$ ($r_g \equiv GM_{\rm
BH}/c^2$), it can happen in only a minority of total disruptions, $\lesssim
1/4$ when the black hole has mass $M_{\rm BH} = 10^6 M_\odot$. For larger
pericenter distances, $10 < r_p/r_g < 27$ (for $M_{\rm BH}=10^6M_\odot$), main
sequence stars are completely disrupted, but the bound debris orbits are highly
eccentric and possess semimajor axes $\sim 100\times$ the scale of the expected
compact disk. Partial disruptions with fractional mass-loss $\gtrsim 10\%$
should occur with a rate similar to that of total disruptions; for fractional
mass-loss $\gtrsim 50\%$, the rate is $\approx 1/3$ as large. Partial
disruptions -- which must precede total disruptions when the stars' angular
momenta evolve in the ""empty loss-cone"" regime -- change the orbital energy by
factors $\gtrsim O(1)$. Remnants of partial disruptions are in general far from
thermal equilibrium. Depending on the orbital energy of the remnant and
conditions within the stellar cluster surrounding the SMBH, it may return after
hundreds or thousands of years and be fully disrupted, or it may rejoin the
stellar cluster.

describe our automated spectral classification scheme and arrive at a final set

to Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia). Of these, 70 spectra of 30 objects are
classified as spectroscopically peculiar (i.e., not matching the spectral
signatures of ""normal"" SNe~Ia) and 79 SNe~Ia (covered by 328 spectra) have
complementary photometric coverage. The median SN in our final set has one
epoch of spectroscopy, has a redshift of 0.0208 (with a low of 0.0007 and high
of 0.1921), and is first observed spectroscopically 1.1 days after maximum
light. The constituent spectra are of high quality, with a median
signal-to-noise ratio of 31.8 pixel$^{-1}$, and have broad wavelength coverage,
with $\sim 95\%$ covering at least 3700--9800~\AA. We analyze our dataset,
focusing on quantitative measurements (e.g., velocities, pseudo-equivalent
widths) of the evolution of prominent spectral features in the available
early-time and late-time spectra. The data are available to the community, and
we encourage future studies to incorporate our spectra in their analyses.

electrical parameter variability is produced by factors other than variations
of physical dimensions and doping profiles, which are there since device
fabrication and remain static over time. Besides these time-zero variability
factors, factors that lead to performance variability from one instant in time
to the other start playing a significant role. Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) is
among these relevant time-dependent variability sources. In this work we extend
the knowledge of the time-dependent random variability induced by RTN, by
providing a statistical model for transistor threshold voltage jitter produced
by RTN. The area scaling of threshold voltage jitter is detailed and discussed,
supporting designers in transistor sizing towards a more reliable design. Not
only the jitter expected in a transistor is modeled, but also its variability
among transistors that by design should be equal. Besides analytical modeling,
Monte Carlo simulations are run. The simulations account for the charge carrier
capture and emission events related to RTN, allowing the proper evaluation of
the RTN related jitter. The Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical
model and illustrate the area scaling of jitter and its variability.

Broadcast (URB). URB is central in the design and implementation of
fault-tolerant distributed systems, as many non-trivial fault-tolerant
distributed applications require communication with provable guarantees on
message deliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for
time-free message-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. Moreover, we
aim at the design of an even more robust communication abstraction. We do so
through the lenses of self-stabilization---a very strong notion of
fault-tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures,
self-stabilizing algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary
transient faults; these faults represent any violation of the assumptions
according to which the system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm
code stays intact).
  This work proposes the first self-stabilizing URB solution for time-free
message-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. The proposed algorithm
has an O(bufferUnitSize) stabilization time (in terms of asynchronous cycles)
from arbitrary transient faults, where bufferUnitSize is a predefined constant
that can be set according to the available memory. Moreover, the communication
costs of our algorithm are similar to the ones of the non-self-stabilizing
state-of-the-art. The main differences are that our proposal considers repeated
gossiping of O(1) bits messages and deals with bounded space (which is a
prerequisite for self-stabilization). Specifically, each node needs to store up
to bufferUnitSize n records and each record is of size O(v + n log n) bits,
where n is the number of nodes in the system and v is the number of bits needed
to encode a single URB instance.

access systems supporting the successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the
access point (AP). When multiple users transmit packets simultaneously in a
slot, owing to the SIC technique, the AP is able to decode them through SIC
resolve procedures (SRPs), which may occupy multiple consequent slots. While
such an SRP could potentially improve the system throughput, how to fully
exploit this capability in practical systems is still questionable. In
particular, the number of active users contending for the channel varies over
time which complicates the algorithm design. By fully exploiting the potential
of SIC, the proposed algorithm is designed to maximize the system throughput
and minimize the access delay. For this purpose, an online estimation is
introduced to estimate the number of active users in real-time and controls
their transmissions accordingly. It is shown that the throughput of the
proposed algorithm can reach up to 0.693 packets/slot under practical
assumptions, which is the first result achieving the throughput limit proved by
Yu-Giannakis. It is further shown that the system throughput of 0.559
packets/slot (80.6$\%$ of the throughput limit) is still achievable when the
SIC capability is restricted by two.

This paper presents a high-level formalization of the Solidity language with a
focus on the memory model. The presented formalization covers all features of
the language related to managing state and memory. In addition, the
formalization we provide is effective: all but few features can be encoded in
the quantifier-free fragment of standard SMT theories. This enables precise and
efficient reasoning about the state of smart contracts written in Solidity. The
formalization is implemented in the solc-verify verifier and we provide an
extensive set of tests that covers the breadth of the required semantics. We
also provide an evaluation on the test set that validates the semantics and
shows the novelty of the approach compared to other Solidity-level contract
analysis tools.

  Segmentation Using Drone-Captured Images","13 pages, 5 figures",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pavement conditions are a critical aspect of asset management and directly
affect safety. This study introduces a deep neural network method called U-Net
for pavement crack segmentation based on drone-captured images to reduce the
cost and time needed for airport runway inspection. The proposed approach can
also be used for highway pavement conditions assessment during off-peak periods
when there are few vehicles on the road. In this study, runway pavement images
are collected using drone at various heights from the Fitchburg Municipal
Airport (FMA) in Massachusetts to evaluate their quality and applicability for
crack segmentation, from which an optimal height is determined. Drone images
captured at the optimal height are then used to evaluate the crack segmentation
performance of the U-Net model. Deep learning methods typically require a huge
set of annotated training datasets for model development, which can be a major
obstacle for their applications. An online annotated pavement image dataset is
used together with the FMA data to train the U-Net model. The results show that
U-Net performs well on the FMA testing data even with limited FMA training
images, suggesting that it has good generalization ability and great potential
to be used for both airport runways and highway pavements.

health application usage data. Personalized policy represents a paradigm shift
from developing a single policy that may prescribe personalized decisions by
tailoring. Specifically, we aim to develop the best policy, one per user, based
on estimating random effects under generalized linear mixed model. With many
random effects, we consider new estimation method and penalized objective to
circumvent high-dimension integrals for marginal likelihood approximation. We
establish consistency and optimality of our method with endogenous app usage.
We apply our method to develop personalized push (""prompt"") schedules in 294
app users, with a goal to maximize the prompt response rate given past app
usage and other contextual factors. We found the best push schedule given the
same covariates varied among the users, thus calling for personalized policies.
Using the estimated personalized policies would have achieved a mean prompt
response rate of 23% in these users at 16 weeks or later: this is a remarkable
improvement on the observed rate (11%), while the literature suggests 3%-15%
user engagement at 3 months after download. The proposed method compares
favorably to existing estimation methods including using the R function ""glmer""

identifying BGCs in bacteria, and could be well suited to perform the same task

Openly accessible BGC databases contain only a very small portion of previously

the development of supervised learning methods for fungal BGCs and potentially
improve prediction performance compared to data-driven methods. In this work we
propose new publicly available fungal BGC datasets to support the BGC discovery

spontaneous edge magnetism with anti-parallel configuration, whose amplitude
can be tuned by a transversal electric field. As the electric field increases
or decreases across a critical value, the edges are demagnetized or
re-magnetized, respectively. A magnetic field at each edge determines the
orientation of the re-magnetization. Thus, a combination of slowly varying
transversal electric field and magnetic field in monolayer graphene zigzag
nanoribbon could drive the quantum system into a bistability loop. The same
phenomenon can be induced in a bilayer/monolayer zigzag nanoribbon without the
magnetic field, because the non-symmetry superexchange interaction controls the
orientation of the re-magnetization. By this way, the quantum system is
switched between ground state and quasi-stable excited state with different
magnetism, band structures and conductance. This feature could be used to
develop graphene-based spintronic nano-devices without magnetic field.

solve a polynomial eigenvalue problem (PEP) $P(\lambda)x=0$ that approximates
the original problem through interpolation. Then, this PEP is usually solved by
linearization. Most of the literature about linearizations assumes that
$P(\lambda)$ is expressed in the monomial basis but, because of the polynomial
approximation techniques, in this context, $P(\lambda)$ is expressed in a
non-monomial basis. The bases used with most frequency are the Chebyshev basis,
the Newton basis and the Lagrange basis. In this paper we construct a family of
linearizations of $P(\lambda)$ that is easy to construct from the matrix
coefficients of $P(\lambda)$ when this polynomial is expressed in any of those
three bases. We also provide recovery formulas of eigenvectors (when
$P(\lambda)$ is regular) and recovery formulas of minimal bases and minimal
indices (when $P(\lambda)$ is singular). Our ultimate goal is to compare the
numerical behavior of these linearizations, within the same family (to select
the best one) and with the linearizations of other families based on the
location of the eigenvalues with respect to the interpolation nodes.

However, for most of the users, the concern of privacy plays a major role as
they cannot control data access once their data are outsourced, especially if
the cloud provider is curious about their data. Data encryption is an effective
way to solve privacy concerns, but executing queries over encrypted data is a
problem that needs attention. In this research, we introduce a bit-based model
to execute different relational algebra operators over encrypted databases at
the cloud without decrypting the data. To encrypt data, we use the randomized
encryption algorithm (Advanced Encryption Standard-CBC) to provide the
maximum-security level. The idea is based on classifying attributes as
sensitive and non-sensitive, where only sensitive attributes are encrypted. For
each sensitive attribute, the table owner predefined the possible partition
domains on which the tuples will be encoded into bit vectors before the
encryption. We store the bit vectors in an additional column(s) in the
encrypted table in the cloud. We use those bits to retrieve only part of
encrypted records that are candidates for a specific query. We implemented and
evaluated our model and found that the proposed model is practical and success
to minimize the range of the retrieved encrypted records to less than 30
percent of the whole set of encrypted records in a table.

result is resized to the original size. Then a voting process produces the

user should not be required to formulate an explicit query. We cast
contextualized code search as a learning problem, where the goal is to learn a
distribution function computing the likelihood that each database code
completes the program, and propose a neural model for predicting which database
code is likely to be most useful. Because it will be prohibitively expensive to
apply a neural model to each code in a database of millions or billions of
codes at search time, one of our key technical concerns is ensuring a speedy
search. We address this by learning a 'reverse encoder' that can be used to
reduce the problem of evaluating each database code to computing a convolution
of two normal distributions.

the proposed scheme performs close to the optimum. Also, it is less

the particles created together with the neutrino are not measured and do not

present. This demonstration uses the saddle point approximation and also
assumes that the experiment lasts longer than a certain threshold. We
independently derive this result using the external wave packet model and also
using a model in which the fields responsible for neutrino production and
detection are treated dynamically. Intuitively this result is a consequence of
the fact that the neutrino emission time does not affect the final state and so
amplitudes corresponding to distinct emission times must be added coherently.
This fact also implies that oscillations resulting from mass eigenstates which
are detected simultaneously arise from neutrinos which were not created
simultaneously but are nonetheless coherent, realizing the neutrino oscillation
paradigm of Kobach, Manohar and McGreevy.

Rev. D, 94, 084015 (2016)], based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem with using the
optical metric. Their approach to finite-distance cases is limited within an
asymptotically flat spacetime. By making several assumptions, we give an
interpretation of their definition from the observer's viewpoint: The observer
assumes the direction of a hypothetical light emission at the observer position
and makes a comparison between the fiducial emission direction and the
direction along the real light ray. The angle between the two directions at the
observer location can be interpreted as the deflection angle by Ishihara et al.
The present interpretation does not require the asymptotic flatness. Motivated
by this, we avoid such asymptotic regions to discuss another integral form of
the deflection angle of light. This form makes it clear that the proposed
deflection angle can be used not only for asymptotically flat spacetimes but
also for asymptotically nonflat ones. We examine the proposed deflection angle
in two models for the latter case; Kottler (Schwarzschild-de Sitter) solution
in general relativity and a spherical solution in Weyl conformal gravity.
Effects of finite distance on the light deflection in Weyl conformal gravity
result in an extra term in the deflection angle, which may be marginally
observable in a certain parameter region. On the other hand, those in Kottler
spacetime are beyond reach of the current technology.

quality neural machine translation (NMT) models in bilingually low-resource
scenarios, as NMT is data-hungry. Multi-task learning is an elegant approach to
inject linguistic-related inductive biases into NMT, using auxiliary syntactic
and semantic tasks, to improve generalisation. The challenge, however, is to
devise effective training schedules, prescribing when to make use of the
auxiliary tasks during the training process to fill the knowledge gaps of the
main translation task, a setting referred to as biased-MTL. Current approaches
for the training schedule are based on hand-engineering heuristics, whose
effectiveness vary in different MTL settings. We propose a novel framework for

scheduling policy. We effectively and efficiently learn the training schedule
policy within the imitation learning framework using an oracle policy algorithm
that dynamically sets the importance weights of auxiliary tasks based on their
contributions to the generalisability of the main NMT task. Experiments on
low-resource NMT settings show the resulting automatically learned training
schedulers are competitive with the best heuristics, and lead to up to +1.1

care must be taken to insure the electrical quality of these layers. In this
work, we study the initial quality of SAM-based seed layers that are compatible
with complex surfaces including through-silicon vias (TSVs), as are used in
via-last three-dimensional semiconductor device packaging. The conformal and
electrical quality of the seed metal is very important. Also important for a
multifunction seed layer is its ability as a barrier layer, which protects the
substrate from high temperature diffusion of the deposited metal. Thus, the
barrier layer must be robust enough to withstand diffusion, yet thin enough to
provide a conformal surface that allows metal seed layer deposition. Standard
barrier layer deposition methods such as evaporation or sputtering require
either a line of sight from the source or aspect ratios large enough to provide
scattering from the background gas within the structure to coat all surfaces.
Electrochemical and chemical vapor deposition provide alternatives, but
concerns arise about contamination and compatibility with radio frequency or
high-speed digital signals. We propose a barrier layer based on an aromatic
self-assembled monolayer (SAM) for use in electroless copper seed layer
deposition. The viability of the SAM barrier layer is determined by the quality
of the deposited copper seed film, judged quantitatively by thin film
resistivity and qualitatively by surface adhesion and morphological properties
such as cracks and bubbles. Insights to the origins of problems and an optimal
scheme are described. Extensions for use as a photolithographic resist layer
are suggested. Our SAM approach for TSV applications yields a 'smart' seed
layer that can be used with a 'simple,' scalloped, easy to fabricate, via hole.

functional computation (e.g., averaging) so as to support large-scale sensing

superposition of a multi-access channel to allow an access point to receive a
desired function of simultaneous signals. In this work, we aim at realizing
AirComp in a two-cell multi-antenna system. To this end, a novel scheme of
simultaneous signal-and-interference alignment (SIA) is proposed that builds on
classic IA to manage interference for multi-cell AirComp. The principle of SIA
is to divide the spatial channel space into two subspaces with equal
dimensions: one for signal alignment required by AirComp and the other for
inter-cell IA. As a result, the number of interference-free spatially
multiplexed functional streams received by each AP is maximized (equal to half
of the available spatial degrees-of-freedom). Furthermore, the number is
independent of the population of devices in each cell. In addition, the
extension to SIA for more than two cells is discussed.

In this paper, we propose an adaptive anomaly detection approach for
hierarchical edge computing (HEC) systems to solve this problem. Specifically,
we first construct three anomaly detection DNN models of increasing complexity,
and associate them with the three layers of HEC from bottom to top, i.e., IoT
devices, edge servers, and cloud. Then, we design an adaptive scheme to select
one of the models based on the contextual information extracted from input
data, to perform anomaly detection. The selection is formulated as a contextual
bandit problem and is characterized by a single-step Markov decision process,
with an objective of achieving high detection accuracy and low detection delay
simultaneously. We evaluate our proposed approach using a real IoT dataset, and
demonstrate that it reduces detection delay by 84% while maintaining almost the
same accuracy as compared to offloading detection tasks to the cloud. In
addition, our evaluation also shows that it outperforms other baseline schemes.

We aim to explore the associated photochemistry of parent species, which
produces different metastable states and forbidden emissions, in this cometary
coma of peculiar composition. We re-analyzed the high-resolution spectra of
comet C/2016 R2, which were obtained in February 2018, using the UVES
spectrograph of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) Very Large Telescope
(VLT). Various forbidden atomic emission lines of [CI], [NI], and [OI] were
observed in the optical spectrum of this comet when it was at 2.8 au from the
Sun. The observed forbidden emission intensity ratios are studied in the
framework of a couple-chemistry emission model. The model calculations show
that CO$_2$ is the major source of both atomic oxygen green and red-doublet
emissions in the coma of C/2016 R2 (while for most comets it is generally
H$_2$O), whereas, CO and N$_2$ govern the atomic carbon and nitrogen emissions,
respectively. Our modelled oxygen green to red-doublet and carbon to nitrogen
emission ratios are higher by a factor {of 3}, when compared to the
observations. These discrepancies can be due to uncertainties associated with
photon cross sections or unknown production/loss sources. Our modelled oxygen
green to red-doublet emission ratio is close to the observations, when we
consider an O$_2$ abundance with a production rate of 30\% relative to the CO
production rate. The collisional quenching is not a significant loss process
for N($^2$D) though its radiative lifetime is significant ($\sim$10 hrs).
Hence, the observed [NI] doublet-emission ratio ([NI] 5198/5200) of 1.22, which
is smaller than the terrestrial measurement by a factor {1.4}, is mainly due to
the characteristic radiative decay of N($^2$D).

collapses, and revivals of the whole compact states, and it persists given any

is time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, a misclassified red blood cell
morphology will lead to false disease diagnosis and improper treatment. Thus, a
decent pathologist must truly be an expert in classifying red blood cell
morphology. In the past decade, many approaches have been proposed for
classifying human red blood cell morphology. However, those approaches have not
addressed the class imbalance problem in classification. A class imbalance
problem---a problem where the numbers of samples in classes are very
different---is one of the problems that can lead to a biased model towards the
majority class. Due to the rarity of every type of abnormal blood cell
morphology, the data from the collection process are usually imbalanced. In
this study, we aimed to solve this problem specifically for classification of
dog red blood cell morphology by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)---a
well-known deep learning technique---in conjunction with a focal loss function,
adept at handling class imbalance problem. The proposed technique was conducted
on a well-designed framework: two different CNNs were used to verify the
effectiveness of the focal loss function and the optimal hyper-parameters were
determined by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that both
CNNs models augmented with the focal loss function achieved higher
$F_{1}$-scores, compared to the models augmented with a conventional
cross-entropy loss function that does not address class imbalance problem. In
other words, the focal loss function truly enabled the CNNs models to be less
biased towards the majority class than the cross-entropy did in the
classification task of imbalanced dog red blood cell data.

IoT devices as secondary transmitters transmit their sensing data to a

framework enables the IoT system to simultaneously optimize the spectrum usage

stochastic optimization problem for the gateway under the dynamics of the
primary channel, the uncertainty of the IoT devices, and the unpredictability

the time scheduling, i.e., the energy harvesting time, backscatter time, and

separable quadratically constrained quadratic problem. Numerical results
demonstrate that the proposed RIS assisted design significantly improves the

toward understanding the macroscopic behavior of deep learning through the lens

  Cogswell et al. (2019) introduced cultural transmission within referential

distributed state for every new consensus instance. Allocating and maintaining
this state causes significant overhead. In particular, freeing the distributed,
outdated states in a fault-tolerant way is not trivial and adds further
complexity and cost to the system.
  In this paper, we propose an extension to the single-decree Paxos protocol

and hence has no need for distributed log pruning, snapshotting, compaction, or
dynamic resource allocation.
  The protocol builds a fault-tolerant atomic register that supports arbitrary
read-modify-write operations. We use the concept of consistent quorums to
detect whether the previous consensus still needs to be consolidated or is
already finished so that the next consensus value can be safely proposed.
Reading a consolidated consensus is done without state modifications and is
thereby free of concurrency control and demand for serialisation. A proposer
that is not interrupted reaches agreement on consecutive consensus decisions

resonance instability in film casting is investigated. Viscoelastic models of
infinite width film casting are derived systematically following an asymptotic
expansion and using two well-known constitutive equations: the Giesekus model
and the simplified Phan-Thien/Tanner~(PTT) model. Based on a steady state
analysis, a numerical boundary condition for the inlet stresses is formulated,
which suppresses the unknown deformation history of the die flow. The critical
draw ratio in dependence of both the Deborah number and the nonlinear
parameters is calculated by means of linear stability analysis. For both
models, the most unstable instability mode may switch under variation of the
control parameters, leading to a non-continuous change in the oscillation
frequency at criticality. The effective elongational viscosity, which depends
exclusively on the local Weissenberg number, is analyzed and identified as
crucial quantity as long as the Deborah number is not too high. This is
demonstrated by using a generalized Newtonian fluid model to approximate the
PTT model. Based on such a generalized Newtonian fluid model, the effects of

important to extract relevant information and enhance the knowledge on their
behaviors. The present work will seek to achieve this goal via a complex
networks approach. This approach will allow finding latent clusters of similar
terror groups using information on their operational characteristics.
Specifically, using open access data of terrorist attacks occurred worldwide
from 1997 to 2016, we build a multi-partite network that includes terrorist
groups and related information on tactics, weapons, targets, active regions. We
propose a novel algorithm for cluster formation that expands our earlier work
that solely used Gower's coefficient of similarity via the application of Von
Neumann entropy for mode-weighting. This novel approach is compared with our
previous Gower-based method and a heuristic clustering technique that only
focuses on groups' ideologies. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the
entropy-based approach tends to reliably reflect the structure of the data that
naturally emerges from the baseline Gower-based method. Additionally, it
provides interesting results in terms of behavioral and ideological
characteristics of terrorist groups. We furthermore show that the
ideology-based procedure tends to distort or hide existing patterns. Among the
main statistical results, our work reveals that groups belonging to opposite
ideologies can share very common behaviors and that Islamist/jihadist groups
hold peculiar behavioral characteristics with respect to the others.
Limitations and potential work directions are also discussed, introducing the
idea of a dynamic entropy-based framework.

properties of core-ERQ in the context of the AGN orientation-based unification
scenario. We use diagnostic diagrams based on ultraviolet (UV) emission line
ratios and UV-optical line kinematic information to compare the physical and
kinematic gas properties of core-ERQ with those of other luminous narrow and
broad line AGN. In particular, we provide a revised comparison of the [OIII]
kinematics in 21 core-ERQ with other samples of quasars matched in luminosity
with the aim of evaluating whether core-ERQ host the most extreme [OIII]
outflows.
  The UV line ratios suggest that the physical properties (for instance,
density, metallicity) of the ionised gas in core-ERQ are similar to those
observed in the BLR of blue Nitrogen-loud QSOs. The [OIII] outflow velocities
of core-ERQ are, on average, consistent with those of very luminous blue QSO1,
although extreme outflows are much more frequent in core-ERQ. These
similarities can be explained in the context of the AGN unification model,
assuming that core-ERQ are viewed with an intermediate orientation between type
2 (edge-on) and type 1 (face-on) QSOs. We propose that core-ERQ are very
luminous but otherwise normal quasars viewed at an intermediate orientation.
Such orientation allows a direct view of the outer part of the large BLR, from
which core-ERQ UV emission originates; the extreme [OIII] outflow velocities
are instead a consequence of the very high luminosity of core-ERQ.

have column densities far in excess of the sensitivity limits of observational
surveys. We construct a simple model to try and quantify how many streams we
might expect to detect. This accounts for the expected random orientation of
the streams in position and velocity space as well as the expected stream
length and mass of stripped HI. Using archival data from the Arecibo Galaxy
Environment Survey, we search for any streams which might previously have been
missed in earlier analyses. We report the confident detection of ten streams as
well as sixteen other less sure detections. We show that these well-match our
analytic predictions for which galaxies should be actively losing gas, however
the mass of the streams is typically far below the amount of missing HI in
their parent galaxies, implying that a phase change and/or dispersal renders
the gas undetectable. By estimating the orbital timescales we estimate that
dissolution rates of 1-10 Msolar/yr are able to explain both the presence of a
few long, massive streams and the greater number of shorter, less massive

accessing entanglement of the vacuum as a resource. We find that a

a reduction of the quadrature variances below classical limits. This is a
surprising result, since the same state transmitted directly from the

The decoherence of the state is caused by an interplay of opposing effects as

for a stronger entanglement resource, constrained by the amplification of
thermal noise due to the presence of Unruh radiation.

  September)",,,,"astro-ph.IM cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Current and upcoming radio telescopes are being designed with increasing
sensitivity to detect new and mysterious radio sources of astrophysical origin.
While this increased sensitivity improves the likelihood of discoveries, it
also makes these instruments more susceptible to the deleterious effects of
Radio Frequency Interference (RFI). The challenge posed by RFI is exacerbated
by the high data-rates achieved by modern radio telescopes, which require
real-time processing to keep up with the data. Furthermore, the high data-rates
do not allow for permanent storage of observations at high resolution. Offline
RFI mitigation is therefore not possible anymore. The real-time requirement
makes RFI mitigation even more challenging because, on one side, the techniques
used for mitigation need to be fast and simple, and on the other side they also
need to be robust enough to cope with just a partial view of the data.
  The Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS) is the real-time, time-domain,
transient detection instrument of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope
(WSRT), processing 73 Gb of data per second. Even with a deep learning
classifier, the ARTS pipeline requires state-of-the-art real-time RFI
mitigation to reduce the number of false-positive detections. Our solution to
this challenge is RFIm, a high-performance, open-source, tuned, and extensible
RFI mitigation library. The goal of this library is to provide users with RFI
mitigation routines that are designed to run in real-time on many-core
accelerators, such as Graphics Processing Units, and that can be highly-tuned
to achieve code and performance portability to different hardware platforms and
scientific use-cases. Results on the ARTS show that we can achieve real-time
RFI mitigation, with a minimal impact on the total execution time of the search

that using currently available high-power laser facilities, the bounds that can

$0.5-6$ eV, set by the optical laser frequencies and collision angle. These
bounds can be further improved through coherent scattering off laser

persistent voltage bias able to power electronic circuits. Similarly, a phase
battery is a quantum equipment which provides a persistent phase bias to the
wave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum
technologies based on quantum coherence. Unlike the voltage batteries, a phase
battery has not been implemented so far, mainly because of the natural rigidity
of the quantum phase that, in typical quantum circuits, is imposed by the
parity and time-reversal symmetry constrains. Here we report on the first
experimental realization of a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting
circuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface
states and proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the
ferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted
into a persistent phase bias $\varphi_0$ across the wire, leading to the
anomalous Josephson effect. By applying an external in-plane magnetic field a
continuous tuning of $\varphi_0$ is achieved. This allows the charging and
discharging of the quantum phase battery and reveals the symmetries of the
anomalous Josephson effect predicted by our theoretical model. Our results
demonstrate how the combined action of spin-orbit coupling and exchange
interaction breaks the phase rigidity of the system inducing a strong coupling
between charge, spin and superconducting phase. This interplay opens avenues
for topological quantum technologies, superconducting circuitry and advanced

the relative treatment effect of the tested therapy; and the association
between both components.
  - We highlight the very important role of the association between components
in choosing the most efficient endpoint to use as primary.
  - For better grounded future trials, we recommend trialists to always
reporting the association between components of the composite endpoint.
  - Common fallacies to note when using composite endpoints: i) composite

  Independent Component Analyses of reference channels","Accepted for publication in Journal of Neuroscience Methods",,,,"q-bio.NC eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Many magnetoencephalographs (MEG) contain, in addition to data
channels, a set of reference channels positioned relatively far from the head
that provide information on magnetic fields not originating from the brain.
This information is used to subtract sources of non-neural origin, with either
geometrical or least mean squares (LMS) methods. LMS methods in particular tend
to be biased toward more constant noise sources and are often unable to remove
intermittent noise.
  New Method: To better identify and eliminate external magnetic noise, we
propose performing ICA directly on the MEG reference channels. This in most
cases produces several components which are clear summaries of external noise
sources with distinct spatio-temporal patterns. We present two algorithms for
identifying and removing such noise components from the data which can in many
cases significantly improve data quality.
  Results: We performed simulations using forward models that contained both
brain sources and external noise sources. First, traditional LMS-based methods
were applied. While this removed a large amount of noise, a significant portion
still remained. In many cases, this portion could be removed using the proposed
technique, with little to no false positives.
  Comparison with existing method(s): The proposed method removes significant
amounts of noise to which existing LMS-based methods tend to be insensitive.
  Conclusions: The proposed method complements and extends traditional
reference based noise correction with little extra computational cost and low
chances of false positives. Any MEG system with reference channels could profit
from its use, particularly in labs with intermittent noise sources.

the exponential growth of the many-electron Hilbert space as the system size

nonlinear molecular response properties on quantum computers, by first
reformulating the target property into a symmetric expression more suitable for
quantum computation via introducing a set of auxiliary quantum states, and then
determining these auxiliary states via solving the corresponding linear systems
of equations on quantum computers. On one hand, we prove that using the quantum
linear system algorithm [Harrow et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 103, 150502 (2009)] as
a subroutine the proposed algorithm scales only polynomially in the system size
instead of the dimension of the exponentially large Hilbert space, and hence
achieves an exponential speedup over existing classical algorithms. On the
other hand, we introduce a variational hybrid quantum-classical variant of the
proposed algorithm, which is more practical for near-term quantum devices.

a unidirectional domain wall tilt in out-of-plane magnetized stripes with
biaxial anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (DMI). The tilt is a
result of the interplay between the in-plane easy-axis anisotropy and DMI. We
show that the additional anisotropy and DMI prefer different domain wall
structure: anisotropy links the magnetization azimuthal angle inside the domain
wall with the anisotropy direction in contrast to DMI, which prefers the
magnetization perpendicular to the domain wall plane. Their balance with the
energy gain due to domain wall extension defines the equilibrium magnetization
the domain wall tilting. We demonstrate that the Walker field and the

fraction of the speed of light (up to 20\% for millisecond pulsars) and

to copious $e^\pm$ pair creation within the magnetosphere, the relativistic
plasma surrounding the star is forced into corotation up to the light cylinder
where the corotation speed reaches the speed of light. The neutron star
electromagnetic activity is powered by its rotation which becomes relativistic
in the neighbourhood of this light cylinder. These objects naturally induce
relativistic rotation on macroscopic scales about several thousands of
kilometers, a crucial ingredient to trigger the central engine as observed on
Earth. In this paper, we elucidate some of the salient features of this
corotating plasma subject to efficient particle acceleration and radiation,
emphasizing several problems and limitations concerning current theories of
neutron star magnetospheres. Relativistic rotation in these systems is
indirectly probed by the radiation produced within the magnetosphere. Depending
on the underlying assumptions about particle motion and radiation mechanisms,
different signatures on their light-curves, spectra, pulse profiles and
polarisation angles are expected in their broadband electromagnetic emission.

poses serious limitations on their synthesis with conventional nanoscale
fabrication methods, such as Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), TPMS can be
fabricated by Additive Manufacturing (AM) techniques, such as 3D Printing. In
this work, we used an optimized atomic model of a schwarzite structure from the
D family (D8bal) to generate a surface mesh that was subsequently used for
3D-printing through Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM). This D schwarzite was
3D-printed with thermoplastic PolyLactic Acid (PLA) polymer filaments.
Mechanical properties under uniaxial compression were investigated for both the
atomic model and the 3D-printed one. Fully atomistic Molecular Dynamics (MD)
simulations were also carried out to investigate the uniaxial compression
behavior of the D8bal atomic model. Mechanical testings were performed on the
3D-printed schwarzite where the deformation mechanisms were found to be similar
to those observed in MD simulations. These results are suggestive of a
scale-independent mechanical behavior that is dominated by structural topology.

precise predictions for the eigenvalues of geometrical observables like volume
and area, up to the value of the only free parameter of the theory, the
Barbero-Immirzi (BI) parameter. With the help of the eigenvalues equation for
the area operator, LQG successfully derives the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of
large black holes with isolated horizons, fixing at this limit the BI parameter
as $\gamma \approx 0.274$. In the present paper we show some evidence that a
black hole with angular momentum $\hbar$ and Planck mass is an eigenstate of
the area operator provided that $\gamma = \sqrt{3}/6 \approx 1.05 \times
0.274$. As the black hole is extremal, there is no Hawking radiation and the
horizon is isolated. We also suggest that such a black hole can be formed in
the head-on scattering of two parallel Standard Model neutrinos in the mass
state $m_2$ (assuming $m_1 = 0$). Furthermore, we use the obtained BI parameter
to numerically compute the entropy of isolated horizons with areas ranging up
to $250\,l_P^2$, by counting the number of micro-states associated to a given
area. The resulting entropy has a leading term ${\cal S} \approx 0.25\, {\cal
A}$, in agreement to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. As the identification of
the above eigenstate rests on the matching between classical areas and quantum
area eigenvalues, we also present, on the basis of an effective quantum model
for the Schwarzschild black hole recently proposed by Ashtekar, Olmedo and
Singh, an expression for the quantum corrected area of isolated horizons, valid
for any black hole mass. Quantum corrections are shown to be negligible for a
Planck mass black hole, of order $10^{-3}$ relative to the classical area.

distinguishable due to their association with ongoing star formation. However,
the role of spiral structure in the chemical evolution of galaxies is unclear.
Here we explore gas-phase abundance variations between arm and interarm regions
for a sample of 45 spiral galaxies using high spatial resolution VLT/MUSE
Integral Field Spectroscopy data. We report the presence of more metal-rich HII
regions in the spiral arms with respect to the corresponding interarm regions
for a large subsample of galaxies ($45-65\%$ depending on the adopted
calibrator for the abundance derivation). A small percentage of the sample is
observed to display the opposite trend, that is, more metal-poor HII regions in
the spiral arms compared to that of the interarms ($5-20\%$ depending on the
calibrator). We investigate the dependence of the variations with three galaxy
properties: the stellar mass, the presence of bars, and the flocculent/grand
design appearance of spiral arms. In all cases, we observe that the
arm-interarm abundance differences are larger (positive) in more massive and
grand-design galaxies. This is confirmed by an analogous spaxel-wise analysis,
which also shows a noticeable effect of the presence of galactic bars, with
barred systems presenting larger (positive) arm-interarm abundance variations
than unbarred systems. The comparison of our results with new predictions from
theoretical models exploring the nature of the spirals would highly impact on
our knowledge on how these structures form and affect their host galaxies.

gravitational axion field which descends from the antisymmetric tensor of the
massless gravitational string multiplet. In the presence of this field, which
has anomalous CP violating interactions with the gravitons, primordial
gravitational waves induce gravitational anomalies, which in turn are
responsible for the appearance of $H^2$ and $H^4$ contributions to the vacuum
energy density, these terms being characteristic of generic
""running-vacuum-model (RVM) type"", where $H$ is the Hubble parameter. In this
work we prove in detail the appearance of the $H^4$ terms due to
gravitational-anomaly-induced condensates in the energy density of the
primordial Universe, which can self-consistently induce inflation, and
subsequent exit from it, according to the generic features of RVM. We also
argue in favour of the robustness of our results, which were derived within an
effective low-energy field theory approach, against Ultra Violet completion of
the theory. During the radiation and matter-dominated eras, gravitational
anomalies cancel, as required for the consistency of the quantum
matter/radiation field theory. However, chiral and QCD-axion-type anomalies
survive and have important consequences for both cosmic magnetogenesis and
axionic dark matter in the Universe. Finally, the stringy RVM scenario
presented here predicts quintessence-like dynamical dark energy for the current

  application to the K$^{\pm}$ mass determination","40 pages, 16 figures",,,,"physics.data-an hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The question of how to combine experimental results that `appear' to be in
mutual disagreement, treated in detail years ago in a previous paper, is
revisited. The first novelty of the present note is the explicit use of
graphical models, in order to make the deterministic and probabilistic links
between the variables of interest more evident. Then, instead of aiming for
results in closed formulae, the integrals of interest are evaluated by {\em
Markov Chain Monte Carlo} (MCMC) sampling, with the algorithms (typically Gibbs
Sampler) implemented in the package JAGS (""Just Another Gibbs Sampler""). For
convenience, the JAGS functions are called from R scripts, thus gaining the
advantage given by the rich collection of mathematical, statistical and
graphical functions included in the R installation. The results of the previous
paper are thus easily re-obtained and the method is applied to the
determination of the charged kaon mass. This note, based on lectures to PhD
students and young researchers has been written with a didactic touch, and the
relevant JAGS/rjags code is provided. (A curious bias arising from the
sequential application of the $\sqrt{\chi^2/\nu}$ scaling prescription to
'apparently' discrepant results, found here, will be discussed in more detail
in a separate paper.)

atmospheric boundary layer from a time series of lidar measurements, using
Large-Eddy Simulations (LES) and a 4D-Var data assimilation algorithm. This
leads to an optimisation problem in which the error between measurements and
simulations is minimised over an observation time horizon. To exploit the
spatial coherence of the turbulence, we use a quadratic regularisation in the
objective function, that is based on the two-point covariance matrix. Moreover,
to improve conditioning, and remove continuity constraints, the problem is
transformed into a Karhunen-Lo\`eve basis. For the optimisation, we use a
quasi-Newton limited-memory BFGS algorithm combined with an adjoint approach
for the gradient. We also consider reconstruction based on a Taylor's frozen
turbulence (TFT) model as point of comparison. To evaluate the approach, we
construct a series of virtual lidar measurements from a fine-grid LES of a
pressure-driven boundary-layer. The reconstruction uses LES on a coarser mesh
and smaller domain, and results are compared to the fine-grid reference. Two
lidar scanning modes are considered: a classical plan-position-indicator mode,
which swipes the lidar beam in a horizontal plane, and a 3D pattern that is
based on a Lissajous curve. We find that normalised errors lie between 15% and
25% (error variance normalised by background variance) in the scanning region,
and increase to $100\%$ over a distance that is comparable to the correlation
length scale outside this scanning region. Moreover, LES outperforms TFT by 30%
to 70% depending on scanning mode and location.

sources seem to be considerably larger and shifted than the actual ones. Since
the scattering depends on the spectrum of density turbulence, better
understanding of the radio wave propagation provides indirect information on
the relative density fluctuations $\epsilon=\langle\delta n\rangle/\langle
n\rangle$ at the effective turbulence scale length. Here, we have analyzed 30
type III bursts detected by Parker Solar Probe (PSP). For the first time, we
have retrieved type III burst decay times $\tau_{\rm{d}}$ between 1 MHz and 10
MHz thanks to an unparalleled temporal resolution of PSP. We observed a
significant deviation in a power-law slope for frequencies above 1 MHz when
compared to previous measurements below 1 MHz by the twin-spacecraft Solar
TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) mission. We note that altitudes of
radio bursts generated at 1 MHz roughly coincide with an expected location of
the Alfv\'{e}n point, where the solar wind becomes super-Alfv\'{e}nic. By
comparing PSP observations and Monte Carlo simulations, we predict relative
density fluctuations $\epsilon$ at the effective turbulence scale length at
radial distances between 2.5$R_\odot$ and 14$R_\odot$ to range from $0.22$ and
$0.09$. Finally, we calculated relative density fluctuations $\epsilon$
measured in situ by PSP at a radial distance from the Sun of $35.7$~$R_\odot$
during the perihelion \#1, and the perihelion \#2 to be $0.07$ and $0.06$,

Separate phases are tracked using a geometric Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) method with
piecewise linear interface construction (PLIC). Thermal energy advection is
treated in conservative form and the geometric calculation of VOF fluxes at
computational cell boundaries is used consistently to calculate the fluxes of
heat capacity. The phase boundary is treated as sharp (infinitely thin), which
leads to a discontinuity in the velocity field across the interface in the
presence of phase change. The numerical difficulty of this jump is accommodated
with the introduction of a novel two-step VOF advection scheme. The method has
been implemented in the open source code PARIS and is validated using
well-known test cases. These include an evaporating circular droplet in
microgravity (2D), the Stefan problem and a 3D bubble in superheated liquid.
The accuracy shown in the results were encouraging. The 2D evaporating droplet
showed excellent prediction of the droplet volume evolution as well as
preservation of its circular shape. A relative error of less than 1% was
achieved for the Stefan problem case, using water properties at atmospheric
conditions. For the final radius of the bubble in superheated liquid at a Jacob
number of 0.5, a relative error of less than 6% was obtained on the coarsest

cluster (GC) 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc). This work was undertaken within the GC
sub-project of the Transient UV Objects project, a programme which aims to find
and study transient and strongly variable UV sources. Globular clusters are
ideal targets for transient searches because of their high stellar densities
and large populations of variable systems. Using all archival observations of
47 Tuc obtained with the UV/optical telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels
Swift observatory with the uvm2 filter, we searched for UV variability using a
specialised pipeline which utilises difference image analysis. We found four
clear transients, hereafter SW1-4, with positions consistent with those of
known cataclysmic variables (CVs) or CV candidates identified previously using
Hubble Space Telescope observations. All four sources exhibit significant
outbursts. Based on the inferred outburst properties and the association with
known CVs, we tentatively identify the UV transients as CV-dwarf novae (DNe).
Two DNe have been previously observed in 47 Tuc: V2, which has a position
consistent with that of SW4; and AKO 9, which was not in outburst during any of
the UVOT observations. We thus increase the known number of DNe in 47 Tuc to 5
and the total number of detected DNe in all Galactic GCs combined from 14 to
17. We discuss our results in the context of the apparent scarcity of DNe in
GCs. We suggest that the likely cause is observational biases, such as limited
sensitivity due to the high background from unresolved stars in the GC and
limited angular resolution of the telescopes used. We additionally detected one
strongly variable source in 47 Tuc, which could be identified as the known RR
Lyrae star HV 810. We found its period to have significantly increased with
respect to that measured from data taken in 1988.

demand for many nanophotonic applications. One of the challenges is to design
nanoparticles producing pure high-order multipole scattering (e.g., octopole,
hexadecapole), whose contribution is usually negligible compared to strong
low-order multipole scattering (i.e., dipole or quadrupole). Here we present an
intuitive way to design such nanoparticles by introducing a void inside them.
We show that both shell and ring nanostructures allow regimes with nearly pure
high-order multipole scattering. Experimentally measured scattering diagrams
from properly designed silicon rings at near-infrared wavelengths (~ 800 nm)
reproduce well scattering patterns of an electric octopole and magnetic
hexadecapole. Our findings advance significantly inverse engineering of
nanoparticles from given complex scattering characteristics, with possible
applications in biosensing, optical metasurfaces, and quantum communications.

recently by Kato, Naito, and Sagaki, carries commuting actions of the
nil-double affine Hecke algebra (nil-DAHA) and a $q$-Heisenberg algebra. The
action of the latter generates a free submodule of rank $|W|$, where $W$ is the
(finite) Weyl group. We show that this submodule is stable under the nil-DAHA,
which enables one to express the nil-DAHA action in terms of $W\times W$
matrices over the $q$-Heisenberg algebra. Our main result gives an explicit
algebraic construction of these matrices as a limit from the (non-nil) DAHA in
simply-laced type. This construction reveals that multiplication by equivariant
scalars, when expressed in terms of the Heisenberg algebra, is given by the
nonsymmetric $q$-Toda system introduced by Cherednik and the author.

  Imaging without Physics Priors","16 pages, 12 figures",,"10.1364/OE.424165",,"eess.IV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning (DL) is a powerful tool in computational imaging for many
applications. A common strategy is to reconstruct a preliminary image as the
input of a neural network to achieve an optimized image. Usually, the
preliminary image is acquired with the prior knowledge of the imaging model.
One outstanding challenge, however, is the degree to which the actual imaging
model deviates from the assumed model. Model mismatches degrade the quality of
the preliminary image and therefore affect the DL predictions. Another main
challenge is that since most imaging inverse problems are ill-posed and the
networks are over-parameterized, DL networks have flexibility to extract
features from the data that are not directly related to the imaging model. To
solve these challenges, a two-step-training DL (TST-DL) framework is proposed
for real-time computational imaging without physics priors. First, a single
fully-connected layer (FCL) is trained to directly learn the model. Then, this
FCL is fixed and concatenated with an un-trained U-Net architecture for a
second-step training to improve the output image fidelity, resulting in four
main advantages. First, it does not rely on an accurate representation of the
imaging model since the model is directly learned. Second, real-time imaging
can be achieved. Third, the TST-DL network is trained in the desired direction
and the predictions are improved since the first step is constrained to learn
the model and the second step improves the result by learning the optimal
regularizer. Fourth, the approach accommodates any size and dimensionality of
data. We demonstrate this framework using a linear single-pixel camera imaging
model. The results are quantitatively compared with those from other DL
frameworks and model-based iterative optimization approaches. We further extend
this concept to nonlinear models in the application of image
de-autocorrelation.

  following first referee report",,"10.1093/mnras/staa377",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We explore the expected galaxy environments of CIV absorbers at z>5 using the
Technicolor Dawn simulations. These simulations reproduce the observed history
of reionization, the z~6 galaxy stellar mass function, the Ly$\alpha$ forest
transmission at z>5, and the SiIV column density distribution (CDD) at z~5.5.
Nonetheless, the CIV CDD remains underproduced. Comparison with observed
CII/SiII equivalent width ratios and the CII line incidence suggests that a low
carbon yield accounts for some, but not all, of the CIV discrepancy.
Alternatively, a density-bounded escape scenario could harden the metagalactic
ionizing background more dramatically even than binary stellar evolution,
boosting the CIV CDD into near-agreement with observations. In this case
galaxies ionize more efficiently and fewer are required to host a given
high-ionization absorber. Absorbers' environments therefore constrain ionizing
escape. Regardless of the escape scenario, galaxies correlate with CIV
absorbers out to 300 proper kpc (pkpc). The correlation strengthens
independently with galaxy luminosity and CIV column density. Around strong
systems (log(N$_{\rm CIV}$/cm$^{-2}$)>14)), the overdensity of galaxies with
M$_{\rm UV}$<-18 or log($L_{{\rm Ly}\alpha}$/erg s$^{-1}$) > 41.9 declines from
200-300 within 100 pkpc to 40-60 within 250 pkpc. The previously-suggested
association between strong CIV absorbers and Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z>5 is not
expected. It may arise if both populations inhabit large-scale voids, but for
different reasons. Although most neighboring galaxies are too faint for HST,
JWST will, with a single pointing, identify ~10 neighboring galaxies per strong
CIV absorber at z > 5. Ground-based tests of these predictions are possible via
deep surveys for Ly$\alpha$ emission using integral field units.

extraterrestrial organics to the early Earth. However, IDPs experience heating
to > 500 ${\deg}$C for up to several seconds during atmospheric entry. In this
study, we aim to understand the effects of atmospheric entry heating on the
dominant organic component in IDPs by conducting flash heating experiments (4 s
to 400 {\deg}C, 600 {\deg}C, 800 {\deg}C, and 1000 {\deg}C) on insoluble
organic matter (IOM) extracted from the meteorite Cold Bokkeveld (CM2). For
each of the experimental charges, the bulk isotopic compositions of H, N, and C
were analyzed using IRMS, the H isotopic heterogeneities (occurrence of
hotspots) of the samples were measured by NanoSIMS, and the functional group
chemistry and ordering of the IOM was evaluated using FTIR and Raman
spectroscopy, respectively. IOM in particles heated to > 600 {\deg}C
experienced loss of isotopically heavy, labile H and N groups, resulting in
decreases in bulk ${\delta}$D, ${\delta}$15N, H/C and, upon heating > 800
{\deg}C, in N/C. The H heterogeneity was not greatly affected by flash heating
to < 600 {\deg}C, although the hotspots tended to be less isotopically
anomalous in the 600 {\deg}C sample than in the 400 {\deg}C sample. However,
the hotspots all but disappeared in the 800 {\deg}C sample. Loss of C=O groups
occurred at 800 {\deg}C. Based on the Raman G-band characteristics, the heating
resulted in increased ordering of the polyaromatic component of the IOM. The
data presented in this study show that all aspects of the composition of IOM in
IDPs are affected by atmospheric entry heating. Modelling and temperature
estimates from stepwise release of He has shown that most IDPs are heated to >
500{\deg}C (Love and Brownlee, 1991; Nier and Schlutter, 1993), hence,
atmospheric entry heating is expected to have altered the organic matter in
most IDPs.

paper describes the in-flight LORRI calibration measurements, and the results
derived from our analysis of the calibration data. LORRI has been remarkably
stable over time with no detectable changes (at the 1% level) in sensitivity or
optical performance since launch. By employing 4 by 4 re-binning of the CCD
pixels during read out, a special spacecraft tracking mode, exposure times of
30 sec, and co-addition of approximately 100 images, LORRI can detect
unresolved targets down to V = 22 (SNR=5). LORRI images have an instantaneous
dynamic range of 3500, which combined with exposure time control ranging from
0ms to 64,967 ms in 1ms steps supports high resolution, high sensitivity
imaging of planetary targets spanning heliocentric distances from Jupiter to
deep in the Kuiper belt, enabling a wide variety of scientific investigations.
We describe here how to transform LORRI images from raw (engineering) units
into scientific (calibrated) units for both resolved and unresolved targets. We
also describe various instrumental artifacts that could affect the
interpretation of LORRI images under some observing circumstances.

  generation investments","37 pages, 16 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Market power behaviour often occurs in modern wholesale electricity markets.
Mixed Complementarity Problems (MCPs) have been typically used for
computational modelling of market power when it is characterised by an
oligopoly with competitive fringe. However, such models can lead to myopic and
contradictory behaviour. Previous works in the literature have suggested using
conjectural variations to overcome this modelling issue. We first show however,
that an oligopoly with competitive fringe where all firms have investment
decisions, will also lead to myopic and contradictory behaviour when modelled
using conjectural variations. Consequently, we develop an Equilibrium Problem
with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model such an electricity market
structure. The EPEC models two types of players: price-making firms, who have
market power, and price-taking firms, who do not. In addition to generation
decisions, all firms have endogenous investment decisions for multiple new
generating technologies. The results indicate that, when modelling an oligopoly
with a competitive fringe and generation investment decisions, an EPEC model
can represent a more realistic market structure and overcome the myopic
behaviour observed in MCPs. The EPEC considered found multiple equilibria for
investment decisions and firms' profits. However, market prices and consumer
costs were found to remain relatively constant across the equilibria. In
addition, the model shows how it may be optimal for price-making firms to
occasionally sell some of their electricity below marginal cost in order to
de-incentivize price-taking firms from investing further into the market. Such
strategic behaviour would not be captured by MCP or cost-minimisation models.

that attract the attention of many researchers. Insight into the wind power
potential in an area and its probable variation due to climate change impacts
can provide useful information for energy policymakers and strategists for
sustainable development and management of the energy. In this study, spatial
variation of wind power density at the turbine hub-height and its variability
under future climatic scenarios are taken under consideration. An ANFIS based
post-processing technique was employed to match the power outputs of the
regional climate model with those obtained from the reference data. The
near-surface wind data obtained from a regional climate model are employed to
investigate climate change impacts on the wind power resources in the Caspian
Sea. Subsequent to converting near-surface wind speed to turbine hub-height
speed and computation of wind power density, the results have been investigated
to reveal mean annual power, seasonal, and monthly variability for a 20-year
period in the present (1981-2000) and in the future (2081-2100). The findings
of this study indicated that the middle and northern parts of the Caspian Sea
are placed with the highest values of wind power. However, the results of the
post-processing technique using adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
model showed that the real potential of the wind power in the area is lower
than those of projected from the regional climate model.

often rely on parameterized conditions to model preconditions for the
controllers, where the correct values of the parameters depend on factors
relating to the environment or the specific robot. In the absence of specific
calibration procedures a roboticist must painstakingly adjust the parameters
through a series of trial and error experiments. In this process, identifying
when the robot has taken an incorrect action, and what should be done is
straightforward, but finding the right parameter values can be difficult. We
present an alternative approach that we call, interactive SMT-based Robot
Transition Repair. During execution we record an execution trace of the
transition function, and we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances
where the robot has transitioned incorrectly, and what the correct transition
should have been. A user supplies these corrections based on the type of error
to repair, and an automated analysis of the traces partially evaluates the
transition function for each correction. This system of constraints is then
formulated as a MaxSMT problem, where the solution is a minimal adjustment to
the parameters that satisfies the maximum number of constraints. In order to
identify a repair that accurately captures user intentions and generalizes to
novel scenarios, solutions are explored by iteratively adding constraints to
the MaxSMT problem to yield sets of alternative repairs. We test with state
machines from multiple domains including robot soccer and autonomous driving,
and we evaluate solver based repair with respect to solver choice and
optimization hyperparameters. Our results demonstrate that SRTR can repair a
variety of states machines and error types 1) quickly, 2) with small numbers of
corrections, while 3) not overcorrecting state machines and harming generalized
performance.

ensure that the convergence of the computed quantities is not affected by
rounding errors and the final accuracy is high enough. Based on the
semiorthogonalization strategy, we develop the joint bidiagonalization process
with partial reorthogonalization(JBDPRO). In the JBDPRO algorithm,
reorthogonalizations occur only when necessary, which saves a big amount of
reorthogonalization work compared with the full reorthogonalization strategy.

algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times to guarantee safety as

and slower trajectories. This work proposes FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory

trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known

trajectory in the free-known space. The MIQP formulation proposed also allows
the solver to choose the trajectory interval allocation. FASTER is tested
extensively in simulation and in real hardware, showing flights in unknown
cluttered environments with velocities up to 7.8m/s, and experiments at the
maximum speed of a skid-steer ground robot (2m/s).

textual matching) between the extracted intent and the candidates to select the

develop a novel method to automatically generate the training data. For (ii),

law distributions, a pattern of findings known as Zipf's law. A vast literature
argues over whether this serves to optimize the efficiency of human
communication, however this claim is necessarily post hoc, and it has been
suggested that Zipf's law may in fact describe mixtures of other distributions.
From this perspective, recent findings that Sinosphere first (family) names are
geometrically distributed are notable, because this is actually consistent with
information theoretic predictions regarding optimal coding. First names form
natural communicative distributions in most languages, and I show that when
analyzed in relation to the communities in which they are used, first name
distributions across a diverse set of languages are both geometric and,
historically, remarkably similar, with power law distributions only emerging
when empirical distributions are aggregated. I then show this pattern of
findings replicates in communicative distributions of English nouns and verbs.
These results indicate that if lexical distributions support efficient
communication, they do so because their functional structures directly satisfy
the constraints described by information theory, and not because of Zipf's law.
Understanding the function of these information structures is likely to be key
to explaining humankind's remarkable communicative capacities.

  Office, Ref: 20-S-0428",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Uncorrelated optical space observation association represents a classic
needle in a haystack problem. The objective being to find small groups of
observations that are likely of the same resident space objects (RSOs) from
amongst the much larger population of all uncorrelated observations. These
observations being potentially widely disparate both temporally and with
respect to the observing sensor position. By training on a large representative
data set this paper shows that a deep learning enabled learned model with no
encoded knowledge of physics or orbital mechanics can learn a model for
identifying observations of common objects. When presented with balanced input
sets of 50% matching observation pairs the learned model was able to correctly
identify if the observation pairs were of the same RSO 83.1% of the time. The
resulting learned model is then used in conjunction with a search algorithm on
an unbalanced demonstration set of 1,000 disparate simulated uncorrelated
observations and is shown to be able to successfully identify true three
observation sets representing 111 out of 142 objects in the population. With
most objects being identified in multiple three observation triplets. This is
accomplished while only exploring 0.06% of the search space of 1.66e8 possible
unique triplet combinations.

domains to solve various image-related tasks, ranging from simple
classification to fine borders annotation. Naturally, many researches proposed
to use it to solve geological problems. Unfortunately, many of the seismic
processing tools were developed years before the era of machine learning,
including the most popular SEG-Y data format for storing seismic cubes. Its
slow loading speed heavily hampers experimentation speed, which is essential
for getting acceptable results. Worse yet, there is no widely-used format for
storing surfaces inside the volume (for example, seismic horizons). To address
these problems, we've developed an open-sourced Python framework with emphasis
on working with neural networks, that provides convenient tools for (i) fast
loading seismic cubes in multiple data formats and converting between them,
(ii) generating crops of desired shape and augmenting them with various
transformations, and (iii) pairing cube data with labeled horizons or other
types of geobodies.

is two, we consider a two-setting Bell experiment. If n is three, we consider a
three-setting Bell experiment. Twosetting model is an explicit local realistic
model for the values of a correlation function, given in a two-setting Bell
experiment. Three-setting model is an explicit local realistic model for the
values of a correlation function, given in a three-setting Bell experiment. In
the non-contextual scenario, there is not the difference between three-setting
model and two-setting model. And we cannot classify local realistic theories in
this case. This says that we can construct three-setting model from two-setting
model. Surprisingly we can discuss incompleteness in the Bell theorem using
non-contextual model. On the other hand, in the contextual scenario, there is
the difference between three-setting model and two-setting model. This says
that we must distinguish three-setting model from two-setting model. And we can
classify local realistic theories in this case.

many research work. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach for stock price
prediction using machine learning and deep learning-based methods. We select
the NIFTY 50 index values of the National Stock Exchange of India, over a
period of four years, from January 2015 till December 2019. Based on the NIFTY
data during the said period, we build various predictive models using machine
learning approaches, and then use those models to predict the Close value of
NIFTY 50 for the year 2019, with a forecast horizon of one week. For predicting
the NIFTY index movement patterns, we use a number of classification methods,
while for forecasting the actual Close values of NIFTY index, various
regression models are built. We, then, augment our predictive power of the
models by building a deep learning-based regression model using Convolutional
Neural Network with a walk-forward validation. The CNN model is fine-tuned for
its parameters so that the validation loss stabilizes with increasing number of
iterations, and the training and validation accuracies converge. We exploit the
power of CNN in forecasting the future NIFTY index values using three
approaches which differ in number of variables used in forecasting, number of
sub-models used in the overall models and, size of the input data for training
the models. Extensive results are presented on various metrics for all
classification and regression models. The results clearly indicate that
CNN-based multivariate forecasting model is the most effective and accurate in
predicting the movement of NIFTY index values with a weekly forecast horizon.

The low-loss indium-tin-oxide electrodes are employed to induce Joule heating
in $Ge_{2}Sb_{2}Te_{5}$-Si active waveguide region. The electrically induced
heating in the active region alters the effective refractive index of hybrid
microring resulting in a wavelength tuning of 1.04 nm for an applied voltage of
only 3V. The device exhibits high extinction ratios in the range of 20-41 dB
and a compact active footprint 0.96 $\mu m^{2}$ only and is suitable for the

Many
Indigenous traditions and knowledge systems around the world are based on the
stars, and the peoples' ability to observe and interpret stellar positions and
properties is of critical importance for daily life and cultural continuity.
The erasure of the night sky acts to erase Indigenous connection to the stars,
acting as a form of ongoing cultural and ecological genocide. Efforts to
reduce, minimise, or eliminate light pollution are being achieved with varying
degrees of success, but urban expansion, poor lighting design, and the
increased use of blue-light emitting LEDs as a cost-effective solution is
worsening problems related to human health, wildlife, and astronomical heritage
for the benefit of capitalistic economic growth. We provide a brief overview of
the issue, illustrating some of the important connections that the Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islander people of Australia maintain with the stars, as well
as the impact growing light pollution has on this ancient knowledge. We propose
a transdisciplinary approach to solving these issues, using a foundation based
on Indigenous philosophies and decolonising methodologies.

  Approach",,,,,"cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The connectivity structure of graphs is typically related to the attributes
of the nodes. In social networks for example, the probability of a friendship
between two people depends on their attributes, such as their age, address, and
hobbies. The connectivity of a graph can thus possibly be understood in terms
of patterns of the form 'the subgroup of individuals with properties X are
often (or rarely) friends with individuals in another subgroup with properties
Y'. Such rules present potentially actionable and generalizable insights into
the graph. We present a method that finds pairs of node subgroups between which
the edge density is interestingly high or low, using an information-theoretic
definition of interestingness. This interestingness is quantified subjectively,
to contrast with prior information an analyst may have about the graph. This
view immediately enables iterative mining of such patterns. Our work
generalizes prior work on dense subgraph mining (i.e. subgraphs induced by a
single subgroup). Moreover, not only is the proposed method more general, we
also demonstrate considerable practical advantages for the single subgroup
special case.

used for precise detection of variations in refractive indices of gaseous
samples. This sensing mechanism is quite straightforward. Cladding and core
modes of a capillary are simultaneously excited by coupling coherent laser
beams to the capillary cladding and core, respectively. Interferogram would be
generated as the light transmitted from the core interferes with the light
transmitted from the cladding. Variations in refractive index of the air
filling the core lead to variations in phase difference between the core and
cladding modes, thus shifting the interference fringes. Using a photodiode
together with a narrow slit, we could analyze the fringe shifts. The resolution
of the sensor was found to be 1*10-8 RIU, that is comparable to the highest
resolution obtained by other interferometric sensors reported in previous
literatures. Finally, we also analyze the temperature cross sensitivity of the
sensor. The advantages of our sensor include very low cost, high sensitivity,
straightforward sensing mechanism, and ease of fabrication.
