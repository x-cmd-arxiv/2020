of the hexagonal structure modulated by a ferromagnetic ordering in the
nanolaminated $ab$-basal planes. The weak chromium magnetic moments are an
order of magnitude stronger in the nanolaminated planes than along the vertical
axis. Theoretically, a small but notable, non-spin-collinear component explains
the existence of a non-perfect spin compensation along the $c$-axis. As shown
in this work, this spin distortion generates an overall residual spin moment
inside the unit cell resembling that of a ferri-magnet. Due to the different
competing magnetic interactions, electron correlations and temperature effects
both need to be considered to achieve a correct theoretical description of the
Cr$_{2}$GeC magnetic properties.

these COM form remains an open question. This study aims to constrain the
formation of complex organic molecules through comparisons of their abundances
towards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 (IRAS16293). We
utilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of
IRAS16293. The species identification and the rotational temperature and column
density estimation were derived by fitting the extracted spectra towards
IRAS16293 A and IRAS16293 B with synthetic spectra. The majority of the work in
this paper pertains to the analysis of IRAS16293 A for a comparison with the
results from the other binary component, which have already been published. We
detect 15 different COM, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous
companion protostar IRAS16293 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11
isotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first
detections of CH3OCH2OH and t-C2H5OCH3 towards IRAS16293 B and the follow-up
detection of CH2DCHO and CH3CDO. Twenty-four lines of CHD2OH are also
identified. The comparison between the two protostars of the binary system
shows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are
partially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is
consistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher
expected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the
hot corino towards IRAS16293 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in
IRAS16293 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In
parallel, the list of identified CHD2OH lines shows the need of accurate
spectroscopic data including their line strength.

vision. This task becomes challenging in real scenarios due to variations in
the background for both static and moving camera sequences. Several deep
learning methods for background subtraction have been proposed in the
literature with competitive performances. However, these models show
performance degradation when tested on unseen videos; and they require huge
amount of data to avoid overfitting. Recently, graph-based algorithms have been
successful approaching unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems.
Furthermore, the theory of graph signal processing and semi-supervised learning
have been combined leading to new insights in the field of machine learning. In
this paper, concepts of recovery of graph signals are introduced in the problem
of background subtraction. We propose a new algorithm called Graph BackGround
Subtraction (GraphBGS), which is composed of: instance segmentation, background
initialization, graph construction, graph sampling, and a semi-supervised
algorithm inspired from the theory of recovery of graph signals. Our algorithm
has the advantage of requiring less labeled data than deep learning methods
while having competitive results on both: static and moving camera videos.
GraphBGS outperforms unsupervised and supervised methods in several challenging
conditions on the publicly available Change Detection (CDNet2014), and UCSD
background subtraction databases.

present VLT/UVES observations of a transit of WASP-121b, an 'ultra-hot' Jupiter
previously found to exhibit a temperature inversion and detections of multiple
species at optical wavelengths. We present initial results using the blue arm
of UVES ($\approx$3700-5000A), recovering a clear signal of neutral Fe in the
planet's atmosphere at >8$\sigma$, which could contribute to (or even fully
explain) the temperature inversion in the stratosphere. However, using standard
cross-correlation methods, it is difficult to extract physical parameters such
as temperature and abundances. Recent pioneering efforts have sought to develop
likelihood `mappings' that can be used to directly fit models to
high-resolution datasets. We introduce a new framework that directly computes
the likelihood of the model fit to the data, and can be used to explore the
posterior distribution of parameterised model atmospheres via MCMC techniques.
Our method also recovers the physical extent of the atmosphere, as well as
account for time- and wavelength-dependent uncertainties. We measure a
temperature of $3710^{+490}_{-510}$K, indicating a higher temperature in the
upper atmosphere when compared to low-resolution observations. We also show
that the Fe I signal is physically separated from the exospheric Fe II.
However, the temperature measurements are highly degenerate with aerosol
properties; detection of additional species, using more sophisticated
atmospheric models, or combining these methods with low-resolution spectra
should help break these degeneracies.

of strong DIBs in association with ERE could be consistent with the suggestion
that the carriers of DIBs and ERE are identical. The likely ERE process is
recurrent fluorescence, enabled by inverse internal conversions from highly
excited vibrational levels of the ground state to low-lying electronic states
with subsequent transitions to ground. This provides a path to rapid radiative
cooling for molecules/molecular ions, greatly enhancing their ability to
survive in a strongly irradiated environment. The ratio of the equivalent

that observed in the low-density interstellar medium with UV interstellar

successfully applied in the standard discriminative classification setting. We
pose the question whether the IB can also be used to train generative

invertible network architectures (INNs), they are information-preserving by
construction. This seems contradictory to the idea of a bottleneck. In this
work, firstly, we develop the theory and methodology of IB-INNs, a class of
conditional normalizing flows where INNs are trained using the IB objective:
Introducing a small amount of {\em controlled} information loss allows for an
asymptotically exact formulation of the IB, while keeping the INN's generative
capabilities intact. Secondly, we investigate the properties of these models
experimentally, specifically used as generative classifiers. This model class
offers advantages such as improved uncertainty quantification and
out-of-distribution detection, but traditional generative classifier solutions
suffer considerably in classification accuracy. We find the trade-off parameter
in the IB controls a mix of generative capabilities and accuracy close to
standard classifiers. Empirically, our uncertainty estimates in this mixed
regime compare favourably to conventional generative and discriminative
classifiers.

magnetars, both in terms of radiative outbursts, and changes to its spin
properties. Here we report on a continuing monitoring campaign with the Neil
Gehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope in which we observe two new outbursts
from this source. The first outburst occurred in 2016 July, and the second in
2017 December, reaching peak 0.5-10 keV absorbed fluxes of
$3.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}\times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and
$2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, factors
of $\sim$5 and $\sim 4$ above the quiescent flux. Both new outbursts were
accompanied by spin-up glitches with amplitudes of $\Delta\nu=
4.47(6)\times10^{-7}$ Hz and $\Delta\nu= 4.32(5)\times10^{-7}$ Hz,
respectively. Following the 2016 July outburst, we observe, as for past
outbursts, a period of delayed torque fluctuations, which reach a peak
spin-down of $1.73\pm0.01$ times the quiescent rate, and which dominates the
spin evolution compared to the spin-up glitches. We also report an observation
near the peak of the first of these outbursts with NuSTAR in which hard X-ray
emission is detected from the source. This emission is well characterized by an
absorbed blackbody plus a broken power law, with a power-law index above
$13.4\pm0.6$ keV of $0.5_{-0.2}^{+0.3}$, similar to those observed in both
persistent and transient magnetars. The hard X-ray results are broadly
consistent with models of electron/positron cooling in twisted magnetic field
bundles in the outer magnetosphere. However the repeated outbursts and
associated torque fluctuations in this source remain puzzling.

  cytometry analyses",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Flow cytometry (FCM) is the standard multi-parameter assay for measuring
single cell phenotype and functionality. It is commonly used for quantifying
the relative frequencies of cell subsets in blood and disaggregated tissues. A
typical analysis of FCM data involves cell classification---that is, the
identification of cell subgroups in the sample---and comparisons of the cell
subgroups across samples or conditions. While modern experiments often
necessitate the collection and processing of samples in multiple batches,
analysis of FCM data across batches is challenging because differences across
samples may occur due to either true biological variation or technical reasons
such as antibody lot effects or instrument optics across batches. Thus a
critical step in comparative analyses of multi-sample FCM data---yet missing in
existing automated methods for analyzing such data---is cross-sample
calibration, whose goal is to align corresponding cell subsets across multiple
samples in the presence of technical variations, so that biological variations
can be meaningfully compared. We introduce a Bayesian nonparametric
hierarchical modeling approach for accomplishing both calibration and cell
classification simultaneously in a unified probabilistic manner. Three
important features of our method make it particularly effective for analyzing
multi-sample FCM data: a nonparametric mixture avoids prespecifying the number
of cell clusters; a hierarchical skew normal kernel that allows flexibility in
the shapes of the cell subsets and cross-sample variation in their locations;
and finally the ""coarsening"" strategy makes inference robust to departures from
the model such as heavy-tailness not captured by the skew normal kernels. We
demonstrate the merits of our approach in simulated examples and carry out a
case study in the analysis of two multi-sample FCM data sets.

distorted spacetime around accreting supermassive black holes. This signal
allows us to spatially map the geometry of the inner accretion flow - a region
which cannot yet be spatially resolved by any telescope - and provides a direct
measure of the black hole mass and spin. The reverberation timescale is set by
the light travel path between the direct emission from a hot X-ray corona and
the reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disc. However,
there is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole
mass, inner disc radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disc.
Here, we use a long X-ray observation of the highly-variable active galaxy,
IRAS 13224-3809, to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on
timescales of a day. With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects,
modelling reveals that the height of the X-ray corona increases with increasing
luminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This
simultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain
an independent timing-based estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole.
The uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical
reverberation method, making X-ray reverberation a powerful technique,
particularly for sources with low optical variability.

  Problems for Post-Disaster Humanitarian Operations",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Humanitarian logistics service providers have two major responsibilities
immediately after a disaster: locating trapped people and routing aid to them.
These difficult operations are further hindered by failures in the
transportation and telecommunications networks, which are often rendered
unusable by the disaster at hand. In this work, we propose a two-echelon
vehicle routing framework for performing these operations using aerial uncrewed
autonomous vehicles (UAVs or drones) to address the issues associated with
these failures. In our proposed framework, we assume that ground vehicles
cannot reach the trapped population directly, but they can only transport
drones from a depot to some intermediate locations. The drones launched from
these locations serve to both identify demands for medical and other aids
(e.g., epi-pens, medical supplies, dry food, water) and make deliveries to
satisfy them. Specifically, we present a decision framework, in which the
resulting optimization problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing
problem with trucks as the first echelon vehicles and for the second echelon
vehicles, we consider two types of drones. Hotspot drones have the capability
of providing a cell phone and internet reception and hence are used to capture
demands. Delivery drones are subsequently employed to satisfy the observed
demand. To handle demand uncertainty, we decompose the decision problem into
two stages: providing telecommunications capabilities in the first stage
thereby capturing demand precisely, and satisfying the resulting demands in the
second stage. To solve the resulting models, we propose efficient computational
approaches by designing a decomposition algorithm with column generation
(CG)-based heuristics to identify optimal drone routes.

simulation results. It is observed that the radiation pattern of the antenna
affects the slope of the path loss. Multi-path components increase the received

distance is smaller for lower gain antennas due to increased reception of

Stokes in 1851, describes many microscopic
biological flow phenomena, including cilia-driven transport and flagellar
motility; the need to quantify and understand these flows has motivated decades
of mathematical and computational research. Regularized stokeslet methods,
which have been used and refined over the past twenty years, offer significant
advantages in simplicity of implementation, with a recent modification based on
nearest-neighbour interpolation providing significant improvements in
efficiency and accuracy. Moreover this method can be implemented with the
majority of the computation taking place through built-in linear algebra,
entailing that state-of-the-art hardware and software developments in the
latter, in particular multicore and GPU computing, can be exploited through
minimal modifications ('passive parallelism') to existing MATLAB computer code.
Hence, and with widely-available GPU hardware, significant improvements in the
efficiency of the regularized stokeslet method can be obtained. The approach is
demonstrated through computational experiments on three model biological flows:
undulatory propulsion of multiple C. Elegans, simulation of progression and
transport by multiple sperm in a geometrically confined region, and left-right
symmetry breaking particle transport in the ventral node of the mouse embryo.
In general an order-of-magnitude improvement in efficiency is observed. This

their usefulness, MIP-based global optimization approaches are significantly
slower compared to the relatively mature algorithms for $\ell_1$-regularization

stripped from a subhalo torques its remaining bound remnant, which causes it to
lose orbital angular momentum. By running idealized simulations of a subhalo
orbiting within an analytical host halo potential, we isolate the effect of
self-friction from traditional dynamical friction due to the host halo. While
at some points in a subhalo's orbit the torque of the stripped material can
boost the orbital angular momentum of the remnant, the net effect over the long
term is orbital decay regardless of the initial orbital parameters or subhalo
mass. In order to quantify the strength of self-friction, we run a suite of
simulations spanning typical host-to-subhalo mass ratios and orbital
parameters. We find that the time-scale for self-friction, defined as the
exponential decay time of the subhalo's orbital angular momentum, scales with
mass ratio and orbital circularity similar to standard dynamical friction. The
decay time due to self-friction is roughly an order of magnitude longer,
suggesting that self-friction only contributes at the 10 percent level.
However, along more radial orbits, self-friction can occasionally dominate over
dynamical friction close to pericentric passage, where mass stripping is
intense. This is also the epoch at which the self-friction torque undergoes
large and rapid changes in both magnitude and direction, indicating that
self-friction is an important process to consider when modeling pericentric

form in the primordial gas since the metal enrichment enhances the cooling
ability and causes the fragmentation into smaller pieces. What actually happens
in such an environment, however, has not been explored in detail. Here, we
study the impact of the metal enrichment on the clouds, conducting
hydrodynamical simulations to follow the cloud evolution in cases with
different degree of the metal enrichment $Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. Below
$Z/Z_{\odot}=10^{-6}$, metallicity has no effect and supermassive stars form
along with a small number of low-mass stars. With more metallicity $Z/Z_{\odot}
\gtrsim 5 \times 10^{-6}$, although the dust cooling indeed promotes
fragmentation of the cloud core and produces about a few thousand low-mass
stars, the accreting flow preferentially feeds the gas to the central massive
stars, which grows supermassive as in the primordial case. We term this
formation mode as the {\it super competitive accretion}, where only the central
few stars grow supermassive while a large number of other stars are competing
for the gas reservoir. Once the metallicity exceeds $10^{-3}~Z_{\odot}$ and
metal-line cooling becomes operative, the central star cannot grow supermassive
due to lowered accretion rate. Supermassive star formation by the super
competitive accretion opens up a new window for seed BHs, which relaxes the
condition on metallicity and enhances the seed BH abundance.

""case BB"" mass transfer. According to this hypothesis, the progenitor of
GW190425 was a binary consisting of a neutron star and a ${\sim} 4-5 {M_\odot}$
helium star, which underwent a common-envelope process. Following the
supernovae of the helium star core, a tight, eccentric, double neutron star was
formed, which merged in ${\lesssim}$ 10 Myr. The helium star progenitor may
explain the unusually large mass of GW190425, while the short time to merger
may explain why we do not see similar systems in radio. In order to test this
hypothesis, we measure the eccentricity of GW190425 using publicly available
LIGO/Virgo data. We constrain the eccentricity at 10 Hz to be $e \leq 0.007$
with $90\%$ confidence. This result provides no evidence for or against the
unstable mass transfer scenario because the binary is likely to have
circularized to $e\lesssim10^{-4}$ by the time it entered the LIGO/Virgo band.
Future detectors operating in lower frequency bands will enable us to discern
the formation channel of mergers similar to GW190425 using eccentricity

turbulence. Stratified turbulence is fundamentally different from Kolmogorov
(isotropic, homogeneous) turbulence; kinetic energy not only cascades from
large to small scales, but it is also converted into buoyancy potential energy.
To understand the density and velocity fluctuations in the ICM, we conduct
high-resolution ($1024^2\times 1536$ grid points) hydrodynamical simulations of
subsonic turbulence (with rms Mach number $\mathcal{M}\approx 0.25$) and
different levels of stratification, quantified by the Richardson number
$\mathrm{Ri}$, from $\mathrm{Ri}=0$ (no stratification) to $\mathrm{Ri}=13$
(strong stratification). We quantify the density, pressure and velocity fields
for varying stratification because observational studies often use surface
brightness fluctuations to infer the turbulent gas velocities of the ICM. We
find that the standard deviation of the logarithmic density fluctuations
($\sigma_s$), where $s=\ln(\rho/\left<\rho(z)\right>)$, increases with
$\mathrm{Ri}$. For weakly stratified subsonic turbulence
($\mathrm{Ri}\lesssim10$, $\mathcal{M}<1$), we derive a new
$\sigma_s$--$\mathcal{M}$--$\mathrm{Ri}$ relation,
$\sigma_s^2=\ln(1+b^2\mathcal{M}^4+0.09\mathcal{M}^2\mathrm{Ri}H_P/H_S)$, where
$b=1/3$--$1$ is the turbulence driving parameter, and $H_P$ and $H_S$ are the
pressure and entropy scale heights respectively. We further find that the power
spectrum of density fluctuations, $P(\rho_k/\left<\rho\right>)$, increases in
magnitude with increasing $\mathrm{Ri}$, whereas the velocity power spectrum is
invariant. Thus, the ratio between density and velocity power spectra strongly
depends on $\mathrm{Ri}$. Pressure fluctuations, on the other hand, are
independent of stratification and only depend on $\mathcal{M}$.

suggest that the kinetic temperature of the inter-galactic medium (IGM) might
be significantly lower compared to its expected value. The colder IGM directly
affects the hydrogen recombination of the universe during the cosmic dawn and
dark ages by enhancing the rate of recombinations. Here, we study and quantify,
the impact of the colder IGM scenario on the recombination history of the
universe in the context of DM-baryonic interaction model which is widely used
to explain the depth of the EDGES 21-cm signal. We find that, in general, the
hydrogen ionisation fraction gets suppressed during the dark ages and cosmic
dawn and the suppression gradually increases at lower redshifts until X-ray
heating turns on. However, accurate estimation of the ionisation fraction
requires knowledge of the entire thermal history of the IGM, from the epoch of
thermal decoupling of hydrogen gas and the CMBR to the cosmic dawn. It is
possible that two separate scenarios which predict very similar HI differential
temperature during the cosmic dawn and are consistent with the EDGES 21-cm
signal might have very different IGM temperature during the dark ages. The
evolutions of the ionisation fraction in these two scenarios are quite
different. This prohibits us to accurately calculate the ionisation fraction
during the cosmic dawn using the EDGES 21-cm signal alone. We find that the
changes in the ionisation fraction w.r.t the standard scenario at redshift $z
\sim 17 $ could be anything between $\sim 0 \%$ to $\sim 36 \%$. This
uncertainty may be reduced if measurements of HI 21-cm differential temperature

representation by combining convolutional neural network together with various
temporal models, such as the families of Markov chain, optical flow, RNN and
temporal convolution. However, these pipelines consume enormous computing
resources due to the alternately learning process for spatial and temporal
information. One natural question is whether we can embed the temporal
information into the spatial one so the information in the two domains can be
jointly learned once-only. In this work, we answer this question by presenting
a simple yet powerful operator -- temporal interlacing network (TIN). Instead
of learning the temporal features, TIN fuses the two kinds of information by
interlacing spatial representations from the past to the future, and vice
versa. A differentiable interlacing target can be learned to control the
interlacing process. In this way, a heavy temporal model is replaced by a
simple interlacing operator. We theoretically prove that with a learnable
interlacing target, TIN performs equivalently to the regularized temporal
convolution network (r-TCN), but gains 4% more accuracy with 6x less latency on
6 challenging benchmarks. These results push the state-of-the-art performances
of video understanding by a considerable margin. Not surprising, the ensemble

monitoring of the blazar 3C 279, including GASP/WEBT, $\it{Fermi}$ and
$\it{Swift}$ data, as well as polarimetric and spectroscopic data. The X-ray
and $\gamma$-ray light curves correlate well, with no delay > 3 hours, implying
general co-spatiality of the emission regions. The $\gamma$-ray-optical
flux-flux relation changes with activity state, ranging from a linear to a more
complex dependence. The behaviour of the Stokes parameters at optical and radio
wavelengths, including 43 GHz VLBA images, supports either a predominantly
helical magnetic field or motion of the radiating plasma along a spiral path.
Apparent speeds of emission knots range from 10 to 37c, with the highest values
requiring bulk Lorentz factors close to those needed to explain $\gamma$-ray
variability on very short time scales. The Mg II emission line flux in the
`blue' and `red' wings correlates with the optical synchrotron continuum flux
density, possibly providing a variable source of seed photons for inverse
Compton scattering. In the radio bands we find progressive delays of the most
prominent light curve maxima with decreasing frequency, as expected from the
frequency dependence of the $\tau=1$ surface of synchrotron self-absorption.
The global maximum in the 86 GHz light curve becomes less prominent at lower
frequencies, while a local maximum, appearing in 2014, strengthens toward
decreasing frequencies, becoming pronounced at $\sim5$ GHz. These tendencies
suggest different Doppler boosting of stratified radio-emitting zones in the
jet.

applied to optical band colours, have had some success in predicting
photometric redshifts of quasi-stellar objects (QSOs): Although the mean of
differences between the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts is close to
zero, the distribution of these differences remains wide and distinctly
non-Gaussian. As per our previous empirical estimate of photometric redshifts,
we find that the predictions can be significantly improved by adding colours
from other wavebands, namely the near-infrared and ultraviolet. Self-testing
this, by using half of the 33 643 strong QSO sample to train the algorithm,
results in a significantly narrower spread for the remaining half of the
sample. Using the whole QSO sample to train the algorithm, the same set of
magnitudes return a similar spread for a sample of radio sources (quasars).
Although the matching coincidence is relatively low (739 of the 3663 sources
having photometry in the relevant bands), this is still significantly larger
than from the empirical method (2%) and thus may provide a method with which to
obtain redshifts for the vast number of continuum radio sources expected to be
detected with the next generation of large radio telescopes.

decaying into neutral pions and a pair of neutrinos. Three events were observed
in the KOTO signal region, with an expected background of about 0.05. Since no
clear signal of systematic errors have been found, the excess of events in the
decay $K_{L}\rightarrow\pi^0\nu\bar{\nu}$ is quite intriguing. One possibility
to explain this anomaly would be the presence of a scalar $\phi$ with mass of
the order of the pion mass and inducing decays $K_L \to \pi^0 \phi$ which mimic
the observed signal.A scalar with mass of the order of the pion mass and a
coupling to muons of the order of the Standard Model Higgs coupling could also
explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment anomaly $(g-2)_{\mu}$. We built on
these facts to show that a light singlet scalar with couplings to the leptons
and quarks as the ones induced by mixing with Higgs states in two Higgs doublet
models may lead to an explanation of both anomalies. More specifically, we show
that this is the case in the so-called type-X models in which leptons and
quarks couple to two different Higgs doublets, and for scalar masses that are
in the range between 40 and 70 MeV. Due to the relatively large coupling to
leptons required to fit $(g-2)_{\mu}$, the scalar lifetime accidentally falls
into the sub-nanosecond range which is essential to evade the severe proton
beam dump experiments and astrophysical constraints, though it becomes
sensitive to constraints from electron beam dump experiments. The additional
phenomenological properties of this model are discussed.

measure the time-dependence of the mean diffusivity $D(t)$ and mean kurtosis
$K(t)$ in cortical gray matter and in 25 gray matter sub-regions, in 10 healthy
subjects. Significant diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence is observed for
$t=21.2$-100 ms, and is characterized by a power-law tail $\sim t^{-\vartheta}$
with dynamical exponent $\vartheta$. To interpret our measurements, we
systematize the relevant scenarios and mechanisms for diffusion time-dependence
in the brain. Using effective medium theory formalisms, we derive an exact
relation between the power-law tails in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$. The estimated
power-law dynamical exponent $\vartheta\simeq1/2$ in both $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ is
consistent with one-dimensional diffusion in the presence of randomly
positioned restrictions along neurites. We analyze the short-range disordered
statistics of synapses on axon collaterals in the cortex, and perform
one-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of diffusion restricted by permeable
barriers with a similar randomness in their placement, to confirm the
$\vartheta=1/2$ exponent. In contrast, the K\""arger model of exchange is less
consistent with the data since it does not capture the diffusivity
time-dependence, and the estimated exchange time from $K(t)$ falls below our
measured $t$-range. Although we cannot exclude exchange as a contributing
factor, we argue that structural disorder along neurites is mainly responsible
for the observed time-dependence of diffusivity and kurtosis. Our observation
and theoretical interpretation of the $t^{-1/2}$ tail in $D(t)$ and $K(t)$
alltogether establish the sensitivity of a macroscopic MRI signal to
micrometer-scale structural heterogeneities along neurites in human gray matter

  A method for variable selection in multiblock analysis, called multiblock
variable influence on orthogonal projections (MB-VIOP) is explained in this
paper. MB-VIOP is a model based variable selection method that uses the data
matrices, the scores and the normalized loadings of an OnPLS model in order to
sort the input variables of more than two data matrices according to their
importance for both simplification and interpretation of the total multiblock
model, and also of the unique, local and global model components separately.
MB-VIOP has been tested using three multiblock datasets.
  MB-VIOP assesses the variable importance in any type of data. MB-VIOP
connects the input variables of different data matrices according to their
relevance for the interpretation of each latent variable, yielding enhanced
interpretability for each OnPLS model component. Besides, MB-VIOP can deal with
strong overlapping of types of variation, as well as with many data blocks with
very different dimensionality. The ability of MB-VIOP for generating
dimensionality reduced models with high interpretability makes this method
ideal for big data mining, multi-omics data integration and any study that
requires exploration and interpretation of large streams of data.

and orbital properties. Their bulk densities span a large range, from those
dense enough to be purely rocky to those needing a substantial contribution
from volatiles to their volumes. Their orbital configurations range from
compact, circular multi-transiting systems like Kepler-11 to systems like our
Solar System's terrestrial planets with wider spacings and modest but
significant eccentricities and mutual inclinations. Here we investigate whether
a continuum of formation conditions resulting from variation in the amount of
solids available in the inner disk can account for the diversity of orbital and
compositional properties observed for super Earths, including the apparent
dichotomy between single transiting and multiple transiting system. We simulate
in situ formation of super-Earths via giant impacts and compare to the observed
Kepler sample. We find that intrinsic variations among disks in the amount of
solids available for in situ formation can account for the orbital and
compositional diversity observed among Kepler's transiting planets. Our
simulations can account for the planets' distributions of orbital period
ratios, transit duration ratios, and transit multiplicity; higher
eccentricities for single than multi transiting planets; smaller eccentricities
for larger planets; scatter in the mass-radius relation, including lower
densities for planets with masses measured with TTVs than RVs; and similarity
in planets' sizes and spacings within each system. Our findings support the
theory that variation among super-Earth and mini-Neptune properties is
primarily locked in by different in situ formation conditions, rather than
arising stochastically through subsequent evolution.

regulated by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), the motions of galaxies through it,
and mergers with other clusters. AGN as a central heating source are key to
preventing runaway cooling flows, but their role in heating cores in a
cosmological context is still poorly understood. The activity of the AGN is
strongly linked to star formation, especially in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy
(BCG), likely because both rely on cold phase gas. A self-consistent model for
AGN and star formation in galaxy clusters thus requires cosmological context,
higher resolution, and a careful modeling of cooling and heating balance. In
this paper, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation
of the RomulusC galaxy cluster to study in detail the role of AGN and a major,
head-on merger in shaping the cluster core. The unprecedented resolution of the
RomulusC simulation captures the multiphase structure of the ICM. The realistic
large-scale outflows launched by very small-scale thermal injections, the
improved modeling of turbulent diffusion and mixing, and the particle nature of
the simulation allow us to carefully separate different heating channels. We
show that AGN activity, while efficient at regulating star formation, is
incapable of destroying a CC. Instead, that process is facilitated by a
head-on, 1:8 mass ratio merger. The merger generates bulk and turbulent
motions, which in turn mix high entropy gas generated by AGN and merger driven
shocks, turbulent dissipation and sloshing of the ICM by infalling
substructures. While central cooling times remain shorter than the Hubble time,
restoring a CC is made more difficult by the reduced precipitation rates at
larger radii, emphasizing that the AGN-ICM connection is truly a multi-scale
problem.

research field for many years. In the last decade, intensive developments in
deep learning (DL) have introduced new state-of-the-art segmentation systems.
In order to expand the knowledge on these topics, the CHAOS - Combined (CT-MR)
Healthy Abdominal Organ Segmentation challenge has been organized in
conjunction with IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI),
2019, in Venice, Italy. CHAOS provides both abdominal CT and MR data from
healthy subjects for single and multiple abdominal organ segmentation. Five
different but complementary tasks have been designed to analyze the
capabilities of current approaches from multiple perspectives. The results are
investigated thoroughly, compared with manual annotations and interactive
methods. The analysis shows that the performance of DL models for single
modality (CT / MR) can show reliable volumetric analysis performance (DICE:
0.98 $\pm$ 0.00 / 0.95 $\pm$ 0.01) but the best MSSD performance remain limited
(21.89 $\pm$ 13.94 / 20.85 $\pm$ 10.63 mm). The performances of participating
models decrease significantly for cross-modality tasks for the liver (DICE:
0.88 $\pm$ 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 $\pm$ 21.97 mm) and all organs (DICE: 0.85 $\pm$
0.21 MSSD: 33.17 $\pm$ 38.93 mm). Despite contrary examples on different
applications, multi-tasking DL models designed to segment all organs seem to
perform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance drop around 5\%).
Besides, such directions of further research for cross-modality segmentation
would significantly support real-world clinical applications. Moreover, having
more than 1500 participants, another important contribution of the paper is the
analysis on shortcomings of challenge organizations such as the effects of
multiple submissions and peeking phenomena.

exclusive reaction where both the proton and neutron in the final state are
assumed to be detected. Accordingly, the incident neutrino energy, the neutrino
scattering angle and the scattered neutrino's energy can all be reconstructed.
It is shown that for specific choices of kinematics the reaction proceeds
mainly via scattering from the proton, while for other choices of kinematics it
proceeds mainly from the neutron. Specific asymmetries are introduced to focus
on these attributes. Measurements in both regions have the potential to yield
valuable information on the nucleon's electroweak form factors at momentum
transfers up to a (GeV/c)$^2$. In particular, the cross sections are shown to
be very sensitive to the isoscalar axial-vector form factor, and sensitive but
less so to the magnetic strangeness form factor. Comparisons with other
reactions, specifically charge-changing neutrino reactions and both
parity-conserving and -violating electron scattering, have the potential to
provide new ways to test the Standard Model.

being in good agreement with experiments. In turn, also the description of the

of these sequences, finite-size scaling analysis turns out to be both feasible
and rewarding, despite relying on theoretical results for asymptotically large

analysis shows that only one of them undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation.
Furthermore, the transition temperature at which droplet formation sets in, is
observed to converge slowly with system size, so that even for our largest

possible progenitors, including black hole mergers, neutron star mergers, black
hole--neutron star mergers, supernovae, and cosmic string cusps. A subset of GW
events are expected to produce electromagnetic (EM) emission that, once
detected, will provide complementary information about their astrophysical
context. To that end, the LIGO--Virgo Collaboration (LVC) sends GW candidate
alerts to the astronomical community so that searches for their EM counterparts
can be pursued. The DESGW group, consisting of members of the Dark Energy
Survey (DES), the LVC, and other members of the astronomical community, uses
the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) to perform a search and discovery program for
optical signatures of LVC GW events. DESGW aims to use a sample of GW events as
standard sirens for cosmology. Due to the short decay timescale of the expected
EM counterparts and the need to quickly eliminate survey areas with no
counterpart candidates, it is critical to complete the initial analysis of each
night's images as quickly as possible. We discuss our search area
determination, imaging pipeline, and candidate selection processes. We review
results from the DESGW program during the first two LIGO--Virgo observing
campaigns and introduce other science applications that our pipeline enables.

contraction of two tensors can be efficiently calculated via generalized
unfoldings. It leads to new tensor models of the investigated system that do
not depend on the chosen unfolding and reveal the tensor structure of the data
model (such that all possible unfoldings can be seen at the same time). As an
example, we apply this new concept to the design of new receivers for
multi-carrier MIMO systems in wireless communications. In particular, we
consider MIMO OFDM systems with and without Khatri-Rao coding. The proposed
receivers exploit the channel correlation between adjacent subcarriers, require
the same amount of training symbols as traditional OFDM techniques, but have an
improved performance in terms of the symbol error rate. Furthermore, we show
that the spectral efficiency of the Khatri-Rao coded MIMO-OFDM can be increased
by introducing ""random coding"" such that the ""coding matrix"" also contains
useful information symbols. Considering this transmission technique, we derive
a tensor model and two types of receivers for randomly coded MIMO-OFDM systems

structural and dynamical properties of the Brown dwarf WD0137-349B. Methods: We
use the three dimensional GCM model Exo-FMS, with a dual-band grey
radiative-transfer scheme to model the atmosphere of WD0137-349B. The results
of the GCM model are post-processed using the three dimensional Monte Carlo
radiative-transfer model \textsc{cmcrt}. Results: Our results suggest
inefficient day-night energy transport and a large day-night temperature
contrast for WD0137-349B. Multiple flow patterns are present, shifting energy
asymmetrically eastward or westward depending on their zonal direction and
latitude. Regions of overturning are produced on the western terminator. We are
able to reproduce the start of the system near-IR emission excess at $\gtrsim$
1.95 $\mu$m as observed by the GNIRS instrument. Our model over predicts the IR
phase curve fluxes by factors of $\approx$1-3, but generally fits the shape of
the phase curves well. Chemical kinetic modelling using \textsc{vulcan}
suggests a highly ionised region at high altitudes can form on the dayside of
the Brown dwarf. Conclusions: We present a first attempt at simulating the
atmosphere of a short period White dwarf - Brown dwarf binary in a 3D setting.
Further studies into the radiative and photochemical heating from the UV
irradiation is required to more accurately capture the energy balance inside
the Brown dwarf atmosphere. Cloud formation may also play an important role in
shaping the emission spectra of the Brown dwarf.

scale factor is non vanishing at all times and hence does not favor big bang
cosmology. However, the profile of density in the radiation dominated universe
shows that EMSG supports inflationary cosmology. Inflationary cosmological
models are successful in providing convincing answers to major cosmological
issues like horizon problem, flatness problem and small value of cosmological
constant but hitherto no model of inflation has been observationally confirmed.
Owing to this, Varying Speed of Light (VSL) were introduced which are a class
of cosmological models which disfavor inflation and propose an alternative
route to solve these cosmological issues by just allowing the speed of light
(and Newtonian Gravitational constant) to vary. VSL theories were motivated to
address the shortcomings of inflation but do not address the shortcomings
related to the initial big bang singularity. In this spirit, we present here a
novel cosmological model which is free from both the ""initial big bang
singularity"" and ""inflation"" by incorporating a mutually varying speed of light
$c(t)$ and Newtonian gravitational constant $G(t)$ in the framework of EMSG. We
report that in EMSG, for a dust universe ($\omega=0$), cosmological models for
a time varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ and constant $c$ and $G$ are
indistinguishable, whereas for a radiation dominated universe ($\omega = 1/3$),
a mutually varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ provides an exiting alternative to
inflationary cosmology which is also free from initial big bang singularity. We
further report that for an ansatz of scale factor representing a bouncing
cosmological model, the VSL theory can be applied to a quadratic $T$ gravity
model to get rid of ""inflation"" and ""big bang singularity"" and concurrently
solve the above mentioned cosmological enigmas.

determine the link weight between them. To incorporate structural balance we
use a triad-updating rule where only one attribute of one agent is changed
intentionally in each update, but this also leads to accidental changes in link
weights and even link polarities. The link weight dynamics in the limit of
large $G$ is described by a Fokker-Planck equation from which the conditions

obtained. This ""paradise state"" of global cooperation is, however, difficult to

technological, and biological systems. However, the observable network
structures in real cases are often incomplete or unavailable due to measurement
errors or private protection issues. Therefore, inferring the complete network
structure is useful for understanding complex systems. The existing studies
have not fully solved the problem of inferring network structure with partial
or no information about connections or nodes. In this paper, we tackle the
problem by utilizing time series data generated by network dynamics. We regard
the network inference problem based on dynamical time series data as a problem
of minimizing errors for predicting future states and proposed a novel
data-driven deep learning model called Gumbel Graph Network (GGN) to solve the
two kinds of network inference problems: Network Reconstruction and Network
Completion. For the network reconstruction problem, the GGN framework includes
two modules: the dynamics learner and the network generator. For the network
completion problem, GGN adds a new module called the States Learner to infer
missing parts of the network. We carried out experiments on discrete and
continuous time series data. The experiments show that our method can
reconstruct up to 100% network structure on the network reconstruction task.
While the model can also infer the unknown parts of the structure with up to
90% accuracy when some nodes are missing. And the accuracy decays with the
increase of the fractions of missing nodes. Our framework may have wide
application areas where the network structure is hard to obtained and the time
series data is rich.

massive vector field. The vector, which interacts with only the quarks, leptons
and gravity, is neutral and long-living (longer than the age of the Universe)

cross section from nucleons, which is some 60 orders of magnitude below the

This property provides an explanation for whys and hows of dark matter
searches. We show that due to its geometrical origin the $Y_\mu$ does not
couple to scalars and gauge bosons. It couples only to fermions. This very
feature of the $Y_\mu$ makes it fundamentally different than all the other

between these two signals has attracted widespread attention from physicists.
In the braneworld scenario, GWs could propagate through the bulk while
electromagnetic waves (EMWs) are bounded on the brane, i.e., our Universe.
Therefore, the trajectories of GWs and EMWs may follow different pathes. If GWs
and EMWs are originated simultaneously from the same source on the brane, they
are expected to arrive at the observer successively. Consequently, the time
delay between GW170817 and GRB 170817A may carry the information of the extra
dimension. In this paper, we try to investigate the phenomenon in the context
of a five-dimensional dS ($\text{dS}_5$) spacetime. We first study two special
Universe models, i.e., de Sitter and Einstein-de Sitter models, and calculate
the gravitation horizon radius in each case. For the real Universe, we then
consider the $\Lambda$CDM model. Our results show that for the de Sitter model
of the Universe, the $\text{dS}_5$ radius could not contribute to the time
delay. With the data of the observation, we constrain the $\text{dS}_5$ radius
to $\ell\gtrsim7.5\times10^{2}\,\text{Tpc}$ for the Einstein-de Sitter model
and $\ell\gtrsim2.4\times10^{3}\,\text{Tpc}$ for the $\Lambda$CDM model. After
considering the uncertainty in the source redshift and the time-lags given by
different astrophysical processes of the binary NS merger, we find that our
constraints are not sensitive to the redshift in the range of (0.005, 0.01) and
the time-lag in the range of (-100s, 1.734s).

the true value is a sub-optimal strategy. Hence, to devise an optimal bidding
strategy, it is of utmost importance to learn the winning price distribution
accurately. Moreover, a demand-side platform (DSP), which bids on behalf of
advertisers, observes the winning price if it wins the auction. For losing
auctions, DSPs can only treat its bidding price as the lower bound for the
unknown winning price. In literature, typically censored regression is used to
model such partially observed data. A common assumption in censored regression
is that the winning price is drawn from a fixed variance (homoscedastic)
uni-modal distribution (most often Gaussian). However, in reality, these
assumptions are often violated. We relax these assumptions and propose a
heteroscedastic fully parametric censored regression approach, as well as a
mixture density censored network. Our approach not only generalizes censored
regression but also provides flexibility to model arbitrarily distributed
real-world data. Experimental evaluation on the publicly available dataset for
winning price estimation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
Furthermore, we evaluate our algorithm on one of the largest demand-side
platforms and significant improvement has been achieved in comparison with the
baseline solutions.

  for Deep Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The design of machine learning systems often requires trading off different
objectives, for example, prediction error and energy consumption for deep
neural networks (DNNs). Typically, no single design performs well in all
objectives; therefore, finding Pareto-optimal designs is of interest. The
search for Pareto-optimal designs involves evaluating designs in an iterative
process, and the measurements are used to evaluate an acquisition function that
guides the search process. However, measuring different objectives incurs
different costs. For example, the cost of measuring the prediction error of
DNNs is orders of magnitude higher than that of measuring the energy
consumption of a pre-trained DNN, as it requires re-training the DNN. Current
state-of-the-art methods do not consider this difference in objective
evaluation cost, potentially incurring expensive evaluations of objective
functions in the optimization process. In this paper, we develop a novel
decoupled and cost-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm, we call
Flexible Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (FlexiBO) to address this issue.
FlexiBO weights the improvement of the hypervolume of the Pareto region by the
measurement cost of each objective to balance the expense of collecting new
information with the knowledge gained through objective evaluations, preventing
us from performing expensive measurements for little to no gain. We evaluate
FlexiBO on seven state-of-the-art DNNs for image recognition, natural language
processing (NLP), and speech-to-text translation. Our results indicate that,
given the same total experimental budget, FlexiBO discovers designs with
4.8$\%$ to 12.4$\%$ lower hypervolume error than the best method in
state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization.

regions of the ISM, tracing scales and structures ranging from kpc disks to the
most compact and dust-obscured regions of galactic nuclei. The
ortho-H2O(423-330) line at 448 GHz, which was recently detected in a local
luminous infrared galaxy (Pereira-Santaella et al. 2017), offers a unique
constraint on the excitation conditions and ISM properties in deeply buried
galaxy nuclei since the line requires high far-IR optical depths to be excited.
In this letter, we report the first high-redshift detection of the 448 GHz
H2O(423-330) line using ALMA, in a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG)
at z=3.63. After correcting for magnification, the luminosity of the 448 GHz
H2O line is ~10^6 L_sun. In combination with three other previously detected
H2O lines, we build a model that ""resolves"" the dusty ISM structure of the SMG,
and find that it is composed of a ~1 kpc optically thin (optical depth at
100{\mu}m {\tau}_{100}~0.3) disk component with dust temperature T_{dust}
\approx 50 K emitting a total infrared power of 5e12 L_sun with surface density
\Sigma_{IR}=4e11 L_sun kpc^{-2}, and a very compact (0.1 kpc) heavily
dust-obscured ({\tau}_{100} \gtrsim 1) nuclear core with very warm dust (100 K)
and \Sigma_{IR}=8e12 L_sun kpc^{-2}. The H2O abundance in the core component,
X_{H2O}~(0.3-5)e{-5}, is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the
disk component. The optically thick core has the characteristic properties of
an Eddington-limited starburst, providing evidence that radiation pressure on
dust is capable of supporting the ISM in buried nuclei at high redshifts. The
multi-component ISM structure revealed by our models illustrates that dust and
molecules such as H2O are present in regions characterized by highly differing
conditions and scales, extending from the nucleus to more extended regions of
SMGs.

In this paper, we propose a video compression method that extracts and
compresses the foreground and background of the video separately. The
compression ratio is greatly improved by sharing background information among
multiple adjacent frames through an adaptive background updating and
interpolation module. Besides, we present two different schemes to compress the

importance of temporal information for video compression. In the decoding end,
a coarse-to-fine two-stage module is applied to achieve the composition of the
foreground and background and the enhancements of frame quality. Furthermore,
an adaptive sampling method for surveillance cameras is proposed, and we have
shown its effects through software simulation. The experimental results show
that our proposed method requires 69.5% less bpp (bits per pixel) than the

ML models that accurately capture the dependence of the dynamics results on the
quantum dynamics parameters. Most importantly, the present work demonstrates
that the BML models can generalize quantum results to different dynamical
processes. Thus, a ML model trained by a combination of approximate and
rigorous results for a certain inelastic transition can make accurate
predictions for different transitions without rigorous calculations. This opens
the possibility of improving the accuracy of approximate calculations for
quantum transitions that are out of reach of rigorous scattering calculations.

wireless communications in millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands which
suffer from high path loss and severe shadowing. In addition, the propagation
channel in mmWave frequencies incorporates only a few number of spatial
clusters requiring a procedure to align the corresponding narrow beams with the
angle of departure (AoD) of the channel clusters. The objective of this
procedure, called beam alignment (BA) is to increase the beamforming gain for
subsequent data communication. Several prior studies consider optimizing BA
procedure to achieve various objectives such as reducing the BA overhead,
increasing throughput, and reducing power consumption. While these studies
mostly provide optimized BA schemes for scenarios with a single active user,
there are often multiple active users in practical networks. Consequently, it
is more efficient in terms of BA overhead and delay to design multi-user BA
schemes which can perform beam management for multiple users collectively. This
paper considers a class of multi-user BA schemes where the base station
performs a one shot scan of the angular domain to simultaneously localize
multiple users. The objective is to minimize the average of expected width of
remaining uncertainty regions (UR) on the AoDs after receiving users'
feedbacks. Fundamental bounds on the optimal performance are analyzed using
information theoretic tools. Furthermore, a beam design optimization problem is
formulated and a practical BA scheme, which provides significant gains compared
to the beam sweeping used in 5G standard is proposed.

relativistic Hartree-Bogoliubov equations in coordinate space are solved in the
DiracWoods-Saxon basis to consider the continuum effects. Numerical checks are
performed from light nuclei to heavy nuclei. The techniques to construct the
DRHBc mass table for even-even nuclei are explored. The DRHBc theory is
extended to study heavier nuclei beyond magnesium isotopes. Taking Nd isotopes
as examples, the experimental binding energies, two-neutron separation
energies, quadrupole deformations, and charge radii are reproduced rather well.
The deformation and continuum play essential roles in the description of
nuclear masses and prediction of drip-line nuclei. By examining the

from functional MRI (fMRI) data, have an individual fingerprint that can be
used to identify an individual from a population (subject-identification).
Although identification rate is high when using resting-state FCs, other tasks
show moderate to low values. Furthermore, identification rate is
task-dependent, and is low when distinct cognitive states, as captured by
different fMRI tasks, are compared. Here we propose an embedding framework,
GEFF (Graph Embedding for Functional Fingerprinting), based on group-level
decomposition of FCs into eigenvectors. GEFF creates an eigenspace
representation of a group of subjects using one or more task FCs (Learning
Stage). In the Identification Stage, we compare new instances of FCs from the
Learning subjects within this eigenspace (validation dataset). The validation
dataset contains FCs either from the same tasks as the Learning dataset or from
the remaining tasks that were not included in Learning. Assessment of
validation FCs within the eigenspace results in significantly increased
subject-identification rates for all fMRI tasks tested and potentially
task-independent fingerprinting process. It is noteworthy that combining
resting-state with one fMRI task for GEFF Learning Stage covers most of the
cognitive space for subject identification. In addition to
subject-identification, GEFF was also used for identification of cognitive
states, i.e. to identify the task associated to a given FC, regardless of the
subject being already in the Learning dataset or not (subject-independent
task-identification). In addition, we also show that eigenvectors from the
Learning Stage can be characterized as task-dominant, subject dominant or
neither, providing a deeper insight into the extent of variance in functional
connectivity across individuals and cognitive states.

conducted a time series decomposition for daily ozone (O3) records; scrutinized
the ability of the time-stratified schema on controlling the yearly, monthly

trend. Based on this finding, we proposed a new logistic regression approach in
which we did adjustment for the weekly time trend. A comparison between the
traditional model and the proposed method was done by simulation. An empirical
study was conducted to explore potential associations between air pollutants

control on yearly and monthly time trends but not on weekly time trend.
Therefore, the estimation from the traditional logistical regression basically
reveals the effect of weekly time trend, instead of the transient effect. In

transform medical and public health practices. Prominent demonstrations of AI

Reports of issues arising from their use in health are already appearing. As
the use of ADS in health expands, it is probable that these hazards will
manifest more widely. Bias, incontestability, and privacy erosion give rise to
mechanisms by which existing social, economic and health disparities are
perpetuated and amplified. Consequently, there is a significant risk that use
of ADS in health will exacerbate existing population health inequities. The
industrial scale and rapidity with which ADS can be applied heightens the risk
to population health equity. It is incumbent on health practitioners and policy
makers therefore to explore the potential implications of using ADS, to ensure

successfully reproduce existing experimental data on elastic modulus and
complex viscosity for these stress factors, besides predicting the development

conjugates in temperature and pH, and concentration and pH. Further it is shown
that the variation of viscosity with shear rate shows a power law behavior for
almost all variations in stress parameters. Our modelling using fractional

sequence-to-sequence (SEQ2SEQ) paradigm. Typically, the model is equipped with
a single set of learned parameters to generate responses for given input
contexts. When confronting diverse conversations, its adaptability is rather
limited and the model is hence prone to generate generic responses. In this
work, we propose an {\bf Ada}ptive {\bf N}eural {\bf D}ialogue generation
model, \textsc{AdaND}, which manages various conversations with
conversation-specific parameterization. For each conversation, the model
generates parameters of the encoder-decoder by referring to the input context.
In particular, we propose two adaptive parameterization mechanisms: a
context-aware and a topic-aware parameterization mechanism. The context-aware
parameterization directly generates the parameters by capturing local semantics
of the given context. The topic-aware parameterization enables parameter
sharing among conversations with similar topics by first inferring the latent
topics of the given context and then generating the parameters with respect to
the distributional topics. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale
real-world conversational dataset show that our model achieves superior
performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and human evaluations.

approaches by introducing a new reward function that not only eliminates the
requirement of a pre supervised learning (SL) step but also decreases the
chance of collision in crowded environments. That improved things, but there
were still a lot of failure cases. So, we developed a hybrid approach to
leverage the simpler FMP approach in stuck, simple and high-risk cases, and
continue using RL for normal cases in which FMP can't produce optimal path.
Also, we extend GA3C-CADRL algorithm to 3D environment. Simulation results show
that the proposed algorithm outperforms both deep RL and FMP algorithms and
produces up to 50% more successful scenarios than deep RL and up to 75% less
extra time to reach goal than FMP.

graph-based applications, such as node classification, link prediction, and

to some machine learning tasks in continuous space. However, regardless of the
fruitful progress, for some kind of graph applications, such as graph
compression and edge partition, it is very hard to reduce them to some graph

reformulating a global layout for a specific graph, which is an important
NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem: graph ordering. In this paper, we
propose to attack the graph ordering problem behind such applications by a
novel learning approach. Distinguished from greedy algorithms based on
predefined heuristics, we propose a neural network model: Deep Order Network
(DON) to capture the hidden locality structure from partial vertex order sets.
Supervised by sampled partial order, DON has the ability to infer unseen
combinations. Furthermore, to alleviate the combinatorial explosion in the
training space of DON and make the efficient partial vertex order sampling , we
employ a reinforcement learning model: the Policy Network, to adjust the
partial order sampling probabilities during the training phase of DON
automatically. To this end, the Policy Network can improve the training
efficiency and guide DON to evolve towards a more effective model
automatically. Comprehensive experiments on both synthetic and real data
validate that DON-RL outperforms the current state-of-the-art heuristic
algorithm consistently. Two case studies on graph compression and edge

model not only provides insight into relevant flow regimes, but is also used in
conjunction with experimental data to guide more computationally prohibitive
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the full governing equations. A unique
feature of our modelling solution is the use of an efficient iterative
procedure in order to update the interfacial deformation based on stresses

The interplay between these techniques allows us to study previously unreported

i.e., belongs to $\ell^1(\mathbb{N})$. We also obtain explicit constants as
functions of the parameters of the model. The proof is based on maximal

existing anomaly detection approaches: (1) many approaches perform well on

latent representation can be bounded for normal samples while anomaly images
are usually outside such bounded intervals, referred to as structure
consistency. We implement this idea and evaluate its performance for anomaly
detection. Our experiments with three datasets show that OIAD can detect over
$90\%$ of anomalies while maintaining a low false alarm rate. It can also
detect suspicious samples from samples labeled as clean, coincided with what

\cite{sampson1992} proposed an approach to allowing nonstationarity in

dependence is a reasonable assumption. \cite{sampson1992} achieve this with two
deformation functions, which are chosen as thin plate splines, each
representing how one of the two coordinates in $D$-space relates to the
original $G$-space coordinates. This works extends the deformation approach,
and the dimension expansion approach of \cite{bornn2012}, to a regression-based
framework in which all dimensions in $D$-space are treated as ""smooths"" as
found, for example, in generalized additive models. The framework offers an
intuitive and user-friendly approach to specifying $D$-space, allows different
levels of smoothing for dimensions in $D$-space, and allows objective inference
for all model parameters. Furthermore, a numerical approach is proposed to
avoid non-bijective deformations, should they occur, which applies to any
deformation. The proposed framework is demonstrated on the solar radiation data
studied in \cite{sampson1992}, and then on an example related to risk analysis,

We develop the equations of motion for spherically symmetric spacetime in the
presence of anisotropic matter distribution by considering the physically valid
expressions of the metric potentials, $\nu=Br^2+2lnC$ and $\lambda=ln(1 +
ar^2+br^4)$. To attain the values of the unknown constants we consider the
observational data of $Cen~ X-3$, $EXO ~1785-248$ and $LMC~ X-4$ star models.
Further, by using evaluated form of the solutions we provide many aspects which
are described by the physical status like effective energy density, components
of radial and transverse pressure, energy conditions, stability against
equilibrium of the forces, speed of sound, mass-radius relation, surface
redshift, compactness parameter, adiabatic index and anisotropic measurement.
It is observed that all these features follow physically accepted patterns and
the resulting outcome is in the experimental range which depicts the viability
of our presented $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity models.

theories with conformal matter content at large R-charge $Q_{\rm R}\to \infty$
with fixed 't Hooft-like coupling $\kappa = Q_{\rm R}\,g_{\rm YM}^{2}$. Our
analysis concerns two distinct classes of natural scaling functions. The first
is built in terms of chiral/anti-chiral two-point functions. The second
involves one-point functions of chiral operators in presence of
$\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Wilson-Maldacena loops. In the rank-1 $SU(2)$ case, the
two-point sector has been recently shown to be captured by an auxiliary chiral
random matrix model. We extend the analysis to $SU(N)$ theories and provide an
algorithm that computes arbitrarily long perturbative expansions for all
considered models, parametric in the rank. The leading and next-to-leading
contributions are cross-checked by a three-loops computation in $\mathcal N=1$
superspace. This perturbative analysis identifies maximally non-planar Feynman
diagrams as the relevant ones in the double scaling limit. In the
Wilson-Maldacena sector, we obtain closed expressions for the scaling
functions, valid for any rank and $\kappa$. As an application, we analyze
quantitatively the large 't Hooft coupling limit $\kappa\gg 1$ where we
identify all perturbative and non-perturbative contributions. The latter are
associated with heavy electric BPS states and the precise correspondence with

must be created and maintained alongside the software itself. One safeguard
from vulnerabilities and failures in code is to ensure correct behavior on the
boundaries between the input space sub-domains. So-called boundary value
analysis (BVA) and boundary value testing (BVT) techniques aim to exercise
those boundaries and increase test effectiveness. However, the concepts of BVA
and BVT themselves are not generally well defined, and it is not clear how to
identify relevant sub-domains, and thus the boundaries delineating them, given
a specification. This has limited adoption and hindered automation. We clarify
BVA and BVT and introduce Boundary Value Exploration (BVE) to describe
techniques that support them by helping to detect and identify boundary inputs.
Additionally, we propose two concrete BVE techniques based on
information-theoretic distance functions: (i) an algorithm for boundary
detection and (ii) the usage of software visualization to explore the behavior
of the software under test and identify its boundary behavior. As an initial
evaluation, we apply these techniques on a much used and well-tested date

scheme, a base station (BS) equipped with a full dimensional array of antennas
optimizes its radiation pattern in the three-dimensional space to maximize the
received signal to noise ratio at a target user. We also study the effect of
angle of incidence of the received signal by the RIS on its reflecting
properties and find a relation between this angle and the BS antenna array's
tilt and elevation angles. The user receives the signal from a reflected path
from the RIS as well as from a direct path from the BS which both depend on the
BS antenna array's tilt and elevation angles. These angles and also the RIS

results show that using RIS-assisted 3D beamforming with optimized phase shifts

that despite of the mixed taxonomies, the Hilda group highly resembles to the
Trojans in the distribution of rotation periods and amplitudes, and even the LR
group (mostly C and X-type) Hildas follow this rule. Contrary to the Main Belt,

systems (such as two-dimensional electron gases) is fundamentally essential for
spintronic applications, which is yet a challenge to date. In this work, we
establish the metamagnetic phase diagram of 4$f$ antiferromagnetic TbScO$_3$
and reveal its giant magnetic response to sub-tesla magnetic field, which has
not been reported thus far. Utilizing this giant magnetic response, we
demonstrate that the spin polarization of two-dimensional electron gas in
SrTiO$_3$/LaTiO$_3$/TbScO$_3$ heterostructure can be manipulated successfully
in aid of interfacial 3\textit{d}-4\textit{f} exchange interaction. Remarkably,
the hysteretic magnetoresistances of two-dimensional electron gas at the
SrTiO$_3$/LaTiO$_3$ interface are entirely determined by the metamagnetic phase
transitions of the underlying TbScO$_3$ substrate. Our results pave a novel
route to engineer the spin polarization of low-dimensional electron systems in
4$f$ antiferromagnet-based heterostructures.

from researchers, but it is far from being well solved partly due to the three
defects of the existing works. First, the existing works often assume an
underlying information diffusion model, which is impractical in real world due
to the complexity of information diffusion. Second, the existing works often
ignore the prediction of the infection order, which also plays an important
role in social network analysis. At last, the existing works often depend on
the requirement of underlying diffusion networks which are likely unobservable
in practice. In this paper, we aim at the prediction of both node infection and
infection order without requirement of the knowledge about the underlying
diffusion mechanism and the diffusion network, where the challenges are
two-fold. The first is what cascading characteristics of nodes should be
captured and how to capture them, and the second is that how to model the
non-linear features of nodes in information cascades. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model called Deep Collaborative Embedding (DCE)
for information cascade prediction, which can capture not only the node
structural property but also two kinds of node cascading characteristics. We
propose an auto-encoder based collaborative embedding framework to learn the
node embeddings with cascade collaboration and node collaboration, in which way
the non-linearity of information cascades can be effectively captured. The
results of extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets verify the
effectiveness of our approach.

through the development of a computer program, called Analogator, that learns
to make analogies by example. By ""seeing"" many different analogy problems,
along with possible solutions, Analogator gradually develops an ability to make
new analogies. That is, it learns to make analogies by analogy. This approach
stands in contrast to most existing research on analogy-making, in which
typically the a priori existence of analogical mechanisms within a model is
assumed. The present research extends standard connectionist methodologies by
developing a specialized associative training procedure for a recurrent network
architecture. The network is trained to divide input scenes (or situations)
into appropriate figure and ground components. Seeing one scene in terms of a
particular figure and ground provides the context for seeing another in an
analogous fashion. After training, the model is able to make new analogies
between novel situations. Analogator has much in common with lower-level
perceptual models of categorization and recognition; it thus serves as a
unifying framework encompassing both high-level analogical learning and
low-level perception. This approach is compared and contrasted with other
computational models of analogy-making. The model's training and generalization
performance is examined, and limitations are discussed.

requires more accurate and efficient RFI flagging methods than its
counterparts. In the last decades, approaches based upon artificial
intelligence (AI), such as codes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
have been proposed to identify RFI more reliably and efficiently. However, RFI
flagging of FAST data with such methods has often proved to be erroneous, with
further manual inspections required. In addition, network construction as well
as preparation of training data sets for effective RFI flagging has imposed
significant additional workloads. Therefore, rapid deployment and adjustment of
AI approaches for different observations is impractical to implement with
existing algorithms. To overcome such problems, we propose a model called
RFI-Net. With the input of raw data without any processing, RFI-Net can detect
RFI automatically, producing corresponding masks without any alteration of the
original data. Experiments with RFI-Net using simulated astronomical data show
that our model has outperformed existing methods in terms of both precision and
recall. Besides, compared with other models, our method can obtain the same
relative accuracy with fewer training data, thus reducing the effort and time
required to prepare the training data set. Further, the training process of
RFI-Net can be accelerated, with overfittings being minimized, compared with
other CNN codes. The performance of RFI-Net has also been evaluated with
observing data obtained by FAST and the Bleien Observatory. Our results
demonstrate the ability of RFI-Net to accurately identify RFI with
fine-grained, high-precision masks that required no further modification.

interesting potential. In the last 35 years, several researchers proposed
approaches for applying videos in requirements engineering due to their
communication richness and effectiveness. However, these approaches mainly use
videos but omit the details about how to produce them. This lack of guidance is
one crucial reason why videos are not an established documentation option for
successful requirements communication and thus shared understanding. Software
professionals are not directors and thus they do not necessarily know what
constitutes a good video in general and for an existing approach. Therefore,
this lack of knowledge and skills on how to produce and use videos for visual
communication impedes the application of videos by software professionals in
requirements engineering.
  How to Create Effective Videos and Vision Videos?: This technical report
addresses this lack of knowledge and skills by software professionals. We
provide two guidelines that can be used as checklists to avoid frequent flaws
in the production and use of videos respectively vision videos. Software
professionals without special training should be able to follow these
guidelines to achieve the basic capabilities to produce (vision) videos that
are accepted by their stakeholders. These guidelines represent a core set of
those capabilities in the preproduction, shooting, postproduction, and viewing
of (vision) videos. We do not strive for perfection in any of these
capabilities, .e.g., technical handling of video equipment, storytelling, or
video editing. Instead, these guidelines support all steps of the (vision)
video production and use process to a balanced way.

width, i.e., for which establishing local consistency of an instance of the CSP
not only decides if there is a solution but also ensures that every solution
may be obtained from a locally consistent instance by greedily assigning values

  Our main result is that the structures S under consideration have relational
width exactly (2, L) where L is the maximal size of a forbidden subgraph of a
homogeneous graph under consideration, but not smaller than 3. It beats the
upper bound (2m, 3m) where m = max(arity(S)+1, L, 3) and arity(S) is the
largest arity of a relation in S, which follows from a sufficient condition
implying bounded relational width from the literature. Since L may be

repulsive and long-range attractive part. By comparison with micromagnetic
simulations, the attractive part is attributed to a local suppression of
exchange interaction. The novel approach to deduce defect induced pinning
potentials on the sub-nm scale is transferable to other non-collinear spin
textures eventually enabling an atomic scale design of defect configurations,
e.g., for reliable read-out in race-track type devices.

Great Observatory of the 2030s. For the first time in human history,
technologies have matured sufficiently to enable an affordable space-based
telescope mission capable of discovering and characterizing Earthlike planets
orbiting nearby bright sunlike stars in order to search for signs of
habitability and biosignatures. Such a mission can also be equipped with
instrumentation that will enable broad and exciting general astrophysics and
planetary science not possible from current or planned facilities. HabEx is a
space telescope with unique imaging and multi-object spectroscopic capabilities
at wavelengths ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to near-IR. These capabilities
allow for a broad suite of compelling science that cuts across the entire NASA
astrophysics portfolio. HabEx has three primary science goals: (1) Seek out
nearby worlds and explore their habitability; (2) Map out nearby planetary
systems and understand the diversity of the worlds they contain; (3) Enable new
explorations of astrophysical systems from our own solar system to external
galaxies by extending our reach in the UV through near-IR. This Great
Observatory science will be selected through a competed GO program, and will
account for about 50% of the HabEx primary mission. The preferred HabEx
architecture is a 4m, monolithic, off-axis telescope that is
diffraction-limited at 0.4 microns and is in an L2 orbit. HabEx employs two
starlight suppression systems: a coronagraph and a starshade, each with their
own dedicated instrument.

conductive substrate localizes the electric fields. Here we present

super-resolution is due to the field configuration resulting from the coupled

different for non-gap vs. gap mode configurations. This influences the overall
enhancement which depends on the Raman mode symmetry and substrate structure.

single-shot detectors have gained great attention recently. To solve the
complex scale variations, single-shot detectors make scale-aware predictions
based on multiple pyramid layers. However, the features in the pyramid are not
scale-aware enough, which limits the detection performance. Two common problems
in single-shot detectors caused by object scale variations can be observed: (1)
small objects are easily missed; (2) the salient part of a large object is
sometimes detected as an object. With this observation, we propose a new
Neighbor Erasing and Transferring (NET) mechanism to reconfigure the pyramid
features and explore scale-aware features. In NET, a Neighbor Erasing Module
(NEM) is designed to erase the salient features of large objects and emphasize
the features of small objects in shallow layers. A Neighbor Transferring Module
(NTM) is introduced to transfer the erased features and highlight large objects
in deep layers. With this mechanism, a single-shot network called NETNet is
constructed for scale-aware object detection. In addition, we propose to
aggregate nearest neighboring pyramid features to enhance our NET. NETNet
achieves 38.5% AP at a speed of 27 FPS and 32.0% AP at a speed of 55 FPS on MS
COCO dataset. As a result, NETNet achieves a better trade-off for real-time and
accurate object detection.

contributions to the slow part of the asymptotic density-density correlation

short-range forward scattering and also with localised scalar static impurities
(where backward scattering takes place) has a compact analytical expression in
terms of simple functions that have second order poles and involve only the
scale-independent bare transmission and reflection coefficients. This proof
uses conventional fermionic perturbation theory resummed to all orders,
together with the idea that for such systems, the (connected) moments of the
density operator all vanish beyond the second order - the odd ones vanish
identically and the higher order even moments are less singular than the second
order moment which is the only one included. This important result is the
crucial input to the recently introduced ""Non-Chiral Bosonization Technique""
(NCBT) to study such systems. The results of NCBT cannot be easily compared
with the results obtained using conventional bosonization as the former only
extracts the most singular parts of the correlation functions albeit for
arbitrary impurity strengths and mutual interactions. The latter, ambitiously
attempts to study all the parts of the asymptotic correlation functions and is
thereby unable to find simple analytical expressions and is forced to operate
in the vicinity of the homogeneous system or the half line (the opposite
extreme). For a fully homogeneous system or its antithesis viz. the half-line,
all the higher order connected moments of the density vanish identically which
means the results of chiral bosonization and NCBT ought to be the same and
indeed they are.

may morph their text and portray themselves as a different gender or
demographic. Similarly, a chatbot may need to customize its communication style
to improve engagement with its audience. This manner of changing the style of
written text has gained significant attention in recent years. Yet these past
research works largely cater to the transfer of single style attributes. The
disadvantage of focusing on a single style alone is that this often results in
target text where other existing style attributes behave unpredictably or are
unfairly dominated by the new style. To counteract this behavior, it would be
nice to have a style transfer mechanism that can transfer or control multiple
styles simultaneously and fairly. Through such an approach, one could obtain
obfuscated or written text incorporated with a desired degree of multiple soft
styles such as female-quality, politeness, or formalness.
  In this work, we demonstrate that the transfer of multiple styles cannot be
achieved by sequentially performing multiple single-style transfers. This is
because each single style-transfer step often reverses or dominates over the
style incorporated by a previous transfer step. We then propose a neural
network architecture for fairly transferring multiple style attributes in a
given text. We test our architecture on the Yelp data set to demonstrate our
superior performance as compared to existing one-style transfer steps performed

to provision (i.e., develop, deploy, manage, and orchestrate) applications in
cloud. However, existing PaaS solutions (including IoT PaaS) usually focus on
cloud and do not enable provisioning of applications with components spanning
cloud and fog. provisioning such applications require novel functions, such as
application graph generation, that are absent from existing PaaS. Furthermore,
several functions offered by existing PaaS (e.g., publication/discovery) need
to be significantly extended in order to fit in a hybrid cloud/fog environment.
In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for PaaS for hybrid cloud/fog

addition, it enables the discovery of existing cloud and fog nodes and
generates application graphs. A proof of concept is built based on Cloudify

only on the individual standard deviations, but not on the dispersion of the
values around the mean. This property leads sometimes to the embarrassing
situation in which the combined result 'looks' somehow at odds with the
individual ones. A practical way to cure the problem is to enlarge the
resulting standard deviation by the $\sqrt{\chi^2/\nu}$ scaling, a prescription
employed with arbitrary criteria on when to apply it and which individual
results to use in the combination. But the `apparent' discrepancy between the
combined result and the individual ones often remains. Moreover this rule does
not affect the resulting `best value', even if the pattern of the individual
results is highly skewed. In addition to these reasons of dissatisfaction,
shared by many practitioners, the method causes another issue, recently noted
on the published measurements of the charged kaon mass. It happens in fact
that, if the prescription is applied twice, i.e. first to a sub-sample of the
individual results and subsequently to the entire sample, then a bias on the
result of the overall combination is introduced. The reason is that the
prescription does not guaranty statistical sufficiency, whose importance is
reminded in this script, written with a didactic spirit, with some historical

The final stage, a user interface, made the model capable of optimizing with
given user input of minimum area and viscosity. Flood fill is used to define a
boundary area function so that the optimal shape does not bypass the minimum
area. Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) is employed to make sure the
ultimate shape is optimized while circumventing the required area. Jointly,
shapes with extremely low drags are found explored by a practical user
interface with no human domain knowledge and modest computation overhead.

basis of the utility that these compromises have for the users of a system,
where an agent's utility function maps their payoff vectors to scalar utility
values. This utility-based approach naturally leads to two different
optimisation criteria for agents in a MOMAS: expected scalarised returns (ESR)
and scalarised expected returns (SER). In this article, we explore the
differences between these two criteria using the framework of multi-objective
normal form games (MONFGs). We demonstrate that the choice of optimisation
criterion (ESR or SER) can radically alter the set of equilibria in a MONFG

provide reasonable predictions, faster, and with higher flexibility compared to
simulation crop modeling. The earlier the prediction during the growing season
the better, but this has not been thoroughly investigated as previous studies
considered all data available to predict yields. This paper provides a machine
learning based framework to forecast corn yields in three US Corn Belt states
(Illinois, Indiana, and Iowa) considering complete and partial in-season
weather knowledge. Several ensemble models are designed using blocked
sequential procedure to generate out-of-bag predictions. The forecasts are made
in county-level scale and aggregated for agricultural district, and state level
scales. Results show that ensemble models based on weighted average of the base
learners outperform individual models. Specifically, the proposed ensemble
model could achieve best prediction accuracy (RRMSE of 7.8%) and least mean
bias error (-6.06 bu/acre) compared to other developed models. Comparing our
proposed model forecasts with the literature demonstrates the superiority of
forecasts made by our proposed ensemble model. Results from the scenario of
having partial in-season weather knowledge reveal that decent yield forecasts
can be made as early as June 1st. To find the marginal effect of each input
feature on the forecasts made by the proposed ensemble model, a methodology is
suggested that is the basis for finding feature importance for the ensemble
model. The findings suggest that weather features corresponding to weather in

challenges. The first is the personalization of preference learning, which
requires that different items/users have different contributions to the
learning of user preference or item quality. The second one is dynamic
explanation, which is crucial for the timeliness of recommendation
explanations. The last one is the granularity of explanations. In practice,
aspect-level explanations are more persuasive than item-level or user-level
ones. In this paper, to address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a
novel model called Hybrid Deep Embedding (HDE) for aspect-based explainable
recommendations, which can make recommendations with dynamic aspect-level
explanations. The main idea of HDE is to learn the dynamic embeddings of users
and items for rating prediction and the dynamic latent aspect
preference/quality vectors for the generation of aspect-level explanations,
through fusion of the dynamic implicit feedbacks extracted from reviews and the
attentive user-item interactions. Particularly, as the aspect
preference/quality of users/items is learned automatically, HDE is able to
capture the impact of aspects that are not mentioned in reviews of a user or an
item. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the
recommending performance and explainability of HDE. The source code of our work

In this work, for the first time, we propose to address the problem of

existing network mining algorithms and facilitate various downstream tasks. To
deal with real-world massive networks with complex attributes, we propose to
leverage the well-developed data cube technology to organize network objects
w.r.t. their essential attributes. An efficient reinforcement learning
algorithm is then developed to automatically explore the data cube structures
and construct the optimal query-specific networks. With extensive experiments
of two classic network mining tasks on different real-world large datasets, we
show that our proposed cube2net pipeline is general, and much more effective
and efficient in query-specific network construction, compared with other
methods without the leverage of data cube or reinforcement learning.

entities' community structural information) can not be well embedded in the
modelling; (2), community evolution can not be well described in the
literature. Therefore, we propose a non-parametric fragmentation coagulation
based Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodel (fcMMSB). Our model performs
entity-based clustering to capture the community information for entities and
linkage-based clustering to derive the group information for links
simultaneously. Besides, the proposed model infers the network structure and
models community evolution, manifested by appearances and disappearances of
communities, using the discrete fragmentation coagulation process (DFCP). By
integrating the community structure with the group compatibility matrix we
derive a generalized version of MMSB. An efficient Gibbs sampling scheme with
Polya Gamma (PG) approach is implemented for posterior inference. We validate
our model on synthetic and real world data.

in Kidney Exchange, House Allocation, School Choice etc. The general theme of
these problems is to allocate goods in a fair manner amongst participating
agents. The agents generally have a unit supply/demand of a good that they want
to exchange with other agents. On the other hand, Bochet et al. study a more
general version of the problem where they allow for agents to have arbitrary
number of divisible goods to be rationed to other agents in the network. In
this current work, our main focus is on non-bipartite networks where agents
have arbitrary units of a homogeneous indivisible good that they want to
exchange with their neighbors. Our aim is to develop mechanisms that would
identify a fair and strategyproof allocation for the agents in the network.
Thus, we generalize the kidney exchange problem to that of a network with
arbitrary capacity of available goods. Our main idea is that this problem and a
couple of other related versions of non-bipartite fair allocation problem can
be suitably transformed to one of fair allocations on bipartite networks for
which we know of well studied fair allocation mechanisms.

four regions and some new design rules were proposed. By using the SPICE model,

Optimization (ACO) algorithms proven to be efficient at finding satisfactory
solutions to many difficult combinatorial optimization problems. The slow-down
in Moore's law, and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs)
capable of conducting general-purpose computations at high speed, has sparked
considerable research efforts into the development of GPU-based ACO
implementations. In this paper, we discuss a range of novel ideas for improving
the GPU-based parallel MMAS implementation, allowing it to better utilize the
computing power offered by two subsequent Nvidia GPU architectures.
Specifically, based on the weighted reservoir sampling algorithm we propose a
novel parallel implementation of the node selection procedure, which is at the
heart of the MMAS and other ACO algorithms. We also present a memory-efficient
implementation of another key-component -- the tabu list structure -- which is
used in the ACO's solution construction stage. The proposed implementations,
combined with the existing approaches, lead to a total of six MMAS variants,
which are evaluated on a set of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances
ranging from 198 to 3,795 cities. The results show that our MMAS implementation
is competitive with state-of-the-art GPU-based and multi-core CPU-based
parallel ACO implementations: in fact, the times obtained for the Nvidia V100
Volta GPU were up to 7.18x and 21.79x smaller, respectively. The fastest of the
proposed MMAS variants is able to generate over 1 million candidate solutions
per second when solving a 1,002-city instance. Moreover, we show that, combined
with the 2-opt local search heuristic, the proposed parallel MMAS finds
high-quality solutions for the TSP instances with up to 18,512 nodes.
