strategy rely on a deeper understanding of the needs and opinions of
constituent members (e.g. citizens, shareholders). While it has become easier
to collect a large number of opinions on a topic, there is a necessity for
automated tools to help navigate the space of opinions. In such contexts
understanding and quantifying the similarity between opinions is key. We find
that measures based solely on text similarity or on overall sentiment often
fail to effectively capture the distance between opinions. Thus, we propose a
new distance measure for capturing the similarity between opinions that
leverages the nuanced observation -- similar opinions express similar sentiment
polarity on specific relevant entities-of-interest. Specifically, in an
unsupervised setting, our distance measure achieves significantly better
Adjusted Rand Index scores (up to 56x) and Silhouette coefficients (up to 21x)
compared to existing approaches. Similarly, in a supervised setting, our
opinion distance measure achieves considerably better accuracy (up to 20%
increase) compared to extant approaches that rely on text similarity, stance
similarity, and sentiment similarity

ground state of this material was has not been ultimately identified. In
particular, two characteristic temperatures of about $\sim 40$ K and $\sim 20$
K manifesting themselves as anomalies in different magnetic measurements are
discussed controversially. A combined analysis of the experimental data
complemented with theoretical calculations of exchange constants enabled us to
identify below 39 K an ``intermediate'' quasi-2D static spin state. This spin
state is characterized by a staggered magnetization with a temperature
evolution that agrees with the predictions for the 2D XY model. We observe that
this state gradually transforms at 15 K into a fully developed 3D
antiferromagnetic N\'eel state. We ascribe such an extended quasi-2D static
regime to an effective magnetic decoupling of the honeycomb planes due to a
strong frustration of the interlayer exchange interactions which inhibits
long-range spin-spin correlations across the planes. Interestingly, we find

various graph learning tasks, but their analysis is still at its infancy. Graph
scattering transforms (GSTs) offer training-free deep GCN models that extract
features from graph data, and are amenable to generalization and stability
analyses. The price paid by GSTs is exponential complexity in space and time
that increases with the number of layers. This discourages deployment of GSTs
when a deep architecture is needed. The present work addresses the complexity
limitation of GSTs by introducing an efficient so-termed pruned (p)GST
approach. The resultant pruning algorithm is guided by a
graph-spectrum-inspired criterion, and retains informative scattering features
on-the-fly while bypassing the exponential complexity associated with GSTs.
Stability of the novel pGSTs is also established when the input graph data or
the network structure are perturbed. Furthermore, the sensitivity of pGST to
random and localized signal perturbations is investigated analytically and
experimentally. Numerical tests showcase that pGST performs comparably to the
baseline GST at considerable computational savings. Furthermore, pGST achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art GCNs in graph and 3D point cloud
classification tasks. Upon analyzing the pGST pruning patterns, it is shown
that graph data in different domains call for different network architectures,
and that the pruning algorithm may be employed to guide the design choices for
contemporary GCNs.

relationships between the scale characteristics of the field and the density
along and across the axis of the power tube and their dependence on time have

electrical conductivity in suspensions of hard conducting platelets are
affected by the addition of platelets and their degree of spontaneous
alignment. For aspect ratios $10, 25$ and $50$, we consistently observe a
monotonically decreasing percolation threshold as a function of volume
fraction. In the nematic phase, the distribution of particles inside the
percolating clusters becomes less spherically symmetric and the aspect ratio of
the clusters increases. However, the clusters are also anisotropically shaped
in the isotropic phase, although their aspect ratio remains constant as a
function of volume fraction. Mapping the percolating clusters of platelets to
linear resistor networks, and assigning unit conductance to all connections, we
find a constant conductivity both across the isotropic-nematic transition and
in the respective stable phases. This behaviour is consistent with the other
observed topological properties of the networks. On the contrary, using an
anisotropic conductance model, the network conductivity decreases with
increasing volume fraction in the isotropic, and further diminishes at the
onset of the nematic. Hence, our observations consistently suggest that unlike
for rod-like fillers, the network structures that arise from platelet
suspensions are neither very sensitive to the particle aspect ratio nor to
alignment, thus rendering platelets less versatile fillers for dispersion in
conductive composites.

radiate across the electromagnetic spectrum. Linking the emission produced at
different wavelengths can provide valuable information about the accretion
process and any associated outflows. In this work, we study simultaneous X-ray
and UV/optical observations of the neutron star LMXB \source, obtained with the
Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory during its 2013, 2014 and 2016 accretion
outbursts. We find that the UV/optical and X-ray emission are strongly
correlated during all three outbursts. For the 2013 and 2014 episodes, which
had the best Swift sampling, we find that the correlation between the
UV/optical and X-ray fluxes is significantly steeper during the decay (soft
state) of the outburst than during the rise (hard-to-soft state). We observe an
UV/optical hysteresis behaviour that is likely linked to the commonly known
X-ray spectral hysteresis pattern. For the decays of the three outbursts we
obtain a correlation index that cannot be directly explained by any single
model. We suspect that this is a result of multiple emission processes
contributing to the UV/optical emission, but we discuss alternative
explanations. Based on these correlations, we discuss which mechanisms are
likely dominating the UV/optical emission of Aql X-1.

as possible optical counterpart of a BBH event a transient source declining in

one QSO. Nineteen transients characterized by a single detection were not

players. If there are many such solutions an important question is how to
select amongst them. We study this question for the Multicommodity Flow
Coalition Game, used to model cooperation between autonomous systems (AS) in
the Internet. In short, strategies are flows in a capacitated network. The
payoff to a node is the total flow which it terminates. Markakis-Saberi show
this game is balanced and hence has a non-empty core by Scarf's Theorem. In the
transferable utility (TU) version this gives a polynomial-time algorithm to
find core elements, but for ASs side payments are not natural. Finding core
elements in NTU games tends to be computationally more difficult. For this
game, the only previous result gives a procedure to find a core element when
the supply graph is a path. We extend their work with an algorithm,
Incorporate, which produces many different core elements.
  We use our algorithm to evaluate specific instances by generating many core
vectors. We call these the Empirical Core for a game. We find that sampled core
vectors are more consistent with respect to social welfare (SW) than for
fairness (minimum payout). For SW they tend to do as well as the optimal linear
program value $LP_{sw}$. In contrast, there is a larger range in fairness for
the empirical core; the fairness values tend to be worse than the optimal
fairness LP value $LP_{fair}$. We study this discrepancy in the setting of
general graphs with single-sink demands. In this setting we give an algorithm
which produces core vectors that simultaneously maximize SW and fairness. This
leads to the following bicriteria result for general games. Given any
core-producing algorithm and any $\lambda \in (0,1)$, one can produce an
approximate core vector with fairness (resp. social welfare) at least $\lambda
LP_{fair}$ (resp $(1-\lambda) LP_{sw}$).

process of optimizing operating rules for multireservoir systems with multiple
objectives. Prior studies applied the concept of direct policy search (DPS), in
which the release policy is expressed as a set of parameterized functions
(e.g., neural networks) that are optimized by simulating the performance of
different parameter value combinations over a testing period. The problem with
this approach is that the operators generally avoid adopting such artificial
black-box functions for the direct real-time control of their systems,
preferring simpler tools with a clear connection to the system physics. This
study addresses this mismatch by replacing the black-box functions in DPS with
physically based parameterized operating rules, for example by directly using
target levels in dams as decision variables. This leads to results that are
physically interpretable and may be more acceptable to operators. The
methodology proposed in this work is applied to a network of five reservoirs
and four power plants in the Nechi catchment in Colombia, with four interests
involved: average energy generation, firm energy generation, flood hazard, and
flow regime alteration. The release policy is expressed depending on only 12
parameters, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared
to existing approaches of multiobjective DPS. The resulting four-dimensional
Pareto-approximate set offers a variety of operational strategies from which
operators may choose one that corresponds best to their preferences. For
demonstration purposes, one particular optimized policy is selected and its
parameter values are analyzed to illustrate how the physically based operating
rules can be directly interpreted by the operators.

which is often called the perturbative expansion of the Chern-Simons theory, is
valued in a graded space generated by Jacobi diagrams. It counts embeddings of
this kind of unitrivalent graphs in the ambient manifold, in a sense that is
explained in the book, using integrals over configuration spaces, or, in a dual
way, algebraic intersections in the same configuration spaces. When the ambient
manifold is the standard 3-sphere, the invariant Z is a universal Vassiliev
link invariant studied by many authors including Guadagnini, Martellini and
Mintchev, Bar-Natan, Bott and Taubes, Altsch\""uler and Freidel, Thurston and
Poirier... This book contains a more flexible definition of this invariant. We
extend Z to a functor on a category of framed tangles in rational homology
cylinders and we describe the behaviour of this functor under various
operations including some cabling operations. We also compute iterated
derivatives of our extended invariant with respect to the discrete derivatives
associated to the main theories of finite type invariants. Together with recent
results of Massuyeau and Moussard, our computations imply that the restriction
of Z to rational homology 3-spheres (equipped with empty links) contains the
same information as the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki LMO invariant for these manifolds.
They also imply that the degree one part of Z is the Casson-Walker invariant.

electric field applied perpendicular to the plane of hexagonal lattices prompt
repetitive shear-like deformations of the solitons, which synchronize the

deformations upon turning voltage on and off is not invariant upon reversal of
time, prompting lateral translations of the crystallites of torons within
quasi-hexagonal periodically deformed lattices. We probe how these motions
depend on voltage and frequency of oscillating field applied in an experimental

inter-relations between synchronized deformations of the soft solitonic

treatment, but the underlying cause of the anti-cancer effect of CAP is not
well understood yet. Among different theories and observations, one theory in
particular has been postulated in great detail and consists of a very complex
network of reactions that are claimed to account for the anti-cancer effect of
CAP. Here, the key concept is a reactivation of two specific apoptotic cell
signaling pathways through catalase inactivation caused by CAP. Thus, it is
postulated that the anti-cancer effect of CAP is due to its ability to
inactivate catalase, either directly or indirectly. A theoretical investigation
of the proposed theory, especially the role of catalase inactivation, can
contribute to the understanding of the underlying cause of the anti-cancer
effect of CAP. In the present study, we develop a mathematical model to analyze
the proposed catalase-dependent anti-cancer effect of CAP. Our results show
that a catalase-dependent reactivation of the two apoptotic pathways of

planning and control, enabling complex manipulation tasks without relying on
high-fidelity modeling or simulation. The key question we address is when
should we use planning and when should we use control to achieve the task?
Planners are designed to find paths through complex configuration spaces, but
for highly underactuated systems, such as deformable objects, achieving a
specific configuration is very difficult even with high-fidelity models.
Conversely, controllers can be designed to achieve specific configurations, but
they can be trapped in undesirable local minima due to obstacles. Our approach
consists of three components: (1) A global motion planner to generate gross
motion of the deformable object; (2) A local controller for refinement of the
configuration of the deformable object; and (3) A novel deadlock prediction
algorithm to determine when to use planning versus control. By separating
planning from control we are able to use different representations of the
deformable object, reducing overall complexity and enabling efficient
computation of motion. We provide a detailed proof of probabilistic
completeness for our planner, which is valid despite the fact that our system
is underactuated and we do not have a steering function. We then demonstrate
that our framework is able to successfully perform several manipulation tasks
with rope and cloth in simulation which cannot be performed using either our
controller or planner alone. These experiments suggest that our planner can
generate paths efficiently, taking under a second on average to find a feasible
path in three out of four scenarios. We also show that our framework is
effective on a 16 DoF physical robot, where reachability and dual-arm
constraints make the planning more difficult.

clear synchronization largely consistent with a semiclassical model of
electron-hole recollisions in bulk solids. On the other hand, the bichromatic
spectrogram of harmonics originating from the exit surface of the 200

for the recovery of gradient-sparse signals from undersampled Gaussian
measurements. Recently established bounds for the required sampling rate state
that uniform recovery of all $s$-gradient-sparse signals in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is
only possible with $m \gtrsim \sqrt{s n} \cdot \text{PolyLog}(n)$ measurements.
Such a condition is especially prohibitive for high-dimensional problems, where
$s$ is much smaller than $n$. However, previous empirical findings seem to
indicate that this sampling rate does not reflect the typical behavior of total
variation minimization. The present work provides a rigorous analysis that
breaks the $\sqrt{s n}$-bottleneck for a large class of ""natural"" signals. The
main result shows that non-uniform recovery succeeds with high probability for
$m \gtrsim s \cdot \text{PolyLog}(n)$ measurements if the jump discontinuities
of the signal vector are sufficiently well separated. In particular, this
guarantee allows for signals arising from a discretization of piecewise
constant functions defined on an interval. The key ingredient of the proof is a
novel upper bound for the associated conic Gaussian mean width, which is based
on a signal-dependent, non-dyadic Haar wavelet transform. Furthermore, a
natural extension to stable and robust recovery is addressed.

formulas, an exhaustive search even for a myopic solution takes exponential
time (with respect to the time span of the task). We propose an efficient
approach for teaching parametric linear temporal logic formulas. Concretely, we
derive a necessary condition for the minimal time length of a demonstration to
eliminate a set of hypotheses. Utilizing this condition, we propose a myopic
teaching algorithm by solving a sequence of integer programming problems. We
further show that, under two notions of teaching complexity, the proposed
algorithm has near-optimal performance. The results strictly generalize the
previous results on teaching preference-based version space learners. We
evaluate our algorithm extensively under a variety of learner types (i.e.,
learners with different preference models) and interactive protocols (e.g.,
batched and adaptive). The results show that the proposed algorithms can
efficiently teach a given target temporal logic formula under various settings,
and that there are significant gains of teaching efficacy when the teacher
adapts to the learner's current hypotheses or uses oracles.

automatically solving decision-making problems in complex uncertain

actions to maximize some cumulative short-term and long-term rewards. Some of
the most impressive results have been shown in Game Theory where agents
exhibited superhuman performance in games like Go or Starcraft 2, which led to
its gradual adoption in many other domains, including Cloud Computing.
Therefore, RL appears as a promising approach for Autoscaling in Cloud since it
is possible to learn transparent (with no human intervention), dynamic (no
static plans), and adaptable (constantly updated) resource management policies
to execute applications. These are three important distinctive aspects to
consider in comparison with other widely used autoscaling policies that are
defined in an ad-hoc way or statically computed as in solutions based on
meta-heuristics. Autoscaling exploits the Cloud elasticity to optimize the
execution of applications according to given optimization criteria, which
demands to decide when and how to scale-up/down computational resources, and
how to assign them to the upcoming processing workload. Such actions have to be
taken considering that the Cloud is a dynamic and uncertain environment.
Motivated by this, many works apply RL to the autoscaling problem in the Cloud.
In this work, we survey exhaustively those proposals from major venues, and
uniformly compare them based on a set of proposed taxonomies. We also discuss
open problems and prospective research in the area.

polaritons can be confined in wires, 3D traps, and arrays of traps, providing
an additional tuning degree of freedom for the polariton energies. Upon
increasing the non-resonant laser excitation power, a Bose-Einstein

Environmental Rebound Effects of City Size",,,,,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Global sustainability relies on our capacity of understanding and guiding
urban systems, and their metabolism, in an adequate way. It has been proposed
that bigger and denser cities are more resource-efficient than smaller ones
because they tend to demand less infrastructure, consume less fuel for
transportation and less energy for cooling or heating in per capita terms. This
hypothesis is also called Brand's Law. But as cities get bigger, denser and
more resource-efficient they also get richer. And richer inhabitants buy more,
increasing its resource demand and associated environmental impacts. To fully
understand the nexus between population size or density and the environmental
impacts generated by a city, one needs to take into account both direct and
indirect impacts. Facing the lack of empirical evidence on consumption-based
emissions for cities, in this paper we propose a mean-field model to derive
emissions estimations out of well-established urban metrics (city size,
density, infrastructure, wealth). We aim at understanding if Brand's law holds
true after adopting a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. The
proposed model shows that when considering consumption-based emissions, in most
cases Brand's law falls apart - bigger cities have greater purchase power,
resulting in greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG emissions.
The model also shows that decoupling between population and emissions is
possible and dependent on the decoupling level between income and impacts. In
order to achieve it, a shift in consumption patterns of most cities is of
utmost importance, so that each new monetary unit added to the GDP, or any
other income variable for that effect does not result in a proportional
increase in GHG emissions.

relaxation and the maximum product matching in undirected weighted graphs. The
results are based on a general convergence analysis theory applied to the class
of AMG methods employing unsmoothed aggregation and identifying a quality
measure for the coarsening; similar quality measures were originally introduced
and applied to other methods as tools to obtain good quality aggregates leading
to optimal convergence for M-matrices. The analysis, as well as the coarsening
procedure, is purely algebraic and, in our case, allows an \emph{a posteriori}
evaluation of the quality of the aggregation procedure which we apply to
analyze the impact of approximate algorithms for matching computation and the
definition of graph edge weights. We also explore the connection between the
choice of the aggregates and the compatible relaxation convergence, confirming
the consistency between theories for designing coarsening procedures in purely
algebraic multigrid methods and the effectiveness of the coarsening based on
compatible weighted matching. We discuss various completely automatic
algorithmic approaches to obtain aggregates for which good convergence
properties are achieved on various test cases.

of the quality factor of the two-dimensional (2D) cross-section resonance mode.
This axial variation is determined analytically based on the numerical solution
to the eigenvalue problem in the 2D cross section. The analysis is developed in
two steps: First, we generalize a recently published expression for the 2D
standing-wave resonance modes in a rectangular cross section to arbitrary
shapes, including the viscous boundary layer. Second, based on these 2D modes,
we derive analytical expressions in three dimensions for the acoustic pressure,
the acoustic radiation and trapping force, as well as the acoustic energy flux

we revisit this fundamental issue presenting general hard X-ray ($K_{X}$) and
optical ($K_{O}$) bolometric corrections, computed combining several AGN
samples spanning the widest (about 7 dex) luminosity range ever used for this
kind of studies. We analysed a total of $\sim 1000$ type 1 and type 2 AGN for
which a dedicated SED-fitting has been carried out. We provide a bolometric
correction separately for type 1 and type 2 AGN; the two bolometric corrections
results to be in agreement in the overlapping luminosity range and therefore,
for the first time, a universal bolometric correction for the whole AGN sample
(both type 1 and type 2) has been computed. We found that $K_{X}$ is fairly
constant at $log(L_{BOL}/L_{\odot}) < 11$, while it increases up to about one
order of magnitude at $log(L_{BOL}/L_{\odot}) \sim 14.5$. A similar increasing
trend has been observed when its dependence on either the Eddington ratio or
the BH mass is considered, while no dependence on redshift up to $z\sim3.5$ has
been found. On the contrary, the optical bolometric correction appears to be
fairly constant (i.e. $K_{O} \sim 5$) whatever is the independent variable. We
also verified that our bolometric corrections correctly predict the AGN
bolometric luminosity functions. According to this analysis, our bolometric

their PWNe, and inverse Compton scattering low-energy photons of the

consider pulsars from the ATNF catalog and build up simulations of the PWN

uncertainty band is determined, which is of at least one order of magnitude

is found, even if it is strongly connected to the chosen value of the radius of

gas-phase turbulence affects planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse
in protoplanetary disks. Turbulence impedes the formation of particle clumps by
acting as an effective turbulent diffusivity, but it can also promote
planetesimal formation by concentrating solids, for example in zonal flows. We
quantify the effect of turbulent diffusivity using numerical simulations of the
streaming instability in small local domains, forced with velocity
perturbations that establish approximately Kolmogorov-like turbulence. We find
that planetesimal formation is suppressed by turbulence once velocity
fluctuations exceed $\langle \delta v^2 \rangle \simeq 10^{-3.5} - 10^{-3}
c_s^2$. Turbulence whose strength is just below the threshold reduces the rate
at which solids are bound into clumps. Our results suggest that the
well-established turbulent thickening of the mid-plane solid layer is the
primary mechanism by which turbulence influences planetesimal formation and
that planetesimal formation requires a mid-plane solid-to-gas ratio $\epsilon
\gtrsim 0.5$. We also quantify the initial planetesimal mass function using a
new clump-tracking method to determine each planetesimal mass shortly after
collapse. For models in which planetesimals form, we show that the mass
function is well-described by a broken power law, whose parameters are robust
to the inclusion and strength of imposed turbulence. Turbulence in
protoplanetary disks is likely to substantially exceed the threshold for
planetesimal formation at radii where temperatures $T \gtrsim 10^3 \ {\rm K}$
lead to thermal ionization. Planetesimal formation may therefore be unviable in
the inner disk out to 2-3 times the dust sublimation radius.

the fractality of our star clusters, showing that they are all extremely
substructured (fractal dimension $D=1.0-1.8$). We also found that fractality is
slowly reduced, with time, on small scales, while it persists on large scales
on longer timescales. Signatures of rotation are found in different simulations

initial angular momentum inherited from prestellar cores before reaching the
stellar embryo is a key question. Disk formation has been naturally considered
as a possible solution to this ""angular momentum problem"". However, how the
initial angular momentum of protostellar cores is distributed and evolves
during the main accretion phase and the beginning of disk formation has largely
remained unconstrained up to now. In the framework of the IRAM CALYPSO survey,
we used high dynamic range C$^{18}$O (2-1) and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations to
quantify the distribution of specific angular momentum along the equatorial
axis in a sample of 12 Class 0 protostellar envelopes from scales ~50 to 10000
au. The radial distributions of specific angular momentum in the CALYPSO sample
suggest two distinct regimes within protostellar envelopes: the specific
angular momentum decreases as $j \propto r^{1.6 \pm 0.2}$ down to ~1600 au and
then tends to become relatively constant around 6 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ km
s$^{-1}$ pc down to ~50 au. The values of specific angular momentum measured in
the inner Class 0 envelopes, namely that of the material directly involved in
the star formation process ($<$1600 au), is on the same order of magnitude as
what is inferred in small T-Tauri disks. Thus, disk formation appears to be a
direct consequence of angular momentum conservation during the collapse. Our
analysis reveals a dispersion of the directions of velocity gradients at
envelope scales $>$1600 au, suggesting that they may not be related to
rotational motions of the envelopes. We conclude that the specific angular
momentum observed at these scales could find its origin in core-forming motions
(infall, turbulence) or trace an imprint of the initial conditions for the
formation of protostellar cores.

obtained when the ejecta density drops below the value for which $\tau_{\rm

describe this ""delayed deposition"" effect, which is straightforward to use for
analysis of observed light curves. We find that the ejecta heating is dominated
by delayed deposition typically from 600 to 1200~day, and only later by longer
lived isotopes $^{57}$Co and $^{55}$Fe decay (assuming solar abundance). For
the relatively narrow $^{56}$Ni velocity distributions of commonly studied
explosion models, the modification of the light curve depends mainly on the
$^{56}$Ni mass-weighted average density, $\langle \rho \rangle t^{3}$. Accurate
late-time bolometric light curves, which may be obtained with JWST far-infrared
(far-IR) measurements, will thus enable to discriminate between explosion
models by determining $\langle \rho \rangle t^3$ (and the $^{57}$Co and
$^{55}$Fe abundances). The flattening of light curves inferred from recent
observations, which is uncertain due to the lack of far-IR data, is readily
explained by delayed deposition in models with $\langle \rho\rangle t^{3}

look-ahead rules that take into account of two effects: nonlocal slow-down
effect and right-skewed non-concave asymmetry in the fundamental diagram. The
proposed 1D cellular automata (CA) models with the Arrhenius type look-ahead
interactions implement stochastic rules for cars' movement following the
configuration of the traffic ahead of each car. In particular, we take two
different look-ahead rules: one is based on the distance from the car under
consideration to the car in front of it; the other one depends on the car
density ahead. Both rules feature a novel idea of multiple moves, which plays a
key role in recovering the non-concave flux in the macroscopic dynamics.
Through a semi-discrete mesoscopic stochastic process, we derive the
coarse-grained macroscopic dynamics of the CA model. We also design a numerical
scheme to simulate the proposed CA models with an efficient list-based kinetic
Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithm. Our results show that the fluxes of the KMC
simulations agree with the coarse-grained macroscopic averaged fluxes for the
different look-ahead rules under various parameter settings.

fitting procedure for the inverted transmitted flux, $1-F$, similar to the
widely used Voigt profile fitting of the transmitted flux $F$ at lower
redshifts, to characterise the transmission spikes that probe predominately
underdense regions of the IGM. We are able to reproduce the width and height
distributions of the transmission spikes, both with optically thin simulations
of the post-reionization Universe using a homogeneous UV background and full
radiative transfer simulations of a late reionization model. We find that the
width of the fitted components of the simulated transmission spikes is very
sensitive to the instantaneous temperature of the reionized IGM. The internal
structures of the spikes are more prominant in low temeperature models of the
IGM. The width distribution of the observed transmission spikes, which require
high spectral resolution ($\leq $ 8 km/s) to be resolved, is reproduced for
optically thin simulations with a temperature at mean density of $T_0= (11000
\pm 1600,10500\pm 2100,12000 \pm 2200)$ K at $z= (5.4,5.6,5.8)$. This is weakly
dependent on the slope of the temperature-density relation, which is favoured
to be moderately steeper than isothermal. In the inhomogeneous, late
reionization, full radiative transfer simulations where islands of neutral
hydrogen persist to $z\sim5.3$, the width distribution of the observed

Coma cluster, using new deep ground-based imaging of the known UDGs and
existing imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope of their GC systems. We find
that the richness of GC systems in UDGs generally exceeds that found in normal
dwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass. These GC-rich UDGs imply halos more
massive than expected from the standard stellar mass-halo mass relation. The
presence of such overly massive halos presents a significant challenge to the
latest simulations of UDGs in cluster environments. In some exceptional cases,
the mass in the GC system is a significant fraction of the stellar content of
the host galaxy. We find that rich GC systems tend to be hosted in UDGs of
lower luminosity, smaller size and fainter surface brightness. Similar trends
are seen for normal dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster. A toy model is
presented in which the GC-rich UDGs are assumed to be `failed' galaxies within
massive halos that have largely old, metal-poor, alpha-element enhanced stellar
populations. On the other hand, GC-poor UDGs are more akin to normal, low
surface brightness dwarfs that occupy less massive dark matter halos.
Additional data on the stellar populations of UDGs with GC systems will help to
further refine and test this simplistic model.

this problem we have a collection $J$ of $n$ jobs, each having a release time
$r_j$, deadline $d_j$, and processing time $p_j$. They have to be scheduled
non-preemptively on $m$ identical parallel machines. The goal is to find a
schedule which maximizes the number of jobs scheduled entirely in their
$[r_j,d_j]$ window. This problem has been studied extensively (even for the
case of $m=1$). Several special cases of the problem remain open. Bar-Noy et
al. [STOC1999] presented an algorithm with ratio $1-1/(1+1/m)^m$ for $m$
machines, which approaches $1-1/e$ as $m$ increases. For $m=1$,
Chuzhoy-Ostrovsky-Rabani [FOCS2001] presented an algorithm with approximation
with ratio $1-\frac{1}{e}-\varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon>0$). Recently
Im-Li-Moseley [IPCO2017] presented an algorithm with ratio
$1-1/e-\varepsilon_0$ for some absolute constant $\varepsilon_0>0$ for any
fixed $m$. They also presented an algorithm with ratio $1-O(\sqrt{\log
m/m})-\varepsilon$ for general $m$ which approaches 1 as $m$ grows. The
approximability of the problem for $m=O(1)$ remains a major open question. Even
for the case of $m=1$ and $c=O(1)$ distinct processing times the problem is
open (Sgall [ESA2012]). In this paper we study the case of $m=O(1)$ and show
that if there are $c$ distinct processing times, i.e. $p_j$'s come from a set
of size $c$, then there is a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation that runs in time
$O(n^{mc^7\varepsilon^{-6}}\log T)$, where $T$ is the largest deadline.
Therefore, for constant $m$ and constant $c$ this yields a PTAS. Our algorithm
is based on proving structural properties for a near optimum solution that
allows one to use a dynamic programming with pruning.

term contains a dissipation coefficient, and the study is modeled based on two
different and familiar choices of the coefficient that have been {studied} in
the literature. By applying the latest observational data, the acceptable
ranges for the free parameters of the model are obtained. For any choice inside

theoretical predictions and observations. Whereas the model is established
based on some assumptions, it is vital to check their validity for the obtained
values of the free parameters of the model. It is realized that the model is
not self-consistent for all values of the ranges and sometimes the assumptions
are violated. Therefore, {to have both self-consistency and agreement with
data} the parameters of the model need to be {constrained} again. After that,
we are going to consider the recently proposed swampland conjecture, which
imposes two conditions on the inflationary models. These criteria could rule
out some of the inflationary models, however, warm inflation is known as one of
those models that could successfully satisfy the swampland criteria. A precise
investigation determines that the proposed warm tachyon inflation could not

  Recent research efforts have focused on developing solutions to secure mobile

context of detecting vulnerabilities in Android apps. Despite this attention,
known vulnerabilities are often found in mobile apps, which can be exploited by

design -- app designers and developers can collaborate to specify and reason

Android Studio tooling demonstrates the methodology is complementary to
existing design and development practices. An evaluation of the effectiveness
of SeMA shows the methodology can detect and help prevent 49 vulnerabilities

stars are gas giants that are more massive than Jupiter. These planets are
prime candidates for formation by disc instability. Aims: We want to determine
the conditions for disc fragmentation around M dwarfs and the properties of the
planets that are formed by disc instability. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic
simulations of M dwarf protostellar discs in order to determine the minimum
disc mass required for gravitational fragmentation to occur. Different stellar
masses, disc radii, and metallicities were considered. The mass of each
protostellar disc was steadily increased until the disc fragmented and a
protoplanet was formed. Results: We find that a disc-to-star mass ratio between
$\sim 0.3$ and $\sim 0.6$ is required for fragmentation to happen. The minimum
mass at which a disc fragments increases with the stellar mass and the disc
size. Metallicity does not significantly affect the minimum disc fragmentation
mass but high metallicity may suppress fragmentation. Protoplanets form quickly
(within a few thousand years) at distances around $\sim50$ AU from the host
star, and they are initially very hot; their centres have temperatures similar
to the ones expected at the accretion shocks around planets formed by core
accretion (up to 12,000K). The final properties of these planets (e.g. mass and
orbital radius) are determined through long-term disc-planet or planet-planet
interactions. Conclusions: Disc instability is a plausible way to form gas
giant planets around M dwarfs provided that discs have at least 30% the mass of
their host stars during the initial stages of their formation. Future
observations of massive M dwarf discs or planets around very young M dwarfs are
required to establish the importance of disc instability for planet formation
around low-mass stars.

the development of pattern recognition approaches for these data is relatively
recent, mainly due to the limited availability of this type of images, as until
recently they were used exclusively for military purposes. Access to aerial
imagery, including spectral information, has been increasing mainly due to the
low cost of drones, cheapening of imaging satellite launch costs, and novel
public datasets. Usually remote sensing applications employ computer vision
techniques strictly modeled for classification tasks in closed set scenarios.
However, real-world tasks rarely fit into closed set contexts, frequently
presenting previously unknown classes, characterizing them as open set
scenarios. Focusing on this problem, this is the first paper to study and
develop semantic segmentation techniques for open set scenarios applied to
remote sensing images. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a
discussion of related works in open set semantic segmentation, showing evidence
that these techniques can be adapted for open set remote sensing tasks; 2) the
development and evaluation of a novel approach for open set semantic

electron-neutrino flux from the $^{37}$Ar and $^{51}$Cr calibration sources. A
deficit in the measured neutrino flux was recorded by counting the number of
neutrino-induced conversions of the $^{71}$Ga nuclei to $^{71}$Ge nuclei. This
deficit was coined ``gallium anomaly'' and it has lead to speculations about
beyond-the-standard-model physics in the form of eV-mass sterile neutrinos.
Notably, this anomaly has already defied final solution for more than 20 years.
Here we reassess the statistical significance of this anomaly and improve the
related statistical approaches by treating the neutrino experiments as repeated
Bernoulli trials taking into account the fact that the number of the detected
$^{71}$Ge nuclei is quite small, thus calling for a Bayesian statistical
approach. In addition, we take into account the systematic errors of the
experiments, their correlations, theoretical uncertainties and the number of
background solar-neutrino events as a Poisson-distributed random variable. To
compare with the previously reported statistical significances of the anomaly
we convert the posterior intervals of our Bayesian approach to standard
deviations $\sigma$ of the frequentist approach. We find that our approach
reduces the statistical significance of the anomaly by $0.8\,\sigma$ for all
the adopted theoretical approaches. This renders the gallium anomaly a
statistically weakly supported concept. Furthermore, the implications of our
approach go far beyond the gallium anomaly since the results of many
rare-events experiments should be reassessed for their limited number of

specialties, document types, and institutions. We present the following: (1) a
survey listing common aspects and lessons learned from previous research, (2) a
fine-grained annotation schema which could be replicated and guide other
annotation initiatives, (3) a web-based annotation tool focusing on an
annotation suggestion feature, and (4) both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation
of the annotations. The result of this work is the SemClinBr, a corpus that has
1,000 clinical notes, labeled with 65,117 entities and 11,263 relations, and
can support a variety of clinical NLP tasks and boost the EHR's secondary use
for the Portuguese language.

composed of flexible, Gaussian phantom polymers, which interact by local
momentum-conserving stochastic MPC collisions. For comparison, the analytical
solution of the linearized Navier-Stokes equation is calculated, where
viscoelasticity is taken into account by a time-dependent shear relaxation
modulus. The fluid properties are characterized by the transverse velocity
autocorrelation function in Fourier space as well as in real space. Various
polymer lengths are considered---from dumbbells to (near-)continuous polymers.
Viscoelasticity affects the fluid properties and leads to strong correlations,
which overall decay exponentially in Fourier space. In real space, the
center-of-mass velocity autocorrelation function of individual polymers
exhibits a long-time tail independent of polymer length, which decays as
$t^{-3/2}$, similar to a Newtonian fluid, in the asymptotic limit $t \to
\infty$. Moreover, for long polymers an additional power-law decay appears at
time scales shorter than the longest polymer relaxation time with the same time
dependence, but negative correlations, and the polymer length dependence
$L^{-1/2}$. Good agreement is found between the analytical and simulation
results.

discrete and faithful characters of $F_2$. The complement of the Riley slice is
a bounded Jordan domain within which there are isolated points, accumulating
only at the boundary, corresponding to parabolic discrete and faithful
representations of rigid subgroups of $PSL(2,\IC)$. Recent work of Aimi,
Akiyoshi, Lee, Oshika, Parker, Lee, Sakai, Sakuma \& Yoshida, have
topologically identified all these groups. Here we give the first identified
substantive properties of the nondiscrete representations and prove a
supergroup density theorem: given any irreducible parabolic representation
$\rho_*:F_2\to PSL(2,\IC)$ whatsoever, any non-discrete parabolic
representation $\rho_0$ has an arbitrarily small perturbation $\rho_\epsilon$
so that $\rho_\epsilon(F_2)$ contains a conjugate of $\rho_*(F_2)$ as a proper
subgroup. This implies that if $\Gamma_*$ is any nonelementary group generated
by two parabolic elements (discrete or otherwise) and $\gamma_0$ is any point
in the complement of the Riley slice, then in any neighbourhood of $\gamma$
there is a point corresponding to a nonelementary group generated by two
parabolics with a conjugate of $\Gamma_*$ as a proper subgroup. Using these
ideas we then show that there are nondiscrete parabolic representations with an
arbitrarily large number of distinct Nielsen classes of parabolic generators.

auspicious approach to understanding how magnetic fields are structured within
CMEs. Although earlier studies have suggested an asymmetry in the width of CMEs
in orthogonal directions, this has not been inspected using multi-viewpoint
observations. Methods. We inspect the early evolution (below ten solar radii)
of the morphology of a dozen CMEs occurring under specific conditions of
observing spacecraft location and CME trajectory, favorable to reduce
uncertainties typically involved in the 3D reconstruction used here. These
events are carefully reconstructed by means of a forward modeling tool using
simultaneous observations of STEREO EUVI and SDO/AIA as input when originating
low in the corona, and followed up in the outer fields of view of the STEREO
and the SOHO coronagraphs. We then examine the height evolution of the
morphological parameters arising from the reconstructions. Results. The
multi-viewpoint analysis of this set of CMEs revealed that their initial
expansion --below three solar radii-- is considerably asymmetric and
non-self-similar. Both angular widths, namely along the main axes of CMEs
($AW_L$) and in the orthogonal direction ($AW_D$, representative of the flux
rope diameter), exhibit much steeper change rates below this height, with the
growth rate of $AW_L$ found to be larger than that of $AW_D$, also below that
height. Angular widths along the main axes of CMEs are on average $\approx$1.8
times larger than widths in the orthogonal direction $AW_D$. The ratios of the
two expansion speeds, namely in the directions of CMEs main axes and in their
orthogonal, are nearly constant in time after $\sim$4 solar radii, with an
average ratio $\approx$1.6. Heights at which the width change rate is defined
to stabilize are greater for $AW_L$ than for $AW_D$.

switch the cryptographic task without requiring any knowledge of its inner
workings. In this paper, we suggest how these related principles can be applied
to the field of quantum cryptography by explicitly demonstrating two quantum
cryptographic protocols, quantum digital signatures (QDS) and quantum secret
sharing (QSS), on the same hardware sender and receiver platform. Crucially,
the protocols differ only in their classical post-processing. The system is
also suitable for quantum key distribution (QKD) and is highly compatible with
deployed telecommunication infrastructures, since it uses standard quadrature
phase shift keying (QPSK) encoding and heterodyne detection. For the first
time, QDS protocols are modified to allow for postselection at the receiver,
enhancing protocol performance. The cryptographic primitives QDS and QSS are
inherently multipartite and we prove that they are secure not only when a
player internal to the task is dishonest, but also when (external)
eavesdropping on the quantum channel is allowed. In our first
proof-of-principle demonstration of an agile and versatile quantum
communication system, the quantum states were distributed at GHz rates. This
allows for a one-bit message to be securely signed using our QDS protocols in

$\varepsilon$. Assuming that the system and reservoir are initially decoupled,

Presented at PHM19",,,,"cs.LG eess.SP stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper addresses a multi-label predictive fault classification problem
for multidimensional time-series data. While fault (event) detection problems
have been thoroughly studied in literature, most of the state-of-the-art
techniques can't reliably predict faults (events) over a desired future
horizon. In the most general setting of these types of problems, one or more
samples of data across multiple time series can be assigned several concurrent
fault labels from a finite, known set and the task is to predict the
possibility of fault occurrence over a desired time horizon. This type of
problem is usually accompanied by strong class imbalances where some classes
are represented by only a few samples. Importantly, in many applications of the
problem such as fault prediction and predictive maintenance, it is exactly
these rare classes that are of most interest. To address the problem, this
paper proposes a general approach that utilizes a multi-label recurrent neural
network with a new cost function that accentuates learning in the imbalanced
classes. The proposed algorithm is tested on two public benchmark datasets: an
industrial plant dataset from the PHM Society Data Challenge, and a human
activity recognition dataset. The results are compared with state-of-the-art
techniques for time-series classification and evaluation is performed using the
F1-score, precision and recall.

non-sequential tasks, characterized by a lack of inherent ordering of features
(variables). The brute force approach of learning a parameter for each
interaction of every order comes at an exponential computational and memory
cost (Curse of Dimensionality). To alleviate this issue, it has been proposed
to implicitly represent the model parameters as a tensor, the order of which is
equal to the number of features; for efficiency, it can be further factorized
into a compact Tensor Train (TT) format. However, both TT and other Tensor
Networks (TNs), such as Tensor Ring and Hierarchical Tucker, are sensitive to
the ordering of their indices (and hence to the features). To establish the
desired invariance to feature ordering, we propose to represent the weight
tensor through the Canonical Polyadic (CP) Decomposition (CPD), and introduce
the associated inference and learning algorithms, including suitable
regularization and initialization schemes. It is demonstrated that the proposed
CP-based predictor significantly outperforms other TN-based predictors on
sparse data while exhibiting comparable performance on dense non-sequential
tasks. Furthermore, for enhanced expressiveness, we generalize the framework to
allow feature mapping to arbitrarily high-dimensional feature vectors. In
conjunction with feature vector normalization, this is shown to yield dramatic
improvements in performance for dense non-sequential tasks, matching models

fluid dynamics problems, it is often claimed that due to modal truncation, a
projection-based reduced-order model (PROM) does not resolve the dissipative
regime of the turbulent energy cascade and therefore is numerically unstable.
Efforts at addressing this claim have ranged from attempting to model the
effects of the truncated modes to enriching the classical subspace of
approximation in order to account for the truncated phenomena. This paper
challenges this claim. Exploring the relationship between projection-based
model order reduction and semi-discretization and using numerical evidence from
three relevant flow problems, it argues in an orderly manner that the real
culprit behind most if not all reported numerical instabilities of PROMs for
turbulence and convection-dominated turbulent flow problems is the Galerkin
framework that has been used for constructing the PROMs. The paper also shows
that alternatively, a Petrov-Galerkin framework can be used to construct
numerically stable PROMs for convection-dominated laminar as well as turbulent
flow problems that are numerically stable and accurate, without resorting to
additional closure models or tailoring of the subspace of approximation. It
also shows that such alternative PROMs deliver significant speedup factors.

have been utilized as a platform to study fundamental liquid-vapor phase change
heat transfer (PCHT) processes as well as a promising candidate for high flux
heat dissipation. Both thin film boiling and evaporation through nanoporous
structures have been demonstrated to achieve high heat flux, but they are
usually considered two mutually exclusive regimes operated under vastly
different conditions, and the factors dictating how close the PCHT process is
to the kinetic limit are elusive. In this work, we utilized a unique transition
between thin film boiling and evaporation through nanoporous membranes to
clarify the factors determining the heat flux and heat transfer coefficient
(HTC) with respect to the kinetic limit conditions. We unambiguously showed the
controllable transition from boiling to evaporation, when the liquid receded
into the nanopores and provided additional driving force from capillary pumping
sustained in the nanoscale pores. We showed that this transition is universal
and can be understood from a simple fluid transport model for all the four
types of fluids we studied, which cover a wide span of surface tension (water,
ethanol, isopropanol (IPA), FC-72). More importantly, PCHT conditions at the
transition points between boiling and evaporation were close to those of the
kinetic limit of all these fluids. However, further increase of the heat flux
beyond the transition points led to decreasing HTC and deviation from the
kinetic limit, which can be attributed to the increasing vapor resistance in
the vapor space and inside the nanopores. This increasing vapor resistance was
also confirmed by experiments on IPA with different vapor pressures.

charge movements of prestin (SLC26a5), the protein responsible for OHC
electromotility. Previous measures of NLC frequency response have employed
methods which did not assess the influence of dielectric loss (sensor charge
movements out of phase with voltage) that may occur, and such loss conceivably
may influence the frequency dependent activity of prestin. Here we evaluate
complex capacitance of prestin out to 30 kHz and find that its frequency
response determined using this approach coincides with all previous estimates.
We also show that membrane tension has no effect on the frequency response of
prestin, despite substantial shifts in its voltage operating range, indicating
that prestin transition rate alterations do not account for the shifts. The
magnitude roll-off of prestin activity across frequency surpasses the
reductions of NLC caused by salicylate treatments that are known to abolish
cochlear amplification. Such roll-off must therefore limit the effectiveness if
prestin in contributing to cochlear amplification at the very high acoustic
frequencies processed by some mammals.

task. Most prior works rely on a two-step scheme involving supervised
pretraining of a Seq2Seq model with synthetic programs followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning with real reference images. Fully
unsupervised approaches promise to train the model directly on the target
images without requiring curated pretraining datasets. However, they struggle
with the inherent sparsity of meaningful programs in the search space. In this
paper, we present the first unsupervised algorithm capable of parsing
constructive solid geometry (CSG) images into context-free grammar (CFG)
without pretraining via non-differentiable renderer. To tackle the
\emph{non-Markovian} sparse reward problem, we combine three key ingredients --
(i) a grammar-encoded tree LSTM ensuring program validity (ii) entropy
regularization and (iii) sampling without replacement from the CFG syntax tree.
Empirically, our algorithm recovers meaningful programs in large search spaces
(up to $3.8 \times 10^{28}$). Further, even though our approach is fully
unsupervised, it generalizes better than supervised methods on the synthetic 2D
CSG dataset. On the 2D computer aided design (CAD) dataset, our approach
significantly outperforms the supervised pretrained model and is competitive to
the refined model.

Wavelength selection for pulsed Ti:Sa lasers used in hot cavity laser resonance
ionization spectroscopy is usually done with birefringent filters (BRFs) and
etalons or diffraction gratings. For resonance ionization spectroscopy a laser
system allowing a continuous wavelength scan is necessary. Tunable lasers based
on BRFs and etalons have high output powers however require synchronized
optimization for continuous laser wavelength scans and are therefore laborious
to use in scanning applications. Diffraction grating tuned lasers can provide
continuous wavelength scan over 200 nm range but typically have lower output
laser power due to the grating deformation under high pumping power. Aiming to
overcome both shortcomings a laser design based on prisms as dispersing element
has been revisited. Simulations on the beam path and optical reflectivity are
done which show that these losses can be minimized to around 0.04 % for a
tuning range from 700 nm up to 920 nm. Further improvement on the tuning range

  Dynamical Systems",,,,,"cs.LG cs.MA math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Regret analysis is challenging in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)
primarily due to the dynamical environments and the decentralized information
among agents. We attempt to solve this challenge in the context of
decentralized learning in multi-agent linear-quadratic (LQ) dynamical systems.
We begin with a simple setup consisting of two agents and two dynamically
decoupled stochastic linear systems, each system controlled by an agent. The
systems are coupled through a quadratic cost function. When both systems'
dynamics are unknown and there is no communication among the agents, we show
that no learning policy can generate sub-linear in $T$ regret, where $T$ is the
time horizon. When only one system's dynamics are unknown and there is
one-directional communication from the agent controlling the unknown system to
the other agent, we propose a MARL algorithm based on the construction of an
auxiliary single-agent LQ problem. The auxiliary single-agent problem in the
proposed MARL algorithm serves as an implicit coordination mechanism among the
two learning agents. This allows the agents to achieve a regret within
$O(\sqrt{T})$ of the regret of the auxiliary single-agent problem.
Consequently, using existing results for single-agent LQ regret, our algorithm
provides a $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound. (Here $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides
constants and logarithmic factors). Our numerical experiments indicate that
this bound is matched in practice. From the two-agent problem, we extend our
results to multi-agent LQ systems with certain communication patterns.

science and quantum thermodynamics since it allows for preparing and/or
protecting special quantum states of single or multipartite systems or to
investigate fundamental questions of the thermodynamics as quantum thermal
machines and their efficiencies. Here we employ this technique to engineer
reservoirs with arbitrary (effective) negative and positive temperatures for a
single spin system. To this end, we firstly engineer an appropriate interaction
between a qubit system, a carbon nuclear spin, to a fermionic reservoir, in our
case a large number of hydrogen nuclear spins that acts as the spins bath. This
carbon-hydrogen structure is present in a polycrystalline adamantane, which was
used in our experimental setup. The required interaction engineering is
achieved by applying a specific sequence of radio-frequency pulses using
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), while the temperature of the bath can be
controlled by appropriate preparation of the initial hydrogen nuclear spin
state, being the predicted results in very good agreement with the experimental
data. As an application we implemented a single qubit quantum thermal machine
which operates at a single reservoir at effective negative temperature whose
efficiency is always 100%, independent of the unitary transformation performed
on the qubit system, as long as it changes the qubit state.

solutions with finite and minimal action, they do not contribute to the energy
spectrum at leading order in the semiclassical analysis. This is because the
instanton fluctuation prefactor vanishes, which can be interpreted as the
action becoming infinite quantum mechanically. Instead, the non-perturbative
physics is governed by different types of {\it bion} configurations. A
generalization to supersymmetric and quasi-exactly soluble models is also
discussed. An interesting pattern of interference between topological and
neutral bions, depending on the hidden topological angle, the discrete theta
angle and the perturbative level number, leads to an intricate pattern of
divergent/convergent expansions for low lying states, and provides criteria for
the exact solvability of some of the states. We confirm these semiclassical
bion predictions using the Bender-Wu Mathematica package to study the structure
of the associated perturbative expansions. It also turns out that all the

strategy for reducing output-side losses due to spatial mode mismatch between

loss reduction that provides less than 2% mean output mode-matching loss. The

one seeks to identify which items are defective given a set of
suitably-designed tests whose outcomes indicate whether or not at least one
defective item was included in the test. The most widespread recovery criterion
seeks to exactly recover the entire defective set, and relaxed criteria such as
approximate recovery and list decoding have also been considered. In this
paper, we study the fundamental limits of group testing under the significantly
relaxed {\em weak recovery} criterion, which only seeks to identify a small
fraction (e.g., $0.01$) of the defective items. Given the near-optimality of
i.i.d.~Bernoulli testing for exact recovery in sufficiently sparse scaling
regimes, it is natural to ask whether this design additionally succeeds with
much fewer tests under weak recovery. Our main negative result shows that this
is not the case, and in fact, under i.i.d.~Bernoulli random testing in the
sufficiently sparse regime, an {\em all-or-nothing} phenomenon occurs: When the
number of tests is slightly below a threshold, weak recovery is impossible,
whereas when the number of tests is slightly above the same threshold,
high-probability exact recovery is possible. In establishing this result, we
additionally prove similar negative results under Bernoulli designs for the
weak detection problem (distinguishing between the group testing model
vs.~completely random outcomes) and the problem of identifying a single item
that is definitely defective. On the positive side, we show that all three
relaxed recovery criteria can be attained using considerably fewer tests under
suitably-chosen non-Bernoulli designs.

optical properties of the heterojunction have not been properly characterized
due to the limited spatial resolution, requiring nano-optical characterization
beyond the diffraction limit. Here, we investigate the lateral monolayer
MoS2-WS2 heterostructure using tip-enhanced photoluminescence (TEPL)
spectroscopy on a non-metallic substrate with picoscale tip-sample distance
control. By placing a plasmonic Au-coated Ag tip at the heterojunction, we
observed more than three orders of magnitude photoluminescence (PL) enhancement
due to the classical near-field mechanism and charge transfer across the
junction. The picoscale precision of the distance-dependent TEPL measurements
allowed for investigating the classical and quantum tunneling regimes above and
below the ~320 pm tip-sample distance, respectively. Quantum plasmonic effects
usually limit the maximum signal enhancement due to the near-field depletion at
the tip. We demonstrate a more complex behavior at the 2D lateral
heterojunction, where hot electron tunneling leads to the quenching of the PL
of MoS2, while simultaneously increasing the PL of WS2. Our simulations show
agreement with the experiments, revealing the range of parameters and
enhancement factors corresponding to various regimes. The controllable

several Myr ago, has likely produced cosmic rays. Its turbulent medium, still
energised by massive stars, can impact cosmic-ray transport locally. The gamma
rays produced in cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas were used to
compare the GeV to TeV cosmic-ray spectrum in the superbubble and in other
regions near the Sun. We used ten years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.25-63 GeV
energy range to study the closer (Eridanus) end of the superbubble. We modelled
the spatial and spectral distributions of the gamma rays produced in the
different gas phases of the clouds found in this direction. We found that the
gamma-ray emissivity spectrum of the gas along the outer rim and in a shell
inside the superbubble is consistent with the average spectrum measured in the
solar neighbourhood. This result calls for a detailed assessment of the recent
supernova rate and census of massive stellar winds in the superbubble in order
to estimate the epoch and rate of cosmic-ray production and to constrain the
transport conditions that can lead to such homogeneity and little
re-acceleration. We also found significant evidence that a diffuse cloud lying
outside the superbubble, at a height of 200-250 pc below the Galactic plane, is
pervaded by a 34\% lower cosmic-ray flux, but with the same particle energy
distribution as the local one. Super-GeV cosmic rays should freely cross such a
diffuse atomic cloud without significant loss or spectral distorsion. We
tentatively propose that the cosmic-ray loss relates to the orientation of the
magnetic field lines threading the cirrus, which point towards the halo
according to the dust polarisation data. We gathered past and present
emissivity measurements near the Sun to show how the local cosmic-ray flux
decreases with Galactic height and to compare this trend with model
predictions.

(TC-BGM), which has a proven track record of yielding accurate total cross
sections for electron capture and ionization. The atomic net ionization cross
sections are then used to assemble two models for ion-molecule collisions: an
independent atom model (IAM) that follows the Bragg additivity rule (labeled
IAM-AR), and also the so-called pixel-counting method (IAM-PCM). The latter
yields reduced cross sections relative to IAM-AR near the maximum, since it
takes into account the overlapping nature of effective cross sectional areas.
The IAM-PCM for higher-charge projectiles leads to strong reductions of net
ionization cross sections relative to the IAM-AR method, and is computed
directly for projectile charges $Q=1, 2, 3$. The scaling behavior of the
IAM-PCM is investigated over a wide range of energies $E$, and at high $E$ it
converges towards the IAM-AR. An empirical scaling rule is established which
allows to reproduce these results based on proton impact calculations. Detailed
comparisons are provided for the uracil target ($\rm C_4 H_4 N_2 O_2$), for

the scaling model derived from the IAM-PCM data it is shown how the

whose incidence is currently under investigation. The situation may be similar
in magnetic binaries because the bright accretion discs in low field systems
hide the photosphere of their WDs thus preventing the study of their magnetic
fields' strength and structure. Considerable research has been devoted to the
vexed question on the origin of magnetic fields. One hypothesis is that WD
magnetic fields are of fossil origin. The other is that magnetic fields arise
from binary interaction, through differential rotation, during common envelope
evolution. The recently discovered population of hot, carbon-rich WDs
exhibiting an incidence of magnetism of up to about 70% and a variability from
a few minutes to a couple of days may support the merging binary hypothesis.
Several studies have raised the possibility of the detection of planets around
MWDs. Rocky planets may be discovered by the detection of anomalous atmospheric
heating of the MWD. Planetary remains have recently revealed themselves in the
atmospheres of about 25% of WDs that are polluted by elements such as Ca, Si,

accretion of planetary debris. The study of isolated and accreting MWDs is
likely to continue to yield exciting discoveries for many years to come.

derive exact information about their properties, such as the distribution of
states at a given program point. Instead, one can attempt to derive
approximations, such as upper bounds on tail probabilities. Such bounds can be
obtained via concentration inequalities, which rely on the moments of a
distribution, such as the expectation (the first raw moment) or the variance
(the second central moment). Tail bounds obtained using central moments are
often tighter than the ones obtained using raw moments, but automatically
analyzing central moments is more challenging.
  This paper presents an analysis for probabilistic programs that automatically
derives symbolic upper and lower bounds on variances, as well as higher central
moments, of cost accumulators. To overcome the challenges of higher-moment
analysis, it generalizes analyses for expectations with an algebraic
abstraction that simultaneously analyzes different moments, utilizing relations
between them. A key innovation is the notion of moment-polymorphic recursion,
and a practical derivation system that handles recursive functions.
  The analysis has been implemented using a template-based technique that
reduces the inference of polynomial bounds to linear programming. Experiments
with our prototype central-moment analyzer show that, despite the analyzer's
upper/lower bounds on various quantities, it obtains tighter tail bounds than
an existing system that uses only raw moments, such as expectations.

functional theory based analysis, we show that the heterostructure composed of
SrRuO3 and SrTiO3 is endowed with all the key characteristics of Sr2RuO4, and,
in principle, can host superconductivity. Furthermore, we show that competing
magnetic phases and associated frustration, naturally affecting the
superconducting state, can be tuned by epitaxial strain engineering. This
system thus offers an excellent platform for gaining more insight into
superconductivity in ruthenates.

predictive tool for wireline log prediction from drilling data can help
management make decisions about data acquisition, especially for delineation

environment with both static and moving obstacles is a challenging problem.
Part of the challenge is developing a formulation that can be solved in
real-time while including the following set of specifications: minimum
time-to-goal, a dynamic vehicle model, minimum control effort, both static and
moving obstacle avoidance, simultaneous optimization of speed and steering, and
a short execution horizon. This paper presents a nonlinear model predictive
control-based trajectory planning formulation, tailored for a large, high-speed
unmanned ground vehicle, that includes the above set of specifications. This
paper also evaluates NLOptControl's ability to solve this formulation in
real-time in conjunction with the KNITRO nonlinear programming problem solver;
NLOptControl is our open-source, direct-collocation based, optimal control
problem solver. This formulation is tested with various sets of the
specifications. In particular, a parametric study relating execution horizon
and obstacle speed, indicates that the moving obstacle avoidance specification
is not needed for safety when the planner has a small execution horizon
($\leq0.375\;s$) and the obstacles are moving slowly ($\leq2.11\frac{m}{s}$).
However, a moving obstacle avoidance specification is needed when the obstacles
are moving faster, and this specification improves the overall safety by a
factor of $6.73$ ($p=2.2\times10^{-16}$) without, in most cases, increasing the
solve-times. Overall, the results indicate that (1) safe trajectory planners
for high-performance automated vehicles should include the entire set of
specifications mentioned above, unless a static or low-speed environment
permits a less comprehensive planner; and (2) NLOptControl can solve the
formulation in real-time.

representation learning models by iteratively stacking multiple layers of
convolution aggregation operations and non-linear activation operations.
Recently, in Collaborative Filtering (CF) based Recommender Systems (RS), by
treating the user-item interaction behavior as a bipartite graph, some
researchers model higher-layer collaborative signals with GCNs. These GCN based
recommender models show superior performance compared to traditional works.
However, these models suffer from training difficulty with non-linear
activations for large user-item graphs. Besides, most GCN based models could
not model deeper layers due to the over smoothing effect with the graph
convolution operation. In this paper, we revisit GCN based CF models from two
aspects. First, we empirically show that removing non-linearities would enhance
recommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple
graph convolutional networks. Second, we propose a residual network structure
that is specifically designed for CF with user-item interaction modeling, which
alleviates the over smoothing problem in graph convolution aggregation
operation with sparse user-item interaction data. The proposed model is a
linear model and it is easy to train, scale to large datasets, and yield better
efficiency and effectiveness on two real datasets. We publish the source code

information transmission from a multi-antenna hybrid access point (HAP) to a

power-splitting (PS) protocol. We introduce the novel concept of hybrid relay
communications, which allows each relay to switch between two radio modes,
i.e., the active RF communications and the passive backscatter communications,
according to its channel and energy conditions. We envision that the complement
transmissions in two radio modes can be exploited to improve the overall relay
performance. As such, we aim to jointly optimize the HAP's beamforming,
individual relays' radio mode, the PS ratio, and the relays' collaborative
beamforming to enhance the throughput performance at the receiver. The
resulting formulation becomes a combinatorial and non-convex problem. Thus, we
firstly propose a convex approximation to the original problem, which serves as
a lower bound of the relay performance. Then, we design an iterative algorithm
that decomposes the binary relay mode optimization from the other operating
parameters. In the inner loop of the algorithm, we exploit the structural
properties to optimize the relay performance with the fixed relay mode in the
alternating optimization framework. In the outer loop, different performance
metrics are derived to guide the search for a set of passive relays to further
improve the relay performance. Simulation results verify that the hybrid
relaying communications can achieve 20% performance improvement compared to the
conventional relay communications with all active relays.

atomic-scale characterization remains a significant challenge. Herein, the
non-equilibrium QFL or electrochemical potential profiles within
single-molecule junctions obtained from the newly developed first-principles
multi-space constrained-search density functional formalism are presented.
Benchmarking the standard non-equilibrium Green's function calculation results,
it is first established that algorithmically the notion of separate
electrode-originated nonlocal QFLs should be maintained within the channel
region during self-consistent finite-bias electronic structure calculations.
For the insulating hexandithiolate junction, the QFL profiles exhibit
discontinuities at the left and right electrode interfaces and across the
molecule the accompanying electrostatic potential drops linearly and Landauer
residual-resistivity dipoles are uniformly distributed. For the conducting
hexatrienedithiolate junction, on the other hand, the electrode QFLs penetrate
into the channel region and produce split QFLs. With the highest occupied
molecular orbital entering the bias window and becoming a good transport
channel, the split QFLs are also accompanied by the nonlinear electrostatic
potential drop and asymmetric Landauer residua-resistivity dipole formation.
Our findings underscore the importance of the first-principles extraction of
QFLs in nanoscale junctions and point to a new direction for the computational
design of next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical
devices.

of interacting photons containing light-matter coupling and self-interaction
term is constructed by eliminating the graviton degrees of freedom coupled to
both matter and photons. It is shown that the equation of state of matter can
be probed from the dynamics of light in this theory. The vacuum birefringence
is also shown to be a generic property in this theory that arises from the
non-linear nature of the self-interaction between gauge fields. Further, the
non-local nature of quantum effective action with modified dispersion relation
is also discussed in great detail. The above results also open an alternate way
to infer the properties of gravitational waves without their direct measurement

Tactile Internet. In this paper, we focus on energy-efficient design of fog
computing networks that support low-latency Tactile Internet applications. We
investigate two performance metrics: Service response time of end-users and
power usage efficiency of fog nodes. We quantify the fundamental tradeoff
between these two metrics and then extend our analysis to fog computing
networks involving cooperation between fog nodes. We introduce a novel
cooperative fog computing concept, referred to as offload forwarding, in which
a set of fog nodes with different computing and energy resources can cooperate
with each other. The objective of this cooperation is to balance the workload
processed by different fog nodes, further reduce the service response time, and
improve the efficiency of power usage. We develop a distributed optimization
framework based on dual decomposition to achieve the optimal tradeoff. Our
framework does not require fog nodes to disclose their private information nor
conduct back-and-forth negotiations with each other. Two distributed
optimization algorithms are proposed. One is based on the subgradient method
with dual decomposition and the other is based on distributed ADMM-VS. We prove
that both algorithms can achieve the optimal workload allocation that minimizes
the response time under the given power efficiency constraints of fog nodes.

finite range several limitations of (time discrete) FT can be observed which
are caused by the orthogonality mismatch of the trigonometric basis functions
on a finite interval. However, in the general situation of non-equidistant or
fragmented sampling FT based methods will cause significant errors in the
parameter estimation. Therefore, the classical Lomb-Scargle method (LSM), which
is not based on Fourier series, was developed as a statistical tool for one

estimation of FT. The present work deduces LSM for $n$-dimensional data sets by
a redefinition of the shifting parameter $\tau$, to maintain orthogonality of

for the first time at these small radial distances, using a diffraction limited

including observations from the {\it Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory}

ejection (CME) propagating through the corona with the nearly constant speed of
250 km/s. Our TSE images provide the same typical velocity as measured at a
distance of one solar radius from the surface. The event was initiated by
coronal dynamics manifested by a prominence eruption that started just before
the eclipse observations and an ascent of a U-shaped structure visible in the
AIA 171 A channel, which we assume as the lower part of a coronal cavity. The
prominence material was observed draining down towards the chromosphere along
the prominence arch. While the prominence disappears in the STEREO-A

problem as a Markov Decision Process, but the solutions often rely on various
assumptions and become brittle when presented with corner cases. In contrast,
deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been very effective at finding
policies by simultaneously exploring, interacting, and learning from
environments. Leveraging the powerful Deep RL paradigm, we demonstrate that an
iterative procedure of self-play can create progressively more diverse
environments, leading to the learning of sophisticated and robust multi-agent
policies. We demonstrate this in a challenging multi-agent simulation of

to successfully merge on or off the road. While the environment starts off
simple, we increase its complexity by iteratively adding an increasingly
diverse set of agents to the agent ""zoo"" as training progresses. Qualitatively,
we find that through self-play, our policies automatically learn interesting

double-exchange mechanism mediated by free carriers, prevailing over the
superexchange mechanism in the insulating state. Our findings highlight that

equation $u_t=u_{xx}+f(u)$ on the real line, where $f$ is a locally Lipschitz
function on $\mathbb{R}.$ Assuming that the initial value $u_0=u(\cdot,0)$ of
the solution has finite limits $\theta^\pm$ as $x\to\pm\infty$, our goal is to
describe the asymptotic behavior of $u(x,t)$ as $t\to\infty$. In a prior work,
we showed that if the two limits are distinct, then the solution is
quasiconvergent, that is, all its locally uniform limit profiles as
$t\to\infty$ are steady states. It is known that this result is not valid in
general if the limits are equal: $\theta^\pm=\theta_0$. In the present paper,
we have a closer look at the equal-limits case. Under minor non-degeneracy
assumptions on the nonlinearity, we show that the solution is quasiconvergent
if either $f(\theta_0)\ne0$, or $f(\theta_0)=0$ and $\theta_0$ is a stable
equilibrium of the equation $\dot \xi=f(\xi)$. If $f(\theta_0)=0$ and

also prove some quasiconvergence theorem making (necessarily) additional

While it is very desirable to probe these devices and the quantum states they
host at the atomic scale, typical methods rely on long-ranged capacitive
interactions, making this difficult. Here we probe a silicon electronic device
at the atomic scale using a localized electronic quantum dot induced directly
within the device at a desired location, using the biased tip of a

short-ranged tunnel coupling interactions of the quantum dot with the device's
source reservoir using sub-nm position control of the tip, and the quantum dot
energy level using a voltage applied to the device's gate reservoir. Despite
the $\sim 1$nm proximity of the quantum dot to the metallic tip, we find the
gate provides sufficient capacitance to enable a high degree of electric
control. Combined with atomic scale imaging, we use the quantum dot to probe
applied electric fields and charge in individual defects in the device. This
capability is expected to aid in the understanding of atomic-scale devices and

promising high-energy neutrino counterpart candidate, we search for additional
neutrino blazars candidates among the Fermi-LAT detected blazars.
  We investigate the multi-wavelength behavior from radio to GeV gamma rays of
blazars found to be in spatial coincidence with single high-energy neutrinos
and lower-energy neutrino flare candidates. In addition, we compare the average
gamma-ray emission of the potential neutrino-emitting sources to the entire
sample of gamma-ray blazars. We find that neutrino-emitting blazar candidates
are statistically compatible with both hypothesis of a linear correlation and
of no correlation between neutrino and gamma-ray energy flux.

(MEC) networks. Resource allocation strategies for maximizing the computation
efficiency are critically important. In this paper, computation efficiency
maximization problems are formulated in wireless-powered MEC networks under
both partial and binary computation offloading modes. A practical non-linear
energy harvesting model is considered. Both time division multiple access
(TDMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) are considered and evaluated
for offloading. The energy harvesting time, the local computing frequency, and
the offloading time and power are jointly optimized to maximize the computation
efficiency under the max-min fairness criterion. Two iterative algorithms and
two alternative optimization algorithms are respectively proposed to address
the non-convex problems formulated in this paper. Simulation results show that
the proposed resource allocation schemes outperform the benchmark schemes in
terms of user fairness. Moreover, a tradeoff is elucidated between the
achievable computation efficiency and the total number of computed bits.
Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that the partial computation
offloading mode outperforms the binary computation offloading mode and NOMA
outperforms TDMA in terms of computation efficiency.

dominates the electron spectrum with an intensity of $\simeq$ 60% was well
reproduced by simulating a set of unresolved excited bands. Moreover, a
detailed analysis of the intensity profile as a function of the angular

$g_K = 0.69^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$ for the ground-state band. The odd-$Z$ $^{249}$Md

activity detection and data decoding can be achieved, which, however,
significantly increases the computational complexity. Coordinate descent
algorithms that enjoy a low per-iteration complexity have been employed to
solve the detection problem, but previous works typically employ a random
coordinate selection policy which leads to slow convergence. In this paper, we
develop multi-armed bandit approaches for more efficient detection via
coordinate descent, which make a delicate trade-off between exploration and
exploitation in coordinate selection. Specifically, we first propose a bandit
based strategy, i.e., Bernoulli sampling, to speed up the convergence rate of
coordinate descent, by learning which coordinates will result in more
aggressive descent of the objective function. To further improve the
convergence rate, an inner multi-armed bandit problem is established to learn
the exploration policy of Bernoulli sampling. Both convergence rate analysis
and simulation results are provided to show that the proposed bandit based
algorithms enjoy faster convergence rates with a lower time complexity compared
with the state-of-the-art algorithm. Furthermore, our proposed algorithms are
applicable to different scenarios, e.g., massive random access with
low-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).

user (PU) to the destination. In the considered CRN, the SU has opportunities
to access the spectrum owned by the PU to send its own status packets to the
destination. The freshness of information is measured by the age of information
(AoI) metric. The problem of minimizing the average AoI and energy consumption
by developing new optimal status update and packet relaying schemes for the SU
is addressed under an average AoI constraint for the PU. This problem is
formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP). The monotonic and
decomposable properties of the value function are characterized and then used
to show that the optimal update and relaying policy is threshold-based with
respect to the AoI of the SU. These structures reveal a tradeoff between the
AoI of the SU and the energy consumption as well as between the AoI of the SU

decomposed the redshift space bispectrum in spherical harmonics which
completely quantify this anisotropy. To illustrate this we consider linear
redshift space distortion of the bispectrum arising from primordial
non-Gaussianity. In the plane parallel approximation only the first four even
$\ell$ multipoles have non-zero values, and we present explicit analytical
expressions for all the non-zero multipoles {\it i.e.} upto $\ell=6,m=4$. The
ratio of the different multipole moments to the real space bispectrum depends
only on $\beta_1$ the linear redshift distortion parameter and the shape of the
triangle. Considering triangles of all possible shapes, we have studied how
this ratio depends on the shape of the triangle for $\beta_1=1$. We have also
studied the $\beta_1$ dependence for some of the extreme triangle shapes. If
measured in future, these multipole moments hold the potential of constraining
$\beta_1$. The results presented here are also important if one wishes to

  For security and privacy, website owners need to be aware of the content they
provide their users. However, in reality, they often do not know which third
parties are embedded, for example, when these third parties request additional
content as it is common in real-time ad auctions.
  In this paper, we present a large-scale measurement study to analyze the
magnitude of these new challenges. To better reflect the connectedness of third
parties, we measured their relations in a model we call third party trees,
which reflects an approximation of the loading dependencies of all third
parties embedded into a given website. Using this concept, we show that
including a single third party can lead to subsequent requests from up to eight
additional services. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the third parties
embedded on a page load are not always deterministic, as 50% of the branches in
the third party trees change between repeated visits. In addition, we found
that 93% of the analyzed websites embedded third parties that are located in

sound speed and viscosity, respectively. By using the latest available data we
derive constraints on the amount of dark energy at early times and the present

energy has on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, including
polarization and lensing, in a generalized parameter space including a varying
total neutrino mass, and tensor to scalar ratio, besides the 6 standard
parameters of the minimal cosmological model. We find that the inclusion of
Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data and CMB lensing significantly
improves the constraints on the EDE parameters, while other high redshift data
like the Quasar Hubble diagram and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest BAO have instead a
negligible impact. We find $\Omega_{\rm eDE} < 0.00391 $ and $w_{0} < -0.9500 $
at the $95 \%$ C.L. for EDE accounting for its clustering through the inclusion
of perturbation dynamics. This limit becomes weaker $\Omega_{\rm eDE} <
0.00337$ if perturbations are neglected. The constraints on the EDE parameters
are remarkably stable even when $\Sigma m_{\nu}$, and $r$ parameters are
varied, with weak degeneracies between $\Omega_{\rm eDE}$ and $r$ or $\Sigma
m_{\nu}$. Perturbation parameters are not constrained with current data sets,
and tensions between the CMB derived $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ values and those
measured with local probes are not eased. This work demonstrates the capability
of CMB probes to constrain the total amount of EDE well below the percent

validating an experiment design using historical data or for exploring
confounders when studying a new relationship. However, existing data-driven
methods for causal effect estimation face some major challenges, including poor
scalability with high dimensional data, low estimation accuracy due to
heuristics used by the global causal structure learning algorithms, and the
assumption of causal sufficiency when hidden variables are inevitable in data.
In this paper, we develop a theorem for using local search to find a superset
of the adjustment (or confounding) variables for causal effect estimation from
observational data under a realistic pretreatment assumption. The theorem
ensures that the unbiased estimate of causal effect is included in the set of
causal effects estimated by the superset of adjustment variables. Based on the
developed theorem, we propose a data-driven algorithm for causal query.
Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is faster and produces better
causal effect estimation than an existing data-driven causal effect estimation
method with hidden variables. The causal effects estimated by the proposed

introduction to wave turbulence. Since the first paper by Zakharov and
Filonenko (1967), capillary wave turbulence has been the subject of many
studies but a didactic derivation of the kinetic equation is still lacking. It
is the objective of this paper to present such a derivation in absence of
gravity and in the approximation of deep water. We use the Eulerian method and
a Taylor expansion around the equilibrium elevation for the velocity potential
to derive the kinetic equation. The use of directional polarities for
three-wave interactions leads to a compact form for this equation which is
fully compatible with previous work. The exact solutions are derived with the
so-called Zakharov transformation applied to wavenumbers and the nature of
these solutions is discussed. Experimental and numerical works done in recent
decades are also reviewed.

line profiles in the velocity spectrum. Unlike the approach favoured by prior
studies, this model is not described by free parameters and we do not use
fitting procedures to match the observations. Instead, we use an analytical
turbulence model coupled with constraints extracted from a 3D hydrodynamic
simulation of the solar atmosphere. We then compare the resulting asymmetries
with their observationally derived counterpart.
  We find that stochastic excitation localised beneath the mode upper turning
point generates negative asymmetry for $\nu < \nu_\text{max}$ and positive
asymmetry for $\nu > \nu_\text{max}$. On the other hand, stochastic excitation
localised above this limit generates negative asymmetry throughout the $p$-mode
spectrum. As a result of the spatial extent of the source of excitation, both
cases play a role in the total observed asymmetries. By taking this spatial
extent into account and using a realistic description of the spectrum of
turbulent kinetic energy, both a qualitative and quantitative agreement can be
found with solar observations perfoemed by the GONG network. We also find that
the impact of the correlation between acoustic noise and oscillation is
negligible for mode asymmetry in the velocity spectrum.

two-dimensional (2D) vdW materials, black phosphorus (BP) and indium selenide
(InSe) have a Brillouin zone-centered conduction and valence bands, and a type
II band offset, both ideally suited for band-to-band tunneling. Here, we
demonstrate TFETs based on BP/InSe heterojunctions with diverse electrical
transport characteristics: forward rectifying, Zener-tunneling and backward
rectifying characteristics are realized in BP/InSe junctions with different
thickness of the BP layer or by electrostatic gating of the junction.
Electrostatic gating yields a large on/off current ratio of up to 108 and
negative differential resistance at low applied voltages (V ~ 0.2V). These
findings illustrate versatile functionalities of TFETs based on BP and InSe,
offering opportunities for applications of these 2D materials beyond the device

such as state, non-determinism, and continuations. In the last decade, several
generalisations of monads have been suggested which provide a more fine-grained
model of effects by replacing the single type constructor of a monad with an
indexed family of constructors. Most notably, graded monads (indexed by a
monoid) model effect systems and parameterised monads (indexed by pairs of pre-
and post-conditions) model program logics. This paper studies the relationship
between these two generalisations of monads via a third generalisation. This
third generalisation, which we call category-graded monads, arises by
generalising a view of monads as a particular special case of lax functors. A
category-graded monad provides a family of functors T f indexed by morphisms f
of some other category. This allows certain compositions of effects to be ruled
out (in the style of a program logic) as well as an abstract description of
effects (in the style of an effect system). Using this as a basis, we show how
graded and parameterised monads can be unified, studying their similarities and
differences along the way.

Despite searches for periodicity in repeat burst arrival times on time scales
from milliseconds to many days, these bursts have hitherto been observed to

report the detection of a $16.35\pm0.15$ day periodicity (or possibly a

terms of a timelike vielbein and a spatial metric. This expansion can be
performed covariantly and off shell. We study the expansion of the

RL in quantum physics, the information gathered in each run is intrinsically
stochastic and thus insufficient to evaluate exactly the performance of the
chosen receiver. Nevertheless, we present families of agents that: (i) discover
a receiver beating the best Gaussian receiver after ~3 10^2 experiments; (ii)
surpass the cumulative reward of the best Gaussian receiver after ~10^3

with unprecedented amounts of data to study human behavior and response
associated with a variety of health conditions and medical treatments. Here we
review recent work in mining social media for biomedical, epidemiological, and
social phenomena information relevant to the multilevel complexity of human
health. We pay particular attention to topics where social media data analysis
has shown the most progress, including pharmacovigilance, sentiment analysis
especially for mental health, and other areas. We also discuss a variety of
innovative uses of social media data for health-related applications and
important limitations in social media data access and use.

Velocity Shear Layer (VSL) position. The VSL is detected as the plasma
potential peak measured by a reciprocating ball-pen probe. A subsequent
statistical analysis of nearly 400 discharges shows a strong systematic trend
in the reconstructed separatrix position relative to the VSL, where the primary
factors are plasma triangularity and the magnetic axis radial position. This
dependency is significantly reduced after the measuring coils positions as
recorded in EFIT input are optimised to provide a closer match between the

the superconductor makes the quantification of the anisotropy itself uncertain:
the intrinsic anisotropy due to the layered structure, quantified by the
anisotropy factor $\gamma$, mixes up with the additional anisotropy due to
pinning. As a consequence, there is no consensus on the experimental anisotropy
factor $\gamma$ that can result in YBCO when directional (twin planes,

dynamic network slicing in which a regional orchestrator coordinates workload
distribution among local fog nodes, providing partitions/slices of energy and
computational resources to support a specific type of service with certain
quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. The resources allocated to each slice can
be dynamically adjusted according to service demands and energy availability. A
stochastic overlapping coalition-formation game is developed to investigate
distributed cooperation and joint network slicing between fog nodes under
randomly fluctuating energy harvesting and workload arrival processes. We
observe that the overall processing capacity of the fog computing network can
be improved by allowing fog nodes to maintain a belief function about the
unknown state and the private information of other nodes. An algorithm based on
a belief-state partially observable Markov decision process (B-POMDP) is
proposed to achieve the optimal resource slicing structure among all fog nodes.

under longitudinally varying dispersion. The realistic waveguide geometry is
proposed that offers linear or oscillating dispersion profile. By solving the
dispersion equation, we theoretically investigate how a linear variation of the
group-velocity dispersion (GVD) over space affects the parabolic trajectory of
an accelerating finite energy airy pulse (FEAP). It is demonstrated that,
suitable adjustment of GVD can lead to unusual quasi-linear trajectory of the
accelerating airy pulse. The impact of the periodic GVD on airy dynamics is
more interesting where FEAP exhibits oscillatory trajectory with periodic peak
power modulation. We theoretically estimate optimized length of the waveguide
delivering maximum power at the output by solving the transcendental relation
between GVD modulation strength and period. The effect of oscillatory higher
order dispersion is dramatic for optical airy pulse where it experiences
singularity points during propagation. At singularity points airy pulse loses
its identity and flips over in time. The rich dynamics of FEAP near singular
point is carefully investigated by solving the propagation equation
analytically. In this report we provide detail theoretical analysis to achieve
selective temporal focusing of FEAP which may be useful for application. All
theoretical predictions are verified numerically and the agreement is found to
be excellent.

topological charge are stable, due to the dynamical instabilities of multiply
charged defects, unless supported by strong external rotation. Due to immense
fundamental interest in the physics of these fundamental topological
excitations, a great deal of work has been expended towards understanding ways
to force their stability. Here we show that in photonic Bose-Einstein
condensates of exciton-polariton quasiparticles pumped in an annular geometry,
not only do the constant particle fluxes intrinsic to the system naturally
stabilize multiply charged vortex states, but that such states can indeed form
spontaneously during the condensate formation through a dynamical symmetry
breaking mechanism. We elucidate the properties of these novel states, notably
finding that they radiate acoustically, in a process analogous to the emission
of gravitational waves from binary black holes. Finally, we show that the
vorticity of these photonic fluids are fundamentally limited by a quantum
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and therefore by the condensate radius and
pumping intensity. This represents the first report of this instability -
deeply fundamental in fluid dynamics - in a quantum photonic fluid.

should be employed to make a spatial measurement and carry out mathematical
modeling. The basic idea of scaling is to find a power exponent using the
double logarithmic linear relation between a variable scale and the
corresponding measurement results. The exponent is a characteristic parameter
which follows a scaleful distribution and can be used to characterize the
scale-free phenomena. The importance of the scaling analysis in geography is
becoming more and more evident for scientists.

  solids of arbitrary shape based on a reduced Baer-Nunziato model",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we propose a new diffuse interface model for the numerical
simulation of inviscid compressible flows around fixed and moving solid bodies
of arbitrary shape. The solids are assumed to be moving rigid bodies, without
any elastic properties. The model is a simplified case of the seven-equation
Baer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows, and results in a
nonlinear hyperbolic system with non-conservative products. The geometry of the
solid bodies is simply specified via a scalar field that represents the volume
fraction of the fluid present in each control volume. This allows the
discretization of arbitrarily complex geometries on simple uniform or adaptive
Cartesian meshes. Inside the solid bodies, the fluid volume fraction is zero,
while it is unitary in the fluid phase. We prove that at the material
interface, i.e. where the volume fraction jumps from unity to zero, the normal
component of the fluid velocity assumes the value of the normal component of
the solid velocity. This result can be directly derived from the governing
equations, either via Riemann invariants or from the generalized Rankine
Hugoniot conditions according to the theory of Dal Maso, Le Floch and Murat,
which justifies the use of a path-conservative approach for treating the
nonconservative products. The governing equations of our new model are solved
on uniform Cartesian grids via a high order path-conservative ADER
discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with a posteriori sub-cell finite volume
(FV) limiter. Since the numerical method is of the shock capturing type, the
fluid-solid boundary is never explicitly tracked by the numerical method,
neither via interface reconstruction, nor via mesh motion. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach is tested on a set of numerical test problems, including
1D Riemann problems as well as supersonic flows over fixed and moving rigid
bodies.

decide which model is best suited for a particular purpose. In this
contribution, I demonstrate how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which
is already a popular tool in other areas of science, can be used for model
fitting and model selection in a pedestrian dynamics context. I fit two
different models for pedestrian dynamics to data on a crowd passing in one
direction through a bottleneck. One model describes movement in
continuous-space, the other model is a cellular automaton and thus describes
movement in discrete-space. In addition, I compare models to data using two
metrics. The first is based on egress times and the second on the velocity of
pedestrians in front of the bottleneck. My results show that while model
fitting is successful, a substantial degree of uncertainty about the value of
some model parameters remains after model fitting. Importantly, the choice of
metric in model fitting can influence parameter estimates. Model selection is
inconclusive for the egress time metric but supports the continuous-space model
for the velocity-based metric. These findings show that ABC is a flexible
approach and highlight the difficulties associated with model fitting and model
selection for pedestrian dynamics. ABC requires many simulation runs and
choosing appropriate metrics for comparing data to simulations requires careful
attention. Despite this, I suggest ABC is a promising tool, because it is
versatile and easily implemented for the growing number of openly available
crowd simulators and data sets.

such information is critical to ensure a detailed understanding of the product

illegible labeling has the potential to be highly detrimental to consumers and
many other stakeholders in the supply chain. In this paper, a multi-source deep
learning-based domain adaptation system is proposed and tested to identify and
verify the presence and legibility of use-by date information from food
packaging photos taken as part of the validation process as the products pass
along the food production line. This was achieved by improving the
generalization of the techniques via making use of multi-source datasets in
order to extract domain-invariant representations for all domains and aligning
distribution of all pairs of source and target domains in a common feature
space, along with the class boundaries. The proposed system performed very well
in the conducted experiments, for automating the verification process and
reducing labeling errors that could otherwise threaten public health and
contravene legal requirements for food packaging information and accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on our food packaging datasets demonstrate that the

displayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals and
fatalities. This time shift, which does not conform to the SIR and SEIR models,
was explained by multi-stage SIR and SEIR models [21]. In this study we prove
that the delay for these models is half of the infectious period within a
quadratic approximation, and we determine the epidemic parameters $R_0$, $T$
and $I_0$ of the 2009 A(H1N1) Istanbul and Netherlands epidemics.These epidemic
parameters were estimated by comparing the normalized cumulative fatality data
with the solutions of the SIR model. Two different error criteria, the $L_2$
norms of the error over the whole observation period and over the initial
portion of the data, were used in order to obtain the best-fitting models. It
was observed that, with respect to both criteria, the parameters of ""good""
models were agglomerated along a line in the $T$-$R_0$ plane, instead of being
scattered uniformly around a ""best"" model. As this fact indicates the existence
of a nearly invariant quantity, interval estimates for the parameters were
given. As the initial phase of the epidemics were less influenced by the
effects of medical interventions, the error norm based on the initial portion
of the data was preferred. However, the presented parameter ranges are well out
of the range for the usual influenza epidemic parameter values. To confirm our
observations on the Istanbul data, the same error criteria were also used for
the 2009 A(H1N1) epidemic for the Netherlands, which has a similar population
density as in Istanbul. As in the Istanbul case, the parameter ranges do not

settings, the process will converge to a factor model in which a single factor
will suffice to capture the covariance structure among the indicators. Factor
analysis with one wave of data can then not distinguish between factor models
with a single factor versus those with two factors that are causally related.
Therefore, unless causal relations between factors can be ruled out a priori,
alleged empirical evidence from one-wave factor analysis for a single factor
still leaves open the possibilities of a single factor or of two factors that
causally affect one another. The implications for interpreting the factor
structure of psychological scales, such as self-report scales for anxiety and
depression, or for happiness and purpose, are discussed. The results are

chiral motion in a minimal setup of three sites. Our demonstration relies on
the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling of the dipolar exchange interaction combined
with time-reversal symmetry breaking by a homogeneous external magnetic field.
Remarkably, the phase of the hopping amplitude between two sites strongly
depends on the occupancy of the third site, thus leading to a correlated
hopping associated to a density-dependent Peierls phase. We experimentally
observe this density-dependent hopping and show that the excitations behave as
anyonic particles with a non-trivial phase under exchange. Finally, we confirm
the dependence of the Peierls phase on the geometrical arrangement of the

three-dimensional topological insulators (3DTIs), provides a new avenue for
spintronics applications. One consequence of spin-momentum locking is the
induction of surface spin accumulations due to applied electric fields. In this
work, we investigate the extraction of such electrically-induced spins from
their host TI material into adjoining conventional, hence topologically
trivial, materials that are commonly used in electronics devices. We focus on
effective Hamiltonians for bismuth-based 3DTI materials in the ${\rm Bi}_2{\rm
Se}_3$ family, and numerically explore the geometries for extracting
current-induced spins from a TI surface. In particular, we consider a device
geometry in which a side pocket is attached to various faces of a 3DTI quantum
wire and show that it is possible to create current-induced spin accumulations
in these topologically trivial side pockets. We further study how such spin
extraction depends on geometry and material parameters, and find that
electron-hole degrees of freedom can be utilized to control the polarization of
the extracted spins by an applied gate voltage.

  and Passive Beamforming Design",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A novel framework is proposed for the deployment and passive beamforming
design of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with the aid of
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology. The problem of joint
deployment, phase shift design, as well as power allocation is formulated for
maximizing the energy efficiency with considering users' particular data
requirements. To tackle this pertinent problem, machine learning approaches are
adopted in two steps. Firstly, a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) based echo
state network (ESN) algorithm is proposed to predict users' tele-traffic demand
by leveraging a real dataset. Secondly, a decaying double deep Q-network (D3QN)
based position-acquisition and phase-control algorithm is proposed to solve the
joint problem of deployment and design of the RIS. In the proposed algorithm,
the base station, which controls the RIS by a controller, acts as an agent. The
agent periodically observes the state of the RIS-enhanced system for attaining
the optimal deployment and design policies of the RIS by learning from its
mistakes and the feedback of users. Additionally, it is proved that the
proposed D3QN based deployment and design algorithm is capable of converging
within mild conditions. Simulation results are provided for illustrating that
the proposed LSTM-based ESN algorithm is capable of striking a tradeoff between
the prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, it is
demonstrated that the proposed D3QN based algorithm outperforms the benchmarks,
while the NOMA-enhanced RIS system is capable of achieving higher energy
efficiency than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) enabled RIS system.

unexpected hypersurface of degree $t$ for multiplicity $m$ if the imposition of
having multiplicity $m$ at a general point $P$ fails to impose the expected
number of conditions on the linear system of hypersurfaces of degree $t$
containing $X$. Conditions which either guarantee the occurrence of unexpected
hypersurfaces, or which ensure that they cannot occur, are not well understand.
We introduce new methods for studying unexpectedness, such as the use of
generic initial ideals and partial elimination ideals to clarify when it can
and when it cannot occur. We also exhibit algebraic and geometric properties of
$X$ which in some cases guarantee and in other cases preclude $X$ having
certain kinds of unexpectedness. In addition, we formulate a new way of
quantifying unexpectedness (our AV sequence), which allows us detect the extent
to which unexpectedness persists as $t$ increases but $t-m$ remains constant.
Finally, we study to what extent we can detect unexpectedness from the Hilbert
function of $X$.

from present day up to less than 1 Gyr from the Big Bang. At a more fundamental
level, xA quasars are of special interest in studies of the physics of AGNs and
host galaxy evolution. However, their observational properties are largely
unknown. xA quasars can be identified in relatively large numbers from major
optical surveys over a broad range of redshifts, thanks to selection criteria
defined from the systematic changes along the quasars main sequence. It has
been possible to build a sample of about 250 quasars at low and intermediate
redshift, and larger samples can be easily selected from the latest data
releases of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. A large sample can clarify the main
properties of xA quasars which are expected - unlike the general population of
quasars - to radiate at an extreme, well defined Eddington ratio with small
scatter. As a result of the small scatter in Eddington ratio shown by xA
quasars, we propose a method to derive the main cosmological parameters based
on redshift-independent ""virial luminosity"" estimates from measurements of
emission line widths, roughly equivalent to the luminosity estimates based from
line width in early and late type galaxies. A major issue related to the
cosmological application of the xA quasar luminosity estimates from line widths
is the identification of proper emission lines whose broadening is
predominantly virial over a wide range of redshift and luminosity. We report on
preliminary developments using the AlIII 1860 intermediate ionization line and
the Hydrogen Balmer line H-beta as virial broadening estimators, and we briefly
discuss the perspective of the method based on xA quasars.

ReInfoSelect back propagates the gradients through the neural ranker, gathers
its NDCG reward, and optimizes the data selection network using policy
gradients, until the neural ranker's performance peaks on target relevance
metrics (convergence). In our experiments on three TREC benchmarks, neural
rankers trained by ReInfoSelect, with only publicly available anchor data,
significantly outperform feature-based learning to rank methods and match the
effectiveness of neural rankers trained with private commercial search logs.
Our analyses show that ReInfoSelect effectively selects weak supervision

feature that takes $K$ values, and depend linearly on the other $n$ features.
Laplacian regularization with respect to a graph on the feature values can
greatly improve the performance of a stratified model, especially in the
low-data regime. A significant issue with Laplacian-regularized stratified
models is that the model is $K$ times the size of the base model, which can be
quite large.
  We address this issue by formulating eigen-stratifed models, which are
stratified models with an additional constraint that the model parameters are
linear combinations of some modest number $m$ of bottom eigenvectors of the
graph Laplacian, i.e., those associated with the $m$ smallest eigenvalues. With
eigen-stratified models, we only need to store the $m$ bottom eigenvectors and
the corresponding coefficients as the stratified model parameters. This leads
to a reduction, sometimes large, of model size when $m \leq n$ and $m \ll K$.
In some cases, the additional regularization implicit in eigen-stratified
models can improve out-of-sample performance over standard Laplacian
regularized stratified models.

organized in a matrix form whose elements are count data. When these
observations are assumed to follow a Poisson or a multinomial distribution, it
is of interest to focus on the estimation of either the intensity matrix
(Poisson case) or the compositional matrix (multinomial case) when it is
assumed to have a low rank structure. In this setting, it is proposed to
construct an estimator minimizing the regularized negative log-likelihood by a
nuclear norm penalty. Such an approach easily yields a low-rank matrix-valued
estimator with positive entries which belongs to the set of row-stochastic
matrices in the multinomial case. Then, as a main contribution, a data-driven
procedure is constructed to select the regularization parameter in the
construction of such estimators by minimizing (approximately) unbiased
estimates of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk in such models, which generalize
Stein's unbiased risk estimation originally proposed for Gaussian data. The
evaluation of these quantities is a delicate problem, and novel methods are
introduced to obtain accurate numerical approximation of such unbiased
estimates. Simulated data are used to validate this way of selecting
regularizing parameters for low-rank matrix estimation from count data. For
data following a multinomial distribution, the performances of this approach
are also compared to $K$-fold cross-validation. Examples from a survey study
and metagenomics also illustrate the benefits of this methodology for real data
analysis.

supposedly clean samples via quality models and actively querying an oracle for
the most informative true labels. While the former can suffer from low data
volumes of on-line scenarios, the latter is constrained by the availability and
costs of human experts. QActor swiftly combines the merits of quality models
for data filtering and oracle queries for cleaning the most informative data.
The objective of QActor is to leverage the stringent oracle budget to robustly
maximize the learning accuracy. QActor explores various strategies combining
different query allocations and uncertainty measures. A central feature of
QActor is to dynamically adjust the query limit according to the learning loss
for each data batch. We extensively evaluate different image datasets fed into
the classifier that can be standard machine learning (ML) models or deep neural

devices with local datasets collaboratively train a joint model with the help
of a remote parameter server (PS). We assume that the devices are connected to
the PS through a bandwidth-limited shared wireless channel. At each iteration
of FL, a subset of the devices are scheduled to transmit their local model
updates to the PS over orthogonal channel resources, while each participating
device must compress its model update to accommodate to its link capacity. We
design novel scheduling and resource allocation policies that decide on the
subset of the devices to transmit at each round, and how the resources should
be allocated among the participating devices, not only based on their channel
conditions, but also on the significance of their local model updates. We then
establish convergence of a wireless FL algorithm with device scheduling, where
devices have limited capacity to convey their messages. The results of
numerical experiments show that the proposed scheduling policy, based on both
the channel conditions and the significance of the local model updates,
provides a better long-term performance than scheduling policies based only on
either of the two metrics individually. Furthermore, we observe that when the
data is independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) across devices,
selecting a single device at each round provides the best performance, while
when the data distribution is non-i.i.d., scheduling multiple devices at each
round improves the performance. This observation is verified by the convergence
result, which shows that the number of scheduled devices should increase for a
less diverse and more biased data distribution.

for the $K$-user multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) interference channel
(IC) with hardware impairments (HWI). HWI may arise due to imperfections in the
devices like I/Q imbalance, phase noise, etc. With I/Q imbalance, the received
signal is a widely linear transformation of the transmitted signal and noise.
Thus, the effective noise at the receivers becomes improper, which means that
its real and imaginary parts are correlated and/or have unequal powers.
  IGS can improve system performance with improper noise and/or improper
interference. In this paper, we study the benefits of IGS for this scenario in
terms of two performance metrics: achievable rate and energy efficiency (EE).
We consider the rate region, the sum-rate, the EE region and the global EE
optimization problems to fully evaluate the IGS performance. To solve these
non-convex problems, we employ an optimization framework based on
majorization-minimization algorithms, which allow us to obtain a stationary
point of any optimization problem in which either the objective function and/or
constraints are linear functions of rates. Our numerical results show that IGS
can significantly improve the performance of the $K$-user MIMO IC with HWI and
I/Q imbalance, where its benefits increase with the number of users, $K$, and
the imbalance level, and decrease with the number of antennas.

Msun) main-sequence stars are known to decline with time, and there now exist
several models for the evolution of rotation and activity. However, the role
that chemical composition plays during stellar spin-down has not yet been
explored. In this work, we use a structural evolution code to compute the
rotational evolution of stars with three different masses (0.7, 1.0, and
1.3Msun and six different metallicities, ranging from [Fe/H]=-1.0 to
[Fe/H]=+0.5. We also implement three different wind-braking formulations from
the literature (two modern and one classical) and compare their predictions for
rotational evolution. The effect that metallicity has on stellar structural
properties, and in particular the convective turnover timescale, leads the two
modern wind-braking formulations to predict a strong dependence of the torque
on metallicity. Consequently, they predict that metal rich stars spin-down more
effectively at late ages (> 1 Gyr) than metal poor stars, and the effect is
large enough to be detectable with current observing facilities. For example,
the formulations predict that a Sun-like (solar-mass and solar-aged) star with
[Fe/H]=-0.3 will have a rotation period of less than 20 days. Even though old,
metal poor stars are predicted to rotate more rapidly at a given age, they have
larger Rossby numbers and are thus expected to have lower magnetic activity
levels. Finally, the different wind-braking formulations predict quantitative
differences in the metallicity-dependence of stellar rotation, which may be
used to test them.

tissue inhomogneities and high RF power deposition. Nowadays, proper RF
excitation of a human body in prostate and cardiac MRI is only possible to
achieve by using phased arrays of antennas attached to the body (so-called
surface coils). Due to safety concerns, the design of such coils aims to
minimize the local specific absorption rate (SAR) keeping the highest possible
RF signal in the region of interest. All previously demonstrated approaches
were based on resonant structures such as e. g.dipoles, capacitively-loaded
loops, TEM-line sections. In this study, we show that there is a better
compromise between the transmit signal and the local SAR using non-resonant
surface coils due to weaker RF near fields in the close proximity of their
conductors. With this aim, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a first
leaky-wave surface coil implemented as a periodically-slotted microstrip
transmission line. Due to its non-resonant radiation, the proposed coil induces
only slightly over half the peak local SAR compared to a state-of-the-art
dipole coil, but has the same transmit efficiency in prostate imaging at 7 T.
Unlike other coils, the leaky-wave coil intrinsically matches its input
impedance to the averaged wave impedance of body tissues in a broad frequency
range, which makes it very attractive for future clinical applications of 7 T
MRI.

consequence the cost per simulation might be unnecessarily high which wastes
computing resources. Hence, it is essential to identify the most critical
numerical parameters and to analyze systematically their effect on the result
in order to minimize the time-to-solution without losing significantly on
accuracy. Relevant parameters are identified by global sensitivity studies
where Sobol' indices are common measures. These sensitivities are obtained by
surrogate models based on polynomial chaos expansion. In this paper, we first

variability we need to properly characterise the impact of the current on the
underlying neuron populations. To develop and test a computational model
capable of capturing the impact of electric field stimulation on networks of
neurons. We construct a cortical tissue model with distinct layers and explicit
neuron morphologies. We then apply a model of electrical stimulation and carry
out multiple test case simulations. The cortical slice model is compared to
experimental literature and shown to capture the main features of the
electrophysiological response to stimulation. Namely, the model showed 1) a
similar level of depolarisation in individual pyramidal neurons, 2)
acceleration of intrinsic oscillations, and 3) retention of the spatial profile
of oscillations in different layers. We then apply alternative electric fields
to demonstrate how the model can capture differences in neuronal responses to
the electric field. We demonstrate that the tissue response is dependent on
layer depth, the angle of the apical dendrite relative to the field, and
stimulation strength. We present publicly available computational modelling

to large scales is strongly suppressed in amplitude, especially at late times,
compared to predictions from perturbation theory (PT) based on the
single-stream approximation. One obvious explanation for this is that PT fails
to describe the dynamics beyond shell-crossing. We test this idea by comparing
measurements in $N$-body simulations to prescriptions based on PT but augmented
with adaptive smoothing to account for the formation of non-linear structures
of various sizes in the multi-stream regime. We first start with
one-dimensional (1D) cosmology, where the Zel'dovich approximation provides the
exact solution in the single stream regime. Similarly to the 3D case, the
response function of the large-scale modes exhibits a strong suppression in
amplitude at small scales which cannot be explained by the Zel'dovich solution
alone. However, by performing adaptive smoothing of initial conditions to
identify haloes of different sizes and solving approximately post-collapse
dynamics in the 3-streams regime, agreement between theory and simulations
drastically improves. We extend our analyses to the 3D case using PINOCCHIO
algorithm, in which similar adaptive smoothing is implemented on the Lagrangian
PT fields to identify haloes and is combined with a spherical halo prescription
to account for post-collapse dynamics. Again, a suppression is found in the
coupling between small- and large-scale modes and the agreement with
simulations is improved.

adults) in Russia was introduced in 2014, with no prior PCV7 use. While
pneumonia hospitalization rates, both in children and adults did not decrease
in the following years, respiratory mortality rates did decline with time.
Moreover, there is a strong association between antibiotic, including multidrug
resistance and PCV13 vaccine serotypes for S. pneumoniae in children in Russia,
and presence of S. pneumoniae among sepsis cases in Russia during the recent
years has been very low. Annual variability in influenza circulation may affect
some of the changes in respiratory mortality rates. Methods. We applied the
inference method from our recent study of influenza-associated mortality in
Russia to relate monthly respiratory mortality rates between 09/2010 and
08/2019 to monthly indices of influenza circulation and baseline rates of
mortality not associated with influenza, allowing for a potential trend in the
baseline rates starting 2015. Results. Baseline rates of respiratory mortality
not associated with influenza decreased with time starting from the 2014/15
season (with each season running from September to August), with the 2018/19
baseline rates of respiratory mortality per 100,000 individuals being lower by
12.41 (95% CI (10.6,14.2)) compared to the 2010-2014 period. Conclusions. While
improvement in care might have contributed to the reduction in the rates of
respiratory mortality not associated with influenza in Russia, the above
temporally consistent reduction is compatible with the gradual replacement of
vaccine serotypes in the transmission and carriage of S. pneumoniae following
the introduction of PCV13. Further work is needed to better understand the
impact of PCV13 on the epidemiology of respiratory infections and related
mortality in Russia.

encoding. Previous studies focused on training the self-attention in a
high-level layer, such as the last pooling layer. However, the effect of
low-level features was reduced in the speaker embedding encoding. Therefore, we
propose masked cross self-attentive encoding (MCSAE) using ResNet. It focuses
on the features of both high-level and lowlevel layers. Based on multi-layer
aggregation, the output features of each residual layer are used for the MCSAE.
In the MCSAE, cross self-attention module is trained the interdependence of
each input features. A random masking regularization module also applied to
preventing overfitting problem. As such, the MCSAE enhances the weight of
frames representing the speaker information. Then, the output features are
concatenated and encoded to the speaker embedding. Therefore, a more
informative speaker embedding is encoded by using the MCSAE. The experimental
results showed an equal error rate of 2.63% and a minimum detection cost
function of 0.1453 using the VoxCeleb1 evaluation dataset. These were improved
performances compared with the previous self-attentive encoding and
state-of-the-art encoding methods.

they overall feel that learning quantum is relevant or not. In order to answer
these questions, we followed a mixed-methods approach, combining both

important they feel quantum science is for society. Nevertheless, the
qualitative information revealed that although students may find quantum
physics and technology important for society, that does not necessarily mean
that they find learning quantum physics relevant. We found that students
believe the latter is relevant to them only if they find it interesting. We
therefore rediscover the common expression ""important, but not for me,"" and we
further propose that this perception derives from students not seeing the

the boost converter by following the approximate dynamic programming. The
advantage of the DHP is that the neural network based characteristic of the

models to make predictions. When this data comes from multiple sources, for
example when evaluation of data against a machine learning model is offered as
a service, there can be privacy issues and legal concerns over the sharing of
data. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows data to be computed on whilst
encrypted, which can provide a solution to the problem of data privacy.
However, FHE is both slow and restrictive, so existing algorithms must be
manipulated to make them work efficiently under the FHE paradigm. Some commonly
used machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression, are
poorly suited to FHE and cannot be manipulated to work both efficiently and
accurately. In this paper, we show that a modular approach, which applies FHE
to only the sensitive steps of a workflow that need protection, allows one
party to make predictions on their data using a Gaussian process regression
model built from another party's data, without either party gaining access to
the other's data, in a way which is both accurate and efficient. This
construction is, to our knowledge, the first example of an effectively
encrypted Gaussian process.

outperform physics-based models given ample amount of training data, they can
produce results that are physically inconsistent. This paper proposes a
physics-guided recurrent neural network model (PGRNN) that combines RNNs and

prediction accuracy over that of physics-based models, while generating outputs
consistent with physical laws. An important aspect of our PGRNN approach lies
in its ability to incorporate the knowledge encoded in physics-based models.
This allows training the PGRNN model using very few true observed data while
also ensuring high prediction accuracy. Although we present and evaluate this
methodology in the context of modeling the dynamics of temperature in lakes, it
is applicable more widely to a range of scientific and engineering disciplines

access into compound data structures. Usually defined as programming language
libraries, they provide combinators to manipulate different shapes of data such
as sums, products and collections, that can be composed to operate on larger
structures. Together they form a powerful language to describe transformations
of data. Among the different approaches to describing optics, one particular
type of optics, called profunctor optics, stands out. It describes alternative
but equivalent representations of most of the common combinators, and enhances
them with elegant composability properties via a higher-order encoding.
Notably, it enables easy composition across different optic families.
Unfortunately, profunctor optics are difficult to reason about, and linking
usual optics with an equivalent profunctor representation has so far been done
on a case-by-case basis, with definitions that sometimes seem very ad hoc. This
makes it hard both to analyse properties of existing profunctor optics and to
define new ones. This thesis presents an equivalent representation of
profunctor optics, called isomorphism optics, that is both closer to intuition
and easier to reason about. This tool enables powerful theorems to be derived
generically about profunctor optics. Finally, this thesis develops a framework
to ease deriving new profunctor encodings from concrete optic families.

However, the successful light-weighted models such as Word Mover's Distance

Massive fake health news which is spreading over the Internet, has become a
severe threat to public health. Numerous studies and research works have been
done in fake news detection domain, however, few of them are designed to cope
with the challenges in health news. For instance, the development of
explainable is required for fake health news detection. To mitigate these
problems, we construct a comprehensive repository, FakeHealth, which includes
news contents with rich features, news reviews with detailed explanations,
social engagements and a user-user social network. Moreover, exploratory
analyses are conducted to understand the characteristics of the datasets,
analyze useful patterns and validate the quality of the datasets for health
fake news detection. We also discuss the novel and potential future research
directions for the health fake news detection.

fake news is drawing significant attention from both academic communities and
general public. In this paper, we consider the existence of confounding
variables in the features of fake news and use Propensity Score Matching (PSM)
to select generalizable features in order to reduce the effects of the
confounding variables. Experimental results show that the generalizability of
fake news method is significantly better by using PSM than using raw frequency
to select features. We investigate multiple types of fake news methods
(classifiers) such as logistic regression, random forests, and support vector
machines. We have consistent observations of performance improvement.

trending videos on the platform. Due to its huge amount of users, it enables
researchers to understand people's preference by analyzing the trending videos.
Trending videos vary from country to country. By analyzing such differences and
changes, we can tell how users' preferences differ over locations. Previous
work focuses on analyzing such culture preferences from videos' metadata, while
the culture information hidden within the visual content has not been
discovered. In this study, we explore culture preferences among countries using
the thumbnails of YouTube trending videos. We first process the thumbnail
images of the videos using object detectors. The collected object information
is then used for various statistical analysis. In particular, we examine the
data from three perspectives: geographical locations, video genres and users'
reactions. Experimental results indicate that the users from similar cultures
shares interests in watching similar videos on YouTube. Our study demonstrates
that discovering the culture preference through the thumbnails can be an
effective mechanism for video social media analysis.

Dynamic Linear Models. Whereas usual time-series clustering methods obtain

dynamically change their cluster memberships over time. In this context, a
mixture model is assumed for the time series and a flexible Dirichlet evolution
for mixture weights allows for smooth membership changes over time. Posterior
estimates and predictions can be obtained through Gibbs sampling, but a more
efficient method for obtaining point estimates is presented, based on
Stochastic Expectation-Maximization and Gradient Descent. Finally, two
applications illustrate the usefulness of our proposed model to model both
univariate and multivariate time-series: World Bank indicators for the
renewable energy consumption of EU nations and the famous Gapminder dataset
containing life-expectancy and GDP per capita for various countries.

Gelfand-Kirillov Conjecture for rational Cherednik algebras in the
'quasi-classical limit'. In the second half of the paper, an abstract framework

monitoring functions. The test platform is based on a driving simulator
developed at the DFKI, consisting of a realistic in-cabin mock-up and a
wide-angle projection system for a realistic driving experience. The platform
has been equipped with a wide-angle 2D/3D camera system monitoring the entire
interior of the vehicle mock-up of the simulator. It is also supplemented with
a ground truth reference sensor system that allows to track and record the
occupant's body movements synchronously with the 2D and 3D video streams of the
camera. Thus, the resulting test platform will serve as a basis to validate
numerous in-cabin monitoring functions, which are important for the realization
of novel human-vehicle interfaces, advanced driver assistant systems, and
automated driving. Among the considered functions are occupant presence
detection, size and 3D-pose estimation and driver intention recognition. In
addition, our platform will be the basis for the creation of large-scale
in-cabin benchmark datasets.

as a way to improve performance. In visual localization, multi-sensor fusion,
multi-process fusion of a single sensing modality, and even combinations of
different localization techniques have been shown to result in improved
performance. However, merely fusing together different localization techniques
does not account for the varying performance characteristics of different
localization techniques. In this paper we present a novel, hierarchical
localization system that explicitly benefits from three varying characteristics
of localization techniques: the distribution of their localization hypotheses,
their appearance- and viewpoint-invariant properties, and the resulting
differences in where in an environment each system works well and fails. We
show how two techniques deployed hierarchically work better than in parallel
fusion, how combining two different techniques works better than two levels of
a single technique, even when the single technique has superior individual
performance, and develop two and three-tier hierarchical structures that
progressively improve localization performance. Finally, we develop a stacked
hierarchical framework where localization hypotheses from techniques with
complementary characteristics are concatenated at each layer, significantly
improving retention of the correct hypothesis through to the final localization
stage. Using two challenging datasets, we show the proposed system
outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

of information to monitor our planet and its climate variability. Uncovering
the main modes of spatial and temporal variability in Earth data is essential
to analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics and processes
driving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with
spatio-temporal datasets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), also known as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) in
geophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze climatic data. However, when
nonlinear feature relations are present, PCA/EOF fails. In this work, we
propose a nonlinear PCA method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth System data.
The proposed method, called Rotated Complex Kernel PCA (ROCK-PCA for short),
works in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes,
operates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space and time
features, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an
explicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The
method is unsupervised and computationally very efficient.We illustrate its
ability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns using synthetic experiments and
real data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate variables
are shown: satellite-based global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Soil
Moisture (SM), and reanalysis Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The ROCK-PCA
method allows identifying their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as
their non-seasonal trends and spatial variability patterns.
