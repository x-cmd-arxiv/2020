Einstein's field equations: the Bianchi Type A models, and show that they can
be written as a continuous-time recurrent neural network (CTRNN). This
reformulation of Einstein's equations allows one to write potentially
complicated nonlinear equations as a simpler dynamical system consisting of
linear combinations of the neural network weights and logistic sigmoid
activation functions. The CTRNN itself is trained by using an explicit
Runge-Kutta solver to sample a number of solutions of Einstein's equations for
the Bianchi Type A models and then using a nonlinear least-squares approach to
find the optimal set of weights, time delay constants, and bias parameters that
provide the best fit of the CTRNN equations to the Einstein equations. In terms
of numerical examples, we specifically provide solutions to Bianchi Type I and
II models. We conclude the paper with some comments on optimal parameter
probability distributions and ideas for future work.

  crop yield: maize in the US",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.data-an","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  We apply an empirical, data-driven approach for describing crop yield as a
function of monthly temperature and precipitation by employing generative
probabilistic models with parameters determined through Bayesian inference. Our
approach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the
US Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily
transferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with
a number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a
two-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly
contributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for
non-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and
allows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that
temperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six
months prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for
US maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean
temperature 18-19$^\circ$C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of
24-25$^\circ$C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total
precipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of
investigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the
absence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a
temperature increase of $2^\circ$C, relative to 1981-2014, results in the mean
yield decreasing by 8\%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of
around 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the
impacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally
significant crops based on their observed behaviour. In concert with other
approaches, this can help inform the development of adaptation strategies that
will ensure food security under a changing climate.

atmospheres and additionally provide useful insights on the effects of
granulation and stellar activity on radial velocity measurements. Most high
resolution solar atlases contain telluric lines that span the optical and limit
the spectral regions useful for analysis. We present here a telluric-corrected
solar atlas covering 0.5-1.0 micron derived from solar spectra taken with a
Fourier Transform Spectrograph (FTS) at the Institut f\""ur Astrophysik,
G\""ottingen. This atlas is the highest resolution spectrum with a wavelength
calibration precise to +/-10 m/s across this 500 nm spectral window. We find
that the atlas matches to within 3% of the telluric-corrected Kitt Peak atlas
in regions containing telluric absorption weaker than 50% in transmission. The
telluric component of the spectral data is fit with a semi-empirical model
composed of Lorentz profiles initialized to the HITRAN parameters for each
absorption feature. Comparisons between the best-fit telluric parameters
describing the Lorentz profile for each absorption feature to the original
HITRAN values in general show excellent agreement considering the effects
atmospheric pressure and temperature have on our final parameters. However, we
identify a small subset of absorption features with larger offsets relative to
the catalogued line parameters. We make our final solar atlas available online.
We additionally make available the telluric spectra extracted from the data
that, given the high resolution of the spectrum, would be useful for studying
the time evolution of telluric line shapes and their impact on Doppler
measurements.

baryonic density region (characterized by a chemical potential $\mu$) in the
presence of a strong magnetic field. We consider in particular, the so-called
Magnetic Dual Chiral Density Wave (MDCDW) phase, which is materialized by an
inhomogeneous condensate formed by a particle-hole pair. It is shown, that the
MDCDW phase is more stable in the weak-coupling regime than the one considered
in the magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry braking phenomenon (MC$\chi$SB)
and even than the chiral symmetric phase that was expected to be realized at
sufficiently high baryonic chemical potential. The different components of the
photon polarization operator of the MDCDW phase in the one-loop approximation
are calculated. We found that in the MDCDW phase there is no Debye screening
neither Meissner effect in the lowest-Landau-level approximation. The obtained
Debye length depends on the amplitude $m$ and modulation $b$ of the
inhomogeneous condensate and it is only different from zero if the relation $|
\mu -b| > m$ holds. But, we found that in the region of interest this
inequality is not satisfied. Thus, no Debye screening takes place under those
conditions. On the other hand, since the particle-hole condensate is
electrically neutral, the U(1) electromagnetic group is not broken by the
ground state and consequently there is no Meissner effect. These results can be
of interest for the astrophysics of neutron stars.

and used. Networks represent powerful models for exploring such cognitive
system, known as mental lexicon. This study investigates lexicon robustness to
progressive word failure with multiplex network attacks. The average lexicon of
an adult English speaker is built by considering 16000 words connected through
semantic free associations and phonological sound similarities. Progressive
structural degradation is modelled as random and targeted attacks. Words with
higher psycholinguistic features (e.g. frequency, length, age of acquisition,
polysemy) or network centrality (e.g. closeness, PageRank, betweenness and
degree) are targeted first. Aphasia-inspired attacks are introduced here and
target first words named correctly, more or less frequently, by patients with
anomic aphasia, a pathology disrupting word finding. Robustness is measured as
connectedness, fundamental for activation spreading and lexical retrieval, and
viability, a multi-layer connectivity identifying language kernels. The lexicon
is resilient to random, aphasia-inspired and psycholinguistic attacks.
Catastrophic phase transitions happen when phonological and semantic degrees
are combined, making the lexicon fragile to multidegree attacks. The viable
kernel is fragile to multi-PageRank and to aphasia-inspired attacks.
Consequently, connectedness in the lexicon is mediated by hubs, whereas
viability enables a lexical semantic/phonological interplay and corresponds to
a facilitative naming effect in aphasia. These effects persist also through
ageing, in different network representations of younger and older lexicons.
This study indicates the need to prevent failure of high multidegree and viable
words in the mental lexicon when pursuing the design of effective language
restoration strategies against cognitive impairing.

average degree $\zeta$ are superimposed.
  In the case $d=1$, for $\zeta$ small the shifted Kesten-McKay DOS with
parameter $Z$ is a mean-field solution for the DOS. Numerical simulations in
the $z_0=2$ model, which is the $k=1$ Newman-Watts small-world model, and in
the $z_0=3$ model lead us to conjecture that for $\zeta \to 0$ the cumulative
function of the DOS converges uniformly to that of the shifted Kesten-McKay
DOS, in an interval $[0, \omega_0]$, with $\omega_0 < \sqrt{z_0-1} + 1$.
  For $2 \le d \le 4$, we introduce a cutoff parameter $K_d \le 0.5$ modeling
sphere repulsion. The case $K_d=0$ is the random elastic network case, with the
DOS close to the Marchenko-Pastur DOS with parameter $t=\frac{Z}{d}$. For $K_d$
large the DOS is close for small $\omega$ to the shifted Kesten-McKay DOS with
parameter $t=\frac{Z}{d}$; in the isostatic case the DOS has around $\omega=0$

the breakdown of the correlated insulating state in an archetypal undoped
cuprate. We identify signatures of electron-phonon coupling to specific
fully-symmetric optical modes during the build-up of a three-dimensional
metallic state that follows charge photodoping. Calculations for coherently
displaced crystal structures along the relevant phonon coordinates indicate
that the insulating state is remarkably unstable toward metallization despite

each SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The
coadds reach limiting magnitudes of order $\sim 27$ in $g$-band, and have a
much smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates,

cover images captured at ISO sensitivity $ISO_{1}$ and generates stego images

signal to the cover that mimics the sensor photonic noise. This paper proposes
an embedding mechanism to perform NS in the JPEG domain after linear
developments by explicitly computing the correlations between DCT coefficients
before quantization. In order to compute the covariance matrix of the photonic
noise in the DCT domain, we first develop the matrix representation of
demosaicking, luminance averaging, pixel section, and 2D-DCT. A detailed
analysis of the resulting covariance matrix is done in order to explain the
origins of the correlations between the coefficients of $3\times3$ DCT blocks.
An embedding scheme is then presented that takes in order to take into account
all the correlations. It employs 4 sub-lattices and 64 lattices per
sub-lattices. The modification probabilities of each DCT coefficient are then
derived by computing conditional probabilities from the multivariate Gaussian
distribution using the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. This
derivation is also used to compute the embedding capacity of each image. Using
a specific database called E1 Base, we show that in the JPEG domain NS
(J-Cov-NS) enables to achieve high capacity (more than 2 bits per non-zero AC
DCT) and with high practical security ($P_{\mathrm{E}}\simeq40\%$ using DCTR

use in a near-field thermophotovoltaic (NF-TPV) device consisting of
millimeter-size surfaces separated by a nanosize vacuum gap. The device
operates with a doped silicon radiator maintained at a temperature of 800 K.
The architecture of the photovoltaic cell, including the emitter and base
thicknesses, the doping level of the base, and the front contact grid
parameters, are optimized for maximizing NF-TPV power output. This is
accomplished by solving radiation and charge transport in the cell via
fluctuational electrodynamics and the minority charge carrier continuity
equations, in addition to accounting for the shading losses due to the front
contacts and additional series resistance losses introduced by the front
contacts and the substrate. The results reveal that these additional loss
mechanisms negatively affect NF-TPV performance in a non-negligible manner, and
that the maximum power output is a trade-off between shading losses and series
resistance losses introduced by the front contacts. For instance, when the cell
is optimized for a 1 x 1 mm2 device operating at a vacuum gap of 100 nm, the
losses introduced by the front contacts reduce the maximum power output by a
factor of ~ 2.5 compared to the idealized case when no front contact grid is
present. If the optimized grid for the 1 x 1 mm2 device is scaled up for a 5 x
5 mm2 device, the maximum power output is only increased by a factor of ~ 1.08
with respect to the 1 x 1 mm2 case despite an increase of the surface area by a
factor of 25. This work demonstrates that the photovoltaic cell in a NF-TPV
device must be designed not only for a specific radiator temperature, but also
for specific gap thickness and device surface area.

biocompatible temperature sensors as well as the lack of practical methods to

demonstrate a method to probe and control the cell division timing in

nanoscale thermometry. Local infrared laser illumination produces a temperature
gradient across the embryo, which is precisely measured by in-vivo nanoscale
thermometry using quantum defects in nanodiamonds. These techniques enable
selective, controlled acceleration of the cell divisions, even enabling an
inversion of division order at the two cell stage. Our data suggest that the
cell cycle timing asynchrony of the early embryonic development in C. elegans
is determined independently by individual cells rather than via cell-to-cell
communication. Our method can be used to control the development of
multicellular organisms and to provide insights into the regulation of cell

\cite{Attiya:1995}, a set of processes has to decide on a chain of a lattice.
More precisely, each correct process proposes an element $e$ of a certain
join-semi lattice $L$ and it has to decide on a value that contains $e$.
Moreover, any pair $p_i,p_j$ of correct processes has to decide two values
$dec_i$ and $dec_j$ that are comparable (e.g., $dec_i \leq dec_j$ or $dec_j <
dec_i$). LA has been studied for its practical applications, as example it can
be used to implement a snapshot objects \cite{Attiya:1995} or a replicated
state machine with commutative operations \cite{Faleiro:2012}. Interestingly,
the study of the Byzantine Lattice Agreement started only recently, and it has
been mainly devoted to asynchronous systems. The synchronous case has been
object of a recent pre-print \cite{Zheng:aa} where Zheng et al. propose an
algorithm terminating in ${\cal O}(\sqrt f)$ rounds and tolerating $f < \lceil
n/3 \rceil$ Byzantine processes.
  In this paper we present new contributions for the synchronous case. We
investigate the problem in the usual message passing model for a system of $n$
processes with distinct unique IDs. We first prove that, when only
authenticated channels are available, the problem cannot be solved if $f=n/3$
or more processes are Byzantine. We then propose a novel algorithm that works
in a synchronous system model with signatures (i.e., the {\em authenticated
message} model), tolerates up to $f$ byzantine failures (where $f<n/3$) and
that terminates in ${\cal O}(\log f)$ rounds. We discuss how to remove
authenticated messages at the price of algorithm resiliency ($f < n/4$).
Finally, we present a transformer that converts any synchronous LA algorithm to
an algorithm for synchronous Generalised Lattice Agreement.

tree-level, but the Higgs doublets get large negative soft supersymmetry (SUSY)
breaking masses squared $m_{H_u}^2 \simeq m_{H_d}^2 < 0$ at a certain energy
scale, $M_{\rm inp}$. The sfermion masses are radiatively generated by anomaly
mediation and Higgs-loop effects, and gaugino masses are solely determined by
anomaly mediation. Consequently, the smuons and bino are light enough to
explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly while the third generation sfermions are heavy
enough to explain the observed Higgs boson mass. The scenario avoids the SUSY
flavor problem as well as various cosmological problems, and is consistent with
the radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. In this paper, we show that,
although the muon $g-2$ explanation in originally proposed Higgs-anomaly
mediation with $M_{\rm inp}\sim 10^{16}\,$GeV is slightly disfavored by the
latest LHC data, the muon $g-2$ can still be explained at $1\sigma$ level when
Higgs mediation becomes important at the intermediate scale, $M_{\rm inp} \sim
10^{12}\,$GeV. The scenario predicts light SUSY particles that can be fully
covered by the LHC and future collider experiments. We also provide a simple
realization of $m_{H_u}^2 \simeq m_{H_d}^2 < 0$ at the intermediate scale.

high-energy physics, particularly in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence,
we explore the information geometry associated to a variety of simple systems.
By studying their Fisher metrics, we derive some general lessons that may have
important implications for the application of information geometry in
holography. We begin by demonstrating that the symmetries of the physical
theory under study play a strong role in the resulting geometry, and that the
appearance of an AdS metric is a relatively general feature. We then
investigate what information the Fisher metric retains about the physics of the
underlying theory by studying the geometry for both the classical 2d Ising
model and the corresponding 1d free fermion theory, and find that the curvature
diverges precisely at the phase transition on both sides. We discuss the
differences that result from placing a metric on the space of theories vs.
states, using the example of coherent free fermion states. We compare the
latter to the metric on the space of coherent free boson states and show that
in both cases the metric is determined by the symmetries of the corresponding
density matrix. We also clarify some misconceptions in the literature
pertaining to different notions of flatness associated to metric and non-metric
connections, with implications for how one interprets the curvature of the
geometry. Our results indicate that in general, caution is needed when
connecting the AdS geometry arising from certain models with the AdS/CFT
correspondence, and seek to provide a useful collection of guidelines for
future progress in this exciting area.

carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars is a tedious task that, owing to the
large number of line blends, often leads to uncertainties on [Fe/H] exceeding
0.25dex. The CEMP stars increase in number with decreasing [Fe/H] and some of
these are known to be bona fide second generation halo stars. Hence, knowing
their [Fe/H] is important for tracing the formation and chemical evolution of
the Galaxy. Here, we aim to improve the [Fe/H] measurements in low-resolution
spectra by avoiding issues related to blends. We improve our chemical tagging
in such spectra at low metallicities. We developed an empirical way of deriving
[Fe/H] in CEMP (and C-normal) stars that relates the equivalent width (EW) of
strong lines, which remain detectable in lower-resolution, metal-poor spectra.
The best [Fe/H] tracers are found to be Cr I and Ni I, which both show strong
transitions in spectral regions that are free of molecular bands (between
~5200-6800A, a region accessible to most surveys). We derive different
relations for dwarfs and giants. The relations are valid in the ranges
~-3<[Fe/H]<-0.5 and 10<EW<800mA (Cr) or [Fe/H]>-3.2 and EW>5mA (Ni), depending
on the element and line as well as the stellar evolutionary stage. The
empirical relations are valid for both CEMP and C-normal stars and have been
proven to be accurate tracers in a sample of ~400 stars (mainly giants). The
metallicities are accurate to within ~0.2 depending on the sample and
resolution, and the empirical relations are robust to within 0.05-0.1dex. Our
relations will improve the metallicity determination in future surveys, which
will encounter a large number of CEMP stars, and will greatly speed up the
process of determining [Fe/H] as the EWs only need to be measured in two or
three lines in relatively clean regions compared to dealing with numerous
blended Fe lines. Abrigded.

experience a major merger per Gyr. Our model predicts galaxy merger rates that
do not scale as a power-law with redshift when selected by descendant stellar
mass, and exhibit a clear stellar mass and mass-ratio dependence. Specifically,
major mergers are more frequent at high masses and at low redshift. We show
mergers are significant for the stellar mass growth of galaxies
$\log_{10}(m_{*}/M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 11.0$. For the most massive galaxies major
mergers dominate the accreted mass fraction, contributing as much as $90$ per

a direct result of the stellar-to-halo mass relation, which results in massive
galaxies having a higher likelihood of experiencing major mergers than low mass

observations, exhibiting a form best described by a power-law exponential

magnetars born in superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or long-duration gamma-ray

offset from the centers of dwarf galaxies may serve as signposts for at least

these cannot be explained by emission from HII regions, normal supernova

accreting wandering massive black holes. Here, we explore the alternative
possibility that these sources are analogs of FRB 121102. We compare their
properties -- radio luminosities, spectral energy distributions, light curves,
ratios of radio-to-optical flux, and spatial offsets -- to FRB 121102, a few
other well-localized FRBs, and potentially related systems, and find that these
are all consistent as arising from the same population. We further compare
their properties to the magnetar nebula model used to explain FRB 121102, as
well as to theoretical off-axis LGRB light curves, and find overall
consistency. Finally, we find a consistent occurrence rate relative to

radius has become a very popular choice for characterising galaxy size.
However, the effective radius measures the concentration of light within
galaxies and thus does not capture the intuitive definition of size which is
related to the edge or boundary of objects. For this reason, we aim to
demonstrate the undesirable consequence of using the effective radius to draw
conclusions about the nature of faint 'ultra-diffuse galaxies' (UDGs) when
compared to dwarfs and Milky Way-like galaxies. Instead of the effective
radius, we use a measure of galaxy size based on the location of the gas
density threshold required for star formation. Compared to the effective
radius, this physically motivated definition places the sizes much closer to
the boundary of a galaxy. Therefore, considering the sizes and stellar mass
density profiles of UDGs and regular dwarfs, we find that the UDGs have sizes
that are within the size range of dwarfs. We also show that currently known
UDGs do not have sizes comparable to Milky Way-like objects. We find that, on
average, UDGs are ten times smaller in extension than Milky Way-like galaxies.
These results show that the use of size estimators sensitive to the
concentration of light can lead to misleading results.

recent studies have highlighted several examples of Dirac-like cones in

cannot be directly related to the Dirac or Weyl equations as they are bosonic

properties including conical band touching points and a gap-opening-role for
`mass' terms. The relationship also extends to the band eigenvectors with the
bosonic states carrying the same Berry connections as the parent fermionic
states. The bosonic bands thus inherit topological character as well. If the
parent fermionic system has non-trivial topology that leads to mid-gap surface
states, the bosonic analogue also hosts surface states that lie within the
corresponding band gap. The proposed bosonic Dirac structure appears in several
known models. In materials, it is realized in Ba$_2$CuSi$_2$O$_6$Cl$_2$ and

on the rotational support of quiescent galaxies and find no universal trends at
either fixed mass or fixed stellar velocity dispersion. This is consistent with
previous studies of the local Universe; rotational support of massive galaxies
depends primarily on stellar mass. We highlight two populations of massive
galaxies ($\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq11$) that deviate from the average mass
relation. First, the most massive galaxies in the most under-dense regions
($(1+\delta)\leq1$) exhibit elevated rotational support. Similarly, at the
highest masses ($\log M_\star/M_\odot\geq11.25$) the range in rotational
support is significant in all but the densest regions. This corresponds to an
increasing slow-rotator fraction such that only galaxies in the densest
environments ($(1+\delta)\geq3.5$) are primarily (90$\pm$10\%)
slow-rotators.This effect is not seen at fixed velocity dispersion, suggesting
minor merging as the driving mechanism: only in the densest regions have the
most massive galaxies experienced significant minor merging, building stellar
mass and diminishing rotation without significantly affecting the central
stellar velocity dispersion. In the local Universe, most massive galaxies are
slow-rotators, regardless of environment, suggesting minor merging occurs at

corrections. The new best-fit bolometric quasar luminosity function behaves
qualitatively different from the Hopkins et al. 2007 model at high redshift.
Compared with the old model, the number density normalization decreases towards
higher redshift and the bright-end slope is steeper at $z\gtrsim 2$. Due to the
paucity of measurements at the faint end, the faint end slope at $z\gtrsim 5$
is quite uncertain. We present two models, one featuring a progressively
steeper faint-end slope at higher redshift and the other featuring a shallow
faint-end slope at $z\gtrsim 5$. Further multi-band observations of the
faint-end QLF are needed to distinguish between these models. The evolutionary
pattern of the bolometric QLF can be interpreted as an early phase likely
dominated by the hierarchical assembly of structures and a late phase likely
dominated by the quenching of galaxies. We explore the implications of this
model on the ionizing photon production by quasars, the CXB spectrum, the SMBH
mass density and mass functions. The predicted hydrogen photoionization rate
contributed by quasars is subdominant during the epoch of reionization and only
becomes important at $z\lesssim 3$. The predicted CXB spectrum, cosmic SMBH

significant radial velocity variability in our multi-epoch observations and

discovered to emit at high energies, but their number is still scarce. The TeV
source HESS J1832-093 has been proposed as a binary candidate, although its
nature is unclear. Neither a GeV counterpart nor a period was found for it.
Aims. The purpose of this work is to search for a gamma-ray source at GeV
energies to understand the origin of the TeV signal. For an unambiguous
identification of its binary nature, finding an orbital modulation is crucial.
Methods. We have analysed data spanning more than 10 years from the Fermi Large
Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), together with Swift archival observations taken
between 2015 and 2018, using both the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and UltraViolet and
Optical Telescope (UVOT). We searched for periodicities in both X-ray and

modulation of \sim 86 days in the X-ray source XMMU J183245-0921539, together
with indications of gamma-ray modulation with a compatible period in 4FGL

interacting stellar winds which may act as particle accelerators. Therefore,

the massive binary Eta Carinae has been firmly associated with a gamma-ray

gamma-ray source, but unambiguous identification remains lacking. Aims.
Observing orbital modulation of the flux would establish an unambiguous
identification of the binary gamma^2 Velorum as the gamma-ray source detected
by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Methods. We have used more than
10 years of observations with Fermi-LAT. Events are folded with the orbital
period of the binary to search for variability. Systematic errors that might
arise from the strong emission of the nearby Vela pulsar are studied by
comparing with a more conservative pulse-gated analysis. Results. Hints of
orbital variability are found, indicating maximum flux from the binary during
apastron passage. Conclusions. Our analysis strengthens the possibility that
gamma-rays are produced in gamma^2 Velorum, most likely as a result of particle
acceleration in the wind collision region. The observed orbital variability is
consistent with predictions from recent MHD simulations, but contrasts with the
orbital variability from Eta Carinae, where the peak of the light curve is

contributions and the related effects of two-electron screening, yields the
result which restores the agreement between theory and experiment and strongly
disagrees with the model-potential Lamb shift values. In the present paper, the
model Lamb shift operator [Shabaev ${\it et \, al.}$, Phys. Rev. A ${\bf 88}$,
012513 (2013)] is used to evaluate the QED effects on the
$^2P_{1/2}-{}^2P_{3/2}$ fine structure in F-like ions. The calculations are
performed by incorporating this operator into the Dirac-Coulomb-Breit equation
employing different methods. It is demonstrated that the methods, based on
including the Lamb shift operator either into the Dirac-Fock equations or into
the calculations by perturbation theory, lead to the theoretical results which
are in good agreement with each other and with experiment. The restriction of
these results to the first order in the QED effects leads to a value which
agrees with the aforementioned ${\it ab\, initio}$ QED result.

MCA-1B showed an almost four-fold increase in bolometric luminosity and a

shifted to even hotter temperatures, exhibiting a WN7/WN8-type spectrum, and
doubling its wind speed. MCA-1B is reminiscent of some supernova impostors, and

able to accelerate particles to hard power law energy spectra $f \propto

determines the spectral shape is currently a topic of intense investigation. By
means of fully kinetic plasma simulations, we carry out a study of particle
acceleration during magnetic reconnection in the trans-relativistic regime of a
proton-electron plasma. While earlier work in this parameter regime has focused
on the effects of electric field parallel to the local magnetic field on the
particle injection (from thermal energy to the lower energy bound of the
power-law spectrum), here we examine the roles of both parallel and
perpendicular electric fields to gain a more complete understanding on the
injection process and further development of a power-law spectrum. We show that
the parallel electric field does contribute significantly to particle
injection, and is more important in the initial phase of magnetic reconnection.
However, as the simulation proceeds, the acceleration by the perpendicular
electric field becomes more important for particle injection and completely
dominates the acceleration responsible for the high-energy power-law spectrum.
This holds robustly, in particular for longer reconnection times and larger
systems, i.e. in simulations that are more indicative of the processes in
astrophysical sources.

Administration (EIA). Random effect negative binomial regression models are
used to estimate the impact of inflation-adjusted gasoline prices on trends of
transportation fatal crashes. Initial results combined with results of previous
studies showed that gender and transportation mean type (motorcycle,
non-motorcycle, bicycle and pedestrian) play prominent roles in interpreting
the final model, so by using random effect negative binomial regression, seven
models are developed to evaluate the effects of gasoline price changes on total
population, male, female, motorcyclists, non-motorcyclists, bicyclists and
pedestrians separately. Our findings suggest that increasing the gasoline
prices will not significantly alter the number of total fatal crashes. However,
by looking at different vehicle types, it is estimated that one dollar increase
in adjusted gasoline price is associated with 24.2% increase in the number of
motorcycle fatal crashes, 1.9% decrease in the number of non-motorcycle fatal
crashes, and 0.7% decrease in the number of pedestrian fatal crashes. Also,
there is no noticeable difference between male and female in response to the
gasoline price changes.

analyses of the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT) are important to

Among the SMEFT operators that can be constrained via various measurements, the
dimension six triple gluon operator involves neither the Higgs boson nor the
top quark, yet its variation can have measurable effects on top and Higgs
production. Without independent constraints on its impact, the sensitivity of
measurements in the top and Higgs sectors to new physics is reduced. We show
that the dijet angular distribution is a powerful observable for probing the
triple gluon operator. We set the most stringent limit on the triple gluon
effective coupling by reinterpreting the results of a search for new phenomena
in dijet events using 35.9 fb$^{-1}$ of pp collision data collected at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the CMS collaboration. The obtained limit on
the strength of the triple gluon operator is far below the sensitivity of that
which can be derived from top quark and Higgs measurements and thus this
operator can be neglected in global SMEFT analyses.

droplet-like compartments, both in vitro and in vivo. A key component of these
droplets are multi-valent proteins that possess several adhesive domains with
specific interaction partners (whose number determines total valency of the
protein) separated by disordered regions. Here, using multi-scale simulations
we show that such proteins self-organize into micro-phase separated droplets of
various sizes as opposed to the Flory-like macro-phase separated equilibrium
state of homopolymers or equilibrium physical gels. We show that the
micro-phase separated state is a dynamic outcome of the interplay between two
competing processes: a diffusion-limited encounter between proteins, and the
dynamics within small clusters that results in exhaustion of available
valencies whereby all specifically interacting domains find their interacting
partners within smaller clusters, leading to arrested phase separation. We
first model these multi-valent chains as bead-spring polymers with multiple
adhesive domains separated by semi-flexible linkers and use Langevin Dynamics
(LD) to assess how key timescales depend on the molecular properties of
associating polymers. Using the time-scales from LD simulations, we develop a
coarse-grained kinetic model to study this phenomenon at longer times.
Consistent with LD simulations, the macro-phase separated state was only
observed at high concentrations and large interaction valencies. Further, in
the regime where cluster sizes approach macro-phase separation, the condensed
phase becomes dynamically solid-like, suggesting that it might no longer be
biologically functional. Therefore, the micro-phase separated state could be a
hallmark of functional droplets formed by proteins with the sticker-spacer
architecture.

contribution of risk groups to overall transmission by projecting the
transmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unmet prevention and
treatment needs within risk groups. However, evidence suggests that STI risk is
dynamic over an individual's sexual life course, which manifests as turnover
between risk groups. We sought to examine the mechanisms by which turnover
influences modelled projections of the tPAF of high risk groups. METHODS. We
developed a unifying, data-guided framework to simulate risk group turnover in
deterministic, compartmental transmission models. We applied the framework to
an illustrative model of an STI and examined the mechanisms by which risk group
turnover influenced equilibrium prevalence across risk groups. We then fit a
model with and without turnover to the same risk-stratified STI prevalence
targets and compared the inferred level of risk heterogeneity and tPAF of the
highest risk group projected by the two models. RESULTS. The influence of
turnover on group-specific prevalence was mediated by three main phenomena:
movement of infectious individuals between risk groups; changes to herd
immunity; and changes in discordant partnerships. Faster turnover led to a
smaller ratio of STI prevalence between the highest and lowest risk groups.
Compared to the fitted model without turnover, the fitted model with turnover
inferred greater risk heterogeneity and consistently projected a larger tPAF of
the highest risk group over time. IMPLICATIONS. If turnover is not captured in
epidemic models, the projected contribution of high risk groups, and thus, the
potential impact of prioritizing interventions to address their needs, could be
underestimated. To aid the next generation of tPAF models, data collection
efforts to parameterize risk group turnover should be prioritized.

$d$ is the distance between the centroid of the points and the center of the

symmetric about the origin and the symmetry group of the point set acts
transitively on the set, the sum of the squared distinct distances between

dense nuclear medium created in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions.
Heavy-flavor transport coefficients in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) stage of
the collisions are particularly interesting, as they contain important
information on the strong interaction at finite temperatures. Studying the
heavy-flavor evolution in a dynamically evolving medium requires a
comprehensive multi-stage modeling approach of both the medium and the probes,
with an accurate implementation of the physical ingredients to be tested. For
this purpose, I have developed a new partonic transport model

quark propagation inside a QGP. The model has an improved implementation of
parton in-medium bremsstrahlung and a flexible treatment of the probe-medium
interactions, combining both large angle scatterings and diffusion processes.
The model is then coupled to a high-energy event-generator, a hydrodynamic
medium evolution and a hadronic transport model. Finally, applying a Bayesian
analysis, I extract the heavy quark transport coefficients from a model-to-data
comparison. The results, with uncertainty quantification, are found to be
consistent with earlier extraction of the light-quark transport coefficients at
high momentum and with first-principle calculations of the heavy flavor
diffusion constant at low momentum.

time-averaged second-order statistics in turbulent channel flow. The
recently-proposed decomposition of the resolvent operator into two distinct

B. J. McKeon, Efficient representation of exact coherent states of the
Navier-Stokes equations using resolvent analysis, Fluid Dynamics Research 51,

components of the energy spectra and the $uv$ cospectrum. The success of the
new representation relies on the ability of the Squire modes to compete with
the vorticity generated by Orr-Sommerfeld modes, which is demonstrated by
decomposing the statistics into contributions from each family. It is then
shown that this competition can be used to infer a phase relationship between
the two sets of modes. Additionally, the relative Reynolds number scalings for
the two families of resolvent weights are derived for the universal classes of
resolvent modes presented by Moarref et al. [R. Moarref, A. S. Sharma, J. A.

  Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) is a powerful and practical
approach for learning sequential decision-making policies. Different from
Reinforcement Learning (RL), GAIL takes advantage of demonstration data by
experts (e.g., human), and learns both the policy and reward function of the
unknown environment. Despite the significant empirical progresses, the theory
behind GAIL is still largely unknown. The major difficulty comes from the
underlying temporal dependency of the demonstration data and the minimax
computational formulation of GAIL without convex-concave structure. To bridge
such a gap between theory and practice, this paper investigates the theoretical
properties of GAIL. Specifically, we show: (1) For GAIL with general reward
parameterization, the generalization can be guaranteed as long as the class of
the reward functions is properly controlled; (2) For GAIL, where the reward is
parameterized as a reproducing kernel function, GAIL can be efficiently solved
by stochastic first order optimization algorithms, which attain sublinear
convergence to a stationary solution. To the best of our knowledge, these are
the first results on statistical and computational guarantees of imitation
learning with reward/policy function approximation. Numerical experiments are
provided to support our analysis.

3.1). However, the sample mean makes no sense back on $K$, so using $\eta$ we
develop a CLT for the sample Fr\'echet mean (Corollary 4.1). This involves
working on the closed convex hull of the embedded image of $K$. To work in the
easier Hilbert space setting of $L^2(K,\eta)$, we have to modify the metric $d$
to a related metric $d_\eta$. We obtain an $L^2$-CLT for both the sample mean

consider an increasing number of players with a unit weight that participate in
the game with a decreasingly small probability. In this case, the Nash
equilibrium flows converge in total variation towards Poisson random variables
whose expected values are Wardrop equilibria of a different nonatomic game with
suitably-defined costs. The latter can be viewed as symmetric equilibria in a
Poisson game in the sense of Myerson, establishing a plausible connection
between the Wardrop model for routing games and the stochastic fluctuations

function approximations (VFAs) to obtain policies and lower bounds on the
optimal policy cost of discounted-cost Markov decision processes (MDPs).
Formulating an ALP requires (i) basis functions, the linear combination of
which defines the VFA, and (ii) a state-relevance distribution, which
determines the relative importance of different states in the ALP objective for
the purpose of minimizing VFA error. Both these choices are typically
heuristic: basis function selection relies on domain knowledge while the
state-relevance distribution is specified using the frequency of states visited
by a heuristic policy. We propose a self-guided sequence of ALPs that embeds
random basis functions obtained via inexpensive sampling and uses the known VFA
from the previous iteration to guide VFA computation in the current iteration.
Self-guided ALPs mitigate the need for domain knowledge during basis function
selection as well as the impact of the initial choice of the state-relevance
distribution, thus significantly reducing the ALP implementation burden. We
establish high probability error bounds on the VFAs from this sequence and show
that a worst-case measure of policy performance is improved. We find that these
favorable implementation and theoretical properties translate to encouraging
numerical results on perishable inventory control and options pricing
applications, where self-guided ALP policies improve upon policies from
problem-specific methods. More broadly, our research takes a meaningful step
toward application-agnostic policies and bounds for MDPs.

regression discontinuity designs to estimate the impact of institutions on
incomes at international borders, drawing inference from the abrupt
discontinuity in governance at borders, whereas other determinants of income
vary smoothly across borders. I extend this literature by assessing the
importance of sub-national variation in institutional quality at provincial
borders in China. Employing nighttime lights emissions as a proxy for income,
across multiple specifications I find no evidence in favour of an

report their preferences for the brightness of overhead lighting. smartSDH
implements a modified Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism; assuming users are
rational, it incentivizes truthful reporting, implements the socially desirable
outcome, and compensates participants to ensure higher payoffs under smartSDH
when compared with the default outside option(i.e., the option chosen in the
absence of such a mechanism). smartSDH assesses the feasibility of the VCG
mechanism in the context of smart building control and evaluated smartSDH's
effect using metrics such as light level satisfaction, incentive satisfaction,

the mechanism indicate user satisfaction, our experiments indicate quite the
contrary. We found that the participants were significantly less satisfied with
light brightness and incentives determined by the VCG mechanism over time.

success in the context of catching the first event of flare-active periods, and
conversely, of correctly predicting declining flare activity. We demonstrate
these evaluation methods graphically and quantitatively as they provide both
quick comparative evaluations and options for detailed analysis. For the
testing interval 2016-2017, we determine the relative frequency distribution of
two-day dichotomous forecast outcomes for three different event histories
(i.e., event/event, no-event/event and event/no-event), and use it to highlight
performance differences between forecasting methods. A trend is identified
across all forecasting methods that a high/low forecast probability on day-1
remains high/low on day-2 even though flaring activity is transitioning. For
M-class and larger flares, we find that explicitly including persistence or
prior flare history in computing forecasts helps to improve overall forecast
performance. It is also found that using magnetic/modern data leads to
improvement in catching the first-event/first-no-event transitions. Finally,
15% of major (i.e., M-class or above) flare days over the testing interval were
effectively missed due to a lack of observations from instruments away from the

the peak [CII] emission does not agree with the peak [OIII] emission,
suggesting that the lines originate from different conditions in the

limit on the dust spectrum, considering the 137 $\pm$ 26 $\mu$Jy continuum

so-called Internal Covariate Shift (ICS) by attempting to keep the
distributions of layer outputs unchanged. Experiments have shown their
effectiveness on training deep neural networks. However, since only the first
two moments are controlled in these BN techniques, it seems that a weak
constraint is imposed on layer distributions and furthermore whether such
constraint can reduce ICS is unknown. Thus this paper proposes a measure for
ICS by using the Earth Mover (EM) distance and then derives the upper and lower
bounds for the measure to provide a theoretical analysis of BN. The upper bound
has shown that BN techniques can control ICS only for the outputs with low
dimensions and small noise whereas their control is NOT effective in other
cases. This paper also proves that such control is just a bounding of ICS
rather than a reduction of ICS. Meanwhile, the analysis shows that the
high-order moments and noise, which BN cannot control, have great impact on the
lower bound. Based on such analysis, this paper furthermore proposes an
algorithm that unitizes the outputs with an adjustable parameter to further
bound ICS in order to cope with the problems of BN. The upper bound for the
proposed unitization is noise-free and only dominated by the parameter. Thus,
the parameter can be trained to tune the bound and further to control ICS.
Besides, the unitization is embedded into the framework of BN to reduce the
information loss. The experiments show that this proposed algorithm outperforms
existing BN techniques on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets.

full spectral fitting of their optical spectra. Motivated from previous
studies, we separate the small-scale features from the large-scale spectral
shape, by performing a moving average method to both the observed spectrum and
the simple stellar population model spectra. The intrinsic dust-free model
spectrum is then derived by fitting the observed ratio of the small-scale to
large-scale (S/L) components with the S/L ratios of the SSP models. The
selective dust attenuation curve is then determined by comparing the observed
spectrum with the dust-free model spectrum. One important advantage of this
method is that the estimated dust attenuation curve is independent of the shape
of theoretical dust attenuation curves. We have done a series of tests on a set
of mock spectra covering wide ranges of stellar age and metallicity. We show
that our method is able to recover the input dust attenuation curve accurately,
although the accuracy depends slightly on signal-to-noise ratio of the spectra.
We have applied our method to a number of edge-on galaxies with obvious dust
lanes from the ongoing MaNGA survey, deriving their dust attenuation curves and
$E(B-V)$ maps, as well as dust-free images in $g$, $r$, and $i$ bands. These
galaxies show obvious dust lane features in their original images, which
largely disappear after we have corrected the effect of dust attenuation. The
vertical brightness profiles of these galaxies become axis-symmetric and can
well be fitted by a simple model proposed for the disk vertical structure.
Comparing the estimated dust attenuation curve with the three commonly-adopted
model curves, we find that the Calzetti curve provides the best description of
the estimated curves for the inner region of galaxies, while the Milky Way and
SMC curves work better for the outer region.

problems in combinatorial optimization, and graph cuts underlie algorithms
throughout discrete mathematics, theoretical computer science, operations
research, and data science. While graphs are a standard model for pairwise
relationships, hypergraphs provide the flexibility to model multi-way
relationships, and are now a standard model for complex data and systems.
However, when generalizing from graphs to hypergraphs, the notion of a ""cut
hyperedge"" is less clear, as a hyperedge's nodes can be split in several ways.
Here, we develop a framework for hypergraph cuts by considering the problem of
separating two terminal nodes in a hypergraph in a way that minimizes a sum of
penalties at split hyperedges. In our setup, different ways of splitting the
same hyperedge have different penalties, and the penalty is encoded by what we
call a splitting function.
  Our framework opens a rich space on the foundations of hypergraph cuts. We
first identify a natural class of cardinality-based hyperedge splitting
functions that depend only on the number of nodes on each side of the split. In
this case, we show that the general hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problem can be
reduced to a tractable graph $s$-$t$ cut problem if and only if the splitting
functions are submodular. We also identify a wide regime of non-submodular
splitting functions for which the problem is NP-hard. We also analyze
extensions to multiway cuts with at least three terminal nodes and identify a
natural class of splitting functions for which the problem can be reduced in an
approximation-preserving way to the node-weighted multiway cut problem in
graphs, again subject to a submodularity property. Finally, we outline several
open questions on general hypergraph cut problems.

parameters and excited-state level crossings to characterize quantum states and
phase transitions in the $(\alpha,Q)$ plane. For weak $Q$ and sufficiently
slowly decaying Heisenberg interactions (small $\alpha$), the system has a
long-range-ordered antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state, and upon increasing
$\alpha$ there is a continuous transition into a quasi long-range ordered
(QLRO) critical state of the type in the standard Heisenberg chain. For rapidly
decaying long-range interactions, there is transition between QLRO and VBS
ground states of the same kind as in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg
chain. Our most important finding is a direct continuous quantum phase
transition between the AFM and VBS states - a close analogy to the 2D
deconfined quantum-critical point. In previous 1D analogies the ordered phases
both have gapped fractional excitations, and the critical point is a
conventional Luttinger Liquid. In our model the excitations fractionalize upon
transitioning from the AFM state, changing from spin waves to deconfined
spinons. We extract critical exponents at the AFM-VBS transition and use
order-parameter distributions to study emergent symmetries. We find emergent
O($4$) symmetry of the O($3$) AFM and scalar VBS order parameters. Thus, the
order parameter fluctuations exhibit the covariance of a uniaxially deformed
O($4$) sphere (an ""elliptical"" symmetry). This unusual quantum phase transition
does not yet have any known field theory description, and our detailed results
can serve to guide its construction. We discuss possible experimental
realizations.

corresponding mesh model. Since the implicit surface is sufficiently expressive
to retain the edges and details of the complex branches model, we use the

virtual scanner is applied to the sampling of point cloud. Finally, considering
the challenges in skeleton extraction, we introduce different methods to build
four different types of point cloud models. This dataset can be used as

(NISQ) systems and is a fundamental challenge for hardware design. When
multiple instructions are executed in parallel, crosstalk between the
instructions can corrupt the quantum state and lead to incorrect program
execution. Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise
through software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of
hardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize
the affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally
expensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead.
On three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude
reduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to
all-pairs crosstalk measurements. Informed by these characterization, we
develop a scheduler that judiciously serializes high crosstalk instructions
balancing the need to mitigate crosstalk and exponential decoherence errors
from serialization. On real-system runs on three IBMQ systems, our scheduler
improves the error rate of application circuits by up to 5.6x, compared to the
IBM instruction scheduler and offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in
practice.
  In a broader picture, the difficulty of mitigating crosstalk has recently
driven QC vendors to move towards sparser qubit connectivity or disabling
nearby operations entirely in hardware, which can be detrimental to
performance. Our work makes the case for software mitigation of crosstalk
errors.

usually trained based on co-occurrence patterns among words. In doing so,
however, the power of such representations is limited, where the same word
might be functionalized separately under different syntactic relations. To
address this limitation, one solution is to incorporate relational dependencies
of different words into their embeddings. Therefore, in this paper, we propose
a multiplex word embedding model, which can be easily extended according to
various relations among words. As a result, each word has a center embedding to
represent its overall semantics, and several relational embeddings to represent
its relational dependencies. Compared to existing models, our model can
effectively distinguish words with respect to different relations without
introducing unnecessary sparseness. Moreover, to accommodate various relations,
we use a small dimension for relational embeddings and our model is able to
keep their effectiveness. Experiments on selectional preference acquisition and
word similarity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and a
further study of scalability also proves that our embeddings only need 1/20 of
the original embedding size to achieve better performance.

transiting circumbinary planet, Kepler-1661 b, found in the Kepler photometry.
The planet has a period of ~175 days and its orbit precesses with a period of
only 35 years. The precession causes the alignment of the orbital planes to
vary, and the planet is in a transiting configuration only ~7% of the time as
seen from Earth. As with several other Kepler circumbinary planets, Kepler-1661
b orbits close to the stability radius, and is near the (hot) edge of habitable
zone. The planet orbits a single-lined, grazing eclipsing binary, containing a
0.84 M_Sun and 0.26 M_Sun pair of stars in a mildly eccentric (e=0.11),
28.2-day orbit. The system is fairly young, with an estimated age of ~1-3 Gyrs,
and exhibits significant starspot modulations. The grazing-eclipse
configuration means the system is very sensitive to changes in the binary
inclination, which manifests itself as a change in the eclipse depth. The
starspots contaminate the eclipse photometry, but not in the usual way of
inducing spurious eclipse timing variations. Rather, the starspots alter the
normalization of the light curve, and hence the eclipse depths. This can lead
to spurious eclipse depth variations, which are then incorrectly ascribed to
binary orbital precession.

investigate the impact of the environmental changes on the dynamics of temporal

preferential activation mechanism, we numerically show that our model could
successfully reproduce various empirical results by the MSE method in terms of

is an important issue while estimating a pure CMB signal. A component
separation method, if these errors in the input foreground contaminated CMB
maps are not properly taken into account, may lead to bias in the cleaned CMB
map and estimated CMB angular power spectrum. But the inability to exactly
determine the calibration coefficients corresponding to each observed CMB map
from any CMB experiment makes it very difficult to incorporate their exact and
actual values in a component separation analysis. Hence the effect of any
random and residual calibration error on the cleaned CMB map and its angular
power spectrum of a component separation problem can only be understood by
performing detailed Monte Carlo simulations. In this paper, we investigate the
impact of using input foreground contaminated CMB maps with random calibration
errors on posterior density of cleaned CMB map and theoretical CMB angular
power spectrum over large angular scales of the sky following the Gibbs ILC
method proposed by \cite{Sudevan:2018qyj}. By performing detailed Monte Carlo
simulations of WMAP and Planck temperature anisotropy observations with
calibration errors compatible with them we show that the best-fit map
corresponding to posterior maximum is minimally biased in Gibbs ILC method by a
CMB normalization bias and residual foreground bias. The bias in best-fit CMB
angular power spectrum with respect to the case where no calibration error is
present are $\sim 28 \mu K^2$ and $-4.7 \mu K^2$ respectively between $2 \le
\ell \le 15$ and $16 \le \ell \le 32$. The calibration error induced error in
best-fit power spectrum causes an overall $6\%$ increase of the net error when
added in quadrature with the cosmic variance induced error.

source communicates with a destination by hopping information through one layer
of $n$ non-communicating relays that operate in half-duplex. The main focus
consists of investigating the following question: What is the contribution of a
single relay on the approximate capacity of the entire network? In particular,
approximate capacity refers to a quantity that approximates the Shannon
capacity within an additive gap which only depends on $n$, and is independent
of the channel parameters. This paper answers the above question by providing a
fundamental bound on the ratio between the approximate capacity of the
highest-performing single relay and the approximate capacity of the entire
network, for any number $n$. Surprisingly, it is shown that such a ratio
guarantee is $f = 1/(2+2\cos(2\pi/(n+2)))$, that is a sinusoidal function of
$n$, which decreases as $n$ increases. It is also shown that the aforementioned
ratio guarantee is tight, i.e., there exist Gaussian half-duplex diamond
$n$-relay networks, where the highest-performing relay has an approximate
capacity equal to an $f$ fraction of the approximate capacity of the entire

forward-backward asymmetry ${\cal A}_{\rm FB}^b$ in $Z\to b\bar b$ at LEP.
Motivated from the above three anomalies we investigate an extension of the SM
with vector-like quarks (VLQs) associated with the down-quark sector, with the
goal of alleviating the tension among these datasets. We perform global fits of
the model under the constraints coming from the unitarity condition of the
first row of the CKM matrix, the $Z$-pole observables ${\cal A}_{\rm FB}^b$,
$R_b$ and $\Gamma_{\rm had}$, Electro-Weak precision observables $\Delta S$ and
$\Delta T$, $B$-meson observables $B_d^0$-$\overline{B}_d^0$ mixing, $B^+ \to
\pi^+ \ell^+ \ell^-$ and $B^0 \to \mu^+ \mu^-$, and direct searches for VLQs at
the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Our results suggest that adding VLQs to the SM
provides better agreement than the SM.

code ensemble, which is defined by the Bernoulli process. We prove that, under
maximum likelihood (ML) decoding, the proposed ensemble can achieve the
capacity of binary-input output symmetric (BIOS) memoryless channels in terms
of bit error rate (BER). The proof technique reveals a new mechanism, different
from lowering down frame error rate (FER), that the BER can be lowered down by
assigning light codeword vectors to light information vectors. The finite
length performance is analyzed by deriving an upper bound and a lower bound,
both of which are shown to be tight in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
region. To improve the waterfall performance, we construct the systematic
convolutional LDGM (SC-LDGM) codes by a random splitting process. The SC-LDGM
codes are easily configurable in the sense that any rational code rate can be
realized without complex optimization. As a universal construction, the main
advantage of the SC-LDGM codes is their near-capacity performance in the
waterfall region and predictable performance in the error-floor region that can
be lowered down to any target as required by increasing the density of the
uncoupled LDGM codes. Numerical results are also provided to verify our

This culminates into a sufficient condition that is equivalent to a restricted
isometry-type property over rank-1, positive semi-definite matrices, and
amounts to a less stringent requirement on the lifted forward model than those
of prominent low-rank-matrix-recovery methods in the literature. We
characterize the performance limits of our framework in terms of the tightness

types of data measured on the same set of objects. A popular model in
high-dimensional multi-view data analysis is to decompose each view's data
matrix into a low-rank common-source matrix generated by latent factors common
across all data views, a low-rank distinctive-source matrix corresponding to
each view, and an additive noise matrix. We propose a novel decomposition
method for this model, called decomposition-based generalized canonical
correlation analysis (D-GCCA). The D-GCCA rigorously defines the decomposition
on the L2 space of random variables in contrast to the Euclidean dot product
space used by most existing methods, thereby being able to provide the
estimation consistency for the low-rank matrix recovery. Moreover, to well
calibrate common latent factors, we impose a desirable orthogonality constraint
on distinctive latent factors. Existing methods, however, inadequately consider
such orthogonality and may thus suffer from substantial loss of undetected
common-source variation. Our D-GCCA takes one step further than generalized
canonical correlation analysis by separating common and distinctive components
among canonical variables, while enjoying an appealing interpretation from the
perspective of principal component analysis. Furthermore, we propose to use the
variable-level proportion of signal variance explained by common or distinctive
latent factors for selecting the variables most influenced. Consistent
estimators of our D-GCCA method are established with good finite-sample
numerical performance, and have closed-form expressions leading to efficient
computation especially for large-scale data. The superiority of D-GCCA over
state-of-the-art methods is also corroborated in simulations and real-world
data examples.

approach. However powerful, the resulting models tend to be complex, described
by a large number of parameters. In many cases interpretability is preferred
over complexity, making too complex models unfit or undesired. In this work,
the complexity of such models is reduced by retrieving a more structured,
parsimonious model from the data, without exploiting physical knowledge.
Essential to the method is a translation of all multivariate nonlinear
functions, typically found in nonlinear state-space models, into sets of
univariate nonlinear functions. The latter is computed from a tensor
decomposition. It is shown that typically an excess of degrees of freedom are
used in the description of the nonlinear system whereas reduced representations
can be found. The method yields highly structured state-space models where the
nonlinearity is contained in as little as a single univariate function, with
limited loss of performance. Results are illustrated on simulations and

through ingeniously designed pretext tasks without human annotation, has
achieved compelling progress in the past few years. Very recently, SlfSL has
also been identified as a promising solution for semi-supervised learning
(SemSL) since it offers a new paradigm to utilize unlabeled data. This work
further explores this direction by proposing to couple SlfSL with SemSL. Our
insight is that the prediction target in SemSL can be modeled as the latent
factor in the predictor for the SlfSL target. Marginalizing over the latent
factor naturally derives a new formulation which marries the prediction targets
of these two learning processes. By implementing this idea through a
simple-but-effective SlfSL approach -- rotation angle prediction, we create a
new SemSL approach called Conditional Rotation Angle Estimation (CRAE).
Specifically, CRAE is featured by adopting a module which predicts the image
rotation angle conditioned on the candidate image class. Through experimental
evaluation, we show that CRAE achieves superior performance over the other
existing ways of combining SlfSL and SemSL. To further boost CRAE, we propose
two extensions to strengthen the coupling between SemSL target and SlfSL target
in basic CRAE. We show that this leads to an improved CRAE method which can
achieve the state-of-the-art SemSL performance.

However, standard convolution with local receptive fields fails in modeling

practical to characterise their physical state, particularly during episodes of

source by Fermi-LAT in July 2017, we observed S4 0444+63 in order to secure its
identification as a gamma-ray blazar. We conducted observations with the
Medicina and Noto radio telescopes at 5, 8, and 24 GHz for a total of 12 epochs
between 2017 August 1 and 2018 September 22. We carried out the observations
with on-the-fly cross scans and reduced the data with our newly developed
Cross-scan Analysis Pipeline, which we present here in detail for the first
time. We found the source to be in an elevated state of emission at radio
wavelength, compared to historical values, which lasted for several months. The
maximum luminosity was reached on 2018 May 16 at 24 GHz, with
$L_{24}=(1.7\pm0.3)\times10^{27}\ \mathrm{W\,Hz}^{-1}$; the spectral index was
found to evolve from slightly rising to slightly steep. Besides the new
observations, which have proved to be an effective and efficient tool to secure
the identification of the source, additional single dish and very-long-baseline
interferometry data provide further insight on the physics of the source. We
estimate a synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_\mathrm{peak}=10^{12.97}$ Hz and a
Doppler factor in excess of $\delta\sim5.0$, with both quantities playing a
role in the gamma-ray emission from the source.

evaluating the former. However, if we target the full substitution space, full
simulations are infeasible even for all binary combinations. To circumvent such
an exhaustive search, we rely on Bayesian optimization. Actually, by searching
only 4% of all the combinations, our AIMI approach discovered two promising

great structural discrepancy with edge maps, thus failing edge-based models.
Moreover, sketches often demonstrate huge variety among different users,
demanding even higher generalizability and robustness for the editing model to

images using hand-drawn sketch inputs. We present a sketch refinement strategy,
as inspired by the coarse-to-fine drawing process of the artists, which we show
can help our model well adapt to casual and varied sketches without the need
for real sketch training data. Our model further provides a refinement level
control parameter that enables users to flexibly define how ""reliable"" the
input sketch should be considered for the final output, balancing between
sketch faithfulness and output verisimilitude (as the two goals might
contradict if the input sketch is drawn poorly). To achieve the multi-level
refinement, we introduce a style-based module for level conditioning, which
allows adaptive feature representations for different levels in a singe

approach in improving the visual quality and user controllablity of image

to the high computational cost for simulating complex physical models and the
high dimension of the random inputs. In applications of practical interest,
both of these problems are encountered, and standard methods either fail or are
not feasible. To overcome the current limitations, we present a generalized
formulation of a Bayesian multi-fidelity Monte-Carlo (BMFMC) framework that can
exploit lower-fidelity model versions in a small data regime. The goal of our
analysis is an efficient and accurate estimation of the complete probabilistic
response for high-fidelity models. BMFMC circumvents the curse of
dimensionality by learning the relationship between the outputs of a reference
high-fidelity model and potentially several lower-fidelity models. While the
continuous formulation is mathematically exact and independent of the
low-fidelity model's accuracy, we address challenges associated with the small
data regime (i.e., only a small number of 50 to 300 high-fidelity model runs
can be performed). Specifically, we complement the formulation with a set of
informative input features at no extra cost. Despite the inaccurate and noisy
information that some low-fidelity models provide, we demonstrate that accurate
and certifiable estimates for the quantities of interest can be obtained for
uncertainty quantification problems in high stochastic dimensions, with
significantly fewer high-fidelity model runs than state-of-the-art methods for
uncertainty quantification. We illustrate our approach by applying it to
challenging numerical examples such as Navier-Stokes flow simulations and
fluid-structure interaction problems.

the existing HA methods utilized unsupervised approaches, where they only
maximized the correlation between the voxels with the same position in the time

Supervised Hyperalignment (SHA) method to ensure better functional alignment

Further, SHA employs a generalized optimization solution, which generates the
shared space and calculates the mapped features in a single iteration, hence
with optimum time and space complexities for large datasets. Experiments on
multi-subject datasets demonstrate that SHA method achieves up to 19% better
performance for multi-class problems over the state-of-the-art HA algorithms.

Problem (mTSP). In a mTSP, the environment is represented as a graph and the
goal is to find tours (starting and ending at the same depot) for the robots in
order to visit all the vertices with minimum global cost, namely the length of
the longest tour. The mTSP is an NP-hard problem for which several
approximation algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms usually assume
generic environments, but tighter approximation bounds can be reached focusing
on specific environments. In this paper, we address the case of environments
composed of sub-parts, called modules, that can be reached from each other only
through some linking structures. Examples are multi-floor buildings, in which
the modules are the floors and the linking structures are the staircases or the
elevators, and floors of large hotels or hospitals, in which the modules are
the rooms and the linking structures are the corridors. We focus on linear
modular environments, with the modules organized sequentially, presenting an
efficient (with polynomial worst-case time complexity) algorithm that finds a
solution for the mTSP whose cost is within a bounded distance from the cost of
the optimal solution. The main idea of our algorithm is to allocate disjoint

covered by only one robot. We experimentally compare our algorithm against some

different spatial dependency patterns can be jointly modeled with multi-heads

possess outstanding magneto-optical properties such as the largest known
Faraday rotation. These properties are related with the distribution of
magnetic moments on octahedral and tetrahedral sites, the presence of spin gaps
in the density of state and a strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work,
first-principles ab initio calculations are performed to study the structural,
electronic and magnetic properties of BIG using Density Functional Theory with
Hubbard+U (DFT+U) correction including spin-orbit coupling and HSE06 hybrid
functional. We found that the presence of spin gaps in the electronic structure
results from the interplay between exchange and correlation effects and the
crystal field strengths for tetrahedral and octahedral iron sublattices. The
DFT+U treatment tends to close the spin-gaps for larger U due to
over-localization effects, notably in the octahedral site. On the other hand,
the hybrid functional confirms the occurrences of three spin gaps in the iron
states of the conduction band as expected from optical measurements. A strong
exchange splitting at the top of the valence bands associated with a lone-pair
type mixture of O p and Bi s,p states is also obtained. Similar exchange
splitting was not previously observed for other iron based garnets, such as for
yttrium iron garnet. It follows that hole doping, as obtained by Ca
substitution at Bi sites, results in a full spin polarized density at the Fermi
energy. This work helps to shed more light on the theoretical comprehension of
the properties of BIG and opens the route towards the use of advanced Many Body

a dielectric material to generate curvature in response to a uniform electric
field, which would add a new degree of freedom for designing actuators.
Flexoelectricity, a two-way coupling between polarization and strain gradient,
is a good candidate. But its applications are usually limited to the nanoscale
due to its inherent size dependence. Here, an inverse flexoelectret effect in
silicone elastomers is introduced to overcome this limitation. Based on this
idea, a flexing actuator which can generate large curvature at the millimeter
length scale is fabricated and shown to have excellent actuation performance
comparable with current nanoscale flexoelectric actuators. Theoretical analysis
indicates that the new phenomenon originates from the interplay of electrets
and Maxwell stress. This work opens an avenue for applying macroscopic
flexoelectricity in actuators and flexible electronics.

  Clouds in the Andromeda Galaxy","ApJ, in press",,"10.3847/1538-4357/ab68de",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In our local Galactic neighborhood, molecular clouds are best studied using a
combination of dust measurements, to determine robust masses, sizes and
internal structures of the clouds, and molecular-line observations to determine
cloud kinematics and chemistry. We present here the first results of a program
designed to extend such studies to nearby galaxies beyond the Magellanic
Clouds. Utilizing the wideband upgrade of the Submillimeter Array (SMA) at 230
GHz we have obtained the first continuum detections of the thermal dust
emission on sub-GMC scales ($\sim$ 15 pc) within the Andromeda galaxy (M31).
These include the first resolved continuum detections of dust emission from
individual GMCs beyond the Magellanic Clouds. Utilizing a powerful capability
of the SMA, we simultaneously recorded CO(2-1) emission with identical
$(u,\,v)$ coverage, astrometry and calibration, enabling the first measurements
of the CO conversion factor, $\alpha_{\rm\,CO(2-1)}$, toward individual GMCs
across an external galaxy. Our direct measurement yields an average
CO--to--dust mass conversion factor of $\alpha^\prime_{\rm CO-dust} =
0.042\pm0.018$ $M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ for the $J= 2-1$
transition. This value does not appear to vary with galactocentric radius.
Assuming a constant gas-to-dust ratio of 136, the resulting $\alpha_{\rm CO}$
$=$ 5.7 $\pm$ 2.4 $M_\odot$ (K km s$^{-1}$ pc$^2$)$^{-1}$ for the 2-1
transition is in excellent agreement with that of Milky Way GMCs, given the
uncertainties. Finally, using the same analysis techniques, we compare our
results with observations of the local Orion molecular clouds, placed at the
distance of M31 and simulated to appear as they would if observed by the SMA.

coding techniques in the era of big data. However, the signal fidelity-driven
coding pipeline design limits the capability of the existing image/video coding
frameworks to fulfill the needs of both machine and human vision. In this
paper, we come up with a novel image coding framework by leveraging both the
compressive and the generative models, to support machine vision and human
perception tasks jointly. Given an input image, the feature analysis is first
applied, and then the generative model is employed to perform image
reconstruction with features and additional reference pixels, in which compact
edge maps are extracted in this work to connect both kinds of vision in a
scalable way. The compact edge map serves as the basic layer for machine vision
tasks, and the reference pixels act as a sort of enhanced layer to guarantee
signal fidelity for human vision. By introducing advanced generative models, we
train a flexible network to reconstruct images from compact feature
representations and the reference pixels. Experimental results demonstrate the
superiority of our framework in both human visual quality and facial landmark
detection, which provide useful evidence on the emerging standardization
efforts on MPEG VCM (Video Coding for Machine).

Loop Quantum Cosmology. We use a perturbative treatment with respect to the
model without a cosmological constant, which is exactly solvable. Our solution
is approximate, but it is precisely valid at the high curvature regime where
quantum gravity corrections are important. We compute explicitly the evolution
of the expectation value of the volume. For semiclassical states characterized
by a Gaussian spectral profile, the introduction of a positive cosmological
constant displaces the bounce of the solvable model to lower volumes and to
higher values of the scalar field. These displacements are state dependent, and
in particular, they depend on the peak of the Gaussian profile, which measures
the momentum of the scalar field. Moreover, for those semiclassical states, the
bounce remains symmetric, as in the vanishing cosmological constant case.
However, we show that the behavior of the volume is more intricate for generic
states, leading in general to a non-symmetric bounce.

harmonic generation. The total energy cutoff of the high-order harmonic
spectrum increases as a function of concentration of vacancy defects, and the
total spectrum gradually turns into a single slanted spectrum without having an
abrupt transition between primary and secondary plateaus. The spectral
intensity of the below-band-gap harmonics in a solid with vacancy defects is
enhanced significantly in comparison to the harmonics in a pristine solid. The
changes in the harmonic spectra are understood in terms of their effective band
structures. The presence of vacancy defects breaks the translational symmetry
of the unit cell locally. As a consequence of this, new defect states appear,
which open additional paths for the electron dynamics. The ill-resolved
electron trajectories in the Gabor profile confirm the interference of
additional paths. Moreover, the single slanted high-order harmonic spectrum
carries a unique signature of vacancy defects in comparison to the high-order
harmonic spectrum corresponding to solids with defects such as underdoping or
overdoping.

memorize random dynamical firing patterns by a simple local learning rule. Two
modes of learning/memorization are considered: The first mode is strictly
online, with a single pass through the data, while the second mode uses
multiple passes through the data. In both modes, the learning is strictly local
(quasi-Hebbian): At any given time step, only the weights between the neurons
firing (or supposed to be firing) at the previous time step and those firing
(or supposed to be firing) at the present time step are modified. The main
result of the paper is an upper bound on the probability that the single-pass
memorization is not perfect. It follows that the memorization capacity in this
mode asymptotically scales like that of the classical Hopfield model (which, in
contrast, memorizes static patterns). However, multiple-rounds memorization is
shown to achieve a higher capacity (with a nonvanishing number of bits per
connection/synapse). These mathematical findings may be helpful for
understanding the functions of short-term memory and long-term memory in

spaceborne SAR satellites, such as TerraSAR-X or COSMO-Skymed, provide 3D
reconstruction and the measurement of ground displacement over large urban
areas. Conventional method such as Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI)
usually requires a fairly large SAR image stack (usually in the order of tens),
in order to achieve reliable estimates of these parameters. Recently, low rank
property in multipass InSAR data stack was explored and investigated in our
previous work. By exploiting this low rank prior, more accurate estimation of
the geophysical parameters can be achieved, which in turn can effectively
reduce the number of interferograms required for a reliable estimation. Based
on that, this paper proposes a novel tensor decomposition method in complex
domain, which jointly exploits low rank and variational prior of the
interferometric phase in InSAR data stacks. Specifically, a total variation
(TV) regularized robust low rank tensor decomposition method is exploited for
recovering outlier-free InSAR stacks. We demonstrate that the filtered InSAR
data stacks can greatly improve the accuracy of geophysical parameters
estimated from real data. Moreover, this paper demonstrates for the first time
in the community that tensor-decomposition-based methods can be beneficial for
large-scale urban mapping problems using multipass InSAR. Two TerraSAR-X data
stacks with large spatial areas demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed method.

different colors. We have collected 111 years of sunspot drawing spanning over
10 solar cycles. These sunspot drawings were carefully stitched to make bound

of known network topology, correlated path measurements, bounded number of
faulty nodes/links, or even special network protocol support. The applicability
of network tomography is considerably constrained by these strong assumptions,
which therefore frequently position it in the theoretical world. In this
regard, we revisit network tomography from the practical perspective by
establishing a generic framework that does not rely on any of these assumptions

metrics of sampled node pairs, the proposed framework, NeuTomography, utilizes
deep neural network and data augmentation to predict the unmeasured performance
metrics via learning non-linear relationships between node pairs and underlying
unknown topological/routing properties. In addition, NeuTomography can be
employed to reconstruct the original network topology, which is critical to
most network planning tasks. Extensive experiments using real network data show
that comparing to baseline solutions, NeuTomography can predict network

Drawing on previous research conducted on neural context-dependent dt-mistake
correction models (Heyman et al. 2018), this study constructs the first neural
network model for Dutch demonstrative and relative pronoun resolution that
specifically focuses on the correction and part-of-speech prediction of these

respectively, the Dutch Europarl corpus (Koehn 2015) - which contains the
proceedings of the European Parliament from 1996 to the present - and the SoNaR
corpus (Oostdijk et al. 2013) - which contains Dutch texts from a variety of
domains such as newspapers, blogs and legal texts. Firstly, a binary
classification model solely predicts the correct 'die' or 'dat'. The classifier
with a bidirectional long short-term memory architecture achieves 84.56%
accuracy. Secondly, a multitask classification model simultaneously predicts
the correct 'die' or 'dat' and its part-of-speech tag. The model containing a
combination of a sentence and context encoder with both a bidirectional long
short-term memory architecture results in 88.63% accuracy for die/dat
prediction and 87.73% accuracy for part-of-speech prediction. More
evenly-balanced data, larger word embeddings, an extra bidirectional long
short-term memory layer and integrated part-of-speech knowledge positively
affects die/dat prediction performance, while a context encoder architecture
raises part-of-speech prediction performance. This study shows promising
results and can serve as a starting point for future research on machine

optically classified with the Palomar data as not presenting a broad component
in the Balmer emission lines associated to the Broad Line Region (BLR) of the
Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We unveil the presence of different kinematic
components of emission lines in the nuclear region of a sample of local
(z$\leq$0.022) type-2 LINERs. We focus on the analysis of their true nature by
means of the detection (or not) of a broad component originated in the BLR.
Additionally, we search for the possible presence of non-rotational motions
such as outflows. We have applied a decomposition of the nuclear emission lines
using a spectroscopic analysis of the optical spectra of 9 type-2 LINERs of
intermediate-resolution data retrieved from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
archive. The study is completed with archival spectra from the Double
Spectrograph from the Palomar Observatory. The emission line fitting reveals
the presence of a broad component associated to the BLR in 6 out of the 9
galaxies for the space-based data, and for 2 out of the 8 from the ground-based
spectra. The velocity dispersion of two galaxies (NGC 4486 and NGC 4594)
measured in HST/STIS data suggest the presence of outflows. The results
indicate that the spatial resolution plays a major role in the detection of the
BLR, as it appears diluted in the ground-based data (even after removing
stellar contribution). This is also true for the emission line diagnostics, as
the contaminant light contributes to lower emission line ratios towards the
star-forming area of standard BPTs. We propose to reclassify NGC4594 as a
type-1 LINER, since a BLR component is seen in both space- and ground-based
spectra. We find ambiguous results for the BLR component of NGC 4486. The
modest outflow detection in our sample may indicate that they are not as
frequent as for type-1 LINERs.

block codes using the minimal weight codewords of the dual code. The decoding
schemes will be described for cyclic codes where polynomials can be used,
however, the modification for non-cyclic codes is possible and straight
forward. The hard decision decoding calculates syndrome polynomials which are
the product of the received polynomial with dual codewords. Proper cyclic
shifts of these syndrome polynomials are obtained and the non-zero positions
are counted componentwise for these shifts. The values of this counting are a
reliability measure and can be used for locating the error and also the
non-error positions. This reliability measure is the basis for various variants
of hard decision decoding algorithms. Decoding schemes with iterative error
reduction are possible as well as information set decoding using the inherent
reliability information of the measure even if there is no reliability
information from the channel. Further, we will show how reliability information
from the channel can be included in order to obtain soft decision decoding
schemes. We derive the relation between bit flipping, believe propagation, and
majority logic decoding to the novel schemes. As examples to illustrate the
functioning we use BCH and Reed-Muller codes as examples for binary codes, and
RS codes for non-binary codes. Besides the Plotkin construction we recall a
known result that Reed-Muller codes punctured by one position are cyclic and
thus, are equivalent to special cases of BCH codes. Simulation results for hard
and soft decision decoding will be given for several examples and compared with
results from literature. Finally, we analyze the soft decision decoding of the
Plotkin construction and derive that one of the two codes uses a $3$ dB better
channel (also known as channel polarization).

  Optimization",,,,,"cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Surrogate-based optimization relies on so-called infill criteria (acquisition
functions) to decide which point to evaluate next. When Kriging is used as the
surrogate model of choice (also called Bayesian optimization), one of the most
frequently chosen criteria is expected improvement. We argue that the
popularity of expected improvement largely relies on its theoretical properties
rather than empirically validated performance. Few results from the literature
show evidence, that under certain conditions, expected improvement may perform
worse than something as simple as the predicted value of the surrogate model.
We benchmark both infill criteria in an extensive empirical study on the `BBOB'
function set. This investigation includes a detailed study of the impact of
problem dimensionality on algorithm performance. The results support the
hypothesis that exploration loses importance with increasing problem
dimensionality. A statistical analysis reveals that the purely exploitative
search with the predicted value criterion performs better on most problems of
five or higher dimensions. Possible reasons for these results are discussed. In
addition, we give an in-depth guide for choosing the infill criteria based on
prior knowledge about the problem at hand, its dimensionality, and the
available budget.

portfolio (GMVP) is the covariance matrix of returns of assets being considered
for investment. Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors
use historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an
unbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great
amount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not
much bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the
covariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is
proposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a
cluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by
reducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this
dissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after
clustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single
group. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order
to limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not
only the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility
decreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced. It implies that
we need a bounded clustering algorithm so that maximum clustering size can be
precisely controlled to find the best portfolio performance.

point of a smooth function on a compact domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$. In contrast
with dimension-free approaches such as gradient descent, we focus here on the
case where $d$ is finite, and potentially small. This viewpoint was explored in
1993 by Vavasis, who proposed an algorithm which, for any fixed finite
dimension $d$, improves upon the $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$ oracle complexity of
gradient descent. For example for $d=2$, Vavasis' approach obtains the
complexity $O(1/\varepsilon)$. Moreover for $d=2$ he also proved a lower bound
of $\Omega(1/\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ for deterministic algorithms (we extend this
result to randomized algorithms).
  Our main contribution is an algorithm, which we call gradient flow trapping
(GFT), and the analysis of its oracle complexity. In dimension $d=2$, GFT
closes the gap with Vavasis' lower bound (up to a logarithmic factor), as we
show that it has complexity
$O\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}}\right)$. In dimension
$d=3$, we show a complexity of
$O\left(\frac{\log(1/\varepsilon)}{\varepsilon}\right)$, improving upon
Vavasis' $O\left(1 / \varepsilon^{1.2} \right)$. In higher dimensions, GFT has
the remarkable property of being a logarithmic parallel depth strategy, in
stark contrast with the polynomial depth of gradient descent or Vavasis'
algorithm. In this higher dimensional regime, the total work of GFT improves
quadratically upon the only other known polylogarithmic depth strategy for this
problem, namely naive grid search. We augment this result with another
algorithm, named \emph{cut and flow} (CF), which improves upon Vavasis'
algorithm in any fixed dimension.

astrophysics, is believed to be initiated by the tearing instability of an
electric current sheet, a region where magnetic field abruptly changes
direction and electric currents build up. Recent studies have suggested that
the amount of magnetic shear in these structures is a critical parameter for
the switch-on nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere, at fluid
spatial scales much larger than kinetic scales. We present results of
simulations of reconnection in 3D current sheets with conditions appropriate to
the solar corona. Using high-fidelity simulations, we follow the evolution of
the linear and non-linear 3D tearing instability, leading to reconnection. We
find that, depending on the parameter space, magnetic shear can play a vital
role in the onset of significant energy release and heating via non-linear
tearing. Two regimes in our study exist, dependent on whether the current sheet
is longer or shorter than the wavelength of the fastest growing parallel mode
(in the corresponding infinite system), thus determining whether sub-harmonics
are present in the actual system. In one regime, where the fastest growing
parallel mode has sub-harmonics, the non-linear interaction of these
sub-harmonics and the coalescence of 3D plasmoids dominates the non-linear
evolution, with magnetic shear playing only a weak role in the amount of energy
released. In the second regime, where the fastest growing parallel mode has
no-sub-harmonics, then only strongly sheared current sheets, where oblique mode
are strong enough to compete with the dominant parallel mode, show any
significant energy release. We expect both regimes to exist on the Sun, and so
our results have important consequences for the the question of reconnection
onset in different solar physics applications.

drag. However, owing to the meniscus deformation, the infused state could
collapse. Here we discuss the transition between infused and collapsed states
of transverse shallow grooves, considering the capillary number,
liquid/lubricant viscosity ratio and aspect ratio of the groove as parameters
for inducing this transition. It is found that depending on the depth of the
grooves, two different scenarios occur. A collapse of lubricant-infused
surfaces could happen due to a depinning of the meniscus from the front groove
edge. However, for very shallow textures, the meniscus contacts the bottom wall
before such a depinning could occur. Our interpretation could help avoiding
this generally detrimental effect in various applications.

experiments have found an excess above 10 GeV relative to the standard
predictions for secondary production in the interstellar medium (ISM). Although
the excess has been mostly suggested to arise from some primary sources of
positrons (such as pulsars and or annihilating dark matter particles), the
almost constant flux ratio of $e^{+}/ \bar{p}$ argues for an alternative
possibility that the excess positrons and antiprotons up to the highest
energies are secondary products generated in hadronic interactions. Recently,
Yang \& Aharonian (2019) revisit this possibility by assuming the presence of
an additional population of CR nuclei sources. Here we examine this secondary
product scenario using the \texttt{DRAGON} code, where the radiative loss of
positrons is taken into account consistently. We confirm that the CR proton
spectrum and the antiproton data can be explained by assuming the presence of
an additional population of CR sources. However, the corresponding positron
spectrum deviates from the measured data significantly above 100 GeV due to the
strong radiative cooling. This suggests that, although hadronic interactions
can explain the antiproton data, the corresponding secondary positron flux is
still not enough to account for the AMS data. Hence contribution from some
primary positron sources, such as pulsars or dark matter, is non-negligible.

physics. This is an attempt to structure the nonlocality mess. ""Quantum
nonlocality"" is Janus faced. One its face is projection (Einstein-L\""uders)
nonlocality and another Bell nonlocality. The first one is genuine quantum
nonlocality, the second one is subquantum nonlocality. Recently it was shown
that Bell ""nonlocality"" is a simple consequence of the complementarity
principle. We now show that projection nonlocality has no connection with
physical space. Projection state update is generalization of the well known
operation of probability update used in classical inference. We elevate the
role of interpretations of a quantum state. By using the individual (physical)
interpretation, one can really get the illusion of a spooky action at a
distance resulting from L\""uders' state update. The statistical interpretation
combined with treating the quantum formalism as machinery for update of
probability is known as the V\""axj\""o interpretation. Here one follows the
standard scheme of probability update adjusted to the quantum calculus of
probability. The latter is based on operating with states represented by
vectors (or density operators). We present in parallel classical and quantum
probability updates. From this presentation, it is clear that both classical

methods to approximate multivariate integrals. A rank-1 lattice rule to
approximate an $s$-dimensional integral is fully specified by its generating
vector $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{Z}^s$ and its number of points $N$. While there
are many results on the existence of ""good"" rank-1 lattice rules, there are no
explicit constructions for good generating vectors for dimensions $s \ge 3$.
This is why one usually resorts to computer search algorithms. Motivated by
earlier work of Korobov from 1963 and 1982, we present two variants of search
algorithms for good lattice rules and show that the resulting rules exhibit a
convergence rate in weighted function spaces that can be arbitrarily close to
the optimal rate. Moreover, contrary to most other algorithms, we do not need
to know the smoothness of our integrands in advance, the generating vector will
still recover the convergence rate associated with the smoothness of the
particular integrand, and, under appropriate conditions on the weights, the
error bounds can be stated without dependence on $s$. The search algorithms
presented in this paper are two variants of the well-known
component-by-component (CBC) construction, one of which is combined with a
digit-by-digit (DBD) construction. We present numerical results for both
algorithms using fast construction algorithms in the case of product weights.
They confirm our theoretical findings.

usage scenarios because there is no need to use a specific panoramic camera or
take images from multiple directions; however, it is still a challenging and
unsolved problem. The primary challenge is controlling the high degree of
freedom involved in generating a wide area that includes the all directions of
the desired plausible spherical image. On the other hand, scene symmetry is a
basic property of the global structure of the spherical images, such as
rotation symmetry, plane symmetry and asymmetry. We propose a method to
generate spherical image from a single NFOV image, and control the degree of
freedom of the generated regions using scene symmetry. We incorporate
scene-symmetry parameters as latent variables into conditional variational
autoencoders, following which we learn the conditional probability of spherical
images for NFOV images and scene symmetry. Furthermore, the probability density
functions are represented using neural networks, and scene symmetry is
implemented using both circular shift and flip of the hidden variables. Our

to increase the performances of machine learning algorithms which is exploiting
data locality. Data locality and access patterns are often at the heart of
performance issues in computing systems due to the use of certain hardware

locality can dramatically increase performance of a given algorithm. Besides,
repeated data access can be seen as redundancy in data movement. Similarly,
there can also be redundancy in the repetition of calculations. This work also
identifies some of the opportunities for avoiding these redundancies by

designed guided-wave-driven metasurfaces can mold guided waves into arbitrary

  Feature and Signal",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we study a new problem arising from the emerging MPEG
standardization effort Video Coding for Machine (VCM), which aims to bridge the
gap between visual feature compression and classical video coding. VCM is
committed to address the requirement of compact signal representation for both
machine and human vision in a more or less scalable way. To this end, we make
endeavors in leveraging the strength of predictive and generative models to
support advanced compression techniques for both machine and human vision tasks
simultaneously, in which visual features serve as a bridge to connect
signal-level and task-level compact representations in a scalable manner.
Specifically, we employ a conditional deep generation network to reconstruct
video frames with the guidance of learned motion pattern. By learning to
extract sparse motion pattern via a predictive model, the network elegantly
leverages the feature representation to generate the appearance of to-be-coded
frames via a generative model, relying on the appearance of the coded key
frames. Meanwhile, the sparse motion pattern is compact and highly effective
for high-level vision tasks, e.g. action recognition. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method yields much better reconstruction quality compared
with the traditional video codecs (0.0063 gain in SSIM), as well as
state-of-the-art action recognition performance over highly compressed videos
(9.4% gain in recognition accuracy), which showcases a promising paradigm of
coding signal for both human and machine vision.

phenethylammonium lead iodide ((PEA)$_2$PbI$_4$) that show complex structure in
their low-temperature excitonic absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra
as well as hot exciton PL. We replace the 2-position (ortho) H on the phenyl
group of the PEA cation with F, Cl, or Br to systematically increase the
cation's cross-sectional area and mass and study changes in the excitonic
structure. These single atom substitutions substantially change the observable
number of and spacing between discrete resonances in the excitonic absorption
and PL spectra and drastically increase the amount of hot exciton PL that
violates Kasha's rule by over an order of magnitude. To fit the progressively
larger cations, the inorganic framework distorts and is strained, reducing the
Pb-I-Pb bond angles and increasing the 2DHP band gap. Correlation between the
2DHP structure and steady-state and time-resolved spectra suggests the complex
structure of resonances arises from one or two manifolds of states, depending
on the 2DHP Pb-I-Pb bond angle (as)symmetry, and the resonances within a
manifold are regularly spaced with an energy separation that decreases as the
mass of the cation increases. The uniform separation between resonances and the
dynamics that show excitons can only relax to the next-lowest state are
consistent with a vibronic progression caused by a vibrational mode on the
cation. These results demonstrate that simple changes to the structure of the

the dynamic cache with a replacement policy for intercepting the temporal

layer for topic-based caching, where the entries are allocated to different
topics (e.g., weather, education). The results of queries characterized by a
topic are kept in the fraction of the cache dedicated to it. This permits to
adapt the cache-space utilization to the temporal locality of the various
topics and reduces cache misses due to those queries that are neither
sufficiently popular to be in the static portion nor requested within
short-time intervals to be in the dynamic portion. We simulate different

compare it with two commonly used tests and three recently proposed tests in

analyze two problems to show that it is possible for an online algorithm to

online edge orientation in which the edges arrive one-by-one to an empty graph

we are given a bipartite graph where one side of the graph is initially present

along a fiber according to the local Brillouin frequency shift, which is
usually calculated by the measured Brillouin spectrum using Lorentzian curve
fitting. In addition, cross-correlation, principal component analysis, and
machine learning methods have been proposed for the more efficient extraction
of Brillouin frequency shifts. However, existing methods only process the
Brillouin spectrum individually, ignoring the correlation in the time domain,
indicating that there is still room for improvement. Here, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a full convolution neural network to extract the
distributed Brillouin frequency shift directly from the measured
two-dimensional data. Simulated ideal Brillouin spectrum with various
parameters are used to train the network. Both the simulation and experimental
results show that the extraction accuracy of the network is better than that of
the traditional curve fitting algorithm with a much shorter processing time.
This network has good universality and robustness and can effectively improve
the performances of existing Brillouin sensors.

Convolutional Neural Network-based architectures for the execution of such a

knowledge learned during the training phase to new scenarios with different
characteristics. A suitably labeled dataset is essential to achieve this
purpose. The main problem is that manually annotating a dataset usually
requires a lot of human effort, and it is costly. To this end, we introduce
ViPeD (Virtual Pedestrian Dataset), a new synthetically generated set of images
collected with the highly photo-realistic graphical engine of the video game
GTA V - Grand Theft Auto V, where annotations are automatically acquired.
However, when training solely on the synthetic dataset, the model experiences a
Synthetic2Real Domain Shift leading to a performance drop when applied to
real-world images. To mitigate this gap, we propose two different Domain
Adaptation techniques suitable for the pedestrian detection task, but possibly
applicable to general object detection. Experiments show that the network
trained with ViPeD can generalize over unseen real-world scenarios better than
the detector trained over real-world data, exploiting the variety of our
synthetic dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with our Domain Adaptation
techniques, we can reduce the Synthetic2Real Domain Shift, making closer the
two domains and obtaining a performance improvement when testing the network
over the real-world images. The code, the models, and the dataset are made

observed two different spectral transitions between the high/soft and low/hard

transition, is best described by a Comptonised thermal component with an
electron temperature of 30 keV and a high luminosity value of 3x10^38 erg/s in
2-200 keV energy range (assuming a distance of 8 kpc). During the second

due to a non-thermal emission. Inverse Compton scattering of soft X-ray photons

explain the observed X-ray spectrum although a contribution to the hard X-ray

the codebooks of both users (which are also known to every party), and a
receiver who is required to decode the message pair sent by both users. The
transmitters send codewords which encode messages subject to input constraints.
The jammer, without knowing the transmitted codeword pair, injects adversarial
noise subject to state constraints so as to actively corrupt the communication
from both users to the receiver. It was left as an open question by Cai (2016)
to nail down the smallest list sizes for constrained AVMACs. Our inner and
outer bounds are based on a judicious notion of symmetrizability for AVMACs
introduced by Cai (2016) with twists to incorporate input and state
constraints. The analysis follows techniques by Csisz\'ar and Narayan (1988).
When no constraints are imposed, our bound collapse to prior results by Cai

AVMACs. Techniques used in this paper can also be extended to the Gaussian case

pristine (i.e., unperturbed by the interaction with the Sun) local interstellar
magnetic field. The constraints are based on analysis of the interstellar
magnetic field components at the heliopause measured by magnetometer
instruments on board Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft. The analysis was performed
with the help of our kinetic-magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) model of the global
heliosphere. The model shows that the solar-induced disturbances of the
interstellar magnetic field are extended relatively far from the Sun up to
400-500 AU. The field is draped around the heliopause and compressed. By
comparison of the model results with Voyager data we found that the model
provides results comparable with the data for the interstellar magnetic field
of
  $B_{LISM}$ = 3.7-3.8 $\mu$G in magnitude and directed towards
$\approx$125$^\circ$ in longitude, and $\approx$37$^\circ$ in latitude in the

perform SPH simulations of misaligned gas and dust discs around binaries to
investigate the different evolution of these two components. We choose two
different disc aspect ratios: A thin case for which the gas disc always breaks,
and a thick one where a smooth warp develops throughout the disc. For each
case, we run simulations of five different dust species with different degrees
of coupling with the gas component, varying in Stokes number from 0.002
(strongly coupled dust) to 1000 (effectively decoupled dust). We report two new
phenomena: First, large dust grains in thick discs pile up at the warp
location, forming narrow dust rings, due to a difference in precession between
the gas and dust components. These pile ups do not form at gas pressure maxima,
and hence are different from conventional dust traps. This effect is most
evident for St ~ 10 - 100. Second, thin discs tear and break only in the gas,
while dust particles with St > 10 form a dense dust trap due to the steep
pressure gradient caused by the break in the gas. We find that dust with St <
0.02 closely follow the gas particles, for both thin and thick discs, with
radial drift becoming noticeable only for the largest grains in this range.

performance of a face recognition system in face verification (1:1) and face

devices due to their adjustable physical properties. Periodic superlattices
facilitate coherent phonon thermal transport due to constructive wave
interference at the boundaries between the materials. However, it is possible
to induce a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport regimes by
adjusting the superlattice period. We have recently observed such crossover in
periodic graphene-boron nitride nanoribbons as the length of individual domains
was increased. In general, transport properties are dominated by translational
symmetry and the presence of unconventional symmetries leads to unusual
transport characteristics. Here we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
simulations to investigate phonon heat transport in graphene-hBN superlattices
following the Fibonacci quasiperiodic sequence, which lie between periodic and
disordered structures. Our simulations show that the quasiperiodicity can
suppress coherent phonon thermal transport in these superlattices. This
behavior is related to the increasing number of interfaces per unit cell as the
Fibonacci generation increases, hindering phonon coherence along the
superlattice. The suppression of coherent thermal transport in graphene-hBN
superlattices enables a higher degree of control on heat conduction at the
nanoscale, and shows potential for application in the design of novel thermal
management devices.

rotating source in a non-uniform potential flow. Other than the restriction to
low flow Mach numbers, the method is exact and general. The variation in
radiation properties with source position is handled by representation as a
Fourier series in source angle, giving rise to an asymmetrically varying
acoustic field evaluated by summation of the series. The method is used to
develop an exact solution for the model problem of a rotor operating near a
cylinder in cross-flow and sample calculations demonstrate the accuracy of the
technique when compared to full numerical evaluation. The calculations show
changes of greater than one decibel in the acoustic field due to flow
non-uniformity at a flow Mach number of 0.15, a typical speed for propeller
aircraft at take-off.

magnetic field evolution coupled with the plasma flows. Such a high cadence
solar spectropolarimetry if developed will allow one to study magnetic field
evolution in eruptive processes like solar flares, prominence eruptions, etc. A
single shot solar spectroscopy was recently demonstrated at Multi Application
Solar Telescope (MAST) at Udaipur Solar Observatory. The snapshot spectroscopy
is performed by sampling the pupil plane using the lenslet array to get
multiple images of the field of view (FOV), which are then collimated and the
collimated beam is made to pass through an FP Etalon in collimated mode. As the
distance from the FP axis increases, the peak transmitted wavelength shift
towards the bluer side. Using a prefilter with a full width half maximum (FWHM)
less than the free spectral range (FSR) of FP, combined with an imaging lens,
we can get multiple images of FOV on image plane with a blue shift in spectra
as we move radially outwards from the optical axis.

extract arguments -- paths in the knowledge graph -- with the goal to justify
the fact being true (thesis) or the fact being false (antithesis),
respectively. Based on these arguments, a binary classifier, referred to as the
judge, decides whether the fact is true or false. The two agents can be
considered as sparse feature extractors that present interpretable evidence for
either the thesis or the antithesis. In contrast to black-box methods, the
arguments enable the user to gain an understanding for the decision of the
judge. Moreover, our method allows for interactive reasoning on knowledge
graphs where the users can raise additional arguments or evaluate the debate
taking common sense reasoning and external information into account. Such
interactive systems can increase the acceptance of various AI applications

standard GI is affected by optical background noise, which reduces its
practical use. We investigated the robustness of an instant ghost imaging (IGI)
algorithm against optical background noise and compare it with the conventional
GI algorithm. Our results show that IGI is extremely resistant to
spatiotemporally varying optical background noise that can change over a large
range. When the noise is large in relation to the signal, IGI will still
perform well in conditions that prevent the conventional GI algorithm from
generating an image because IGI uses signal differences for imaging. Signal
differences are intrinsically resistant to common noise modes, so the IGI
algorithm is strongly robust against noise. This research is of great
significance for the practical application of GI.

classification services are more complex than white-box classifier,the
architecture and parameters of DL models on cloud platforms cannot be obtained

of security. In this paper, we mainly focus on studying the security of
real-world cloud-based image classification services. Specifically, (1) We
propose a novel attack method, Fast Featuremap Loss PGD (FFL-PGD) attack based
on Substitution model, which achieves a high bypass rate with a very limited
number of queries. Instead of millions of queries in previous studies, our
method finds the adversarial examples using only two queries per image; and (2)

crashes and deaths are highlighted as part of the United Nation's sustainable
development goals and vision zero efforts around the globe. The advent of
transportation network companies, such as ridesourcing, expands mobility
options in cities and may impact road safety outcomes. In this study, we
analyze the effects of ridesourcing use on road crashes, injuries, fatalities,
and driving while intoxicated (DWI) offenses in Travis County Texas. Our
approach leverages real-time ridesourcing volume to explain variation in road
safety outcomes. Spatial panel data models with fixed effects are deployed to
examine whether the use of ridesourcing is significantly associated with road
crashes and other safety metrics. Our results suggest that for a 10% increase
in ridesourcing trips, we expect a 0.12% decrease in road crashes (p<0.05), a
0.25% decrease in road injuries (p<0.001), and a 0.36% decrease in DWI offenses
(p<0.0001) in Travis County. Ridesourcing use is not associated with road
fatalities at a 0.05 significance level. This study augments existing work
because it moves beyond binary indicators of ridesourcing presence or absence
and analyzes patterns within an urbanized area rather than metropolitan-level
variation. Contributions include developing a data-rich approach for assessing
the impacts of ridesourcing use on our transportation system's safety, which
may serve as a template for future analyses of other US cities. Our findings
provide feedback to policymakers by clarifying associations between
ridesourcing use and traffic safety, while helping identify sets of actions to
achieve safer and more efficient shared mobility systems.

nature of loads is taken into account to further reduce the operating cost by
managing the voltage levels. The branch and cut method is applied to handle the
integrality constraints associated with the operation of dcds. A globally
convergent trust-region algorithm (tra) is applied to solve the integer relaxed
problems at each node during the branching process. The tra sub-problems are
solved using the interior point method. To reduce the branching burden of the
branch and cut algorithm, before applying tra at each node, a simplified
optimization problem is first solved. Using the convergence status and value of
the objective function of this problem, a faster decision is made on stopping
the regarding branch. Solving the simplified problem obviates the application
of tra at most nodes. It is shown that the method converges to the optimal
solution with a considerable saving in computation time according to the
numerical studies.

the tidal disruption of main sequence stars by supermassive black holes. Using
fully general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations and MESA-model initial
conditions, we explore the pericenter-dependence of tidal disruption properties
for eight stellar masses ($0.15 \leq M_*/M_\odot \leq 10$) and six black hole
masses ($10^5 \leq M_{BH}/M_\odot \leq 5 \times 10^7$). We present here the
results most relevant to observations. The effects of internal stellar
structure and relativity decouple for both the disruption cross section and the
characteristic energy width of the debris. Moreover, the full disruption cross
section is almost independent of $M_*$ for $M_*/M_\odot \lesssim 3$.
Independent of $M_*$, relativistic effects increase the critical pericenter
distance for full disruptions by up to a factor $\sim 3$ relative to the
Newtonian prediction. The probability of a direct capture is also independent
of $M_*$; at $M_{BH}/M_\odot \simeq 5 \times 10^6$ this probability is equal to
that of a complete disruption. The width of the debris energy distribution
$\Delta E$ can differ from the standard estimate by factors from 0.35 to 2,
depending on $M_*$ and $M_{BH}$, implying a corresponding change in the
characteristic mass-return timescale. The ""frozen-in approximation"" is
inconsistent with $\Delta E$, and mass-loss continues over a long span of time.
We provide analytic forms, suitable for use in both event rate estimates and
parameter inference, to describe all these trends. For partial disruptions, we
find a nearly-universal relation between the star's angular momentum and the
fraction of $M_*$ remaining. Within the ""empty loss-cone"" regime, partial
disruptions must precede full disruptions. These partial disruptions can
drastically affect the rate and appearance of subsequent total disruptions.

the stellar mass dependence of the outcomes for a black hole of mass
$10^{6}\rm{M}_{\odot}$. We consider eight different stellar masses, from
$0.15~{\rm M}_\odot$ to $10~{\rm M}_\odot$. We find that, relative to the
traditional order-of-magnitude estimate $r_{\rm t}$, the physical tidal radius
of low-mass stars ($M_{\star} \lesssim 0.7~ {\rm M}_\odot$) is larger by tens
of percent, while for high-mass stars ($M_{\star} \gtrsim1~ {\rm M}_\odot$) it
is smaller by a factor 2--2.5. The traditional estimate of the range of
energies found in the debris is $\approx 1.4\times$ too large for low-mass
stars, but is a factor $\sim 2$ too small for high-mass stars; in addition, the
energy distribution for high-mass stars has significant wings. For all stars
undergoing tidal encounters, we find that mass-loss continues for many stellar
vibration times because the black hole's tidal gravity competes with the
instantaneous stellar gravity at the star's surface until the star has reached
a distance from the black hole $\sim O(10)r_{\rm t}$.

becomes weaker, the debris mass is increasingly concentrated near the outer
edges of the energy distribution. As a result, the mass fallback rate can
deviate substantially from a $t^{-5/3}$ power-law, becoming more like a single

Even for strong encounters, remnants have speeds at infinity relative to the
black hole potential $\lesssim 300$ km s$^{-1}$, so they are unable to travel
far out into the galactic bulge. The remnants most deeply bound to the black
hole go through a second tidal disruption event upon their first return to

main-sequence stars with realistic internal density profiles, we examine full
and partial tidal disruptions across a wide range of black hole mass
($10^{5}\leq M_{\rm BH}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq 5\times 10^{7}$) and stellar
mass ($0.3 \leq M_{\star} /\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\leq 3$) as larger $M_{\rm BH}$
leads to stronger relativistic effects. For fixed $M_{\star}$, as $M_{\rm BH}$
increases, the ratio of the maximum pericenter distance yielding full
disruptions ($\mathcal{R}_{\rm t}$) to its Newtonian prediction rises rapidly,
becoming triple the Newtonian value for $M_{\rm BH} = 5\times10^{7}~{\rm
M}_\odot$, while the ratio of the energy width of the stellar debris for full
disruptions to the Newtonian prediction decreases steeply, resulting in a
factor of two correction at $M_{\rm BH} = 5 \times 10^7~{\rm M}_\odot$. We find
that for partial disruptions, the fractional remnant mass for a given ratio of
the pericenter to $\mathcal{R}_{\rm t}$ is higher for larger $M_{\rm BH}$.
These results have several implications. As $M_{\rm BH}$ increases above $\sim
10^7~{\rm M}_\odot$, the cross section for complete disruptions is suppressed
by competition with direct capture. However, the cross section ratio for
partial to complete disruptions depends only weakly on $M_{\rm BH}$. The
relativistic correction to the debris energy width delays the time of peak
mass-return rate and diminishes the magnitude of the peak return rate. For
$M_{\rm BH} \gtrsim 10^7~{\rm M}_\odot$, the $M_{\rm BH}$-dependence of the
full disruption cross section and the peak mass-return rate and time is
influenced more by relativistic effects than by Newtonian dynamics.

promising candidate to provide sustainable and scalable performance for Virtual
Reality. However, the entire multi-GPU system is viewed as a single GPU which
ignores the data locality in VR rendering during the workload distribution,
leading to tremendous remote memory accesses among GPU models. By conducting
comprehensive characterizations on different kinds of parallel rendering
frameworks, we observe that distributing the rendering object along with its
required data per GPM can reduce the inter-GPM memory accesses. However, this
object-level rendering still faces two major challenges in NUMA-based multi-GPU
system: (1) the large data locality between the left and right views of the
same object and the data sharing among different objects and (2) the unbalanced
workloads induced by the software-level distribution and composition
mechanisms. To tackle these challenges, we propose object-oriented VR rendering
framework (OO-VR) that conducts the software and hardware co-optimization to
provide a NUMA friendly solution for VR multi-view rendering in NUMA-based
multi-GPU systems. We first propose an object-oriented VR programming model to
exploit the data sharing between two views of the same object and group objects
into batches based on their texture sharing levels. Then, we design an object
aware runtime batch distribution engine and distributed hardware composition
unit to achieve the balanced workloads among GPMs. Finally, evaluations on our
VR featured simulator show that OO-VR provides 1.58x overall performance
improvement and 76% inter-GPM memory traffic reduction over the
state-of-the-art multi-GPU systems. In addition, OO-VR provides NUMA friendly
performance scalability for the future larger multi-GPU scenarios with ever
increasing asymmetric bandwidth between local and remote memory.

necessary in applications such as delivery, exploration, or support to the
wireless infrastructure. Mobile charging stations (i.e., mobile stations with

solutions to address this issue. However, the ability of these platforms to
charge the drones is limited in terms of the number and charging time. This
paper designs an auction-based mechanism to control the charging schedule in
multi-drone setting. In this paper, charging time slots are auctioned, and
their assignment is determined by a bidding process. The main challenge in
developing this framework is the lack of prior knowledge on the distribution of
the number of drones participating in the auction. Based on optimal
second-price-auction, the proposed formulation, then, relies on deep learning
algorithms to learn such distribution online. Numerical results from extensive
simulations show that the proposed deep learning-based approach provides
effective battery charging control in multi-drone scenarios.

electricity prices, and they can perceive as unfair price differentiation in

resources and emerging price-elastic behaviours pave the way for the effective
introduction of marginal nodal pricing schemes in distribution networks. The
aim of the proposed framework is to show how traditional non-flexible consumers
can coexist with flexible users in a local distribution area. Flexible users
will pay nodal prices, whereas non-flexible consumers will be charged a fixed
price derived from the underlying nodal prices. Moreover, the developed
approach shows how a distribution system operator should manage the local grid
by optimally determining the lines to be expanded, and the collected network
tariff levied on grid users, while accounting for both congestion rent and
investment costs. The proposed model is formulated as a non-linear integer
bilevel program, which is then recast as an equivalent single optimization
problem, by using integer algebra and complementarity relations. The power
flows in the distribution area are modelled by resorting to a second-order cone
relaxation, whose solution is exact for radial networks under mild assumptions.
The final model results in a mixed-integer quadratically constrained program,
which can be solved with off-the-shelf solvers. Numerical test cases based on

The joint embedding is modeled by representing the processes in a reproducing

allow the registration to be independent of a specific signal resolution. The
framework is fully analytical with a closed-form derivation of the Riemannian
gradient and Hessian. We study a more specialized but widely used case where
the Lie group acts on functions isometrically. We solve the problem by
maximizing the inner product between two functions defined over data, while the
continuous action of the rigid body motion Lie group is captured through the
integration of the flow in the corresponding Lie algebra. Low-dimensional cases
are derived with numerical examples to show the generality of the proposed
framework. The high-dimensional derivation for the special Euclidean group
acting on the Euclidean space showcases the point cloud registration and
bird's-eye view map registration abilities. An implementation of this framework

Such programs exhibit a pattern of allocating, copying, potentially mutating,

These objects may assemble data structures such as stacks, queues, lists,
ragged arrays, and trees, which may be of random, and possibly unbounded, size.
For the simple case of $N$ particles, $T$ generations, $D$ objects, and
resampling at each generation, dense representation requires $O(DNT)$ memory,
while sparse representation requires only $O(DT+DN\log DN)$ memory, based on
existing theoretical results. This work describes an object copy-on-write
platform to automate this saving for the programmer. The core idea is
formalized using labeled directed multigraphs, where vertices represent
objects, edges the pointers between them, and labels the necessary bookkeeping.
A specific labeling scheme is proposed for high performance under the
motivating pattern. The platform is implemented for the Birch probabilistic
programming language, using smart pointers, hash tables, and reference-counting
garbage collection. It is tested empirically on a number of realistic
probabilistic programs, and shown to significantly reduce memory use and
execution time in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. This
enables copy-on-write for the imperative programmer, lazy deep copies for the

severity, spatial cluster-ID, and crash time (hour). Evidence gained from the
model data analysis will be adopted by policymakers and key stakeholders to
gain insights into major contributing factors associated with fatal road
crashes and to translate knowledge into safety programs and enhanced road
policies.

the propagation and coalescence of microcracks. Simulating this mechanism at
the continuum level is computationally expensive or, in some cases,
intractable. The computational cost is due to the need for highly resolved
computational meshes required to capture complex crack growth behavior, such as
branching, turning, etc. Typically, continuum-scale models that account for
brittle damage evolution homogenize the crack network in some way, which
reduces the overall computational cost, but can also neglect key physics of the
subgrid crack growth behavior, sacrificing accuracy for efficiency. We have
developed an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current
inability to represent micro-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach
leverages damage and stress data from a high-fidelity model that explicitly
resolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator,
which runs in seconds as opposed to the high-fidelity model, which takes hours.
Once trained, the machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of
crack length statistics. A continuum-scale constitutive model is then informed
with these crack statistics, speeding up the workflow by four orders of
magnitude. Both the machine learning model and the continuum-scale model are
validated against a high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively,
showing excellent agreement. There are two key findings. The first is that we
can reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing that the machine
learning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the
maximum stress components to capture the necessary physics. Another compelling
finding is that the emulator can be trained in one experimental setting and
transferred successfully to predict behavior in a different setting.

mechanism for discrete element (DEM) simulations of granular materials. Linear
springs with a frictional slider are used for modeling interactions in
directions normal and tangential to the contact surface. Although the model is
simple in two dimensions, its implementation in 3D faces certain subtle
challenges, and the particle interactions that occur within a single time-step
require careful modeling with a robust algorithm. The paper details a 3D
algorithm that accounts for the changing direction of the tangential force
within a time-step, the transition from elastic to slip behavior within a
time-step, possible contact sliding during only part of a time-step, and
twirling and rotation of the tangential force during a time-step. Without three
of these adjustments, errors are introduced in the incremental stiffness of an
assembly. Without the fourth adjustment, the resulting stress tensor is not
only incorrect, it is no longer a tensor. The algorithm also computes the work
increments during a time-step, both elastic and dissipative.
