glassy states are suppressed by small field, several remarkable features
appear. These include a linear, nonsaturating magnetoresistance as a function
of field that is reminiscent of a topological or charge-compensated semimetal,
and a large anomalous Hall conductivity amounting to $\sim$2000 $\Omega

ground state and a relatively low crystal electric field splitting of the
Pr$^{3+}$ multiplets of less than 100 K. Shubnikov-de Hass oscillations are
absent in LaAlSi, whereas they are clearly observed below about 25 K in PrAlSi,
with an unusual temperature dependence of the dominating oscillation frequency
$F$. It increases from $F$ = 18 T at 25 K to $F$ = 33 T at 2 K, hinting at an
emerging Fermi pocket upon cooling into the ordered phase. These results

(BSE) hold important clues about the provenance of Earth's building material.
Prior studies have argued that non-carbonaceous (NC) and carbonaceous (CC)
meteorite groups together define a Mo-Ru 'cosmic' correlation, and that the BSE
plots on the extension of this correlation. These observations were taken as
evidence that the final 10-15% of Earth's accreted material derived from a
homogeneous inner disk reservoir with an enstatite chondrite-like isotopic
composition. Here, using new Mo and Ru isotopic data for previously
uninvestigated meteorite groups, we show that the Mo-Ru correlation only exists
for NC meteorites, and that both the BSE and CC meteorites fall off this Mo-Ru
correlation. These observations indicate that the final stages of Earth's
accretion were heterogeneous and consisted of a mixture of NC and CC materials.
The Mo-Ru isotope systematics are best accounted for by either an NC heritage
of the late veneer combined with a CC heritage of the Moon-forming giant
impactor, or by mixed NC-CC compositions for both components. The involvement
of CC bodies in the late-stage accretionary assemblage of Earth is consistent
with chemical models for core-mantle differentiation, which argue for the
addition of more oxidized and volatile-rich material toward the end of Earth's
formation. As such, this study resolves the inconsistencies between homogeneous
accretion models based on prior interpretations of the Mo-Ru systematics of
meteorites and the chemical evidence for heterogeneous accretion of Earth.

structural relationships between variables. Existing methods to investigate
mutual independence rely on the definition of two competing models, one being
nested into the other and used to generate a null distribution for a statistic
of interest, usually under the asymptotic assumption of large sample size. As
such, these methods have a very restricted scope of application. In the present
manuscript, we propose to change the investigation of mutual independence from
a hypothesis-driven task that can only be applied in very specific cases to a
blind and automated search within patterns of mutual independence. To this end,
we treat the issue as one of model comparison that we solve in a Bayesian
framework. We show the relationship between such an approach and existing
methods in the case of multivariate normal distributions as well as
cross-classified multinomial distributions. We propose a general Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to numerically approximate the posterior
distribution on the space of all patterns of mutual independence. The relevance
of the method is demonstrated on synthetic data as well as two real datasets,
showing the unique insight provided by this approach.

collection of co-linearly moving quarks and gluons (partons), interacting
accordingly to perturbative QCD rules. However, massive experimental evidence
shows that, in particular when transverse spin dependent observables are

is widely being used in spectroscopy, sensing and microscopy. Total internal
reflection fluorescence (TIRF) confines fluorescence excitation by an
evanescent (near-) field and it is a popular contrast generator for
surface-selective fluorescence assays. Its emission equivalent, supercritical
angle fluorescence (SAF) is comparably less established although it achieves a
similar optical sectioning as does TIRF. SAF emerges when a fluorescing
molecule is located very close to an interface and its near-field emission
couples to the higher-refractive index medium (n2 > n1) and becomes
propagative. Then, most fluorescence is detectable on the side of the
higher-index substrate and a large fraction of this fluorescence is emitted
into angles forbidden by Snell's law. SAF as well as the undercritical angle
fluorescence (UAF) (far-field emission) components can be collected with
microscope objectives having a high-enough detection aperture NA > n2 and be
separated in the back-focal plane (BFP) by Fourier filtering. The BFP image
encodes information about the fluorophore radiation pattern, and it can be
analysed to yield precise information about the refractive index in which the
emitters are embedded, their nanometric distance from the interface and their
orientation. A SAF microscope can retrieve this near-field information through
wide-field optics in a spatially resolved manner, and this functionality can be
added to any existing inverted microscope.

establish a family of speed limits for heat, work, entropy production, and

universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a
mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam-Tamm version of the time-energy

well known that in such cases the solutions have singularities near the corners
which poses a challenge for many existing methods. If the boundary data is
smooth on each edge of the polygon, then in the vicinity of each corner the
solution to the corresponding boundary integral equation has an expansion in
terms of certain (analytically available) singular powers. Using the known
behavior of the solution, universal discretizations have been constructed for
the solution of the Dirichlet problem. However, the leading order behavior of
solutions to the Neumann problem is $O(t^{\mu})$ for $\mu \in (-1/2,0)$
depending on the angle at the corner (compared to $O(C+t^{\mu})$ with $\mu>1/2$
for the Dirichlet problem); this presents a significant challenge in the design
of universal discretizations. Our approach is based on using the discretization
for the Dirichlet problem in order to compute a solution in the ""weak sense"" by
solving an adjoint linear system; namely, it can be used to compute inner
products with smooth functions accurately, but it cannot be interpolated.
Furthermore we present a procedure to obtain accurate solutions arbitrarily
close to the corner, by solving a sequence of small local subproblems in the
vicinity of that corner. The results are illustrated with several numerical

of three phases, the Map phase, the Shuffle phase and the Reduce phase. For
this framework, we propose the use of binary matrices (with $0,1$ entries)
called \textit{computing matrices} to describe the map phase and the shuffle
phase. Similar binary matrices were recently proposed for the coded caching
framework. The structure of ones and zeroes in the binary computing matrix
captures the map phase of the MapReduce framework. We present a new simple
coded data shuffling scheme for this binary matrix model, based on a
\textit{identity submatrix cover} of the computing matrix. This new coded
shuffling scheme has in general a larger communication load than existing
schemes, but has the advantage of less complexity overhead than the well-known
earlier schemes in literature in terms of the file-splitting and associated
indexing and coordination required. We also show that there exists a binary
matrix based distributed computing scheme with our new data-shuffling scheme
which has strictly less than twice than the communication load of the known
optimal scheme in literature. The structure of this new scheme enables it to be
applied to the framework of MapReduce with stragglers also, in a
straightforward manner, borrowing its advantages and disadvantages from the
no-straggler situation. Finally, using binary matrices derived from
combinatorial designs, we show specific classes of computing schemes with very
low \textit{file complexity} (number of subfiles in the file), with marginally
higher communication load compared to the optimal scheme for equivalent
parameters.

multi-user systems where analog precoding is realized by switches and phase
shifters such that radio frequency (RF) chain to transmit antenna connections
can be switched off for energy saving. By explicitly considering the effect of
each connection on the required power for baseband and RF signal processing, we
describe the total power consumption in a sparsity form of the analog precoding
matrix. However, these sparsity terms and sparsity-modulus constraints of the
analog precoding make the system energy-efficiency maximization problem
non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this problem, we first transform
it into a subtractive-form weighted sum rate and power problem. A compressed
sensing-based re-weighted quadratic-form relaxation method is employed to deal
with the sparsity parts and the sparsity-modulus constraints. We then exploit
alternating minimization of the mean-squared error to solve the equivalent
problem where the digital precoding vectors and the analog precoding matrix are
updated sequentially. The energy efficiency upper bound and a heuristic
algorithm are also examined for comparison purposes. Numerical results confirm
the superior performances of the proposed algorithm over benchmark
energy-efficiency hybrid precoding algorithms and heuristic ones.

because of rapid capacity fading due to lithium polysulfides (LiPSs)
dissolution into the electrolyte. In order to enhance the efficiency and
performance of the Li-S batteries, the transition metal dichalcogenides are
reported as promising anchoring materials (AMs) as they could strongly adsorb
and effectively suppress the migration of the polysulfides species. Herein, we
used first-principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations to
investigate the interactions between AMs such as tungsten dichalcogenides, WX2
(X=S and Se) and the LiPSs. The LiPSs binding behavior of WS2 and WSe2 are
found to be quite similar. The calculated adsorption energies of LiPS species
indicate that the WX2 possesses moderate binding strength and the binding is
facilitated via charge transfer from the polysulfides to the AM. We observe
elongation of intramolecular Li-S bonds in LiPS upon their adsorption onto the
WX2, however, chemical structures of LiPSs are preserved without decomposition.
The calculated density of states indicates the LiPS adsorbed WX2 systems
exhibits semiconducting behavior with a slightly lower bandgap compared to the
pristine WX2. Overall, our simulation results provide detailed insight into the
behavior of WX2 as AMs to suppress the LiPSs migration and henceforth paves the
way towards the development of high-performance Li-S batteries.

robots. Unlike robots, humans almost immediately know how to manipulate objects
for grasping due to learning over the years. A grown woman can grasp objects
more skilfully than a child because of learning skills developed over years,
the absence of which in the present day robotic grasping compels it to perform
well below the human object grasping benchmarks. In this paper we have taken up
the challenge of developing learning based pose estimation by decomposing the
problem into both position and orientation learning. More specifically, for
grasp position estimation, we explore three different methods - a Genetic
Algorithm (GA) based optimization method to minimize error between calculated
image points and predicted end-effector (EE) position, a regression based
method (RM) where collected data points of robot EE and image points have been
regressed with a linear model, a PseudoInverse (PI) model which has been
formulated in the form of a mapping matrix with robot EE position and image
points for several observations. Further for grasp orientation learning, we
develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model which we name as Grasp Deep
Q-Network (GDQN) and benchmarked our results with Modified VGG16 (MVGG16).
Rigorous experimentations show that due to inherent capability of producing
very high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems, GA
based predictor performs much better than the other two models for position
estimation. For orientation learning results indicate that off policy learning
through GDQN outperforms MVGG16, since GDQN architecture is specially made
suitable for the reinforcement learning. Based on our proposed architectures

regular shapes.

We develop two novel algorithms, where each agent only plays from a subset of
all the arms. Agents use the communication medium to recommend only arm-IDs
(not samples), and thus update the set of arms from which they play. We
establish that, if agents communicate $\Omega(\log(T))$ times through any
connected pairwise gossip mechanism, then every agent's regret is a factor of
order $N$ smaller compared to the case of no collaborations. Furthermore, we
show that the communication constraints only have a second order effect on the
regret of our algorithm. We then analyze this second order term of the regret
to derive bounds on the regret-communication tradeoffs. Finally, we empirically
evaluate our algorithm and conclude that the insights are fundamental and not
artifacts of our bounds. We also show a lower bound which gives that the regret
scaling obtained by our algorithm cannot be improved even in the absence of any
communication constraints. Our results thus demonstrate that even a minimal
level of collaboration among agents greatly reduces regret for all agents.

Galactocentric distances between 13 kpc and 20 kpc to the previous maps.
  Aims: Here, we investigate the dynamical effects produced by different
mechanisms that can explain the radial and vertical components of these
extended kinematic maps, including a decomposition of bending and breathing of
the vertical components. This paper as a whole tries to be a compendium of
different dynamical mechanisms whose predictions can be compared to the
kinematic maps.
  Methods: Using analytical methods or simulations, we are able to predict the
main dynamical factors and compare them to the predictions of the extended
kinematic maps of Gaia-DR2.
  Results: The gravitational influence of Galactic components that are
different from the disk, such as the long bar or bulge, the spiral arms, or a
tidal interaction with Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, may explain some features of
the velocity maps, especially in the inner parts of the disk. However, they are
not sufficient in explaining the most conspicuous gradients in the outer disk.
Vertical motions might be dominated by external perturbations or mergers,
although a minor component may be due to a warp whose amplitude evolves with
time. Here, we show with two different methods, which analyze the dispersion of
velocities, that the mass distribution of the disk is flared. Despite these
partial explanations, the main observed features can only be explained in terms
of out-of-equilibrium models, which are either due to external perturbers or to
the fact that the disk has not had time to reach equilibrium since its
formation.

trained with SQLoss evolve cooperative behavior in several social dilemma
matrix games. To work with social dilemma games that have visual input, we
propose GameDistill. GameDistill uses self-supervision and clustering to
automatically extract cooperative and selfish policies from a social dilemma
game. We combine GameDistill and SQLoss to show how agents evolve socially
desirable cooperative behavior in the Coin Game.

  Within 3D X-ray Computed Tomography Volumes","Technical Report, Durham University",,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Threat Image Projection (TIP) is a technique used in X-ray security baggage
screening systems that superimposes a threat object signature onto a benign
X-ray baggage image in a plausible and realistic manner. It has been shown to
be highly effective in evaluating the ongoing performance of human operators,
improving their vigilance and performance on threat detection. However, with
the increasing use of 3D Computed Tomography (CT) in aviation security for both
hold and cabin baggage screening a significant challenge arises in extending
TIP to 3D CT volumes due to the difficulty in 3D CT volume segmentation and the
proper insertion location determination. In this paper, we present an approach
for 3D TIP in CT volumes targeting realistic and plausible threat object
insertion within 3D CT baggage images. The proposed approach consists of dual
threat (source) and baggage (target) volume segmentation, particle swarm
optimisation based insertion determination and metal artefact generation. In
addition, we propose a TIP quality score metric to evaluate the quality of
generated TIP volumes. Qualitative evaluations on real 3D CT baggage imagery
show that our approach is able to generate realistic and plausible TIP which
are indiscernible from real CT volumes and the TIP quality scores are
consistent with human evaluations.

uninformative responses. There have been various useful efforts on trying to
eliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms
during inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In
our work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what
utterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we
start with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates
the average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder
side during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more
likely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model
diversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more
evenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage
this novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing
relevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score
through the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label
Fine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled
by the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL,
adopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward
signal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms
of MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on
both diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better
than competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation). Moreover, our
approaches are orthogonal to the base model, making them applicable as an
add-on to other emerging better dialogue models in the future.

data-driven turbulence modeling, especially for models with high dimensional

efforts on data-driven Reynolds-Averaged Naiver Stokes (RANS) turbulence
modeling and model extrapolation, with main focus on the popular methods being
used in the field of transfer learning. Several potential metrics to measure
the dissimilarity between training flows and testing flows are examined.
Different Machine Learning (ML) models are compared to understand how the
capacity or complexity of the model affects its behavior in the face of dataset
shift. Data preprocessing schemes which are robust to covariate shift, like
normalization, transformation, and importance re-weighted likelihood, are
studied to understand whether it is possible to find projections of the data
that attenuate the differences in the training and test distributions while
preserving predictability. Three metrics are proposed to assess the
dissimilarity between training/testing dataset. To attenuate the dissimilarity,
a distribution matching framework is used to align the statistics of the
distributions. These modifications also allow the regression tasks to have
better accuracy in forecasting under-represented extreme values of the target
variable. These findings are useful for future ML based turbulence models to
evaluate their model predictability and provide guidance to systematically
generate diversified high-fidelity simulation database.

they stereotype words and hence suffer from inherently biased training. Bias
removal has been traditionally studied for structured datasets, but we aim at
bias mitigation from unstructured text data. In this paper, we make two
important contributions. First, we systematically design methods to quantify
the bias for any model and propose algorithms for identifying the set of words
which the model stereotypes. Second, we propose novel methods leveraging
knowledge-based generalizations for bias-free learning. Knowledge-based
generalization provides an effective way to encode knowledge because the
abstraction they provide not only generalizes content but also facilitates
retraction of information from the hate speech detection classifier, thereby
reducing the imbalance. We experiment with multiple knowledge generalization
policies and analyze their effect on general performance and in mitigating
bias. Our experiments with two real-world datasets, a Wikipedia Talk Pages

the use of knowledge-based generalizations results in better performance by
forcing the classifier to learn from generalized content. Our methods utilize

showing the linear dispersive result for all such modes, we show that the
quadratically dispersive modes couple to a special nonrelativistic spacetime

Newton-Cartan) is intimately linked to the mean-field phase of the condensate.
To illustrate the general result, we further provide the specific theory in the

numbers. Finally, we use the coupling to different spacetimes to compute and
relate various energy and momentum currents in these analog systems. While this
result is general, present day experiments can realize these different

that H^- photodetachment by Ly{\alpha} decreases the critical UV flux for

two-dimensional conformal field theories, such as logarithmic negativity, odd
entropy, and reflected entropy, after quantum quenches of various kinds. These
correlation measures, in the holographic context, are all associated to the
entanglement wedge cross section. We contrast various classes of conformal
field theories, both rational and irrational (pure) conformal field theories.
First, for rational conformal field theories, whose dynamics can be well
described by the quasi-particle picture, we find all four quantities for
disjoint intervals to be proportional, regardless of the specific quench
protocol. Second, using the light cone bootstrap, we generalize our results to
irrational conformal field theories where we find sharp distinctions from the
quasi-particle results and striking differences between mutual information and
the other measures. The large surplus of logarithmic negativity relative to
mutual information forces us to reconsider what mutual information and
logarithmic negativity really measure. We interpret these results as a
signature of information scrambling and chaos in irrational theories. These CFT
results perfectly agree with our gravitational (holographic) calculations.
Furthermore, using holography, we are able to generalize the results to outside
of the light cone limit. Finally, due to the breakdown of the quasi-particle
picture for irrational theories, we appeal to the ""line-tension picture,""
motivated by random unitary circuits, as a phenomenological description. We
observe that random unitary circuits, with local Hilbert space dimension
determined by the Cardy formula, have precisely the same entanglement dynamics
as irrational (including holographic) conformal field theories.

problems associated with fast control pulses and guarantees operation
consistency, providing an advantage over static qubits. For inter-dot barrier

lensing of quasars and from fluctuations in stellar streams separately

reconstructed their global and radial histories of star formation and mass
growth. We find the mass- and luminosity-weighted age gradients of CLEs are
nearly flat or mildly negative. The respective $Z$ gradients are negative,
being flatter as the mass is smaller. The more massive CLEs formed stars
earlier and quenched faster than the less massive ones. The CLEs show a weak
inside-out growth and a clear inside-out quenching. They finished their
quenching globally 3.8 $\pm$ 1.2 Gyr ago, with quenching time-scales of 3.4
$\pm$ 0.8 Gyr. At masses < 10$^{11}$ $M_{\bigodot}$, the age and $Z$ gradients
of the RQEs and BSFs are flatter than those of the CLEs but with larger
scatters. They show very weak inside-out growth and quenching, which is slow
and even not completed at $z\sim0$ for the BSFs. Instead, the massive RQEs show
an outside-in quenching and positive gradients in the luminosity-weighted age
and stellar metallicities. The RQEs of all masses quenched 1.2 $\pm$ 0.9 Gyr
ago on average. Our results for the CLEs are consistent with a two-phase
scenario where their inner parts formed by an early and coeval dissipative
collapse with a consequent burst of star formation and further quenching,

discuss some evolutionary scenarios for the RQE and BSF galaxies.

$>$3$\sigma$ significance corresponding to an 850$\mu$m flux-limit of

to star formation, very high star formation rates (SFR) of $\sim$2500-4500

considering a large contribution to the 850$\mu$m flux from dust heated by the
quasar itself, significant SFRs of $\sim$600-1500 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ are

The number counts of sub-mm galaxies in the total survey area (134.3arcmin$^2$)

individual quasars where we find evidence for an excess of associated sub-mm
galaxies. For two quasars, higher spatial resolution and spectroscopic ALMA

perform idealised disc galaxy simulations to understand how galactic properties
such as metallicity and gas mass affect the escape of Lyman Continuum (LyC)
photons using radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with strong stellar feedback.
We find that the luminosity-weighted escape fraction from a metal-poor
($Z=0.002$) galaxy embedded in a halo of mass $M_h\simeq10^{11}\,M_\odot$ is
$\left<f_{\rm esc}^{\rm 3D}\right>\simeq 10\,\%$. Roughly half of the LyC
photons are absorbed within scales of 100 pc, and the other half is absorbed in
the ISM ($\lesssim 2\, {\rm kpc}$). When the metallicity of the gas is
increased to $Z=0.02$, the escape fraction is significantly reduced to
$\left<f_{\rm esc}^{\rm 3D}\right>\simeq1\%$ because young stars are enshrouded
by their birth clouds for a longer time. In contrast, increasing the gas mass
by a factor of 5 leads to $\left<f_{\rm esc}^{\rm 3D}\right>\simeq 5\, \%$
because LyC photons are only moderately absorbed by the thicker disc. Our
experiments suggest that high metallicity is likely more responsible for the
low escape fractions observed in massive star-forming galaxies, supporting the
scenario in which the escape fraction is decreasing with increasing halo mass.
Finally, negligible correlation is observed between the escape fraction and
surface density of star formation or galactic outflow rates.

properties of mobile dopants in correlated anti-ferromagnets (AFMs). But
describing them theoretically, even in simplified toy models, remains a
challenge. Here we study ARPES spectra of a single mobile hole in the $t-J$
model. Recent progress in the microscopic description of mobile dopants allows
us to use a geometric decoupling of spin and charge fluctuations at strong
couplings, from which we conjecture a one-to-one relation of the one-dopant
spectral function and the spectrum of a constituting spinon in the
\emph{undoped} parent AFM. We thoroughly test this hypothesis for a single hole
doped into a 2D Heisenberg AFM by comparing our semi-analytical predictions to
previous quantum Monte Carlo results and our large-scale time-dependent matrix
product state (td-MPS) calculations of the spectral function. Our conclusion is
supported by a microscopic trial wavefuntion describing spinon-chargon bound
states, which captures the momentum and $t/J$ dependence of the quasiparticle
residue. Our conjecture suggests that ARPES measurements in the pseudogap phase
of cuprates can directly reveal the Dirac-fermion nature of the constituting
spinons. Specifically, we demonstrate that our trial wavefunction provides a
microscopic explanation for the sudden drop of spectral weight around the nodal
point associated with the formation of Fermi arcs, assuming that additional
frustration suppresses long-range AFM ordering. We benchmark our results by
studying the cross-over from two to one dimension, where spinons and chargons
are confined and deconfined respectively.

in a 5-dimensional bulk whose dynamics is governed by Einstein-dilaton-axion

axion, the model generically exhibits a multitude of static solutions, with
different values for the equilibrium position for the brane. Under mild
assumptions regarding the dependence of brane parameters on bulk fields, a
number of these solutions exhibit electroweak symmetry breaking with a
hierarchically small Higgs mass as compared to the cutoff-scale of the brane
theory. The realisation of self-tuning of the cosmological constant is generic
and as efficient as in previous constructions without a bulk axion. Vacua with
a hierarchically small Higgs mass can sometimes be found, regardless of whether
the brane theory depends explicitly on the bulk axion. Because it is expected
on general principles that the brane action will depend on the axion, the
generation of solutions with a large hierarchy is a robust feature.

constrain the geometry of the circumstellar material (CSM) surrounding SN IIn
explosions, which may shed light on their progenitor diversity. In order to
distinguish between aspherical and spherical circumstellar material (CSM), we
estimate the blackbody radius temporal evolution of the SNe IIn of our sample,
following the method introduced by Soumagnac et al. We find that higher
luminosity objects tend to show evidence for aspherical CSM. Depending on
whether this correlation is due to physical reasons or to some selection bias,
we derive a lower limit between 35% and 66% on the fraction of SNe IIn showing
evidence for aspherical CSM. This result suggests that asphericity of the CSM
surrounding SNe IIn is common - consistent with data from resolved images of
stars undergoing considerable mass loss. It should be taken into account for
more realistic modelling of these events.

emission at $T \sim 1000$ K is common in classical novae (especially CO novae)
at the infrared peak in the light curve, due to condensation of dust
$\sim$30--60 days after the explosion. Radio follow up with the Australia
Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) detected a fading continuum source with
properties consistent with a classical nova but probably inconsistent with
colliding protostars. Considering all VVV transients that could have been
projected against a catalogued IRDC raises the probability of a chance
association to $p=0.13$ to 0.24. After weighing several options, it appears
likely that VVV-WIT-01 was a classical nova event located behind an IRDC.

With the approach, the number of atomic chains can be controlled by the inner

coded apertures are structured by embedding lead spheres in a matrix of
positions machined inside a transparent medium such as acrylic glass, resulting
in an advantageous transparent to opaque area ratio and thus an improved
detection efficiency. This configuration also induces a systematic,
element-wise, noise on the Point-Spread-Function (PSF) of the correlation
matrix. When imaging with these apertures extended hot-spots, a penumbra
phenomenon occurrs and reduces this intrinsic noise, in the way a kernel filter
does. Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT) is used to analyze the effect of this
phenomenon on the correlation matrix and to explain the maximization of its
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for certain extent of the hot-spots. Simulations
have been used for the detailed study of the SNR dependence on the dimensions
of the hot-spot, while experiments with two 99mTc cylindrical sources with 11mm

reduction of the intrinsic noise. The results define the way of optimization of
the imaging setup for the detection of extended hot-spots. Such an optimization

neural network with binary outputs that help identify the filters from each
layer of the original network that do not have any significant contribution to
the model and can therefore be pruned. The pruner network has the same
architecture as the original network except that it has a
multitask/multi-output last layer containing binary-valued outputs (one per

to minimize the number of filters from the original network by assigning zero
weights to the corresponding output feature-maps. In contrast to most of the
existing methods, instead of relying on iterative pruning, our approach can
prune the network (original network) in one go and, moreover, does not require
specifying the degree of pruning for each layer (and can learn it instead). The
compressed model produced by our approach is generic and does not need any
special hardware/software support. Moreover, augmenting with other methods such
as knowledge distillation, quantization, and connection pruning can increase
the degree of compression for the proposed approach. We show the efficacy of
our proposed approach for classification and object detection tasks.

generalize the Boolean Hidden Matching problem by replacing the parity function

completely characterize the classical hardness of all symmetric functions $f$

demonstrating significant magnetic activity transitions sharply from roughly
$10\%$ for main-sequence stars earlier (more massive) than spectral type M3.5
(0.35 M$_\odot$) to nearly $90\%$ for stars later than M3.5. The latter are
typically rotating quite rapidly, suggesting differing spin-down histories.
Tantalizingly, it is also later than M3.5 at which main-sequence stars become
fully convective, and may no longer contain a tachocline, a layer of rotational
shear revealed by helioseismology to separate the radiative zone (RZ) and
convection zone (CZ). We turn here to the more massive M-stars to study the
impact such a layer may have on their internal dynamics. Using the spherical 3D
MHD simulation code Rayleigh, we compare the properties of convective dynamos
generated within quickly rotating (1, 2, and 4 $\Omega_\odot$) M2 (0.4
M$_\odot$) stars, with the computational domain either terminating at the base
of the convection zone or permitting overshoot into the underlying stable
region. We find that a tachocline is not necessary for the organization of
strong toroidal wreaths of magnetism in these stars, though its presence can
increase the coupling of mean field amplitudes to the stellar rotation rate.
Additionally, in stars that undergo periodic cycles, we find that the presence
of a tachocline tends to make the cycles both longer and more regular than they
would have otherwise been. Finally, we find that the tachocline helps to
enhance the surface poloidal fields and organize them into larger spatial

gradient in thermodynamic systems. Even though it has been studied for over 150
years, there is neither a complete theoretical description of thermophoresis in
liquids nor of the Soret coefficient, the quantifiying measure of the Soret
equilibrium. Recent studies connect its nature to equilibrium properties of the
system, namely the excess enthalpy and the excess entropy, while there is still
a debate over which of both describes the Soret coefficient more accurately and
whether it can even be represented using those quantities. In this work I
present a theoretical description for both cases based on density analysis by
means of Brownian motion and dynamical density functional theory, where I
assume local equilibrium. The interpretation of the Brownian stochastic
differential equation (SDE) as an Ito or Stratonovich SDE is shown to have an
influence on the outcome of the density. I argue that a Soret coefficient
proportional to the excess enthalpy is connected to a system in a thermal
gradient following its equation of state. Furthermore, I derive that the
Boltzmann distribution law for external potentials does not hold for systems in
thermal gradients but has to be replaced by a more general quantity. The
theoretical predictions are consequently tested by means of BD simulations,
where several systems are shown to follow their equation of state. The Soret
coefficient of a solute in a toy model solvent is shown to be proportional to
the solute's equilibrium solvation enthalpy. I further attempt to verify the
theoretic derivations by means of MD simulations of noble gas solutes in SPC/E
water. While the Soret equilibrium SPC/E water density follows its equation of
state, neither Soret coefficient nor Soret equilibrium solute densitie entail a
coherent agreement with any of the theoretical predictions.

updates with an off-gradient direction, constructed from samples of the RBM

gradient methods. This approach, which we call mode training, promotes faster
training and stability, in addition to lower converged relative entropy (KL

we also demonstrate its efficacy on synthetic datasets where we can compute KL
divergences exactly, as well as on a larger machine learning standard, MNIST.
The mode training we suggest is quite versatile, as it can be applied in
conjunction with any given gradient method, and is easily extended to more
general energy-based neural network structures such as deep, convolutional and
unrestricted Boltzmann machines.

attention recently due to increased applications in sensor networks and

pulse-based synchronization against malicious attacks. However, most existing
results on resilient PCO synchronization are obtained for all-to-all networks.
We propose a new pulse-based synchronization mechanism to improve the
resilience of PCO synchronization that is applicable under general connected
topologies. Under the proposed synchronization mechanism, we rigorously
characterize the condition for stealthy Byzantine attacks and prove that
perfect synchronization of legitimate oscillators can be guaranteed in the
presence of multiple stealthy Byzantine attackers, irrespective of whether the
attackers collude with each other or not. The new mechanism can guarantee
resilient synchronization even when the initial phases of legitimate
oscillators are widely distributed in a half circle, which is in distinct
difference from most existing attack-resilient synchronization algorithms
(including the seminal paper from Lamport and Melliar-Smith [1]) that require a
priori (almost) synchronization among legitimate oscillators. Numerical
simulation results are given to confirm the theoretical results.

interaction in the low-energy effective action of type II strings compactified

which satisfy Poisson rather than Laplace-type equations. In earlier work, it
was proposed that the exact coefficient is given by a two-loop integral in
exceptional field theory, with the full spectrum of mutually 1/2-BPS states
running in the loops, up to the addition of a particular Langlands-Eisenstein
series. Here we compute the weak coupling and large radius expansions of these
automorphic functions for any $d$. We find perfect agreement with perturbative
string theory up to genus three, along with non-perturbative corrections which
have the expected form for 1/8-BPS instantons and bound states of 1/2-BPS
instantons and anti-instantons. The additional Langlands-Eisenstein series
arises from a subtle cancellation between the two-loop amplitude with 1/4-BPS
states running in the loops, and the three-loop amplitude with mutually 1/2-BPS
states in the loops. For $d=4$, the result is shown to coincide with an
alternative proposal in terms of a covariantised genus-two string amplitude,
due to interesting identities between the Kawazumi-Zhang invariant of genus-two
curves and its tropical limit, and between double lattice sums for the particle

  methods","StarAI has a 6 page limit excluding references",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Single-site Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a variant of MCMC in which a
single coordinate in the state space is modified in each step. Structured
relational models are a good candidate for this style of inference. In the
single-site context, second order methods become feasible because the typical
cubic costs associated with these methods is now restricted to the dimension of
each coordinate. Our work, which we call Newtonian Monte Carlo (NMC), is a
method to improve MCMC convergence by analyzing the first and second order
gradients of the target density to determine a suitable proposal density at
each point. Existing first order gradient-based methods suffer from the problem
of determining an appropriate step size. Too small a step size and it will take
a large number of steps to converge, while a very large step size will cause it
to overshoot the high density region. NMC is similar to the Newton-Raphson
update in optimization where the second order gradient is used to automatically
scale the step size in each dimension. However, our objective is to find a
parameterized proposal density rather than the maxima.
  As a further improvement on existing first and second order methods, we show
that random variables with constrained supports don't need to be transformed
before taking a gradient step. We demonstrate the efficiency of NMC on a number
of different domains. For statistical models where the prior is conjugate to
the likelihood, our method recovers the posterior quite trivially in one step.
However, we also show results on fairly large non-conjugate models, where NMC
performs better than adaptive first order methods such as NUTS or other inexact
scalable inference methods such as Stochastic Variational Inference or
bootstrapping.

$\mathcal{O}(n^\omega \mathcal{Z}_q)$ then, by optimizing the trade-off, the

larger than those typical in the ISM. Larger variability on short timescales is

topic model, a relatively standard pre-processing step is to first build a
vocabulary of frequent words. Such a general pre-processing step is often
independent of the topic modeling stage, and thus there is no guarantee that
the pre-generated vocabulary can support the inference of some optimal (or even
meaningful) topic models appropriate for a given task, especially for computer
vision applications involving ""visual words"". In this paper, we propose a new
approach to topic modeling, termed Vocabulary-Selection-Embedded
Correspondence-LDA (VSEC-LDA), which learns the latent model while
simultaneously selecting most relevant words. The selection of words is driven
by an entropy-based metric that measures the relative contribution of the words
to the underlying model, and is done dynamically while the model is learned. We
present three variants of VSEC-LDA and evaluate the proposed approach with
experiments on both synthetic and real databases from different applications.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of built-in vocabulary selection and
its importance in improving the performance of topic modeling.

their vital role in power electronic converters for downhole subsea

MOSFETs with wide band gap materials have been proposed such as silicon carbide
(SiC) and gallium nitride (GaN) as an alternative to existing silicon (Si)
based MOSFETs and IGBTs. However, reliability analysis should be performed
before substituting SiC-MOSFETs in the place of existing Si-MOSFETs and IGBTs.
Due to costly equipment of experimental test setup for accelerated life test, a
good reliable and precise simulation-based test bench should be used to test
the life test procedure before implementing actual hardware. Therefore, this
paper introduces a power cycle (PC) test bench for accelerated life testing for
reliability assessment of SiC-MOSFET in harsh offshore environment. The
introduced test bench is a simulation-based of power switch in SimScape and
LTspice and has been validated with datasheet of 1.2 kV SiC-MOSFET,
CAS300M12BM2 by CREE. Preliminary hardware circuits are also shown for further
experimental tests. The captured data from the Device-Under-Test (DUT) in
different ambient temperatures are envisioned and provide critical information
about the failure mechanisms and lifetime characteristics of power devices. The
provided lifetime characteristics data of SiC-MOSFET can be used to
statistically estimate the Remaining-Useful-Lifetime (RUL) of component in a
real application such as downhole motor drives.

reconstructing strands in DNA-based storage systems. Under this paradigm, a

and the goal of the decoder is to output the transmitted word or some close

channels and studying the error probability of the maximum-likelihood (ML)
decoder under this setup. First, it is discussed how the ML decoder operates.
Then, we observe that the dominant error patterns are deletions in the same run
or errors resulting from alternating sequences. Based on these observations, it
is derived that the error probability of the ML decoder is roughly
$\frac{3q-1}{q-1}p^2$, when the transmitted word is any $q$-ary sequence and
$p$ is the channel's deletion probability. We also study the cases when the
transmitted word belongs to the Varshamov Tenengolts (VT) code or the shifted
VT code. Lastly, the insertion channel is studied as well. These theoretical
results are verified by corresponding simulations.

  Embedding Approach",,,,,"cs.FL cs.CC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It can be shown that each permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be
embedded, in a well defined sense, in a connected graph with $O(n+|G|)$
vertices. Some groups, however, require much fewer vertices. For instance,
$S_n$ itself can be embedded in the $n$-clique $K_n$, a connected graph with n
vertices. In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar
generating a finite permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded
by three structural parameters of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of
vertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree. More precisely, we show that
any permutation group $G \sqsubseteq S_n$ that can be embedded into a connected
graph with $m$ vertices, treewidth k, and maximum degree $\Delta$, can also be
generated by a context-free grammar of size $2^{O(k\Delta\log\Delta)}\cdot
m^{O(k)}$. By combining our upper bound with a connection between the extension
complexity of a permutation group and the grammar complexity of a formal
language, we also get that these permutation groups can be represented by
polytopes of extension complexity $2^{O(k \Delta\log \Delta)}\cdot m^{O(k)}$.
The above upper bounds can be used to provide trade-offs between the index of
permutation groups, and the number of vertices, treewidth and maximum degree of
connected graphs embedding these groups. In particular, by combining our main
result with a celebrated $2^{\Omega(n)}$ lower bound on the grammar complexity
of the symmetric group $S_n$ we have that connected graphs of treewidth
$o(n/\log n)$ and maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$ embedding subgroups of $S_n$ of
index $2^{cn}$ for some small constant $c$ must have $n^{\omega(1)}$ vertices.
This lower bound can be improved to exponential on graphs of treewidth
$n^{\varepsilon}$ for $\varepsilon<1$ and maximum degree $o(n/\log n)$.

$O(n \log n)$ parallel reduction algorithm. Experimental performance results
show that the proposed reduction method is $\sim 3.2 \times$ faster than a
conventional GPU reduction implementation, and preserves the numerical
precision because the sub-results of each chain of $R$ MMAs is kept as a 32-bit
floating point value, before being all reduced into as a final 32-bit result.
The chained MMA design allows a flexible configuration of thread-blocks; small
thread-blocks of 32 or 128 threads can still achieve maximum performance using
a chain of $R=4,5$ MMAs per block, while large thread-blocks work best with
$R=1$. The results obtained in this work show that tensor cores can indeed
provide a significant performance improvement to non-Machine Learning

been measured from ground-based spectroscopic surveys. This will allow a

of high strain rate or low vorticity, a process otherwise known as preferential
concentration. This can be observed in geophysical flows, and is inferred to
occur in astrophysical environments, often resulting in rapid particle growth
which is critical to physical processes such as rain or planet formation. Here
we study the effects of preferential concentration in a two-way coupled system
in the context of the particle-driven convective instability. To do so, we use
Direct Numerical Simulations and adopt the two-fluid approximation. We focus on
a particle size range for which the latter is valid, namely when the Stokes
number is $\lesssim O(0.1)$. For Stokes number above $\sim 0.01$, we find that
the maximum particle concentration enhancement over the mean scales with the
rms fluid velocity $u_{\rm{rms}}$, the particle stopping time $\tau_p$, and the
particle diffusivity $\kappa_p$, as $u_{\rm{rms}}^2 \tau_p / \kappa_p$. We show
that this scaling can be understood from simple arguments of dominant balance.
We also show that the typical particle concentration enhancement over the mean
scales as $(u_{\rm{rms}}^2 \tau_p/ \kappa_p)^{1/2}$. We finally find that the
probability distribution function of the particle concentration enhancement
over the mean has an exponential tail whose slope scales as $(u_{\rm{rms}}^2
\tau_p / \kappa_p)^{-1/2}$. We apply our model to geophysical and astrophysical

order-isomorphic subsequences of $\pi$ are called twins. How long twins are
contained in every permutation? The well known Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres theorem
implies that there is always a pair of twins of length $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. On
the other hand, by a simple probabilistic argument Gawron proved that for every
$n\geqslant 1$ there exist permutations with all twins having length
$O(n^{2/3})$. He conjectured that the latter bound is the correct size of the
longest twins guaranteed in every permutation. We support this conjecture by
showing that almost all permutations contain twins of length
$\Omega(n^{2/3}/\log n^{1/3})$. Recently, Bukh and Rudenko have tweaked our
proof and removed the log-factor. For completeness, we also present our version
of their proof (see Remark 1.2 below on the interrelation between the two
proofs).
  In addition, we study several variants of the problem with diverse
restrictions imposed on the twins. For instance, if we restrict attention to
twins avoiding a fixed permutation $\tau$, then the corresponding extremal
function equals $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$, provided that $\tau$ is not monotone. In
case of block twins (each twin occupies a segment) we prove that it is
$(1+o(1))\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}$, while for random permutations it is twice
as large. For twins that jointly occupy a segment (tight twins), we prove that
for every $n$ there are permutations avoiding them on all segments of length
greater than $24$.

surface gravities and metallicities for 21 M-dwarfs observed at high-resolution
(R $\sim$ 22,500) in the \textit{H}-band as part of the SDSS-IV APOGEE survey.
The atmospheric parameters and metallicities are derived from spectral
syntheses with 1-D LTE plane parallel MARCS models and the APOGEE
atomic/molecular line list, together with up-to-date H$_{2}$O and FeH molecular
line lists. Our sample range in $T_{\rm eff}$ from $\sim$ 3200 to 3800K, where
eleven stars are in binary systems with a warmer (FGK) primary, while the other
10 M-dwarfs have interferometric radii in the literature. We define an
$M_{K_{S}}$--Radius calibration based on our M-dwarf radii derived from the
detailed analysis of APOGEE spectra and Gaia DR2 distances, as well as a
mass-radius relation using the spectroscopically-derived surface gravities. A
comparison of the derived radii with interferometric values from the literature
finds that the spectroscopic radii are slightly offset towards smaller values,
with $\Delta$ = -0.01 $\pm$ 0.02 $R{\star}$/$R_{\odot}$. In addition, the
derived M-dwarf masses based upon the radii and surface gravities tend to be
slightly smaller (by $\sim$5-10\%) than masses derived for M-dwarf members of
eclipsing binary systems for a given stellar radius. The metallicities derived
for the 11 M-dwarfs in binary systems, compared to metallicities obtained for
their hotter FGK main-sequence primary stars from the literature, shows
excellent agreement, with a mean difference of [Fe/H](M-dwarf - FGK primary) =
+0.04 $\pm$ 0.18 dex, confirming the APOGEE metallicity scale derived here for
M-dwarfs.

angle of the strings over that bridge, produces string tension modulation that
is first order in the amplitude of the string motion. This note refines a
previous suggestion regarding the impact on the frequencies of the strings' and
bridge's motion. For a given mode frequency pair of string and bridge, the
resulting tension modulation produces a new, additional motion characterized by
the sum and difference of the original ones. Strictly speaking, this
corresponds to canonical ""frequency modulation"" only in the limit of modulation
slow compared to the string frequency. The more general result is precisely an
example of what is known as ""parametric oscillation,"" first analyzed by
Rayleigh. The qualitative impact of tension modulation on banjo timbre remains
as suggested previously. It is only the precise math and physics that warrants

formation rate (SFR) and is surrounded by an enormous HI feature stretching
about 60 kpc north and south of the optically visible galaxies. Both the driver
for the high SFR in NGC 4490 and the formation mechanism of the HI structure
are puzzling aspects of this system. We have used mid-infrared Spitzer data to
show that NGC 4490 has a double nucleus morphology. One nucleus is visible in
the optical, while the other is only visible at infrared and radio wavelengths.
We find the optical nucleus and the potential infrared visible nucleus have
similar sizes, masses, and luminosities. Both are comparable in mass and
luminosity to other nuclei found in interacting galaxy pairs and much more
massive and luminous compared with typical non-nuclear star-forming complexes.
We examine possible origin scenarios for the infrared feature, and conclude
that it is likely that NGC 4490 is itself a merger remnant, which is now
interacting with NGC 4485. This earlier encounter provides both a possible
driver for extended star formation in NGC 4490, and multiple pathways for the
formation of the extended HI plume.

solution to five dimensions, the positive frequency modes of the Kaluza-Klein
states generate a power-law term in the effective action that inversely grows
with the instanton size. This causes 5D small instantons to enhance the axion
mass in a way that does not spoil the axion solution to the strong CP problem.
Moreover this enhancement can be much larger than the usual QCD contribution
from large instantons, although it requires the 5D gauge theory to be near the

Here we demonstrate the epitaxial growth of hexagonal LiZnSb, one of the

find that LiZnSb can be grown in an adsorption-controlled window, using an

stabilized with respect to a competing cubic polymorph, as revealed by X-ray
diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements. First-principles
calculations show that for moderate amounts of epitaxial strain and moderate

energy than the hexagonal phase, but only by a few meV per formula unit.
Therefore we suggest that kinetics plays a role in stabilizing the desired

video clip using a natural language sentence. The encoder-decoder framework is
the most popular paradigm for this task in recent years. However, there exist
some problems in the decoder of a video captioning model. We make a thorough
investigation into the decoder and adopt three techniques to improve the
performance of the model. First of all, a combination of variational dropout
and layer normalization is embedded into a recurrent unit to alleviate the
problem of overfitting. Secondly, a new online method is proposed to evaluate
the performance of a model on a validation set so as to select the best
checkpoint for testing. Finally, a new training strategy called professional
learning is proposed which uses the strengths of a captioning model and
bypasses its weaknesses. It is demonstrated in the experiments on Microsoft
Research Video Description Corpus (MSVD) and MSR-Video to Text (MSR-VTT)
datasets that our model has achieved the best results evaluated by BLEU, CIDEr,
METEOR and ROUGE-L metrics with significant gains of up to 18% on MSVD and 3.5%
on MSR-VTT compared with the previous state-of-the-art models.

bridge nodes can be used to glean insights about a network's community
structure, spread of influence and the resilience of the network to faults.
Efficiently computing network properties when the network is fully observed has
received significant attention (Wasserman and Faust 1994; Cook and Holder
2006), however the problem of computing aggregate network properties when there
is missing data attributes has received little attention. Computing these
properties for networks with missing attributes involves performing inference
over the network. Statistical relational learning (SRL) and graph neural
networks (GNNs) are two classes of machine learning approaches well suited for
inferring missing attributes in a graph. In this paper, we study the
effectiveness of these approaches in estimating aggregate properties on
networks with missing attributes. We compare two SRL approaches and three GNNs.
For these approaches we estimate these properties using point estimates such as
MAP and mean. For SRL-based approaches that can infer a joint distribution over
the missing attributes, we also estimate these properties as an expectation
over the distribution. To compute the expectation tractably for probabilistic
soft logic, one of the SRL approaches that we study, we introduce a novel
sampling framework. In the experimental evaluation, using three benchmark
datasets, we show that SRL-based approaches tend to outperform GNN-based
approaches both in computing aggregate properties and predictive accuracy.
Specifically, we show that estimating the aggregate properties as an
expectation over the joint distribution outperforms point estimates.

best of our knowledge, no mobile health (mHealth) solutions can directly
support a user to self-examine their oral health condition. This paper presents
OralCam, the first interactive app that enables end-users' self-examination of
five common oral conditions (diseases or early disease signals) by taking
smartphone photos of one's oral cavity. OralCam allows a user to annotate
additional information (e.g. living habits, pain, and bleeding) to augment the
input image, and presents the output hierarchically, probabilistically and with
visual explanations to help a laymen user understand examination results.
Developed on our in-house dataset that consists of 3,182 oral photos annotated
by dental experts, our deep learning based framework achieved an average
detection sensitivity of 0.787 over five conditions with high localization
accuracy. In a week-long in-the-wild user study (N=18), most participants had

continuously generated by active particles, are intertwined with the

Here we demonstrate important facets of this interplay by exploring dynamics of
swimming bacteria in a liquid crystalline environment with pre-designed
periodic splay and bend in molecular orientation. The bacteria are expelled
from the bend regions and condense into polar jets that propagate and transport
cargo unidirectionally along the splay regions. The bacterial jets remain
stable even when the local concentration exceeds the threshold of bending
instability in a non-patterned system. Collective polar propulsion and
different role of bend and splay are explained by an advection-diffusion model
and by numerical simulations that treat the system as a two-phase active
nematic. The ability of prepatterned liquid crystalline medium to streamline
the chaotic movements of swimming bacteria into polar jets that can carry cargo
along a predesigned trajectory opens the door for potential applications in
cell sorting, microscale delivery and soft microrobotics.

particles of the normal component in superfluid $^4$He (He II) which can be

bubbles in He II and can bind to quantized vortices at sufficiently low
temperatures, thereby allowing for direct visualization of vortex dynamics in
an inviscid superfluid. However, the
$a^{3}\Sigma^+_{u}$${\rightarrow}$$c^{3}\Sigma^+_{g}$ optical absorption line,
which is responsible for the fluorescence imaging of the He$_{2}^{*}$
molecules, is controlled by fluctuations on the bubble shape, and its exact
line profile is not known at low temperatures. In this paper, we present a
bubble model for evaluating the surface fluctuation eigenmodes of the excimers
in He II. The line profile of the
$a^{3}\Sigma^+_{u}{\rightarrow}c^{3}\Sigma^+_{g}$ transition is calculated at
different temperatures by considering both the zero-point and thermal
fluctuations on the bubble shape. We show that, as the temperature drops from
2~K to 20 mK, the peak absorption strength is enhanced by a factor of about
five, accompanying a blueshift of the peak location by about 2 nm. A
double-peak line profile due to the rotational levels of the molecular core can
be resolved. This bubble model also allows us to evaluate the stiffness of the
He$_{2}^{*}$ bubbles and hence their diffusion constant in He II due to
scattering off thermal phonons. Our results will aid the design of future
experiments on imaging quantized vortices in He II using He$_{2}^{*}$ tracers.

inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches
may originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical
reconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects in neural circuits remains
an open question. Herein, we study excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced
neuronal network with biologically realistic synaptic kinetics. It can maintain
irregular spiking dynamics with different levels of synchrony and critical
avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point. We propose a novel
semi-analytical mean-field theory to derive the field equations governing the
network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I balanced state of the
network manifesting irregular individual spiking is characterized by a
macroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point or a periodic
motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in the macroscopic
field. Furthermore, by analyzing public data, we find the coexistence of
irregular spiking and critical avalanches in the spontaneous spiking activities
of mouse cortical slice in vitro, indicating the universality of the observed
phenomena. Our theory unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural
activities in different spatiotemporal scales to coexist and elucidates a
possible origin of the criticality of neural systems. It also provides a novel
tool for analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks and its
relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for
large-scale modeling and computation of cortical dynamics.

Master equation to compute GMFE of GMFG and graphon optimal Markovian policies
(GOMPs) of graphon mean field teams (GMFTs). We consider a large population of
players sequentially making strategic decisions where the actions of each
player affect their neighbors which is captured in a graph, generated by a
known graphon. Each player observes a private state and also a common
information as a graphon mean-field population state which represents the
empirical networked distribution of other players' types. We consider
non-stationary population state dynamics and present a novel backward recursive
algorithm to compute both GMFE and GOMP that depend on both, a player's private
type, and the current (dynamic) population state determined through the
graphon. Each step in computing GMFE consists of solving a fixed-point
equation, while computing GOMP involves solving for an optimization problem. We
provide conditions on model parameters for which there exists such a GMFE.
Using this algorithm, we obtain the GMFE and GOMP for a specific security setup
in cyber physical systems for different graphons that capture the interactions
between the nodes in the system.

Circinus X-1 several times at its very lowest X-ray flux using the high energy
transmission grating spectrometer on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. At a
flux of 1.8$\times10^{-11}$ \ergcm we observed a single 1.6 keV blackbody
spectrum. The observed continuum luminosity of 10$^{35}$ \ergsec is about two
orders of magnitude too low to explain the observed photoionized luminosity
suggesting a much more complex structure of the X-ray source which is partially
or entirely obscured as had been previously suggested. This affects most
emissions from the accretion disk including previously observed accretion disk
coronal line emissions. Instead, the strongest observed photoionized lines are
blueshifted by about $\sim 400$ \kms\ and we suggest that they originate in the
ionized wind of a B5Ia supergaint companion supporting a previous
identification. The neutron star in Cir X-1 is very young and should have a
high magnetic field. At the observed luminosity the emission radius of the
blackbody is small enough to be associated with the accretion hot spot as the
X-ray emitting region. The small emission radius then points to a field
strength below $10^{12}$ G which would be consistent with the observation of
occasional type I X-ray bursts at high magnetic fields. We discuss Cir X-1 in
the context of being a high-mass X-ray binary with some emphasis on a possible
Be-star X-ray binary nature.

hierarchically. Small dark matter halos form first. Then, they grow gradually
via continuous merger and accretion. These halos host the majority of baryonic
matter in the Universe in the form of hot gas and cold stellar phase.
Determining how baryons are partitioned into these phases requires detailed
modeling of galaxy formation and their assembly history. It is speculated that
formation time of the same mass halos might be correlated with their baryonic
content. To evaluate this hypothesis, we employ halos of mass above
$10^{14}\,M_{\odot}$ realized by TNG300 solution of the IllustrisTNG project.
Formation time is not directly observable. Hence, we rely on the magnitude gap
between the brightest and the fourth brightest halo galaxy member, which is
shown that traces formation time of the host halo. We compute the conditional
statistics of the stellar and gas content of halos conditioned on their total
mass and magnitude gap. We find a strong correlation between magnitude gap and
gas mass, BCG stellar mass, and satellite galaxies stellar mass, but not the
total stellar mass of halo. Conditioning on the magnitude gap can reduce the
scatter about halo property--halo mass relation and has a significant impact on
the conditional covariance. Reduction in the scatter can be as significant as
30%, which implies more accurate halo mass prediction. Incorporating the
magnitude gap has a potential to improve cosmological constraints using halo
abundance and allows us to gain insight into the baryon evolution within these
systems.

attracted much interest in the research community. Although many attempts have
been reported, crowd counting remains an open real-world problem due to the
vast scale variations in crowd density within the interested area, and severe
occlusion among the crowd. In this paper, we propose a novel Pyramid
Density-Aware Attention-based network, abbreviated as PDANet, that leverages
the attention, pyramid scale feature and two branch decoder modules for
density-aware crowd counting. The PDANet utilizes these modules to extract
different scale features, focus on the relevant information, and suppress the
misleading ones. We also address the variation of crowdedness levels among
different images with an exclusive Density-Aware Decoder (DAD). For this
purpose, a classifier evaluates the density level of the input features and
then passes them to the corresponding high and low crowded DAD modules.
Finally, we generate an overall density map by considering the summation of low
and high crowded density maps as spatial attention. Meanwhile, we employ two
losses to create a precise density map for the input scene. Extensive
evaluations conducted on the challenging benchmark datasets well demonstrate
the superior performance of the proposed PDANet in terms of the accuracy of
counting and generated density maps over the well-known state of the arts.

the Prism protocol in 2018 and showed that it achieves near-optimal blockchain
throughput while maintaining a similar level of security as bitcoin. Previous
probabilistic security guarantees for the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols
were either established under a simplified discrete-time model or expressed in

strengthened analysis under a more realistic continuous-time model. A fully
rigorous model for blockchains is developed with no restrictions on adversarial
miners except for an upper bound on their aggregate mining rate. The only
assumption on the peer-to-peer network is that all block propagation delays are
upper bounded by a constant. A new notion of ""t-credible blockchains"" is
introduced, which, together with some carefully defined ""typical"" events
concerning block production over time intervals, is crucial to establish
probabilisitic security guarantees in continuous time. A blockchain growth
theorem, a blockchain quality theorem, and a common prefix theorem are
established with explicit probability bounds. Moreover, under a certain typical
event which occurs with probability close to $1$, a valid transaction that is
deep enough in one credible blockchain is shown to be permanent in the sense
that it must be found in} in all future credible blockchains.

including neuroimage analysis. However, to effectively train a high-quality
deep learning model, the aggregation of a significant amount of patient
information is required. The time and cost for acquisition and annotation in
assembling, for example, large fMRI datasets make it difficult to acquire large
numbers at a single site. However, due to the need to protect the privacy of
patient data, it is hard to assemble a central database from multiple
institutions. Federated learning allows for population-level models to be
trained without centralizing entities' data by transmitting the global model to
local entities, training the model locally, and then averaging the gradients or
weights in the global model. However, some studies suggest that private
information can be recovered from the model gradients or weights. In this work,
we address the problem of multi-site fMRI classification with a
privacy-preserving strategy. To solve the problem, we propose a federated
learning approach, where a decentralized iterative optimization algorithm is
implemented and shared local model weights are altered by a randomization
mechanism. Considering the systemic differences of fMRI distributions from
different sites, we further propose two domain adaptation methods in this
federated learning formulation. We investigate various practical aspects of
federated model optimization and compare federated learning with alternative
training strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is promising to
utilize multi-site data without data sharing to boost neuroimage analysis
performance and find reliable disease-related biomarkers. Our proposed pipeline
can be generalized to other privacy-sensitive medical data analysis problems.

VGT is insensitive to the radiative transfer effect. We numerically show the
possibility of constructing 3D magnetic fields tomography through VGT. We find
that the intensity PDFs change their shape from the pure log-normal to a
distribution that exhibits a power-law tail depending on the optical depth for
supersonic turbulence. We conclude the change of CO isotopologs' intensity PDFs
can be independent of self-gravity, which makes the intensity PDFs less
reliable in identifying gravitational collapsing regions. We compute the
intensity PDFs for a star-forming region NGC 1333 and find the change of
intensity PDFs in observation agrees with our numerical results. The synergy of

for effective spatial modeling. Our designed block introduces an additional
inter-block connection to bypass a high-dimensional informative feature before
the bottleneck module across blocks to review the complete past memorized
experiences and rethinks progressively. For inter coding, the current
reconstructed frame interacts with reference frames (peak quality frame and the
nearest adjacent frame) collaboratively at the feature level. For (2), we
extract both intra-frame and inter-frame side information for better context
modeling. A coarse-to-fine partition map based on HEVC partition trees is built
as the intra-frame side information. Furthermore, the warped features of the
reference frames are offered as the inter-frame side information. Our PRN with
intra-frame side information provides 9.0% BD-rate reduction on average
compared to HEVC baseline under All-intra (AI) configuration. While under
Low-Delay B (LDB), Low-Delay P (LDP) and Random Access (RA) configuration, our
PRN with inter-frame side information provides 9.0%, 10.6% and 8.0% BD-rate
reduction on average respectively. Our project webpage is

  Fractional Matchings",,,,,"cs.GT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stable matchings have been studied extensively in social choice literature.
The focus has been mostly on integral matchings, in which the nodes on the two
sides are wholly matched. A fractional matching, which is a convex combination
of integral matchings, is a natural extension of integral matchings. The topic
of stability of fractional matchings has started receiving attention only very
recently. Further, incentive compatibility in the context of fractional
matchings has received very little attention. With this as the backdrop, our
paper studies the important topic of incentive compatibility of mechanisms to
find stable fractional matchings. We work with preferences expressed in the
form of cardinal utilities. Our first result is an impossibility result that
there are matching instances for which no mechanism that produces a stable
fractional matching can be incentive compatible or even approximately incentive
compatible. This provides the motivation to seek special classes of matching
instances for which there exist incentive compatible mechanisms that produce
stable fractional matchings. Our study leads to a class of matching instances
that admit unique stable fractional matchings. We first show that a unique
stable fractional matching for a matching instance exists if and only if the
given matching instance satisfies the conditional mutual first preference
(CMFP) property. To this end, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that makes
ingenious use of envy-graphs to find a non-integral stable matching whenever
the preferences are strict and the given instance is not a CMFP matching
instance. For this class of CMFP matching instances, we prove that every
mechanism that produces the unique stable fractional matching is (a) incentive
compatible and further (b) resistant to coalitional manipulations.

parameters, such as the mass and the interaction couplings. To study the
phenomenology of $\Delta\upsilon$ we model the evolution of DM in terms of a
simplistic and generic Boltzmann-like momentum distribution. Using cosmological
data from the Cosmic Microwave Background, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations, and
Red Luminous Galaxies, we constrain the DM velocity dispersion for a broad
range of masses $10^{-3} eV < m_\chi < 10^9 eV$, finding $\Delta\upsilon_0
\lesssim$ 0.33 km/s (99% CL). Including the EDGES $T_{21}$-measurements, we
extend our study to constrain the baryon-DM interaction in the range of DM
velocities allowed by our analysis. As a consequence, we present new bounds on
two electromagnetic models of DM, namely minicharged particles (MCPs) and
electric dipole moment (EDM). For MCPs, the parameter region that is consistent
with EDGES and independent bounds on cosmological and stellar physics is very
small, pointing to the sub-eV mass regime of DM. A window in the MeV-GeV may
still be compatible with these bounds for MCP models without a hidden photon.
But the EDM parameter region consistent with EDGES is excluded by Big-Bang

has been rapidly growing, while the technology maturity in this domain is still

Additionally, an associated mapping approach is introduced to track the hand

the tracked trace. Finally, we provide a variety of experimental results to

  The proposed platform is built upon three key ideas. First, we use
permissioned blockchains with smart contracts as a technically sound approach
for building the B2B platform. The blockchain deploys smart contracts that
govern the interactions of enterprise buyers and sellers. Second, the smart
contracts are designed using a rigorous analysis of a repeated game model of
the strategic interactions between buyers and sellers. We show that such smart
contracts induce honest behavior from buyers and sellers. Third, we embed
cryptographic regulation protocols into the permissioned blockchain to ensure
that business sensitive information is not revealed to the competitors. We
believe our work is an important step in the direction of building a powerful
B2B platform that maximizes social welfare and enables trusted collaboration

the TDDFT method to a systematic description of the IVD resonances in the Zr,

  The strengths of IVD resonances are calculated using two complementary
methods: TDDFT and FAM-QRPA methods. For the TDDFT results, additional
benchmark calculations have been performed using the well-tested code Sky3D. In
these three models, the important ingredients which have major influence on the
results, such as time-odd potentials, boundary conditions, smoothing
procedures, spurious peaks etc., have been carefully examined.
  The current TDDFT and the Sky3D codes yield almost identical response
functions once both codes use the same time-odd mean fields and absorbing
boundary conditions. The strengths of the IVD resonances calculated using the

giant dipole resonance. Upon seeing a reasonable accuracy offered by the
implemented code, we perform systematic TDDFT calculations for spherical Zr and

Reduced bit precision allows for a larger effective memory and increased

show that, unlike previous 8-bit precision training methods, the proposed
method works out-of-the-box for representative models: ResNet-50, Transformer

loss scaling parameters or keeping certain layers in single precision. We
introduce two learnable statistics of the DNN tensors - shifted and squeezed

thus minimizing the loss in information due to quantization.

non-supporters. In an election, each party nominates exactly one of its
candidates to compete against the other party's. The candidate wins the
election with higher odds if he or she brings more utility for all the people.
We model such competition as a ""two-party election game"" such that each party
is a player with two or more pure strategies corresponding to its potential
candidates, and the payoff of each party is a mixed utility from a selected
pair of competing candidates.
  By looking into the three models, namely, the linear link, Bradley-Terry, and
the softmax models, which differ in how to formulate a candidate's winning odds
against the competing candidate, we show that the two-party election game may
neither have any pure Nash equilibrium nor a bounded price of anarchy.
Nevertheless, by considering the conventional ""egoism"", which states that any
candidate benefits his/her party's supporters more than any candidate from the
competing party does, we prove that the two-party election game in both the
linear link model and the softmax model always has pure Nash equilibria, and
furthermore, the price of anarchy is constantly bounded.

several technological applications and to test the fundamental limits of

could be a valuable resource for such control. Recently, hybrid
electromechanical systems using superconducting qubits, based on
electric-charge mediated coupling, have been quite successful. Here, we realize
a hybrid device, consisting of a superconducting transmon qubit and a
mechanical resonator coupled using the magnetic-flux. The coupling stems from
the quantum-interference of the superconducting phase across the tunnel
junctions. We demonstrate a vacuum electromechanical coupling rate up to 4 kHz
by making the transmon qubit resonant with the readout cavity. Consequently,
thermal-motion of the mechanical resonator is detected by driving the
hybridized-mode with mean-occupancy well below one photon. By tuning qubit away
from the cavity, electromechanical coupling can be enhanced to 40 kHz. In this
limit, a small coherent drive on the mechanical resonator results in the
splitting of qubit spectrum, and we observe interference signature arising from
the Landau-Zener-St\""uckelberg effect. With improvements in qubit coherence,
this system offers a novel platform to realize rich interactions and could
potentially provide full control over the quantum motional states.

organic spacer molecules, are attracting increasing attention as a more robust
analogue to the conventional three-dimensional metal-halide perovskites.
However, reducing the perovskite dimensionality alters their optoelectronic
properties dramatically, yielding excited states that are dominated by bound
electron-hole pairs known as excitons, rather than by free charge carriers
common to their bulk counterparts. Despite the growing interest in
two-dimensional perovskites for both light harvesting and light emitting
applications, the full impact of the excitonic nature on their optoelectronic
properties remains unclear, particularly regarding the spatial dynamics of the
excitons within the two-dimensional (2D) plane. Here, we present direct
measurements of in-plane exciton transport in single-crystalline layered
perovskites. Using time-resolved fluorescence microscopy, we show that excitons
undergo an initial fast, intrinsic normal diffusion through the crystalline
plane, followed by a transition to a slower subdiffusive regime as excitons get
trapped. Interestingly, the early intrinsic exciton diffusivity depends
sensitively on the exact composition of the perovskite, such as the choice of
organic spacer. We attribute these changes in exciton transport properties to
strong exciton-phonon interactions and the formation of large exciton-polarons.
Our findings provide a clear design strategy to optimize exciton transport in
these systems.

benefit-risk assessments of therapies. Compared to efficacy analyses AE
analyses are often rather simplistic. The probability of an AE of a specific
type is typically estimated by the incidence proportion, sometimes the
incidence density or the Kaplan-Meier estimator are proposed. But these
analyses either do not account for censoring, rely on a too restrictive
parametric model, or ignore competing events. With the non-parametric
Aalen-Johansen estimator as the gold-standard, these potential sources of bias
are investigated in a data example from oncology and in simulations, both in
the one-sample and in the two-sample case. As the estimators may have large
variances at the end of follow-up, the estimators are not only compared at the
maximal event time but also at two quantiles of the observed times. To date,
consequences for safety comparisons have hardly been investigated in the
literature. The impact of using different estimators for group comparisons is
unclear, as, for example, the ratio of two both underestimating or
overestimating estimators may or may not be comparable to the ratio of the
gold-standard estimator. Therefore, the ratio of the AE probabilities is also
calculated based on different approaches. By simulations investigating constant
and non-constant hazards, different censoring mechanisms and event frequencies,
we show that ignoring competing events is more of a problem than falsely
assuming constant hazards by use of the incidence density and that the choice
of the AE probability estimator is crucial for group comparisons.

three-point finite volume scheme using relaxation-based approximate Riemann
solvers from Bouchut [Nonlinear stability of finite volume methods for
hyperbolic conservation laws and well-balanced schemes for sources, Birkhauser]
and Coquel and Perthame [SINUM, 35, 1998]. Then, we consider the DGSEM based on
collocation of quadrature and interpolation points which relies on the
framework introduced by Fisher and Carpenter [JCP, 252, 2013] and Gassner
[SISC, 35, 2013]. We replace the physical fluxes in the integrals over
discretization elements by entropy conservative numerical fluxes [Tadmor, MCOM,
49, 1987], while ES numerical fluxes are used at element interfaces. We thus
derive a two-point numerical flux satisfying the Tadmor's entropy conservation
condition and use the numerical flux from the three-point scheme as ES flux.
Time discretization is performed with a strong-stability preserving Runge-Kutta
scheme. We then derive conditions on the numerical parameters to guaranty a
semi-discrete entropy inequality as well as positivity of the cell average of
the partial densities and internal energy of the fully discrete DGSEM at any
approximation order. The later results allow to use existing limiters in order
to restore positivity of nodal values within elements. The scheme also resolves
exactly stationary material interfaces. Numerical experiments in one and two
space dimensions on flows with discontinuous solutions support the conclusions

a factor of 7 higher than the conventional techniques. Using this technique, we
demonstrate the transfer laser light through a 145-km-long, lab-based spooled

an edge server using data distributed at edge devices (e.g., smart-phones and
sensors) without compromising their privacy. In the FEEL framework, edge
devices periodically transmit high-dimensional stochastic gradients to the edge
server, where these gradients are aggregated and used to update a global model.
When the edge devices share the same communication medium, the multiple access
channel (MAC) from the devices to the edge server induces a communication
bottleneck. To overcome this bottleneck, an efficient broadband analog
transmission scheme has been recently proposed, featuring the aggregation of
analog modulated gradients (or local models) via the waveform-superposition
property of the wireless medium. However, the assumed linear analog modulation
makes it difficult to deploy this technique in modern wireless systems that
exclusively use digital modulation. To address this issue, we propose in this
work a novel digital version of broadband over-the-air aggregation, called
one-bit broadband digital aggregation (OBDA). The new scheme features one-bit
gradient quantization followed by digital quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)
at edge devices and over-the-air majority-voting based decoding at edge server.
We provide a comprehensive analysis of the effects of wireless channel
hostilities (channel noise, fading, and channel estimation errors) on the
convergence rate of the proposed FEEL scheme. The analysis shows that the
hostilities slow down the convergence of the learning process by introducing a
scaling factor and a bias term into the gradient norm. However, we show that
all the negative effects vanish as the number of participating devices grows,
but at a different rate for each type of channel hostility.

this study, we construct a varied dataset consisting of the medical records of
1260 patients by sampling data from 9 institutes and three domains of Dutch

this new data. Furthermore, a state-of-the-art neural architecture performs
strongly across languages and domains, even with limited training data.
Compared to feature-based and rule-based methods the neural method requires
significantly less configuration effort and domain-knowledge. We make all code

code Gmunu (General-relativistic multigrid numerical solver) which uses a
multigrid method to solve the elliptic metric equations in the conformally flat
condition (CFC) approximation on a spherical grid. Most of the existing
relativistic hydrodynamics codes are based on formulations which rely on a
free-evolution approach of numerical relativity, where the metric variables are
determined by hyperbolic equations without enforcing the constraint equations
in the evolution. On the other hand, although a fully constrained-evolution
formulation is theoretical more appealing and should lead to more stable and
accurate simulations, such an approach is not widely used because solving the
elliptic-type constraint equations during the evolution is in general more
computationally expensive than hyperbolic free-evolution schemes. Multigrid
methods solve differential equations with a hierarchy of discretizations and
its computational cost is generally lower than other methods such as direct
methods, relaxation methods, successive over-relaxation. With multigrid
acceleration, one can solve the metric equations on a comparable time scale as
solving the hydrodynamics equations. This would potentially make a fully
constrained-evolution formulation more affordable in numerical relativity
simulations. As a first step to assess the performance and robustness of
multigrid methods in relativistic simulations, we develop a hydrodynamics code
that makes use of standard finite-volume methods coupled with a multigrid
metric solver to solve the Einstein equations in the CFC approximation. In this
paper, we present the methodology and implementation of our code Gmunu and its
properties and performance in some benchmarking relativistic hydrodynamics

evolution of urban environments of utmost importance to improve the well-being

emerging properties of cities, leading to the discovery of scaling laws
mirroring, for instance, the dependence of socio-economic indicators on city
sizes. Though scaling laws allow for the definition of city-size independent
socio-economic indicators, only a few efforts have been devoted to the modeling
of the dynamical evolution of cities as mirrored through socio-economic
variables and their mutual influence. In this work, we propose a Maximum
Entropy (ME), non-linear, generative model of cities. We write in particular a
Hamiltonian function in terms of a few macro-economic variables, whose coupling
parameters we infer from real data corresponding to French towns. We first
discover that non-linear dependencies among different indicators are needed for
a complete statistical description of the non-Gaussian correlations among them.
Furthermore, though the dynamics of individual cities are far from being
stationary, we show that the coupling parameters corresponding to different
years turn out to be quite robust. The quasi time-invariance of the Hamiltonian
model allows proposing an analytic model for the evolution in time of the
macro-economic variables, based on the Langevin equation. Despite no temporal
information about the evolution of cities has been used to derive this model,
its forecast accuracy of the temporal evolution of the system is compatible to
that of a model inferred using explicitly such information.

processes driving the build-up of stellar populations and the ensuing star
formation (SF) quenching process in galaxy bulges, therefore potentially
sensitive discriminators between competing theoretical concepts on bulge
formation and evolution. Based on spectral modeling of integral field
spectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey, we derive mass- and light-weighted
stellar age gradients ($\nabla$(t,B)L,M) within the photometrically determined
bulge radius (RB) of a representative sample of local face-on late-type
galaxies that span 2.6 dex in stellar mass. Our analysis documents a trend for
decreasing $\nabla$(t,B)L,M with increasing M,T, with high-mass bulges
predominantly showing negative age gradients and vice versa. The inversion from
positive to negative $\nabla$(t,B)L,M occurs at logM,T ~ 10, which roughly
coincides with the transition from lower-mass bulges whose gas excitation is
powered by SF to bulges classified as Composite, LINER or Seyfert. We discuss
two limiting cases for the origin of radial age gradients in massive LTG
bulges. The first assumes that the stellar age in the bulge is initially
spatially uniform, thus the observed age gradients arise from an inside-out SF
quenching (ioSFQ) front that is radially expanding with a mean velocity vq. In
this case, the age gradients translate into a slow ioSFQ that lasts until z~2,
suggesting mild negative feedback by SF or an AGN. If negative age gradients in
massive bulges are not due to ioSFQ but primarily due to their inside-out
formation process, then the standard hypothesis of quasi-monolithic bulge
formation has to be discarded in favor of a scenario that involves gradual
buildup of stellar mass over 2-3 Gyr through, e.g., inside-out SF and inward
migration of SF clumps from the disk. In this case, rapid AGN-driven ioSFQ
cannot be ruled out.

alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combining the centering
steps used in the interior-point method. The first stage of Centering ADMM
updates the iterate so that it approaches the central path by incorporating a
barrier function term into the objective function, as in the interior-point
method. If the current iterate is sufficiently close to the central path with a
sufficiently small value of the barrier parameter, the method switches to the
standard version of ADMM. We show that Centering ADMM (not employing a dynamic
update of the penalty parameter) has global convergence properties. To observe
the effect of the centering steps, we conducted numerical experiments with SD
relaxation problems of instances in QAPLIB. The results demonstrate that the
centering steps are quite efficient for some classes of instances.

we prove that if a given equilibrium is linearly stable, then the ones
resulting from the application of Bogoyavlenskij symmetry transformations are
linearly stable too, provided that a parameter involved in those

anisotropy, flow, and torsion of a helical magnetic axis, for a specific class

formation process, Asymptotic Giant Branch stellar envelopes and planetary
nebula, external galaxies including starburst galaxies and analogues for the
Milky Way, and the environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Time domain
studies of AGN and protostellar polarization variability will also become

These investigations would benefit from a potential future upgrade adding
450$\mu$m capability to the camera, which would allow inference of spectral

mapping speed and polarization capabilities of the new camera will transform
the JCMT into a true submillimetre polarization survey instrument, offering the

stream. The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational
budget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the
constant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all
incremental states. The bounded memory generates data imbalance in favor of new
classes and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly
countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network
training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling
of past class classifier weights to make them more comparable to those of new
classes. Scaling exploits incremental state level statistics and is applied to
the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes in order to profit from
all their available data. We also question the utility of the widely used
distillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it
to vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory. Evaluation is done
against competitive baselines using four public datasets. Results show that the
classifier weights scaling and the removal of the distillation are both
beneficial.

exploiting two complementary distributed LQR methods. The first consists of a
bottom-up approach in which optimal interactions between self-stabilizing
agents are defined so as to minimize an upper bound of the global LQR

controller is approximated by a distributed control scheme whose stability is
guaranteed by the stability margins of LQR control. In this paper, distributed
observer which minimizes an upper bound of a deterministic performance
criterion, is proposed by solving a dual LQR problem using bottom-up approach.
The cost function is defined by considering minimum-energy estimation theory

beamforming designs for RIS mainly focus on optimizing the spectral efficiency
for single carrier systems. To avoid the complicated bit allocation on
different spatial domain subchannels in MIMO systems, in this paper, we propose
a geometric mean decomposition-based beamforming for RIS-assisted millimeter

by exploiting the common angular-domain sparsity of mmWave massive MIMO
channels over different subcarriers, a simultaneous orthogonal match pursuit
algorithm is utilized to obtain the optimal multiple beams from an oversampling
2D-DFT codebook. Moreover, by only leveraging the angle of arrival and angle of
departure associated with the line of sight (LoS) channels, we further design
the phase shifters for RIS by maximizing the array gain for LoS channel.
Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve better BER
performance than conventional approaches. Our work is an initial attempt to

inferred from proxies of molecular hydrogen (H$_2$), such as carbon monoxide
(CO) or neutral atomic carbon ([CI]) and molecular gas mass conversion factors.
The use of these proxies, however, relies on modeling and observations that
have not been directly measured outside the local universe. Here, we use recent
samples of high-redshift gamma-ray burst (GRB) and quasar molecular gas
absorbers to determine this conversion factor $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ from the
column density of H$_2$, which gives us the mass per unit column, and the
[CI]($J=1$) column density, which provides the luminosity per unit column. This
technique allows us to make direct measurements of the relative abundances in
high-redshift absorption-selected galaxies. Our sample spans redshifts of
z=1.9-3.4 and covers two orders of magnitude in gas-phase metallicity. We find
that $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ scales linearly with the metallicity: $\log
\alpha_{\rm [CI]} = -1.13\times \log(Z/Z_{\odot}) + 1.33$, with a scatter of
$\sigma_{\alpha_{\rm [CI]}} = 0.2$ dex. Using a sample of emission-selected
galaxies at z~0-5, with both [CI] and CO line detections, we apply the
$\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ conversion to derive independent estimates of the molecular
gas mass and $\alpha_{\rm CO}$. We find a remarkable agreement between the
molecular gas masses inferred from the absorption-derived $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$
compared to typical $\alpha_{\rm CO}$-based estimates, and an inferred
metallicity evolution of $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ that is consistent with $\alpha_{\rm
[CI]}$ and previous estimates from the literature. These results thus support
the use of the absorption-derived $\alpha_{\rm [CI]}$ conversion factor for
emission-selected star-forming galaxies and demonstrate that both methods probe
the same universal properties of molecular gas in the local and high-redshift
universe.

spectroscopic data indicates that the distorted CrO6 octahdera, is giving rise
to strain in the sample. Due to this strain, polar regions are forming in an

generic $x_0\in\mathcal S$. Once the limiting function $f_0(\check x)$ is known
(which we call the discrete transition behavior, or DTB for short), the
resolution of reconstruction can be easily found. Next, we show that straight
segments of $\mathcal S$ lead to non-local artifacts in $f_{\Lambda\epsilon}$,
and that these artifacts are of the same strength as the useful singularities
of $f_{\Lambda\epsilon}$. We also show that $f_{\Lambda\epsilon}(x)$ does not
converge to its continuous analogue $f_\Lambda=(-\Delta)^{1/2}f$ as
$\epsilon\to0$ even if $x\not\in\mathcal S$. Results of numerical experiments
presented in the paper confirm these conclusions. We also consider a class of
Fourier integral operators $\mathcal{B}$ with the same canonical relation as
the classical Radon transform adjoint, and a class of distributions
$g\in\mathcal{E}'(Z_n)$, $Z_n:=S^{n-1}\times\mathbb R$, and obtain easy to use
formulas for the DTB when $\mathcal{B} g$ is computed from discrete data
$g(\alpha_{\vec k},p_j)$. Exact and LT reconstructions are particlular cases of
this more general theory.

an equivalent probability measure, focusing on American options we show that

be remedied by imposing time consistency on exercise policies, but in general
persists even in this case, which compounds the familiar issue that valuing an
option using this measure may not result in an arbitrage free value. An
alternative and known approach bypasses both of these pitfalls by optimizing
option exercise policies under any given equivalent martingale measure and
anchoring quadratic hedging to the resulting value of this policy. Additional

Therefore, heat transport systems are necessary to cool the electronic
components effectively. Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are such heat transport systems,
which use evaporation and condensation to reach a higher heat transfer
coefficient than with sole heat conduction. The operating temperature of the
LHP governs the temperature of the electronic components, but depends on the
amount of dissipated heat and the temperature of the heat sink. For this
reason, a control heater on the LHP provides the ability to control the
operating temperature at a fixed setpoint temperature. For the model-based
control design of the control heater controller, the current LHP state-space
model in the literature focuses on the setpoint response without modeling the
fluid's dynamics. However, the fluid's dynamics determine the disturbance
behavior of the LHP. Therefore, the fluid's dynamics are incorporated into a
new LHP state-space model, which is not only able to simulate the LHP behavior
under disturbance changes, but is also used for the model-based design of a
robust nonlinear controller, which achieves an improved control performance

as an optimal technology to speed up the response of large sparse linear

dual delineation approach. This involves a single groundwater flow solve and a
pure advective transport solve with different right-hand sides. The new solver
was compared with traditional preconditioned iterative methods and direct
sparse solvers on several two- and three-dimensional benchmark problems
spanning homogeneous and heterogeneous formations. For the groundwater flow
problems, using the algebraic multigrid preconditioning speeds up the numerical
solution by one to two orders of magnitude. Contrarily, a sparse direct solver
was the most efficient for the pure advective transport processes such as the
forward travel time simulations. Hence, the best sparse solver for the more
general advection-dispersion transport equation is likely to be P\'eclet number
dependent. When equipped with the best solvers, processing multimillion grid
blocks by the dual delineation approach is a matter of seconds. This paves the
way for routine time-consuming tasks such as sensitivity analysis. The paper
gives practical hints on the strategies and conditions under which algebraic
multigrid preconditioning for the class of nonlinear and/or transient problems
would remain competitive.

threat to the safe operation of plasma nuclear fusion reactors. A critical
aspect of understanding RE dynamics is to calculate the runaway probability,
i.e., the probability that an electron in the phase space will runaway on, or
before, a prescribed time. Such probability can be obtained by solving the
adjoint equation of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation that controls the
electron dynamics. In this effort, we present a sparse-grid probabilistic
scheme for computing the runaway probability. The key ingredient of our
approach is to represent the solution of the adjoint equation as a conditional
expectation, such that discretizing the differential operator reduces to the
approximation of a set of integrals. Adaptive sparse grid interpolation is
utilized to approximate the map from the phase space to the runaway
probability. The main novelties of this effort are the integration of the
sparse-grid method into the probabilistic numerical scheme for computing escape
probability, as well as the demonstration in computing RE probabilities. Two
numerical examples are given to illustrate that the proposed method can achieve
$\mathcal{O}(\Delta t)$ convergence, as well as the adaptive refinement
strategy can effectively handle the sharp transition layer between the runaway

called Generalized Konishi Anomaly, we show that dimensional transmutation via
gaugino condensation {\emph{in the ultraviolet}} drives gauge symmetry breaking
in a large class of {\emph{asymptotically strong}} Super Yang Mills Higgs
theories. For Adjoint multiplet type chiral superfields $\Phi$ (transforming as
$r \times \bar r$ representations of a non Abelian gauge group G), solution of
the Generalized Konishi Anomaly(GKA) equations allows calculation of quantum
corrected VEVs in terms of the dimensional transmutation scale $\Lambda_{UV}
\simeq M_X \, e^{\frac{8\pi^2}{ g^2(M_X) b_0}} $ which determines the gaugino
condensate. Thus the gauge coupling at the perturbative unification scale $M_X$
generates GUT symmetry breaking VEVs by non-perturbative dimensional
transmutation. This obviates the need for large(or any) input mass scales in
the superpotential. Rank reduction can be achieved by including pairs of chiral
superfields transforming as either $({\bf Q}(r),{ \bf\bar Q}(\bar r))$ or $
(\Sig((r\otimes r)_{symm})), \Sigb(({\bar r \otimes\bar r})_{symm})$, that form
trilinear matrix gauge invariants $\bar Q\cdot \Phi\cdot Q, \Sigb \cdot
\Phi\cdot \Sig $ with $\Phi$. Novel, robust and {\emph{ultraminimal}} Grand
unification algorithms emerge from the analysis. We sketch the structure of a
realistic Spin(10) model, with the $16$-plet of Spin(10) as the base
representation $r$, which mimics the realistic Minimal Supersymmetric GUT but
contains even fewer free parameters. We argue that our results point to a large

a learning procedure, in which we learn a control sequence capable of driving
the unknown target state coherently to a simple fiducial state, so that the
target state can be directly reconstructed by applying the control sequence
reversely. In this manner, the state tomography problem is converted to a
state-to-state transfer problem. To solve the latter problem, we use the
closed-loop learning control approach. Our scheme is further experimentally
tested using techniques of a 4-qubit nuclear magnetic resonance. {Experimental

when a growing planet opens a gap in its disk the flow of gas into the gap is
dominated by gas falling vertically from a height of at least one gas scale
height. Our primary objective is to include, for the first time, the chemical
impact that accreting gas above the midplane will have on the resulting C/O. We
compute the accretion of gas onto planetary cores beginning at different disk
radii and track the chemical composition of the gas and small icy grains to
predict the resulting carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) in their atmospheres. In our
model, all of the planets which began their evolution inward of 60 AU open a
gap in the gas disk, and hence are chemically affected by the vertically
accreting gas. Two important conclusions follow from this vertical flow: (1)
more oxygen rich icy dust grains become available for accretion onto the
planetary atmosphere. (2) The chemical composition of the gas dominates the
final C/O of planets in the inner ($<$ 20 AU) part of the disk. This implies
that with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope we can trace the disk
material that sets the chemical composition of exoplanetary atmospheres.

between the epitaxial layer and the substrate in order to reduce the
defectiveness and improve the overall quality of the SiC epi-film. In
particular, we find that the morphology and the quality of the epi-film depends
on the carbonization temperature and the concentration of Ge in close proximity
of the Si1-xGex/SiC interface. Ge segregation at the interface influences the
film quality, and in particular a [Ge]>12% in close proximity to the interface
leads to the formation of poly-crystalls, while close to 10% induces a mirror
like morphology. Moreover, by finely tuning the Ge concentration and
carbonization temperature, crystal quality higher than that observed for SiC
grown on bare silicon is achieved.

  Under some restricted invertibility conditions on the maximum likelihood

chose a unique polar-nonpolar LaMnO3/SrIrO3 superlattice because Mn (3d)/Ir
(5d) oxides exhibit rich magnetic behaviors and strong spin-orbit coupling

then effectively modify the magnetization, tilt of the ferromagnetic easy axis,
and symmetry transition of the anisotropic magnetoresistance of the

Freeman-Durden concept is an active research line in PolSAR field according to
the considerable attention it has deserved along the last twenty years.
Certainly, most of subsequent proposals have been driven by the only objective
of getting a better qualitative balance among scattering mechanisms according
to theoretical expectations. This idea is not a negative aspect per se, as has
led to a more rigorous understanding of orientation effects in both urban and
natural areas and hence to improved land cover classifications. However, an
in-depth quantitative analysis on the output parameters is usually lacking in
this topic. The attention has been mostly paid to the power of dominant
contributions, whereas the accuracy and interpretation of other parameters
useful for practical applications have been almost systematically overlooked.
The questions that remain to be answered are: What is the actual role of all
parameters describing the models? Can we assign them a consistent physical
interpretation or are some of them acting just as fitting parameters? The
present work aims to promote the discussion on these open issues regarding the
quantitative assessment of model-based PolSAR decomposition schemes. To proceed
with, we have simulated the coherency matrix according to one of existing
general models and different scenarios. The inversion performance has been
analysed in terms of the histograms of output parameters, standard deviation
and bias. The analysis reveals that even the backscattering powers associated
with all three basic scattering mechanisms are estimated with a non-negligible
error higher than 10% for some cases. Despite these conclusions are subject to
a particular model and inversion approach they suggest that a careful
consideration of physically-based decompositions outcomes should be taken.

Magellanic Clouds represent a natural anchor for the ladder, due to their
proximity and the very well known geometric distance. Accordingly, the LACES

containing more than 300 stars and more than 1200 medium-high resolution
spectra. Abundance measurements, performed by equivalent width and curve of
growth analysis, have been tested on a wide grid of synthetic spectra to
quantify the systematic arising from this procedure. We focus on the errors
arising from temperature measurements, using the Line Depth Ratio method. We
find that in order to not bias the final results many aspects (e.g. degeneracy
of the atmospheric parameters, instrumental set up etc.) should be explicitly
taken into account. In particular, there is a not negligible metallicity

disk around an invisible object similar to {\epsilon} Aur. The system is
characterized by grey and asymmetric eclipses every 5.6 yr, with a significant
variation in their photometric depth, ranging from ~ 0 m .5 to ~ 2 m .0. Aims.
The main aim of the observational campaign of the EE Cep eclipse in 2014 was to
test the model of disk precession (Galan et al. 2012). We expected that this
eclipse would be one of the deepest with a depth of ~ 2 m .0. Methods. We
collected multicolor observations from almost 30 instruments located in Europe
and North America. This photometric data covers 243 nights during and around
the eclipse. We also analyse the low- and high-resolution spectra from several
instruments. Results. The eclipse was shallow with a depth of 0 m .71 in
V-band. The multicolor photometry illustrates small color changes during the
eclipse with a total amplitude of order ~ +0 m . 15 in B-I color index. The
linear ephemeris for this system is updated by including new times of minima,
measured from the three most recent eclipses at epochs E = 9, 10 and 11. New
spectroscopic observations were acquired, covering orbital phases around the
eclipse, which were not observed in the past and increased the data sample,
filling some gaps and giving a better insight into the evolution of the H
{\alpha} and NaI spectral line profiles during the primary eclipse.
Conclusions. The eclipse of EE Cep in 2014 was shallower than expected 0 m .71
instead of ~ 2 m . 0. This means that our model of disk precession needs
revision.

enthalpy of Mach 5. Prior experiments measured a freestream turbulence
intensity at the inflow to the cavity ranging from 10 - 15%. A synthetic
turbulence inflow generator was implemented for the simulations in this work to
reproduce the turbulence at the inflow to the cavity. Velocity perturbations
and turbulence intensity generated by the turbulent inflow boundary condition
are shown to match those values measured in the facility using particle induced
velocimetry. Simulations were performed both with and without inflow turbulence
to study the effect of turbulence on flame stability and structure. In both
cases, a cavity-stabilized flame was achieved. The inflow turbulence promoted
more robust combustion, causing the flame to propagate further from the cavity
into the core flow, broadening the flame angle with respect to the axial flow
direction. The flame angle captured in the simulation agrees with experimental
results and theoretical prediction. The cavity's vortex shedding frequency was
identified. Flame strain rate and pressure fluctuations in the cavity shear
layer were also measured and found to vary periodically at a frequency equal to
that of the vortex shedding. High flow strain rate in the cavity shear layer,
driven by the vortex shedding process, is identified as a cause of flame
stretching and low OH concentrations as the flame traverses the cavity ramp.
The effect of spatial resolution on the simulations is discussed through a
comparison of cases using second-order and third-order accurate discontinuous
Galerkin finite elements.

Mobility of this boundary in Cu is strongly dependent on the direction of the
applied driving force. The mobility anisotropy generally becomes smaller, but
does not disappear completely, as temperature is increased. In contrast, the

illustrating that the anisotropic mobility phenomenon is material-dependent.

of the intrabinary shock formed by the colliding winds of the pulsar and the
companion. A more detailed inspection of energy resolved modulations than
previously reported gives hints of a mild softening at superior conjunction of
the pulsar below 3keV, likely due to the contribution of the thermal emission
from the neutron star. The intrabinary shock emission, if extending into the
MeV range, would be energetically capable alone to irradiate the donor star.

now map our nearest galaxies in 3D at fidelities never before achievable.
Combining data from the OGLE-IV catalogue with mid-infrared photometry from the

to trace the 3D structure of the Magellanic Clouds. An automated photometry
pipeline has been developed to obtain precise mean magnitudes and light curves
for Cepheids in the Magellanic System, which in turn produces distance
measurements for individual Cepheids accurate to 5%. The resulting detailed

topic. To produce PBHs with this mass, the primordial scalar power spectrum
needs to be enhanced to the order of 0.01 at the scale $k\sim 10^{12}\
\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. The enhanced power spectrum also produces large secondary
gravitational waves at the mHz band. A phenomenological delta function power
spectrum is usually used to discuss the production of PBHs and secondary
gravitational waves. Based on G and k inflations, we propose a new mechanism to
enhance the power spectrum at small scales by introducing a non-canonical
kinetic term $[1-2G(\phi)]X$ with the function $G(\phi)$ having a peak. Away
from the peak, $G(\phi)$ is negligible and we recover the usual slow-roll
inflation which is constrained by the cosmic microwave background anisotrpy
observations. Around the peak, the slow-roll inflation transiently turns to
ultra slow-roll inflation. The enhancement of the power spectrum can be
obtained with generic potentials, and there is no need to fine tune the
parameters in $G(\phi)$. The energy spectrum $\Omega_{GW}(f)$ of secondary
gravitational waves have the characteristic power law behaviour
$\Omega_{GW}(f)\sim f^{n}$ and is testable by pulsar timing array and space
based gravitational wave detectors.

elastic scattering with nucleons through the exchange of Higgs bosons is highly
suppressed due to its pseudo-Goldstone boson nature. The model is therefore
free from the constraints arising from direct DM detection experiments. We
identify regions of the model parameter space for reproducing the observed DM
density compatible with the constraints from the Large Hadron Collider and the
indirect DM searches by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC.

semi-supervised learning where a learning algorithm has access to a small set

by applying pseudo-labels to samples in the unlabeled set by using a model
trained on the combination of the labeled samples and any previously
pseudo-labeled samples, and iteratively repeating this process in a
self-training cycle. Current methods seem to have abandoned this approach in
favor of consistency regularization methods that train models under a
combination of different styles of self-supervised losses on the unlabeled
samples and standard supervised losses on the labeled samples. We empirically
demonstrate that pseudo-labeling can in fact be competitive with the
state-of-the-art, while being more resilient to out-of-distribution samples in
the unlabeled set. We identify two key factors that allow pseudo-labeling to
achieve such remarkable results (1) applying curriculum learning principles and
(2) avoiding concept drift by restarting model parameters before each

One of the offspring of technological change is the SBTC, which is for many
economists the leading cause of the increasing wage inequality. However,
despite that the technological change affected similarly the majority of the
developed countries, nevertheless, the level of the increase of wage inequality
wasn't similar. Following the predictions of the SBTC theory, the different
levels of inequality could be due to varying degrees of skill inequality
between economies, possibly caused by variations in the number of skilled
workers available. However, recent research shows that the difference mentioned
above can explain a small percentage of the difference between countries.
Therefore, most of the resulting inequality could be due to the different ways
in which the higher level of skills is valued in each labor market. The
position advocated in this article is that technological change is largely
given for all countries without much scope to reverse. Therefore, in order to
illustrate the changes in the structure of wage distribution that cause wage
inequality, we need to understand how technology affects labor market
institutions.In this sense, the pay inequality caused by technological progress
is not a phenomenon we passively accept. On the contrary, recognizing that the
structure and the way labor market institutions function is largely influenced
by the way institutions respond to technological change, we can understand and
maybe reverse this underlying wage inequality.

the possibility of thermalon mediated phase transition. We observe that the
phase transitions of the charged case is possible in which the required

also discover that the critical temperature and the coupling $\lambda$ of the

wide range of applications, including agriculture, aerial photography, and

from drones becomes highly demanding, bringing computer vision and drones more
and more closely. To promote and track the developments of object detection and
tracking algorithms, we have organized three challenge workshops in conjunction
with ECCV 2018, ICCV 2019 and ECCV 2020, attracting more than 100 teams around
the world. We provide a large-scale drone captured dataset, VisDrone, which
includes four tracks, i.e., (1) image object detection, (2) video object
detection, (3) single object tracking, and (4) multi-object tracking. In this
paper, we first present a thorough review of object detection and tracking
datasets and benchmarks, and discuss the challenges of collecting large-scale
drone-based object detection and tracking datasets with fully manual
annotations. After that, we describe our VisDrone dataset, which is captured
over various urban/suburban areas of 14 different cities across China from
North to South. Being the largest such dataset ever published, VisDrone enables
extensive evaluation and investigation of visual analysis algorithms for the
drone platform. We provide a detailed analysis of the current state of the
field of large-scale object detection and tracking on drones, and conclude the
challenge as well as propose future directions. We expect the benchmark largely
boost the research and development in video analysis on drone platforms. All

convergence rate by $O(\varepsilon^{1/2})$. Equipped with the error estimates,
we developed both interior and boundary Lipschitz estimates at large-scales. As

cooperate with each other to fulfill a special goal. Analyzing this network
yields meaningful information about the expertise of these experts and their
subject areas. To perform the analysis, graph embedding techniques have emerged
as an effective and promising tool. Graph embedding attempts to represent graph
nodes as low-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose a graph embedding
method, called ExEm, that uses dominating-set theory and deep learning
approaches to capture node representations. ExEm finds dominating nodes of the
collaborative network and constructs intelligent random walks that comprise of
at least two dominating nodes. One dominating node should appear at the
beginning of each path sampled to characterize the local neighborhoods.
Moreover, the second dominating node reflects the global structure information.
To learn the node embeddings, ExEm exploits three embedding methods including
Word2vec, fastText and the concatenation of these two. The final result is the
low-dimensional vectors of experts, called expert embeddings. The extracted
expert embeddings can be applied to many applications. In order to extend these
embeddings into the expert recommendation system, we introduce a novel strategy
that uses expert vectors to calculate experts' scores and recommend experts. At
the end, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ExEm
through assessing its performance over the multi-label classification, link
prediction, and recommendation tasks on common datasets and our collected data
formed by crawling the vast author Scopus profiles. The experiments show that
ExEm outperforms the baselines especially in dense networks.

efficiently by human administrators, particularly when they operate in
uncertain and dynamic environments and require frequent changes.
Requirements-driven adaptation techniques have been proposed to endow systems
with the necessary means to autonomously decide ways to satisfy their
requirements. However, many current approaches rely on general-purpose
languages, models and/or frameworks to design, develop and analyze autonomous
systems. Unfortunately, these tools are not tailored towards the
characteristics of adaptation problems in autonomous systems. In this paper, we
present Optimal by Design (ObD ), a framework for model-based
requirements-driven synthesis of optimal adaptation strategies for autonomous
systems. ObD proposes a model (and a language) for the high-level description
of the basic elements of self-adaptive systems, namely the system,
capabilities, requirements and environment. Based on those elements, a Markov
Decision Process (MDP) is constructed to compute the optimal strategy or the
most rewarding system behaviour. Furthermore, this defines a reflex controller
that can ensure timely responses to changes. One novel feature of the framework
is that it benefits both from goal-oriented techniques, developed for
requirement elicitation, refinement and analysis, and synthesis capabilities
and extensive research around MDPs, their extensions and tools. Our preliminary
evaluation results demonstrate the practicality and advantages of the
framework.

need for studies that summarise scientific research. An increasingly common
review is a 'Methodology scoping review', which provides a summary of existing
analytical methods, techniques and software, proposed or applied in research
articles, which address an analytical problem or further an analytical
approach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation and reporting
are limited.
  Methods: Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated
through a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarise the challenges
inherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of
best practice to promote future guideline development.
  Results: We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping
review. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the
search terms a priori and the language used for a particular method can vary
across the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful
consideration since new methodology is often not described (in full) within
abstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical
question, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary
materials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing
review guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to
defining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes.
  Conclusion: Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of
research, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardise their design,
implementation and reporting. We recommend a wider discussion on this topic.

impact on precipitation in different parts of the world. In this research, the
impact of El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation
(PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on seasonal precipitation over Iran
was investigated. For this purpose, 103 synoptic stations with at least 30
years of data were utilized. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the
indices in the previous 12 months with seasonal precipitation was calculated,
and the meaningful correlations were extracted. Then the month in which each of
these indices has the highest correlation with seasonal precipitation was
determined. Finally, the overall amount of increase or decrease in seasonal
precipitation due to each of these indices was calculated. Results indicate the
Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), NAO, and PDO have the most impact on seasonal
precipitation, respectively. Also, these indices have the highest impact on the
precipitation in winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively. SOI has a
diverse impact on winter precipitation compared to the PDO and NAO, while in
the other seasons, each index has its special impact on seasonal precipitation.
Generally, all indices in different phases may decrease the seasonal
precipitation up to 100%. However, the seasonal precipitation may increase more
than 100% in different seasons due to the impact of these indices. The results
of this study can be used effectively in water resources management and
especially in dam operation.

thus improves the precision of sentence split; then we introduce Permutation
Invariant Training to alleviate the effects of order variance in seq2seq
learning for this task. Experiments on the WebSplit-v1.0 benchmark dataset show
that our approaches can largely improve the performance over the previous
seq2seq learning approaches. Moreover, an extrinsic evaluation on oie-benchmark
verifies the effectiveness of our approaches by an observation that splitting
long sentences with our state-of-the-art model as preprocessing is helpful for
improving OpenIE performance.

  September 28 30, 2005, Konya, Turkey",,,,"q-bio.TO physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Strokes are still one of the leading causes for death after heart diseases
and cancer in all over the world. Most strokes happen because an artery that
carries blood uphill from the heart to the head gets clogged. Most of the time,
as with heart attacks, the problem is atherosclerosis, hardening of the
arteries, calcified buildup of fatty deposits on the vessel wall. The primary
troublemaker is the carotid artery, one on each side of the neck, the main
thoroughfare for blood to the brain. Only within the last 25 years, though,
have researchers been able to put their finger on why the carotid is especially
susceptible to atherosclerosis. In this study, the fluid dynamic simulations
were done in a carotid bifurcation under the steady flow conditions
computationally. In vivo geometry and boundary conditions were obtained from a
diseased who has both sides of stenosis located in his carotid artery patients.
The location of critical flow fields such as low wall shear stress (WSS),
stagnation regions and separation regions were detected. Low WSS was found at
the downstream of the bifurcation.

occurrence of an event when the system is in state s. A function p from S to
[0,1] is called a numerical event or alternatively, an S-probability. If a set
P of S-probabilities is ordered by the order of real functions it becomes a
poset which can be considered as a quantum logic. In case P is a Boolean
algebra this will indicate that the underlying physical system is a classical
one. The goal of this paper is to study sets of S-probabilities which are not
far from being Boolean algebras, especially by means of the addition and
comparison of functions that occur in these sets. In particular, certain
classes of Boolean posets of S-probabilities are characterized and related to
each other and descriptions based on sets of states are derived.

  Programming","16 pages, 6 figures",,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.LG cs.NE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  This paper proposes a model based on gene expression programming for
predicting the discharge coefficient of triangular labyrinth weirs. The
parameters influencing discharge coefficient prediction were first examined and
presented as crest height ratio to the head over the crest of the weir, a crest
length of water to channel width, a crest length of water to the head over the
crest of the weir, Froude number and vertex angle dimensionless parameters.
Different models were then presented using sensitivity analysis in order to
examine each of the dimensionless parameters presented in this study. In
addition, an equation was presented through the use of nonlinear regression
(NLR) for the purpose of comparison with GEP. The results of the studies
conducted by using different statistical indexes indicated that GEP is more
capable than NLR. This is to the extent that GEP predicts the discharge
coefficient with an average relative error of approximately 2.5% in such a
manner that the predicted values have less than 5% relative error in the worst
model.

misconduct, which should better be detected in the reviewing process. However,
due to large number of submissions, the detection whether a picture is
fabricated or reused is laborious for reviewers, and sometimes is indistinct
with human eyes. A tool for detecting similarity between images may help to
alleviate this problem. Some methods based on local feature points matching
work for most of the time, while these methods may result in mess of matchings
due to ignorance of global relationship between features. We present a
framework to detect similar, or perhaps fabricated, pictures with the graph
matching techniques. A new iterative method is proposed, and experiments show
that such a graph matching technique is better than the methods based only on
local features for some cases.
