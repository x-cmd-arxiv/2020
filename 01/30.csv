between consciousness and the material world remains to be explored. We applied
a new logic tool, the non-identity law, to the analysis of the visual dynamics
related to the naturalistic observation of a night-shot still life. We show
that visual awareness possesses a postponed, recurrent out-of-body projection
pathway and that the out-of-body projection is superimposed onto the original,
which is reciprocally verified by vision and touch. This suggests that the
visual system instinctually not only represents the subjective image
(brain-generated imagery) but also projects the image back onto the original or
to a specific place according to the cues of the manipulated afferent messenger
light signaling pathway. This finding provides a foundation for understanding
the subjectivity and intentionality of consciousness from the perspective of
visual awareness and the isomorphic relations between an unknowable original,
private experience, and shareable expression. The result paves the way for
scientific research on consciousness and facilitates the integration of
humanities and natural science.

rewriting rules. The rules replace every symbol in a string in parallel with a
successor to produce the next string, and this procedure iterates. In a
stochastic context-free L-system (S0L-system), every symbol may have one or
more rewriting rule, each with an associated probability of selection. Properly
constructed rewriting rules have been found to be useful for modeling and
simulating some natural and human engineered processes where each derived
string describes a step in the simulation. Typically, processes are modeled by
experts who meticulously construct the rules based on measurements or domain
knowledge of the process. This paper presents an automated approach to finding
stochastic L-systems, given a set of string sequences as input. The implemented
tool is called the Plant Model Inference Tool for S0L-systems (PMIT-S0L).
PMIT-S0L is evaluated using 960 procedurally generated S0L-systems in a test
suite, which are each used to generate input strings, and PMIT-S0L is then used
to infer the system from only the sequences. The evaluation shows that PMIT-S0L
infers S0L-systems with up to 9 rewriting rules each in under 12 hours.
Additionally, it is found that 3 sequences of strings is sufficient to find the
correct original rewriting rules in 100% of the cases in the test suite, and 6
sequences of strings reduces the difference in the associated probabilities to
approximately 1% or less.

Despite identifying magnon modes at the zone boundary, the team was unable to
parameterise the low energy magnetic excitation spectrum below $T\rm{_{N}}$
using conventional pseudo-bosonic approaches. It would not be for another 40
years that Roger, now at Oxford and motivated by the discovery of the
high-$T_{c}$ cuprate superconductors [Bednorz & Muller 1986 Z. Phys. B
$\mathbf{64}$ 189], would make another attempt at the parameterisation of the
magnetic excitation spectrum that had previously alluded him. Upon his return
to CoO, Roger found a system embroiled in controversy, with some of its most
fundamental parameters still remaining undetermined. Faced with such a
formidable task, Roger performed a series of inelastic neutron scattering
experiments in the early 2010's on both CoO and a magnetically dilute
structural analogue MgO. These experiments would prove instrumental in the
determination of both single-ion [Cowley $\textit{et al.}$ 2013 Phys. Rev. B

longtime friend and collaborator Bill Buyers, to successfully parameterise the

spectacular failures and intermittent, yet profound, little victories.

binaries is to first construct a waveform in a non-inertial, co-precessing
binary source frame followed by a time-dependent rotation to map back to the
physical, inertial frame. A key insight in the construction of these models is
that the co-precessing waveform can be effectively mapped to some equivalent
aligned spin waveform. Secondly, the time-dependent rotation implicitly
introduces $m$-mode mixing, necessitating an accurate description of
higher-order modes in the co-precessing frame. We assess the efficacy of this
modelling strategy in the strong field regime using Numerical Relativity
simulations. We find that this framework allows for the highly accurate
construction of $(2,\pm 2)$ modes in our data set, while for higher order
modes, especially the $(2,|1|), (3,|2|)$ and $(4,|3|)$ modes, we find rather
large mismatches. We also investigate a variant of the approximate map between
co-precessing and aligned spin waveforms, where we only identify the slowly
varying part of the time domain co-precessing waveforms with the aligned-spin
one, but find no significant improvement. Our results indicate that the simple
paradigm to construct precessing waveforms does not provide an accurate
description of higher order modes in the strong-field regime, and demonstrate
the necessity for modelling mode asymmetries and mode-mixing to significantly
improve the description of precessing higher order modes.

of the structure theory of vector lattices. If $X$ is such a lattice, those
notions seem - at first glance - intimately related to the lattice operations
on $X$. The last fifteen years, though, have seen an extension of all those
concepts to a much larger class of ordered vector spaces.
  In fact if $X$ is an Archimedean ordered vector space with generating cone,
or a member of the slightly larger class of pre-Riesz spaces, then the notions
of disjointness, bands and band projections can be given proper meaning and
give rise to a non-trivial structure theory.
  The purpose of this note is twofold: (i) We show that, on any pre-Riesz
space, the structure of the space of all band projections is remarkably close
to what we have in the case of vector lattices. In particular, this space is a
Boolean algebra. (ii) We give several criteria for a pre-Riesz space to already
be a vector lattice. These criteria are coined in terms of disjointness and
closely related concepts, and they mark how lattice-like the order structure of
pre-Riesz spaces can get before the theory collapses to the vector lattice

loadings and shrink the idiosyncratic errors. Closed-form solutions are
provided for the penalized optimization problems. Theoretical results
demonstrate that the modified estimators achieve faster convergence rates and
lower asymptotic mean squared errors when the underlying network structure
among individuals is correct. An interesting finding is that even if the priori
network is totally misleading, the proposed estimators perform no worse than
conventional state-of-art methods. Furthermore, to facilitate the practical
application, we propose a data-driven approach to select the tuning parameters,
which is computationally efficient. We also provide an empirical criterion to
determine the number of common factors. Simulation studies and application to
the S&P100 weekly return dataset convincingly illustrate the superiority and
adaptivity of the new approach.

shocks, associated with deceleration of infalling baryons. Such shocks,
characterized by a very high Mach number, are present even in 1D models of
cluster evolution. Another class is composed of ""runaway merger shocks"", which
appear when a merger shock, driven by a sufficiently massive infalling
subcluster, propagates away from the main-cluster center. We argue that, when
the merger shock overtakes the accretion shock, a new long-living shock is
formed that propagates to large distances from the main cluster (well beyond
its virial radius) affecting the cold gas around the cluster. We refer to these
structures as Merger-accelerated Accretion shocks (MA-shocks) in this paper. We
show examples of such MA-shocks in 1D and 3D simulations and discuss their
characteristic properties. In particular, (1) MA-shocks shape the boundary
separating the hot intracluster medium (ICM) from the unshocked gas, giving
this boundary a ""flower-like"" morphology. In 3D, MA-shocks occupy space between
the dense accreting filaments. (2) Evolution of MA-shocks highly depends on the
Mach number of the runaway merger shock and the mass accretion rate parameter
of the cluster. (3) MA-shocks may lead to the misalignment of the ICM boundary
and the splashback radius.

arc-lengths to comprehensively test uniformity and independence of SHP. We
performed our analysis on the scales limited by spherical harmonic modes $\le$
128, to restrict ourselves to signal-dominated regions. To find the non-uniform

Monte Carlo simulated uniformly random sets of SHP and use 0.05 and 0.001

multistable branches of discrete localized states (dLSs), corresponding to
different number of active elements in the array. These branches are either
independent of each other or are organized into a snaking bifurcation diagram
where the width of the dLS grows via a process of successive increase and
decrease of the gain. Mechanisms are revealed by which the snaking branches can
be created and destroyed as a second parameter, e.g., the linewidth enhancement
factor or the coupling strength are varied. For increasing couplings, the

classification plays an important role in human identification as preprocess
step. So far, various methods have been proposed to solve this problem.
Absolutely, classification accuracy is the main challenge for researchers in
gender classification. But, some challenges such as rotation, gray scale
variations, pose, illumination changes may be occurred in smart phone image
capturing. In this respect, a multi step approach is proposed in this paper to
classify genders in human face images based on improved local binary patters
(MLBP). LBP is a texture descriptor, which extract local contrast and local
spatial structure information. Some issues such as noise sensitivity, rotation
sensitivity and low discriminative features can be considered as disadvantages
of the basic LBP. MLBP handle disadvantages using a new theory to categorize
extracted binary patterns of basic LBP. The proposed approach includes two
stages. First of all, a feature vector is extracted for human face images based
on MLBP. Next, non linear classifiers can be used to classify gender. In this
paper nearest neighborhood classifier is evaluated based on Tani-Moto metric as
distance measure. In the result part, two databases, self-collected and ICPR
are used as human face database. Results are compared by some state-ofthe-art
algorithms in this literature that shows the high quality of the proposed
approach in terms of accuracy rate. Some of other main advantages of the
proposed approach are rotation invariant, low noise sensitivity, size invariant
and low computational complexity. The proposed approach decreases the
computational complexity of smartphone applications because of reducing the
number of database comparisons. It can also improve performance of the
synchronous applications in the smarphones because of memory and CPU usage
reduction.

Global oscillations of shell H ingestion in two of the RAWD simulations cause
bursts of entrainment of H and non-radial hydrodynamic feedback. With the same

reproduces the rate and location of the H burning within the He shell closely
matching the 3D simulation predictions, as well as qualitatively displaying the

resilience. We investigated the basis of this behavior across scales of
observations by coupling time-lapse (4-D) tomographic imaging of macroscopic
mechanical stressing with structural microscopy and chemical spectroscopy on
Roman marine concrete (RMC) from ancient harbors in Italy and Israel.
Stress-strain measurements revealed that RMC creeps and exhibits a ductile
deformation mode. The permeability of specimens from Italy were found to be low
due to increased matrix-aggregate bonding. Structural and chemical imaging
shows the presence of well-developed sulfur-rich, fibrous minerals that are
intertwined and embedded in a crossbred matrix having the chemical traits of
both a calcium-aluminum-silicate-hydrate and a geopolymer. This latter likely
reflects the ultra-alkaline volcanic nature of the primary source materials. We
hypothesize that the fine interweave of sulfur-rich fibers within this
crossbred matrix enhances aggregate bonding, which altogether contributes to
the durability of RMC.

However, an accurate description of Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ by first-principles
methods like density functional theory is far from trivial due to its complex
electronic structure, with a variety of energetically close electronic and
magnetic states. It was found that the local density approximation as well as
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) are unable to describe
Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ correctly. Here, we report an extensive benchmark for
different Li$_x$Mn$_y$O$_z$ systems using the hybrid functionals PBE0 and
HSE06, as well as the recently introduced local hybrid functional PBE0r. We
find that all of these functionals yield energetic, structural, electronic, and
magnetic properties in good agreement with experimental data. The notable
benefit of the PBE0r functional, which relies on on-site Hartree-Fock exchange
only, is a much reduced computational effort that is comparable to GGA
functionals. Furthermore, the Hartree-Fock mixing factors in PBE0r are smaller
than in PBE0, which improves the results for (lithium) manganese oxides. The
investigation of Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$ shows that two Mn oxidation states, +III and
+IV, coexist. The Mn$^\text{III}$ ions are in the high-spin state and the
corresponding MnO$_6$ octahedra are Jahn-Teller distorted. The ratio between
Mn$^\text{III}$ and Mn$^\text{IV}$ and thus the electronic structure changes
with the Li content while no major structural changes occur in the range from
$x=0$ to $1$. This work demonstrates that the PBE0r functional provides an
equally accurate and efficient description of the investigated

that could be detected by spacecraft cameras. Deposits emplaced by larger
plumes could be detected by cameras operating at visible wavelengths provided
that their average particle size is sufficiently large, their porosity is high,
and/or they are salt-rich. Conversely, deposits emplaced by large plumes could
be easily detected by near-IR imagers regardless of porosity, or individual
particle size or composition. If low-albedo deposits flanking lineated features
on Europa are indeed cryoclastic mantlings, they were likely emplaced by plumes
that were less than 4 km tall, and deposition could be ongoing today.

thermodynamic equilibrium in a hypothetical life form inhabiting black hole

Weak-lensing cosmological constraints will also soon reach higher levels of
precision with next-generation surveys like LSST, WFIRST and Euclid. We use the
MassiveNus simulations to derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses
$M_{\nu}$, the present-day total matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$, and the
primordial power spectrum normalization $A_{\rm s}$ in a tomographic setting.
We measure the lensing power spectrum as second-order statistics along with
peak counts as higher-order statistics on lensing convergence maps generated
from the simulations. We investigate the impact of multiscale filtering
approaches on cosmological parameters by employing a starlet (wavelet) filter
and a concatenation of Gaussian filters. In both cases peak counts perform
better than the power spectrum on the set of parameters [$M_{\nu}$,
$\Omega_{\rm m}$, $A_{\rm s}$] respectively by 63$\%$, 40$\%$ and 72$\%$ when
using a starlet filter and by 70$\%$, 40$\%$ and 77$\%$ when using a multiscale
Gaussian. More importantly, we show that when using a multiscale approach,
joining power spectrum and peaks does not add any relevant information over
considering just the peaks alone. While both multiscale filters behave
similarly, we find that with the starlet filter the majority of the information
in the data covariance matrix is encoded in the diagonal elements; this can be
an advantage when inverting the matrix, speeding up the numerical

instead of optimization, not the prior, or Bayes rule. Bayesian inference is
especially compelling for deep neural networks. (1) Neural networks are
typically underspecified by the data, and can represent many different but high
performing models corresponding to different settings of parameters, which is
exactly when marginalization will make the biggest difference for both
calibration and accuracy. (2) Deep ensembles have been mistaken as competing
approaches to Bayesian methods, but can be seen as approximate Bayesian
marginalization. (3) The structure of neural networks gives rise to a
structured prior in function space, which reflects the inductive biases of
neural networks that help them generalize. (4) The observed correlation between
parameters in flat regions of the loss and a diversity of solutions that
provide good generalization is further conducive to Bayesian marginalization,
as flat regions occupy a large volume in a high dimensional space, and each
different solution will make a good contribution to a Bayesian model average.

contact conditions at such surfaces. The bulk rock deformation is simulated
using low-order continuous finite elements, while frictional contact conditions
are imposed by means of a Lagrange multiplier method. We employ a cell-centered
finite-volume scheme to solve the fracture fluid mass balance equation. From a
modeling perspective, a convenient choice is to use a single grid for both
mechanical and flow processes, with piecewise-constant interpolation of
Lagrange multipliers, i.e., contact tractions and fluid pressure.
Unfortunately, this combination of displacement and multiplier variables is not
uniformly inf-sup stable, and therefore requires a stabilization technique.
Starting from a macroelement analysis, we develop two algebraic stabilization
approaches and compare them in terms of robustness and convergence rate. The
proposed approaches are validated against challenging analytical two- and
three-dimensional benchmarks to demonstrate accuracy and robustness. These
benchmarks include both pure contact mechanics problems and well as problems
with tightly-coupled fracture flow.

at the infrared core (IRC), N1 at the radio core near nonthermal source TH2,
and the fainter sources N2 and N3 in the northeast. The line profile is
characterized by a primary component with $\Delta
v_{\mathrm{primary}}$$\sim$90-130 km s$^{-1}$ (FWHM) on top of a broad {blue}
wing with $\Delta v_{\mathrm{broad}}$$\sim$300-350 km s$^{-1}$, and an
additional redshifted narrow component in the west. The velocity field
generated from our cube reveals several distinct patterns. A mean NE-SW
velocity gradient of +10 km s$^{-1}$ arcsec$^{-1}$ along the major axis traces
the solid-body rotation curve of the nuclear disk. At the radio core,
isovelocity contours become S-shaped, indicating the presence of secondary
nuclear bar of total extent $\sim$5$''$ (90 pc). The symmetry of the bar places
the galactic center near the radio peak TH2 of the galaxy rather than the IRC,
and makes this the most likely location of a SMBH. A third kinematic
substructure is formed by blueshifted gas on the southeast side of the IRC.
This feature provides evidence for a $\sim$100-250 km s$^{-1}$ starburst-driven
outflow potentially responsible for powering the kpc-scale galactic wind of NGC

networks. In particular, it is used to study long time behavior such as
phase-locking where all oscillators rotate at a common frequency with fixed
angle differences. It has been observed that phase-locking occurs if the
natural frequencies of the oscillators are sufficiently close to each other,
and doesn't if they aren't. Intuitively, the closer the natural frequencies are
to each other the more stable the system is. In this paper, we study the
Kuramoto model on ring networks with positive coupling between the oscillators
and derive a criterion for a bifurcation in which two branches of phase-locked
solutions collide as we increase the coupling strengths. Furthermore, we state
a criterion for when one of these branches consists of stable phase-locked
solutions. In this case stability is lost as the positive coupling is
increased. We then apply our criteria to show that for any size of the ring
network there always exists choices of the natural frequencies and coupling
strengths so that this bifurcation occurs. (We require at least five
oscillators for one branch to consist of stable phase-locked solutions.)
Finally, we conjecture that generically our bifurcation is locally a
subcritical bifurcation and globally an $S$-curve. (In the case where one
branch consists of phase-locked solutions, an $S$-curve results in bistability
i.e. the existence of two distinct stable phase-locked solutions.) Finally, we
note that our methods are constructive.

with wide > 5"" separation composed by ultracool dwarfs companions to stars,
plus nine double ultracool dwarf systems. These systems were selected based on
common distance criteria. About 90% of the total sample has proper motions
available and 73% of the systems also satisfy a common proper motion criterion.
The sample of ultracool candidates was taken from the Dark Energy Survey (DES)
and the candidate stellar primaries are from Gaia DR2 and DES data. We compute
chance alignment probabilities in order to assess the physical nature of each
pair. We find that 174 candidate pairs with Gaia DR2 primaries and 81 pairs
with a DES star as a primary have chance alignment probabilities < 5%. Only
nine candidate systems composed of two ultracool dwarfs were identified. The
sample of candidate multiple systems is made up of five triple systems and one
quadruple system. The majority of the ultracool dwarfs found in binaries and
multiples are of early L type and the typical wide binary fraction over the L
spectral types is 2-4%. Our sample of candidate wide binaries with ultracool
dwarfs as secondaries constitutes a substantial increase over the known number
of such systems, which are very useful to constrain the formation and evolution
of ultracool dwarfs.

Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-like model however, in general, the overlap between

the edge states of the finite system, which retain their topological
protection, appear to be either attenuated or amplified. This phenomenon,
called ""edge polarisation"", is usually associated with an underlying
non-Hermitian topology. By investigating the bulk system, we show that the
resulting tight-binding eigenvalue problem may be made to appear non-Hermitian
in this physical 'atomic' (lattice-site) basis. The resulting {\it effective}
bulk Hamiltonian possesses ${\cal PT}$-symmetry and its topological invariant,
interpreted in terms of a non-Hermitian classification, is found to be given by
a bulk winding number of $\mathbb{Z}$-type. The observation of edge
polarisation, through the established bulk-boundary correspondence, is then
interpreted as an emerging non-Hermitian skin-effect of the {\it effective}
bulk Hamiltonian. Therefore, the overlap matrix generates non-Hermitian-like
effects in an otherwise Hermitian problem; a general fact applicable to a
broader range of systems than just the one studied here.

However, contrarily to the exact, extremely precise, and robust quantization of
the Hall conductance, the pumped charge is strictly quantized only when the
pumping time is a multiple of a characteristic timescale, i.e., the pumping
cycle duration. Here, we show instead that the pumped current becomes exactly
quantized, independently from the pumping time, if the system is led into a
quasiperiodic, incommensurate regime. In this quasiperiodic and topologically
nontrivial state, the Bloch bands and the Berry curvature become flat, the
pumped charge becomes linear in time, while the current becomes steady,
topologically quantized, and proportional to the Chern number. The quantization
of the current is exact up to exponentially small corrections. This has to be
contrasted with the case of the commensurate (nonquasiperiodic) regime, where
the current is not constant, and the pumped charge is quantized only at integer
multiples of the pumping cycle.

sample of dense cores and filaments in the cloud and study their properties.
The densest clouds of the Ophiuchus complex, L1688 and L1689, which thus far
are only indirectly described as filamentary regions owing to the spatial
distribution of their young stellar objects (YSOs), are confirmed to be
dominated by filamentary structures. The tight correlation observed between
prestellar cores and filamentary structures in L1688 and L1689 supports the
view that solar-type star formation occurs primarily in dense filaments. While
the sub clouds of the complex show disparities, L1689 being less efficient than
L1688 at forming stars when considering their total mass budgets, both sub
clouds share almost the same prestellar core formation efficiency in dense
molecular gas. We also find evidence in the Herschel data for a remarkable
concentric geometrical configuration in L1688 which is dominated by up to three
arc-like compression fronts and presumably created by shockwave events
emanating from the Sco OB2 association, including the neighboring massive (O9V)
star ${\sigma}$ Sco.

contributions from core-collapse supernovae of type II. A comparison to the
scaled solar r-pattern shows that the lighter neutron-capture elements
(37<Z<60) are poorly matched. In particular, we find imprints of the weak
r-process acting at low metallicities. Nonetheless, by comparing our detailed
abundances to the observed metal-poor star BD +17 3248, we find a persistent
residual pattern that is indicative of enrichment contributions from the

rotating AGB stars at low metallicity considerably improves the fit. Based on a
solar ratio of heavy- to light-s elements -- at odds with model predictions for
the i-process -- and a missing clear residual pattern with respect to other

weak, entering only logarithmically, starting at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. We
carefully study all sources of uncertainties, paying special attention to

maintained by our choice of renormalization scale variation. In the computation
of the experimental uncertainty for the moment ratios, the correlations among
individual moments are properly taken into account. Additionally, in the
perturbative contributions to experimental vector-current moments,
$\alpha_s(m_Z)$ is kept as a free parameter such that our extraction of the
strong coupling is unbiased and based only on experimental data. The most
precise extraction of $\alpha_s$ from vector correlators comes from the ratio
of the charm-quark moments $R_c^{V,2}$ and reads $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1168\pm

moments, using the ratio $R_b^{V,2}$, we find $\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1186\pm0.0048$.
Our results from the lattice pseudo-scalar charm correlator agree with the

our more conservative study of the perturbative error. Averaging the results

$\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1177\pm0.0020$. Combining experimental and lattice information

discs. The leading theory regarding the origin of these patterns is that they
are due to dust trapping at the edges of gas gaps induced by the gravitational
torques from embedded planets. If the concentration of solids at the gap edges
becomes high enough, it could potentially result in planetesimal formation by
the streaming instability. We test this hypothesis by performing global 1-D
simulations of dust evolution and planetesimal formation in a protoplanetary
disc that is perturbed by multiple planets. We explore different combinations
of particle sizes, disc parameters, and planetary masses, and find that
planetesimals form in all these cases. We also compare the spatial distribution
of pebbles from our simulations with protoplanetary disc observations. Planets
larger than one pebble isolation mass catch drifting pebbles efficiently at the
edge of their gas gaps, and depending on the efficiency of planetesimal
formation at the gap edges, the protoplanetary disc transforms within a few
100,000 years to either a transition disc with a large inner hole devoid of
dust or to a disc with narrow bright rings. For simulations with planetary
masses lower than the pebble isolation mass, the outcome is a disc with a
series of weak ring patterns but no strong depletion between the rings.
Lowering the pebble size artificially to 100 micrometer-sized ""silt"", we find
that regions between planets get depleted of their pebble mass on a longer
time-scale of up to 0.5 million years. These simulations also produce fewer
planetesimals than in the nominal model with millimeter-sized particles and
always have at least two rings of pebbles still visible after 1 Myr.

regions. These surveys found a power-law relation between $M_{\rm{dust}}$ and
$M_{\star}$ that steepens in time, but which is also flatter for transition
disks (TDs). We performed dust evolution models, which included perturbations
to the gas surface density with different amplitudes to investigate the effect
of particle trapping on the $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation. These
perturbations were aimed at mimicking pressure bumps that originated from
planets. We focused on the effect caused by different stellar and disk masses
based on exoplanet statistics that demonstrate a dependence of planet mass on
stellar mass and metallicity. Models of dust evolution can reproduce the
observed $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ relation in different star-forming regions
when strong pressure bumps are included and when the disk mass scales with
stellar mass (case of $M_{\rm{disk}}=0.05\,M_\star$ in our models). This result
arises from dust trapping and dust growth beyond centimeter-sized grains inside
pressure bumps. However, the flatter relation of $M_{\rm{dust}}-M_{\star}$ for
TDs and disks with substructures cannot be reproduced by the models unless the
formation of boulders is inhibited inside pressure bumps. In the context of
pressure bumps originating from planets, our results agree with current
exoplanet statistics on giant planet occurrence increasing with stellar mass,
but we cannot draw a conclusion about the type of planets needed in the case of
low-mass stars. This is attributed to the fact that for $M_\star<1\,M_\odot$,
the observed $M_{\rm{dust}}$ obtained from models is very low due to the
efficient growth of dust particles beyond centimeter-sizes inside pressure
bumps.

are detected in the Lyman-$\alpha$ line in the second, third and fifth epochs,
which could arise from the extended planetary thermosphere and a tail of
stellar wind protons neutralised via charge-exchange with the planetary
exosphere. We propose that increases in the X-ray irradiation of the planet,
and decreases in its EUV irradiation causing lower photoionisation rates of
neutral hydrogen, favour the detection of these signatures by sustaining larger
densities of H$^{0}$ atoms in the upper atmosphere and boosting
charge-exchanges with the stellar wind. Deeper and broader absorption
signatures in the last epoch suggest that the planet entered a different

scientific attention, as the gapless Dirac electronic band structure opens up
relaxation channels that are not allowed in conventional materials. We report
Fermi-level-dependent mid-infrared emission in graphene originating from a
previously unobserved decay channel: hot plasmons generated from optically
excited carriers. The observed Fermi-level dependence rules out Planckian light
emission mechanisms and is consistent with the calculated plasmon emission
spectra in photoinverted graphene. Evidence for bright hot plasmon emission is
further supported by Fermi-level-dependent and polarization-dependent resonant
emission from graphene plasmonic nanoribbon arrays under pulsed laser
excitation. Spontaneous plasmon emission is a bright emission process as our
calculations for our experimental conditions indicate that the spectral flux of
spontaneously generated plasmons is several orders of magnitude higher than
blackbody emission at a temperature of several thousand Kelvin. In this work,
it is shown that a large enhancement in radiation efficiency of graphene
plasmons can be achieved by decorating graphene surface with gold nanodisks,
which serve as out-coupling scatterers and promote localized plasmon excitation
when they are resonant with the incoming excitation light. These observations
set a framework for exploration of ultrafast and ultrabright mid-infrared
emission processes and light sources.

metals science due to its essential contribution to the strength of steels and
most engineering alloys. Yet the basic, atomistic mechanisms leading to
martensite nucleation and twin morphology are not yet known. A detailed picture
in this regard is required if the strengthening effects of martensite are to be
properly understood. This work presents molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
the martensitic transformation using a model fcc/bcc semi-coherent interface
with Nishiyama-Wasserman orientation relationship. Significant insight into
this important phenomenon is detailed in this work which shows that the atomic
displacements that cause nucleation and twin morphology formation of the
martensitic phase originate at the fcc/bcc interface. The interface facilitates
the initial atomic shear during the transformation which in turn causes the
stress-induced homogeneous nucleation and twin morphology formation. The
understanding of the atomistic processes leading to the twin morphology
formation will allow the control of the twinning process for further
enhancement of mechanical properties.

consider dry (Coulomb) friction between rigid scales surfaces, and the

that the friction has a dual contribution on the system by advancing the
locking mechanism due to change of mechanism from purely kinematic to
interfacial behavior, and stiffening the twist response due to increase the
engagement forces. We also discovered, by increasing the coefficient of
friction using engineering scale surfaces to a critical coefficient, the system
could reach to an instantaneous post-engagement locking. The developed model
outlines analytical relationships between geometry, deformation, frictional
force and kinematic energy, to design biomimetic scale-covered metamaterials

($\simeq 75-85\%$) being due to a decrease in the HI/dust covering fractions in

data-flow functions over a finite domain. On-demand data-flow analyses restrict
the focus of the analysis on specific program locations and data facts. This
setting provides a natural split between (i) an offline (or preprocessing)
phase, where the program is partially analyzed and analysis summaries are
created, and (ii) an online (or query) phase, where analysis queries arrive on
demand and the summaries are used to speed up answering queries.
  In this work, we consider on-demand IFDS analyses where the queries concern
program locations of the same procedure (aka same-context queries). We exploit
the fact that flow graphs of programs have low treewidth to develop faster
algorithms that are space and time optimal for many common data-flow analyses,

query solutions that are embarrassingly parallelizable, i.e. the total work for

solutions train two types of heterogeneous networks (multi-phase) separately
for the candidate generation and the False Positive Reduction (FPR) purposes.
In this paper, we enforce an end-to-end 3D Aggregated Faster R-CNN solution by
stacking an ""aggregated classifier branch"" on the backbone of RPN. This
classifier branch is equipped with Feature Aggregation and Local Magnification
Layers to enhance the classifier branch. We demonstrate our model can achieve
the state of the art performance on both LUNA16 and DeepLesion dataset.
Especially, we achieve the best single-model FROC performance on LUNA16 with
the inference time being 4.2s per processed scan.

geometrical variation to evaluate the influence of a rear underbody diffuser
which are commonly applied in high performance and race cars to improve
downforce. We perform parametric studies on the rear diffuser angle of two
baseline configurations of the Ahmed body: the first with a 0 degree upper
slant angle and the second with a 25 degrees slant angle. We employ a
high-fidelity CFD simulation based on the spectral/hp element discretisation
that combines classical mesh refinement with polynomial expansions in order to
achieve both geometrical refinement and better accuracy. The diffuser length
was fixed to the same length of 222 mm similar to the top slant angle that have
previously been studies The diffuser angle was changed from 0 to 50 degrees in
increments of 10 degrees and an additional case considering the angle of 5
degrees. For the case of a 0 degree slant angle on the upper surface the peak
values for drag and negative lift (downforce) coefficient were achieved with a
30 degrees diffuser angle, where the flow is fully attached with two streamwise
vortical structures, analogous to results obtained from Ahmed but with the body
flipped upside down. For diffuser angles above 30 degrees, flow is fully
separated from the diffuser. The Ahmed body with 25 degrees slant angle and a
diffuser achieves a peak value for downforce at a 20 degrees diffuser angle,
where the flow on the diffuser has two streamwise vortices combined with some
flow separation. The peak drag value for this case is at 30 degrees diffuser
angle, where the flow becomes fully separated.

For the parameter space of relevance, the outflow is primarily driven by
supernovae with radiation pressure being significant but subdominant. Our
analysis provides the unifying physical origin for a diverse set of observed
LyC leakers, including the green-peas galaxies, [SII]-weak galaxies,
Lyman-alpha emitters, with these two characteristics as the common denominator.
Among verifiable physical properties of LyC leakers, we predict that (1) the
newly formed stellar masses are are typically in the range of 1e8-1e10 Msun,
except perhaps ULIRGs, (2) the outflow velocities are typically in the range
typically of 100-600km/s, but may exceed 1e3 km/s in ULIRGs, with a strong
positive correlation between the stellar masses formed and the outflow
velocities, (3) the overall escape fraction of galaxies is expected to increase
with increasing redshift, given the cosmological trend that galaxies become
denser and more compact with increasing redshift. In addition, two interesting
by-product predictions are also borne out. First, ULIRGs appear to be in a
parameter region where they should be prodigious LyC leakers, unless there is a
large ram-pressure. Second, Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are not supposed to be
prodigious LyC leakers in our model, given their claimed effective radii

significant safety issues remain during control transfers between the
automation and human drivers and automation interactions with the
transportation system. In order to address these issues, it is critical to
understand both the behavior of human drivers during these events and the
environments where they occur. This article analyzes automated vehicle crash
narratives from the California Department of Motor Vehicles automated vehicle
crash database to identify safety concerns and gaps between crash types and
current areas of focus in the current research. The database was analyzed using
probabilistic topic modeling of open-ended crash narratives. Topic modeling
analysis identified five themes in the database: driver-initiated transition
crashes, sideswipe crashes during left-side overtakes, and rear-end collisions
while the vehicle was stopped at an intersection, in a turn lane, and when the
crash involved oncoming traffic. Many crashes represented by the
driver-initiated transitions topic were also associated with the side-swipe
collisions. A substantial portion of the side-swipe collisions also involved
motorcycles. These findings highlight previously raised safety concerns with
transitions of control and interactions between vehicles in automated mode and
the transportation social network. In response to these findings, future
empirical work should focus on driver-initiated transitions, overtakes, silent
failures, complex traffic situations, and adverse driving environments. Beyond
this future work, the topic modeling analysis method may be used as a tool to
monitor emergent safety issues.

correlation kernel is expressed in terms of non-Hermitian matrix valued
orthogonal polynomials. This model belongs to a class of models for which the
existing techniques for studying asymptotics cannot be applied. The novel part
of our method consists of establishing a connection between matrix valued and
scalar valued orthogonal polynomials. This allows to simplify the double
contour formula for the kernel obtained by Duits and Kuijlaars by reducing the
size of a Riemann-Hilbert problem. The proof relies on the fact that the matrix
valued weight possesses eigenvalues that live on an underlying Riemann surface
$\mathcal{M}$ of genus $0$. We consider this connection of independent
interest; it is natural to expect that similar ideas can be used for other
matrix valued orthogonal polynomials, as long as the corresponding Riemann
surface $\mathcal{M}$ is of genus $0$.
  The rest of the method consists of two parts, and mainly follows the lines of
a previous work of Charlier, Duits, Kuijlaars and Lenells. First, we perform a
Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis to obtain asymptotics for the scalar
valued orthogonal polynomials. The main difficulty is the study of an
equilibrium problem in the complex plane. Second, the asymptotics for the
orthogonal polynomials are substituted in the double contour integral and the
latter is analyzed using the saddle point method.
  Our main results are the limiting densities of the lozenges in the disordered
flower-shaped region. However, we stress that the method allows in principle to
rigorously compute other meaningful probabilistic quantities in the model.

broad variety of domains. Many approaches have been proposed in recent years,
but often they require that the length of the anomalies be known in advance and
provided as an input parameter. This limits the practicality of the algorithms,
as such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different
lengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a
linear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been
proposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still
requires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization
step. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem.
In this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method
utilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter
values for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a
set of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that
the proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based

operational and future high-energy missions gathered during 3.5 days to discuss
the status of the cross-calibration between the current international
complement of X-ray observatories, and the possibilities to improve it. This
summary consists of reports from the various WGs with topics ranging from the
identification and characterization of standard calibration sources,
multi-observatory cross-calibration campaigns, appropriate and new statistical
techniques, calibration of instruments and characterization of background,
communication and preservation of knowledge, and results for the benefit of the
astronomical community.

method takes dark matter halo merger trees (including 3-dimensional spatial
information) from cosmological N-body simulations as input and applies analytic
prescriptions to compute both the Population III (Pop III) and metal-enriched
star formation histories. We have developed a novel method to accurately
compute the major feedback processes affecting Pop III star formation: H$_2$
photodissociation from Lyman-Werner (LW) radiation, suppression of star
formation due to inhomogeneous reionization, and metal enrichment via
supernovae winds. Our method utilizes a grid-based approach relying on fast
Fourier transforms (FFTs) to rapidly track the LW intensity, ionization
fraction, and metallicity in 3-dimensions throughout the simulation box. We
present simulations for a wide range of astrophysical model parameters from
$z\approx 30-6$. Initially long-range LW feedback and local metal enrichment
and reionization feedback dominate. However, for $z \lesssim 15$ we find that
the star formation rate density (SFRD) of Pop III stars is impacted by the
combination of external metal enrichment (metals from one halo polluting other
pristine halos) and inhomogeneous reionization. We find that the interplay of
these processes is particularly important for the Pop III SFRD at $z \lesssim
10$. Reionization feedback delays star formation long enough for metal bubbles
to reach halos that would otherwise form Pop III stars. Including these effects
can lead to more than an order of magnitude decrease in the Pop III SFRD at
$z=6$ compared to LW feedback alone.

indicate over-representation of triangles in the PPI network, and confirm
results from previous research as to over-representation of transitive

also confirm, using ERGMs, previous research showing that under-representation
of the cyclic triangle (feedback loop) can be explained as a consequence of

Here, we report the presence of a compressive strain in Mo$S_2$ crystalline
powder and nanosheets obtained via the process of ball-milling and probe
sonication. The diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction pattern shift to
higher 2$\theta$ value implying a compressive strain that increases with the

blue-shifted w.r.t the bulk unprocessed sample. The observed blue-shift is
attributed to the presence of compressive strain in the samples. Whereas in

the number clusters for each latent variable. Monte Carlo simulations confirm
our theoretical results and give intuition about the finite-sample performance

self-exciting processes to jointly learn from groups of cascades. We first
start from the observation that maximum likelihood estimates for content
virality and influence decay are separable in a Hawkes process. Next, our
proposed model, which leverages a Borel mixture model and a kernel mixture
model, jointly models the unfolding of a heterogeneous set of cascades. When
applied to cascades of the same online items, the model directly characterizes
their spread dynamics and supplies interpretable quantities, such as content

final content popularities. On two retweet cascade datasets -- one relating to
YouTube videos and the second relating to controversial news articles -- we
show that our models capture the differences between online items at the
granularity of items, publishers and categories. In particular, we are able to
distinguish between far-right, conspiracy, controversial and reputable online
news articles based on how they diffuse through social media, achieving an F1
score of 0.945. On holdout datasets, we show that the dual mixture model

isomorphism measures between two embedding spaces, based on the relevant
statistics of their individual spectra. We empirically show that 1) language
similarity scores derived from such spectral isomorphism measures are strongly
associated with performance observed in different cross-lingual tasks, and 2)
our spectral-based measures consistently outperform previous standard
isomorphism measures, while being computationally more tractable and easier to
interpret. Finally, our measures capture complementary information to
typologically driven language distance measures, and the combination of
measures from the two families yields even higher task performance
correlations.

classifiers can be fooled by adversarial examples, in which an attacker adds
perturbations to an original sample, causing the classifier to misclassify the
sample. Adversarial attacks that render DNNs vulnerable in real life represent
a serious threat in autonomous vehicles, malware filters, or biometric
authentication systems. In this paper, we apply Fast Gradient Sign Method to
introduce perturbations to a facial image dataset and then test the output on a
different classifier that we trained ourselves, to analyze transferability of
this method. Next, we craft a variety of different black-box attack algorithms
on a facial image dataset assuming minimal adversarial knowledge, to further
assess the robustness of DNNs in facial recognition. While experimenting with
different image distortion techniques, we focus on modifying single optimal
pixels by a large amount, or modifying all pixels by a smaller amount, or
combining these two attack approaches. While our single-pixel attacks achieved
about a 15% average decrease in classifier confidence level for the actual
class, the all-pixel attacks were more successful and achieved up to an 84%
average decrease in confidence, along with an 81.6% misclassification rate, in
the case of the attack that we tested with the highest levels of perturbation.
Even with these high levels of perturbation, the face images remained
identifiable to a human. Understanding how these noised and perturbed images
baffle the classification algorithms can yield valuable advances in the
training of DNNs against defense-aware adversarial attacks, as well as adaptive
noise reduction techniques. We hope our research may help to advance the study
of adversarial attacks on DNNs and defensive mechanisms to counteract them,
particularly in the facial recognition domain.

which are often viewed as the remaining building blocks of our Galaxy. The
follow-up spectroscopy showed that dwarf galaxies have a sizeable spread in
their metallicities. Several scenarios were suggested to explain the
metallicity spread, which can be tested by the structural patterns of stellar
subpopulations with distinct metallicities. However, such chemical plus
structural examination, to which we refer to as ""chemostructural study"" is
hindered by the lack of stars with spectroscopic metallicity. Here we propose
the Ca$-$$by$ photometry as an alternative way to secure metallicities for a
2$-$3 orders of magnitude larger stellar sample than the spectroscopic sample
and thus enable us to perform a chemostructural study on dwarf galaxies. In
particular, we use the $hk$ index [$\equiv($Ca$-b)-(b-y)$], whose validity as a
photometric metallicity indicator (and crass insensitivity to age) for
red-giant-branch stars was upheld via Galactic globular clusters, and observe
three dwarf spheroidal galaxies$-$Draco, Sextans, and Canes Venatici I
(CVnI)$-$with Subaru/Suprime-Cam. We find that in all the galaxies the
metal-rich stellar populations are more centrally concentrated than the
metal-poor counterparts, suggesting that the central regions of the galaxies
underwent extended star formation. Such a negative radial metallicity gradient
for Sextans and CVnI opposes to the traditional spectroscopic results. We also
find that their metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) can be characterized
by a unimodal, skewed Gaussian shape with a metal-rich peak and a metal-poor
tail. We discuss their features in the chemostructure and MDF in terms of dwarf

properties of a wide range of astrophysical systems from planetary disks to
large-scale structures.
  To demonstrate the capability of the new ART$^2$, we applied it to two
hydrodynamics simulations: the zoom-in Milky Way Simulation to obtain
panchromatic properties of individual galaxies, and the large-scale
IllustrisTNG100 Simulation to obtain global properties such as the line
intensity mappings. These products are essential for a broad array of studies

evolution. By enabling direct comparison between numerical simulations and
multi-band observations, ART$^2$ provides a crucial theoretical framework for

employed for neutrino transport in CCSN simulations, we normally can not afford
to deploy a large enough number of energy bins needed to resolve this small

$\sim$15% for heavy-lepton neutrinos and by much smaller quantities for other

the nucleon scattering dominates the electron scattering in the thermalization
of neutrino spectra in all flavors. We then study possible artifacts that the
coarse energy grid may produce in the finite-difference methods. In order to

several assumptions that the Y00 system utilized linear-feedback shift

an attack to remove the assumptions of the previous work. The framework of the

Until now, the standard way to invoke Stein's method for this problem was to
use the Poisson equation for the diffusion as a starting point. The main
technical difficulty with this approach is obtaining bounds on the derivatives
of the solution to the Poisson equation, also known as Stein factor bounds. In
this paper we propose starting with the discrete Poisson equation of the Markov
chain. An important step in our approach is extending the discrete Poisson
equation to be defined on the continuum where the diffusion is defined, and we
achieve this by using interpolation. Although there are still Stein factor
bounds to prove, these now correspond to the finite differences of the discrete
Poisson equation solution, as opposed to the derivatives of the solution to the
continuous one. Discrete Stein factor bounds can be easier to obtain, for
instance when the drift is not everywhere differentiable, when the diffusion
has a state-dependent diffusion coefficient, or in the presence of a reflecting
boundary condition. We use the join the shortest queue model in the
Halfin-Whitt regime as a working example to illustrate the methodology. We show
that the steady-state approximation error of the diffusion limit converges to
zero at a rate of $1/\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of servers in the

collective machine learning models with locally stored data from multiple
participants. Vertical federated learning (VFL) deals with the case where
participants sharing the same sample ID space but having different feature
spaces, while label information is owned by one participant. Current studies of
VFL only support two participants, and mostly focus on binaryclass logistic
regression problems. In this paper, we propose the Multi-participant
Multi-class Vertical Federated Learning (MMVFL) framework for multi-class VFL
problems involving multiple parties. Extending the idea of multi-view learning
(MVL), MMVFL enables label sharing from its owner to other VFL participants in
a privacypreserving manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MMVFL, a
feature selection scheme is incorporated into MMVFL to compare its performance
against supervised feature selection and MVL-based approaches. Experiment
results on real-world datasets show that MMVFL can effectively share label
information among multiple VFL participants and match multi-class

(OS) data. Every patient had four pre-operative MR scans and manually drawn
tumor contours. For automatic tumor segmentation, a 3D convolutional neural

model was applied to the remaining 163 GBM patients to generate tumor contours.
The handcrafted and DL-based radiomic features were extracted from
auto-contours using explicitly designed algorithms and a pre-trained CNN
respectively. 163 GBM patients were randomly split into training (n=122) and
testing (n=41) sets for survival analysis. Cox regression models with
regularization techniques were trained to construct the handcrafted and
DL-based signatures. The prognostic power of the two signatures was evaluated
and compared. The 3D CNN achieved an average Dice coefficient of 0.85 across
163 GBM patients for tumor segmentation. The handcrafted signature achieved a
C-index of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.55-0.73), while the DL-based signature achieved a
C-index of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.57-0.77). Unlike the handcrafted signature, the
DL-based signature successfully stratified testing patients into two
prognostically distinct groups (p-value<0.01, HR=2.80, 95% CI: 1.26-6.24). The
proposed 3D CNN generated accurate GBM tumor contours from four MR images. The
DL-based signature resulted in better GBM survival prediction, in terms of
higher C-index and significant patient stratification, than the handcrafted

of improving patient stratification and survival prediction in GBM patients.

study in spherical symmetry the Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon equations and
\textit{while we do not directly show mass inflation}, we obtain a ""mass

Censorship Conjecture for a realistic model of spherical collapse in which
charged matter emulates the repulsive role of angular momentum: in our case the
Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon system on one-ended space-times. As a result, we
prove in spherical symmetry that:
  - two-ended asymptotically flat space-times are $C^2$-future-inextendible
i.e. $C^2$ Strong Cosmic Censorship is true for Einstein-Maxwell-Klein-Gordon,
assuming the decay of the scalar field on the event horizon at the expected

  - In the one-ended case, the Cauchy horizon emanating from time-like infinity
is $C^2$-inextendible. This result suppresses the main obstruction to $C^2$

that is broadband, meaning that the rate of change of the time-dependent
Hamiltonian is as fast or faster than the dynamics it generates. In many areas
of quantum physics, including quantum technology, one must include dissipation
and decoherence induced by the environment. While Markovian master equations
provide the only really efficient way to model these effects, these master
equations are derived for constant Hamiltonians (or those with a discrete set
of well-defined frequencies). In 2006, Alicky, Lidar, and Zanardi [Phys. Rev. A
73, 052311 (2006)] provided detailed qualitative arguments that Markovian
master equations could not describe systems under broadband control. Despite
apparently broad acceptance of these arguments, such master equations are
routinely used to model precisely these systems. This odd state of affairs is
likely due to a lack of quantitative results. Here we perform exact simulations
of two- and three-level systems coupled to an oscillator bath to obtain
quantitative results. Although we confirm that in general Markovian master
equations cannot predict the effects of damping under broadband control, we
find that there is a widely applicable regime in which they can. Master
equations are accurate for weak damping if both the Rabi frequencies and
bandwidth of the control are significantly smaller than the system's transition
frequencies. They also remain accurate if the bandwidth of control is as large
as the frequency of the driven transition so long as this bandwidth does not
overlap other transitions. Master equations are thus able to provide accurate
descriptions of many quantum information processing protocols for atomic
systems.

destination. In particular, a real-world IoT scenario is considered in which
multiple (partially) observed status information by different IoT devices are
required at the destination, so that the real-time status of the physical
process can be properly re-constructed. By taking into account such correlated
status information at the IoT devices, the problem of IoT device scheduling is
studied in order to jointly minimize the average age of information (AoI) at
the destination and the average energy cost at the IoT devices. Particularly,
two types of IoT devices are considered: Type-I devices whose status updates
randomly arrive and type-II devices whose status updates can be
generated-at-will with an associated sampling cost. This stochastic problem is
formulated as an infinite horizon average cost Markov decision process (MDP).
The optimal scheduling policy is shown to be threshold-based with respect to
the AoI at the destination, and the threshold is non-increasing with the
channel condition of each device. For a special case in which all devices are
type-II, the original MDP can be reduced to an MDP with much smaller state and
action spaces. The optimal policy is further shown to have a similar
threshold-based structure and the threshold is non-decreasing with an energy
cost function of the devices. Simulation results illustrate the structure of
the optimal policy and show the effectiveness of the optimal policy compared

work has shown that AIFV-$m$ codes can beat Huffman coding. AIFV-$m$ codes
construct am $m$-tuple of different coding trees between which the code
alternates and are only almost instantaneous (AI). This means that decoding a
word might require a delay of a finite number of bits.
  Current algorithms for constructing optimal AIFV-$m$ codes are iterative
processes that construct progressively ""better sets"" of code trees. The
processes have been proven to finitely converge to the optimal code but with no
known bounds on the convergence rate.
  This paper derives a geometric interpretation of the space of binary AIFV-$2$

iterative procedures for constructing optimal AIFV codes.
  We first show that a simple binary search procedure can replace the current
iterative process to construct optimal binary AIFV-$2$ codes. We then describe
how to frame the problem as a linear programming with an exponential number of
constraints but a polynomial-time separability oracle. This permits using the
Gr\""otschel, Lov\'asz and Schrijver ellipsoid method to solve the problem in a
polynomial number of steps. While more complicated, this second method has the
potential to lead to a polynomial time algorithm to construct optimal AIFV-$m$

nodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures
of homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show
that estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction
problem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals
sum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of
names to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and
can introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error
autocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance
is not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare
estimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels,
evaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel ""ego-alter""
modeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification
strategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other
relational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network.
We conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online
networks. Code for this paper is available at

  for 1-d Expanding Maps",,,,,"math.DS math-ph math.MP math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we establish a coupling lemma for standard families in the
setting of piecewise expanding interval maps with countably many branches. Our
method merely requires that the expanding map satisfies Chernov's one-step
expansion at $q$-scale and eventually covers a magnet interval. Therefore, our
approach is particularly powerful for maps whose inverse Jacobian has low
regularity and those who does not satisfy the big image property. The main
ingredients of our coupling method are two crucial lemmas: the growth lemma in
terms of the characteristic $\cZ$ function and the covering ratio lemma over
the magnet interval. We first prove the existence of an absolutely continuous
invariant measure. What is more important, we further show that the growth
lemma enables the liftablity of the Lebesgue measure to the associated Hofbauer
tower, and the resulting invariant measure on the tower admits a decomposition
of Pesin-Sinai type. Furthermore, we obtain the exponential decay of
correlations and the almost sure invariance principle (which is a functional
version of the central limit theorem). For the first time, we are able to make
a direct relation between the mixing rates and the $\cZ$ function, see
(\ref{equ:totalvariation1}). The novelty of our results relies on establishing
the regularity of invariant density, as well as verifying the stochastic
properties for a large class of unbounded observables.
  Finally, we verify our assumptions for several well known examples that were
previously studied in the literature, and unify results to these examples in
our framework.

adversarial learning in deriving the defect detection model, so AIFT does not
need annotations for road pavement defects. We evaluate the efficiency of AIFT

severe challenge to many existing feature selection methods with respect to
computational efficiency and prediction performance. This paper presents a new
hybrid two-layer feature selection approach that combines a wrapper and an
embedded method in constructing an appropriate subset of predictors. In the
first layer of the proposed method, the Genetic Algorithm(GA) has been adopted
as a wrapper to search for the optimal subset of predictors, which aims to
reduce the number of predictors and the prediction error. As one of the
meta-heuristic approaches, GA is selected due to its computational efficiency;
however, GAs do not guarantee the optimality. To address this issue, a second
layer is added to the proposed method to eliminate any remaining
redundant/irrelevant predictors to improve the prediction accuracy. Elastic
Net(EN) has been selected as the embedded method in the second layer because of
its flexibility in adjusting the penalty terms in regularization process and
time efficiency. This hybrid two-layer approach has been applied on a Maize
genetic dataset from NAM population, which consists of multiple subsets of
datasets with different ratio of the number of predictors to the number of
observations. The numerical results confirm the superiority of the proposed

complexity motivates an extensive array of prior work to adopt some form of

interactions is sufficient in solving a hypergraph task, and how different such
results become across datasets? This question, if properly answered, provides a
useful engineering guideline on how to trade off between complexity and
accuracy of solving a downstream task. To this end, we propose a method of
incrementally representing group interactions using a notion of n-projected
graph whose accumulation contains information on up to n-way interactions, and
quantify the accuracy of solving a task as n grows for various datasets. As a
downstream task, we consider hyperedge prediction, an extension of link
prediction, which is a canonical task for evaluating graph models. Through
experiments on 15 real-world datasets, we draw the following messages: (a)
Diminishing returns: small n is enough to achieve accuracy comparable with
near-perfect approximations, (b) Troubleshooter: as the task becomes more
challenging, larger n brings more benefit, and (c) Irreducibility: datasets
whose pairwise interactions do not tell much about higher-order interactions
lose much accuracy when reduced to pairwise abstractions.

distributions during the hmSAM printing. The voxel-encoding DIW printing is
then integrated with an evolutionary algorithm (EA)-based design strategy to
achieve the desired magnetic actuation and motion with complex geometry
variations and curvature distributions. With the new EA-guided voxel-encoding
DIW printing technique, we demonstrate the functional hmSAMs that produce
complicated shape morphing with desired curvature distributions for advanced
applications such as biomimetic motions. These demonstrations indicate that the
proposed EA-guided voxel-encoding DIW printing method can significantly broaden
the application potentials of the hmSAMs.

important role in digital forestry research. Multiple scans are generally used
to overcome occlusion effects and obtain complete tree structural information.
However, it is time-consuming and difficult to place artificial reflectors in a
forest with complex terrain for marker-based registration, a process that
reduces registration automation and efficiency. In this study, we propose an
automatic coarse-to-fine method for the registration of point-cloud data from
multiple scans of a single tree. In coarse registration, point clouds produced
by each scan are projected onto a spherical surface to generate a series of
two-dimensional (2D) images, which are used to estimate the initial positions
of multiple scans. Corresponding feature-point pairs are then extracted from
these series of 2D images. In fine registration, point-cloud data slicing and
fitting methods are used to extract corresponding central stem and branch
centers for use as tie points to calculate fine transformation parameters. To
evaluate the accuracy of registration results, we propose a model of error
evaluation via calculating the distances between center points from
corresponding branches in adjacent scans. For accurate evaluation, we conducted
experiments on two simulated trees and a real-world tree. Average registration
errors of the proposed method were 0.26m around on simulated tree point clouds,
and 0.05m around on real-world tree point cloud.

non-prehensile actions. Shaping plastic objects is challenging, since they are
difficult to model and to track visually. We study this problem, by using
kinetic sand, a plastic toy material which mimics the physical properties of
wet sand. Inspired by a pilot study where humans shape kinetic sand, we define
two types of actions: \textit{pushing} the material from the sides and
\textit{tapping} from above. The chosen actions are executed with a robotic arm
using image-based visual servoing. From the current and desired view of the
material, we define states based on visual features such as the outer contour
shape and the pixel luminosity values. These are mapped to actions, which are
repeated iteratively to reduce the image error until convergence is reached.
For pushing, we propose three methods for mapping the visual state to an
action. These include heuristic methods and a neural network, trained from
human actions. We show that it is possible to obtain simple shapes with the
kinetic sand, without explicitly modeling the material. Our approach is limited
in the types of shapes it can achieve. A richer set of action types and
multi-step reasoning is needed to achieve more sophisticated shapes.

help us to identify the origin of the binaries as star clusters. Such MSs are
not polluted by outflows of the BH progenitors, such as stellar winds and
supernova ejecta. Chemical anomalies might be a good test to confirm the origin
of binaries with relatively less massive MSs ($\lesssim 5M_{\odot}$), orbital
periods ($\sim 1.5\;$year) and higher eccentricities ($e \gtrsim 0.1$).

The contributions are mainly in the following two aspects: First, a new
adaptive control method is proposed for the considered system. Logic-based
switching rule is utilized to tune the controller parameters online to
stabilize the system in finite time. Different from the existing adaptive
controllers for structured/parametric uncertainties, a new switching barrier
Lyapunov method and supervisory functions are introduced to overcome the
obstacles caused by unstructured uncertainties and unknown control directions.
Second, based on a time-varying backstepping scheme, an extension is made to
the proposed method such that all the system states can be regulated to zero in
prescribed finite time. Moreover, a new analysis tool is presented to show the
boundedness of the control signals. Simulations are conducted to verify the
effectiveness of the proposed methods.

which involves multiple plays and Markovian rewards in the rested bandits
setting. In order to tackle this problem we consider an adaptive allocation
rule which at each stage combines the information from the sample means of all
the arms, with the Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bound of a single arm
which is selected in round-robin way. For rewards generated from a
one-parameter exponential family of Markov chains, we provide a finite-time
upper bound for the regret incurred from this adaptive allocation rule, which
reveals the logarithmic dependence of the regret on the time horizon, and which
is asymptotically optimal. For our analysis we devise several concentration
results for Markov chains, including a maximal inequality for Markov chains,
that may be of interest in their own right. As a byproduct of our analysis we
also establish asymptotically optimal, finite-time guarantees for the case of
multiple plays, and i.i.d. rewards drawn from a one-parameter exponential
family of probability densities. Additionally, we provide simulation results
that illustrate that calculating Kullback-Leibler upper confidence bounds in a
round-robin way, is significantly more efficient than calculating them for
every arm at each round, and that the expected regrets of those two approaches
behave similarly.

  Objectives for Segmenting Histopathological Images","This work has been submitted for possible publication",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a new regularization method to train a fully
convolutional network for semantic tissue segmentation in histopathological
images. This method relies on the benefit of unsupervised learning, in the form
of image reconstruction, for network training. To this end, it puts forward an
idea of defining a new embedding that allows uniting the main supervised task
of semantic segmentation and an auxiliary unsupervised task of image
reconstruction into a single one and proposes to learn this united task by a
single generative model. This embedding generates an output image by
superimposing an input image on its segmentation map. Then, the method learns
to translate the input image to this embedded output image using a conditional
generative adversarial network, which is known as quite effective for
image-to-image translations. This proposal is different than the existing
approach that uses image reconstruction for the same regularization purpose.
The existing approach considers segmentation and image reconstruction as two
separate tasks in a multi-task network, defines their losses independently, and
combines them in a joint loss function. However, the definition of such a
function requires externally determining right contributions of the supervised
and unsupervised losses that yield balanced learning between the segmentation
and image reconstruction tasks. The proposed approach provides an easier
solution to this problem by uniting these two tasks into a single one, which
intrinsically combines their losses. We test our approach on three datasets of
histopathological images. Our experiments demonstrate that it leads to better
segmentation results in these datasets, compared to its counterparts.

utilized for different connectivity tasks. For example, a long-range low-rate
RAT can be used for topology management and coordination, whereas a short-range
high-rate RAT for data transmission. In this paper, we introduce a distributed
consensus protocol for the hierarchical organization of Wireless Mesh Networks
(WMNs) with devices using multiple RATs. Our protocol considers three
hierarchical roles after the initial setup: Master, cluster head (CH), and
cluster member (CM). The Master coordinates the use of all RATs, whereas the
CHs coordinate all but the RAT with the longest transmission range. The initial
setup takes place immediately after powering on the devices, after which the
devices self-organize in a distributed manner by means of a consensus to elect
the Masters and CHs. The resulting interconnected structure is based on the
connectivity graphs created with the different RATs. The distributed consensus
protocol operates with a minimal amount of network information and demonstrates
high networking performance.

evaluating this spectrum in a numerically-exact fashion it is demonstrated that
the behavior of the entanglement entropy in the vicinity of the critical
excitation-phonon coupling strength chiefly originates from one specific
entanglement-spectrum eigenvalue, namely the smallest one. While the discrete
translational symmetry of the system implies that those eigenvalues can be
labeled by the bare-excitation quasimomentum quantum numbers, here it is shown
numerically that they are predominantly associated to the quasimomenta $0$ and

determine a process or the properties of a system, is an essential part of the
analysis of data sets with a large number of variables. A mathematical rigorous
approach to quantifying the relevance of these features is mutual information.
Mutual information determines the relevance of features in terms of their joint
mutual dependence to the property of interest. However, mutual information
requires as input probability distributions, which cannot be reliably estimated
from continuous distributions such as physical quantities like lengths or
energies. Here, we introduce total cumulative mutual information (TCMI), a
measure of the relevance of mutual dependences that extends mutual information
to random variables of continuous distribution based on cumulative probability
distributions. TCMI is a non-parametric, robust, and deterministic measure that
facilitates comparisons and rankings between feature sets with different
cardinality. The ranking induced by TCMI allows for feature selection, i.e.,
the identification of variable sets that are nonlinear statistically related to
a property of interest, taking into account the number of data samples as well
as the cardinality of the set of variables. We evaluate the performance of our
measure with simulated data, compare its performance with similar
multivariate-dependence measures, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our
feature-selection method on a set of standard data sets and a typical scenario

compression and has drawn much attention. In this work, we disclose a harmful
sparsifying process called filter collapse, which is common in DNNs with batch
normalization (BN) and rectified linear activation functions (e.g. ReLU, Leaky
ReLU). It occurs even without explicit sparsity-inducing regularizations such
as $L_1$. This phenomenon is caused by the normalization effect of BN, which
induces a non-trainable region in the parameter space and reduces the network
capacity as a result. This phenomenon becomes more prominent when the network
is trained with large learning rates (LR) or adaptive LR schedulers, and when
the network is finetuned. We analytically prove that the parameters of BN tend
to become sparser during SGD updates with high gradient noise and that the
sparsifying probability is proportional to the square of learning rate and
inversely proportional to the square of the scale parameter of BN. To prevent
the undesirable collapsed filters, we propose a simple yet effective approach
named post-shifted BN (psBN), which has the same representation ability as BN
while being able to automatically make BN parameters trainable again as they
saturate during training. With psBN, we can recover collapsed filters and
increase the model performance in various tasks such as classification on
CIFAR-10 and object detection on MS-COCO2017.

dimension $n$, i.e., $\lambda=l+{(n-2)\over 2}$. Thus, without setting a priori
$n=3$, complex values of $\lambda$ can be achieved, in particular, by keeping
$l$ real and complexifying $n$. For suitable values of such an auxiliary
complexified dimension, it is therefore possible to obtain results on
scattering amplitude and phase shift that are completely equivalent to the
results obtained in the sixties for Yukawian potentials in $\mathbb{R}^3$.
Moreover, if both $l$ and $n$ are complexified, the possibility arises of
recovering the partial wave amplitude from residues of a function of two

into a broader framework, where a correspondence exists between the scattering

problem. Secondly, we show that in some cases Gaussian Elimination on SAT
instances does not work as well as Gaussian Elimination on algebraic systems.
We demonstrate how this oversight is fixed in our solver, which is adapted to
read instances in algebraic normal form (ANF). Finally, we propose a novel
preprocessing technique based on the Minimal Vertex Cover Problem in graph
theory. This preprocessing technique is, within the framework of multivariate
Boolean polynomial systems, used as a DLL branching selection rule that leads
to quick linearization of the underlying algebraic system. Our benchmarks use a
model obtained from cryptographic instances for which a significant speedup is
achieved using the findings in this paper. We further explain how our
preprocessing technique can be used as an assessment of the security of a
cryptographic system.

describes the basics of DRL. The main elements of designing such a system are
the modeling of the environment, the modeling abstractions, the description of
the state and the perception models, the appropriate rewarding, and the
realization of the underlying neural network. The paper describes vehicle

Neumann entropy. Despite this utility, a proper resource theory for conditional
von Neumann entropy has not been developed, unlike that of entanglement. We
pave the way for such a resource theory by characterizing the class of free

of obtaining a tight upper bound to the set of conditional entropies of states
in which an operator gives the same expectation value as a convex optimization
problem. We solve it numerically for a two qubit case and find that this
enhances the usefulness of our witnesses. We also find that for a particular

A connected
dominating set $S \subseteq V$ is a secure connected dominating set of $G$, if
for each $ u \in V\setminus S$, there exists $v\in S$ such that $(u,v) \in E$
and the set $(S \setminus \{ v \}) \cup \{ u \} $ is a connected dominating set
of $G$. The minimum size of a secure connected dominating set of $G$ denoted by
$ \gamma_{sc} (G)$, is called the secure connected domination number of $G$.
Given a graph $ G$ and a positive integer $ k,$ the Secure Connected Domination
(SCDM) problem is to check whether $ G $ has a secure connected dominating set
of size at most $ k.$ In this paper, we prove that the SCDM problem is
NP-complete for doubly chordal graphs, a subclass of chordal graphs. We
investigate the complexity of this problem for some subclasses of bipartite
graphs namely, star convex bipartite, comb convex bipartite, chordal bipartite
and chain graphs. The Minimum Secure Connected Dominating Set (MSCDS) problem
is to find a secure connected dominating set of minimum size in the input
graph. We propose a $ (\Delta(G)+1) $ - approximation algorithm for MSCDS,
where $ \Delta(G) $ is the maximum degree of the input graph $ G $ and prove
that MSCDS cannot be approximated within $ (1 -\epsilon) ln(| V |)$ for any $
\epsilon > 0 $ unless $ NP \subseteq DTIME(| V |^{O(log log | V |)})$ even for
bipartite graphs. Finally, we show that the MSCDS is APX-complete for graphs
with $\Delta(G)=4$.

medium of galaxies. Their transfer in gas being a complex process, the
interpretation of their observational signatures, either in absorption or in
emission, is often not straightforward. Numerical radiative transfer
simulations are needed to accurately describe the travel of resonant line
photons in real and in frequency space, and to produce realistic mock
observations. This paper introduces RASCAS, a new public 3D radiative transfer
code developed to perform the propagation of any resonant line in numerical
simulations of astrophysical objects. RASCAS was designed to be easily
customisable and to process simulations of arbitrarily large sizes on large
supercomputers. RASCAS performs radiative transfer on an adaptive mesh with an
octree structure using the Monte Carlo technique. RASCAS features full MPI
parallelisation, domain decomposition, adaptive load-balancing, and a standard
peeling algorithm to construct mock observations. The radiative transport of
resonant line photons through different mixes of species (e.g. \ion{H}{i},
\ion{Si}{ii}, \ion{Mg}{ii}, \ion{Fe}{ii}), including their interaction with
dust, is implemented in a modular fashion to allow new transitions to be easily
added to the code. RASCAS is very accurate and efficient. It shows perfect
scaling up to a minimum of a thousand cores. It has been fully tested against
radiative transfer problems with analytic solutions and against various test
cases proposed in the literature. Although it was designed to describe
accurately the many scatterings of line photons, RASCAS may also be used to
propagate photons at any wavelength (e.g. stellar continuum or fluorescent
lines), or to cast millions of rays to integrate the optical depths of ionising
photons, making it highly versatile.

resolved by Hi-C 2.1. With the aid of Multi-Scale Gaussian Normalization (MGN),
strands from a region of low-emission that can only be visualized against the
contrast of the darker, underlying moss are studied. A comparison is made
between these low-emission strands with those from regions of higher emission
within the target active region. It is found that Hi-C 2.1 can resolve
individual strands as small as ~202km, though more typical strands widths seen
are ~513km. For coronal strands within the region of low-emission, the most
likely width is significantly narrower than the high-emission strands at
~388km. This places the low-emission coronal strands beneath the resolving
capabilities of SDO/AIA, highlighting the need of a permanent solar observatory

constitute a new paradigm for next-generation cellular communications. However,
the flight range and communication capacity of aerial BSs are usually limited
due to the UAVs' size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. To address this
challenge, in this paper, we consider dynamic cooperative transmission among
multiple aerial BSs for power-efficient aerial communications. Thereby, a
central controller intelligently selects the aerial BSs navigating in the air
for cooperation. Consequently, the large virtual array of moving antennas
formed by the cooperating aerial BSs can be exploited for low-power information
transmission and navigation, taking into account the channel conditions, energy
availability, and user demands. Considering both the fronthauling and the data
transmission links, we jointly optimize the trajectories, cooperation
decisions, and transmit beamformers of the aerial BSs for minimization of the
weighted sum of the power consumptions required by all BSs. Since obtaining the
global optimal solution of the formulated problem is difficult, we propose a
low-complexity iterative algorithm that can efficiently find a
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to the problem. Simulation results show that,
compared with several baseline schemes, dynamic multi-UAV cooperation can
significantly reduce the communication and navigation powers of the UAVs to
overcome the SWAP limitations, while requiring only a small increase of the
transmit power over the fronthauling links.

Mallet-Paret and Verduyn Lunel. The finite dimensional space that is `missed'
by these splittings can be characterized using the Hale inner product, but the
resulting degeneracy issues raise subtle questions that are much harder to
resolve than in the finite-range case. Indeed, there is no direct analogue for
the standard 'atomicity' condition that is typically used to rule out
degeneracies, since it explicitly references the smallest and largest shifts.
  We construct alternative criteria that exploit finer information on the
structure of the MFDE. Our results are optimal when the coefficients are cyclic
with respect to appropriate shift semigroups or when the standard positivity
conditions typically associated to comparison principles are satisfied. We
illustrate these results with explicit examples and counter-examples that

the regions of the input data that have the most significance for providing
correct decisions. The primary way to learn such receptive fields is to train
the models upon masked data, which helps the networks to ignore any unwanted
regions, but has two major drawbacks: 1) it often yields edge-sensitive
decision processes; and 2) augments the computational cost of the inference
phase considerably. This paper describes a solution for implicitly driving the
inference of the networks' receptive fields, by creating synthetic learning
data composed of interchanged segments that should be \emph{apriori}
important/irrelevant for the network decision. In practice, we use a
segmentation module to distinguish between the foreground
(important)/background (irrelevant) parts of each learning instance, and
randomly swap segments between image pairs, while keeping the class label
exclusively consistent with the label of the deemed important segments. This
strategy typically drives the networks to early convergence and appropriate
solutions, where the identity and clutter descriptions are not correlated.
Moreover, this data augmentation solution has various interesting properties:
1) it is parameter-free; 2) it fully preserves the label information; and, 3)
it is compatible with the typical data augmentation techniques. In the
empirical validation, we considered the person re-identification problem and

downstream natural language processing tasks such as universal reading
comprehension, brought forward by this architecture's use of contextualized
word embeddings and self-attention mechanisms. This paper contributes to
solving problems related to ambiguity in PICO sentence prediction tasks, as
well as highlighting how annotations for training named entity recognition
systems are used to train a high-performing, but nevertheless flexible
architecture for question answering in systematic review automation.
Additionally, it demonstrates how the problem of insufficient amounts of
training annotations for PICO entity extraction is tackled by augmentation. All
models in this paper were created with the aim to support systematic review
(semi)automation. They achieve high F1 scores, and demonstrate the feasibility
of applying transformer-based classification methods to support data mining in

the chiral component of the stress tensor on a plane restricted to the real

boundary correlators of the WZW scalars have the same structure as the
correlators of chiral Ka\v{c}-Moody currents. This is checked at the level of
the tree and one-loop Witten diagrams in AdS$_2$. We also compute some
tree-level correlators in a generic $\sigma$-model defined on AdS$_2$ and show
that they simplify only in the WZW case where an extra Ka\v{c}-Moody symmetry
appears. In particular, the terms in 4-point correlators having logarithmic
dependence on 1d cross-ratio cancel only at the WZW point. One motivation
behind this work is to learn how to compute AdS$_2$ loop corrections in 2d

considerably with transition to turbulence. This plays an important role in
cases of e.g. artificial respiration or stenosis. On the other hand, in piston
engines and reciprocating thermal/chemical process devices, turbulent or
transitional oscillatory flows affect mixing properties, and also mass and heat
transfer. In contrast to the extensively investigated statistically steady wall
bounded shear flows, rather little work has been devoted to the onset,
amplification and decay of turbulence in pipe flows driven by an unsteady
external force. Experiments [1, 3, 6] indicate that transition to turbulence
depends on only one parameter, i.e. Re_{\delta} \sim Re/Wo with a critical

of Re and Wo to extend the validity of this critical value to higher Wo. To

classify their light profiles as core-less, and place an upper limit to the
core size of ~10 pc. Considering the full magnitude and volume-limited ATLAS3D

including the proxy for the stellar angular momentum and the velocity
dispersion within one half-light radius, stellar mass, stellar age,
$\alpha$-element abundance, and age and metallicity gradients. More than half
of the slow rotators have core-less light profiles, and they are all less
massive than $10^{11}$ Msun. Core-less slow rotators show evidence for
counter-rotating flattened structures, have steeper metallicity gradients, and
a larger dispersion of gradient values than core slow rotators. Our results
suggest that core and core-less slow rotators have different assembly
processes, where the former are the relics of massive dissipation-less merging
in the presence of central supermassive black holes. Formation processes of
core-less slow rotators are consistent with accretion of counter-rotating gas
or gas-rich mergers of special orbital configurations, which lower the final
net angular momentum of stars, but support star formation. We also highlight
core fast rotators as galaxies that share properties of core slow rotators and
core-less slow rotators. Formation processes similar to those for core-less
slow rotators can be invoked to explain the assembly of core fast rotators,
with the distinction that these processes form or preserve cores.[Abridged]

input features of a series of well-known classification models. The predicted
labels from these classification models were measured by four types of rules,
which determined the finalised predicted label. Our experiment results showed
that our proposed rule-based EEG classification system achieved $99.83 \pm 0.42

theoretically in the strong correlation regime. It is shown that Majorana modes
can leak to the whole nanostructure, giving rise to a subtle interplay between
the two-stage Kondo screening and the half-fermionic nature of Majorana
quasiparticles. In particular, the coupling to the topological wire is found to
reduce the effective exchange interaction between the two quantum dots in the
absence of normal leads. Interestingly, it also results in an enhancement of
the second-stage Kondo temperature when the normal leads are attached.
Moreover, it is shown that the second stage of the Kondo effect can become
significantly modified in one of the spin channels due to the interference with
the Majorana zero-energy mode, yielding the low-temperature conductance equal
to $G=G_0/4$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, instead of $G=0$ in the absence of the

push-forward measure of the Lebesgue measure on $K$ by the polynomial $f$ and
involves univariate sums of squares of polynomials with growing degrees $2r$.
Hence it is weaker, but cheaper to compute, than an earlier hierarchy by
Lasserre (SIAM Journal on Optimization 21(3), 864--885, 2011), which uses
multivariate sums of squares. We show that this new hierarchy converges to the
global minimum of $f$ at a rate in $O(\log^2 r / r^2)$ whenever $K$ satisfies a
mild geometric condition, which holds, e.g., for convex bodies and for compact
semialgebraic sets with dense interior. As an application this rate of
convergence also applies to the stronger hierarchy based on multivariate sums
of squares, which improves and extends earlier convergence results to a wider
class of compact sets. Furthermore, we show that our analysis is near-optimal
by proving a lower bound on the convergence rate in $\Omega(1/r^2)$ for a class

$1.55\approx 3/2$ with standard deviation 4.7%. This function predicts modes
also at 5.3 and 3.5 min, which are not detected in the full MLCs. In the
present work we analyze simple small parts from high resolution LCs. We confirm
the QPs modes at 8.0, 5.3 and 3.5 min. Generally, we found 8 QP modes with
regular logarithmic distribution in the time interval 3.5-73 min. We also show
typical intra-night evolutions of QP modes in the minute scale -- sharp or
gradual transitions from one QP mode to other. In the end we find that the
parts of the LCs carry out the properties of the whole LCs at short time scale.
This lead to two well pronounces dependences - between the range deviation and
standard deviation of the LC, as well as between the quasi-period and the

spectroscopically confirmed type Ia supernovae discovered by the Dark Energy
Survey Supernova Program (DES-SN) and used in the first DES-SN cosmological
analysis. Fitting spectral energy distributions to the $griz$ photometric
measurements of the DES-SN host galaxies, we derive stellar masses and
star-formation rates. For the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D ($z$, $x_1$,
$c$, $\alpha$, $\beta$) bias correction, we find evidence of a Hubble residual
`mass step', where SNe Ia in high mass galaxies ($>10^{10} \textrm{M}_{\odot}$)
are intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low mass
counterparts by $\gamma=0.040\pm0.019$mag. This value is larger by $0.031$mag
than the value found in the first DES-SN cosmological analysis. This difference
is due to a combination of updated photometric measurements and improved star
formation histories and is not from host-galaxy misidentification. When using a
1D (redshift-only) bias correction the inferred mass step is larger, with
$\gamma=0.066\pm0.020$mag. The 1D-5D $\gamma$ difference for DES-SN is
$0.026\pm0.009$mag. We show that this difference is due to a strong correlation
between host galaxy stellar mass and the $x_1$ component of the 5D
distance-bias correction. To better understand this effect, we include an
intrinsic correlation between light-curve width and stellar mass in simulated
SN Ia samples. We show that a 5D fit recovers $\gamma$ with $-9$mmag bias
compared to a $+2$mmag bias for a 1D fit. This difference can explain part of
the discrepancy seen in the data. Improvements in modeling correlations between
galaxy properties and SN is necessary to determine the implications for
$\gamma$ and ensure unbiased precision estimates of the dark energy
equation-of-state as we enter the era of LSST.

graph is directed or not. Most studies ignore the directionality, so as to
learn high-quality representations optimized for node classification. On the
other hand, studies that capture directionality are usually effective on link
prediction but do not perform well on other tasks. This preliminary study
presents a novel text-enriched, direction-aware algorithm called DIAGRAM ,
based on a carefully designed multi-objective model to learn embeddings that
preserve the direction of edges, textual features and graph context of nodes.
As a result, our algorithm does not have to trade one property for another and
jointly learns high-quality representations for multiple network analysis
tasks. We empirically show that DIAGRAM significantly outperforms six
state-of-the-art baselines, both direction-aware and oblivious ones,on link

adopts binary stellar population synthesis models, to explore the cosmic event
rate of kilonovae, and the properties of their host galaxies in a cosmological
context. We find that model with supernova kick velocity of 0 km/s fits the
observation best, in agreement with the exception of some formation channels of
binary neutron star. This indicates that NNMs prefer to originate from binary
systems with low kick velocities. With V$_{\rm kick}$=0 km/s, the cosmic event
rate of NNMs and NBMs at z=0 are 283 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ and 91
Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, respectively, marginally consistent with the constraint
from LVC GWTC-1. For Milky Way-mass galaxies, we predict the NNM rate is
$25.7^{+59.6}_{-7.1}$ Myr$^{-1}$, which is also in good agreement with the
observed properties of binary neutron stars in the Milky Way. Taking all the
NNMs into account in the history of Milky Way-mass galaxies, we find that the
averaged r-process elements yield with A>79 in a NNM and NBM event should be
0.01 M$_{\odot}$ to be consistent with observation. We conclude that NGC 4993,
the host galaxy of GW170817, is a typical host galaxy for NNMs. However,
generally NNMs and NBMs tend to reside in young, blue, star-forming, late-type
galaxies, with stellar mass and gaseous metallicity distribution peaking at
$10^{10.65}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 8.72-8.85, respectively. By studying kilonovae

devices that will require addressability and scalability. Here, combining
top-down nanofabrication and bottom-up self-assembly, we report on the growth
of Ge wires on pre-patterned Si (001) substrates with controllable position,
distance, length and structure. This is achieved by a novel growth process
which uses a SiGe strain-relaxation template and can be generalized to other
material combinations. Transport measurements show an electrically tunable
spin-orbit coupling, with a spin-orbit length similar to that of III-V
materials. Also, capacitive coupling between closely spaced wires is observed,
which underlines their potential as a host for implementing two qubit gates.
The reported results open a path towards scalable qubit devices with Si
compatibility.

thermoelectric materials by reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. However,
the effects of compositional variation on the lattice dynamics of alloy systems
are not well understood, due in part to the difficulty of building realistic
first-principles models of structurally-complex solid solutions. This work
builds on our previous study of Sn$_{n}$(S$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$)$_{m}$ solid
solutions [Gunn $\textit{et al.}$, $\textit{Chem. Mater.}$ $\textbf{31}$,
$\textit{10}$, 3672, $\textbf{2019}$] to explore the lattice dynamics of the
$\textit{Pnma}$ Sn(S$_{1-x}$Se$_{x}$) system, which has been widely studied for
potential thermoelectric applications. We find that the vibrational internal
energy and entropy have a large quantitative impact on the mixing free energy
and are likely to be particularly important in alloy systems with competing
phases. The thermodynamically-averaged phonon dispersions and density of states
curves show that alloying preserves the structure of the low-frequency bands of
modes associated with the Sn sublattice but broadens the high-frequency
chalcogen bands into a near-continuous spectrum at the 50/50 mixed composition.
This results in a general reduction in the phonon mode group velocities and an
increase in the number of energy-conserving scattering channels for
heat-carrying low-frequency modes, which is consistent with the decrease in
thermal conductivity observed in experimental measurements. Finally, we discuss
some of the limitations of our first-principles modelling approach and propose
methods to address these in future studies.

deconvolution algorithm to recover the force from the experimental frequency
shift is required. It has been recently shown that this deconvolution can be an
ill-posed inversion problem causing false force-distance curves. Whether an
inversion problem is well- or ill-posed is determined by two factors: the shape
of the force-distance curve and the oscillation amplitude used for the

performs similarly to gradient-based approaches which require access to model

influence from distant actions to the action to be predicted, i.e., recognizing
the long-term dependence structure; and it remains an underexplored problem. To
better model the long-term dependence structure, we propose a GatedLongRec
solution in this work. To account for the long-term dependence, GatedLongRec
extracts distant actions of top-$k$ related categories to the user's ongoing
intent with a top-$k$ gating network, and utilizes a long-term encoder to
encode the transition patterns among these identified actions. As user intent
is not directly observable, we take advantage of available side-information
about the actions, i.e., the category of their associated items, to infer the
intents. End-to-end training is performed to estimate the intent representation
and predict the next action for sequential recommendation. Extensive
experiments on two large datasets show that the proposed solution can recognize
the structure of long-term dependence, thus greatly improving the sequential
recommendation.

In an attempt to improve storm response and minimize costs, energy companies

utilizing meteorological output from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models.
The majority of scientific literature in this area focuses on the application
of NWP models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, to ice
storm case studies, but such analyses tend to provide little verification of
output fidelity prior to use. This study evaluates the performance of WRF in
depicting the 21-23 December 2013 New England ice storm at the surface and in
vertical profile. A series of sensitivity tests are run using eight planetary
boundary layer (PBL) physics parameterizations, three reanalysis datasets, two
vertical level configurations, and with and without grid nudging. Simulated
values of precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and wind direction are
validated against surface and radiosonde observations at several station
locations across northeastern U.S. and southeastern Canada. The results show
that, while the spatially and temporally averaged statistics for near-surface
variables are consistent with those of select ice-storm case studies,
near-surface variables are highly sensitive to model when examined at the
station level. No single model configuration produces the most robust solution
for all variables or station locations, although one scheme generally yields
model output with the least realism. In all, we find that careful model
sensitivity testing and extensive validation are necessary components for
minimizing model-based biases in simulations of ice storms.

The existence of a toric one-skeleton is a useful tool to understand
six-dimensional monotone complexity-one spaces. In particular, we will show
that the existence of a toric one-skeleton for such a space implies that the
second Betti number of $M$ is at most seven. This is a simple application of

amplitudes has played a crucial role in the automation of NLO calculations, and
the development of similar algorithms at two loops is a natural strategy for
NNLO automation. Within a numerical framework the numerator of loop integrals
is usually constructed in four dimensions, and the missing rational terms,
which arise from the interplay of the $(D-4)$-dimensional parts of the loop
numerator with $1/(D-4)$ poles in $D$ dimensions, are reconstructed separately.
At one loop, such rational terms arise only from UV divergences and can be
restored through process-independent local counterterms. In this paper we
investigate the behaviour of rational terms of UV origin at two loops. The main
result is a general formula that combines the subtraction of UV poles with the
reconstruction of the associated rational parts at two loops. This formula has
the same structure as the R-operation, and all poles and rational parts are
described through a finite set of process-independent local counterterms. We
also present a general formula for the calculation of all relevant two-loop
rational counterterms in any renormalisable theory based on one-scale tadpole
integrals. As a first application, we derive the full set of two-loop rational
counterterms for QED in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge.

gapped and semi-metallic topological classifications, in a high-throughput way
using density functional theory-based spin-orbit spillage,
Wannier-interpolation, and related techniques. We first compute the spin-orbit
spillage for the ~1000 2D materials in the JARVIS-DFT dataset

high-spillage values. Then, we use Wannier-interpolation to carry-out Z2,
Chern-number, anomalous Hall conductivity, Curie temperature, and edge state
calculations to further support the predictions. We identify various
topologically non-trivial classes such as quantum spin-hall insulators (QSHI),
quantum anomalous-hall insulators (QAHI), and semimetals. For a few predicted

numerical treatment of the long-range electrostatic potentials in many-particle
systems and the respective interaction energy and forces [39,40,2]. In this
paper, we outline the prospects for tensor-based numerical modeling of the
collective electrostatic potential on lattices and in many-particle systems of
general type. We generalize the approach initially introduced for the
rank-structured grid-based calculation of the collective potentials on 3D
lattices [39] to the case of many-particle systems with variable charges placed
on $L^{\otimes d}$ lattices and discretized on fine $n^{\otimes d}$ Cartesian
grids for arbitrary dimension $d$. As result, the interaction potential is
represented in a parametric low-rank canonical format in $O(d L n)$ complexity.
The energy is then calculated in $O(d L)$ operations. Electrostatics in large
biomolecules is modeled by using the novel range-separated (RS) tensor format
[2], which maintains the long-range part of the 3D collective potential of the
many-body system represented on $n\times n \times n$ grid in a parametric
low-rank form in $O(n)$-complexity. We show that the force field can be easily
recovered by using the already precomputed electric field in the low-rank RS
format. The RS tensor representation of the discretized Dirac delta [45]
enables the efficient energy preserving regularization scheme for solving the
3D elliptic PDEs with strongly singular right-hand side arising in
bio-sciences. We conclude that the rank-structured tensor-based approximation
techniques provide the promising numerical tools for applications to many-body
dynamics, protein docking and classification problems and for low-parametric

Criterion for optimal betting, we define the asymptotic doubling rate of the

probabilities of winning. The performance of the model are hence studied as a
function of the input capital state under the assumption that the latter
belongs to the set of Gaussian density matrices (i.e. displaced, squeezed

devote all her/his initial resources into coherent state amplitude.

time-to-event modelling through survival analysis is applied to model
time-dependent transition probabilities. Several life events were analysed,
such as getting married, buying a new car, child birth, home relocation and
divorce, together with the socio-demographic attributes for survival modelling,
some of which are age, nationality, number of children, number of cars and home
ownership. The data originates from a survey conducted in Dortmund, Germany,

representations can be learned via performing graph convolutions on the
user-item interaction graph. However, such finding is mostly restricted to the
collaborative filtering (CF) scenario, where the interaction contexts are not
available. In this work, we extend the advantages of graph convolutions to
context-aware recommender system (CARS, which represents a generic type of
models that can handle various side information). We propose \textit{Graph
Convolution Machine} (GCM), an end-to-end framework that consists of three
components: an encoder, graph convolution (GC) layers, and a decoder. The
encoder projects users, items, and contexts into embedding vectors, which are
passed to the GC layers that refine user and item embeddings with context-aware
graph convolutions on user-item graph. The decoder digests the refined
embeddings to output the prediction score by considering the interactions among
user, item, and context embeddings. We conduct experiments on three real-world
datasets from Yelp and Amazon, validating the effectiveness of GCM and the
benefits of performing graph convolutions for CARS. Our implementations are
available at \url{https://github.com/wujcan/GCM}.

a combination of a Newtonian quadrupole moment and Lense-Thirring precession of
the orbit resulting from rapid rotation of the WD. Lense-Thirring precession,

area. In fact, despite the reasonable performance obtained by combination and
parametric metrics, currently there is no reliable pixel-based audio-visual

that autoencoders, fed with descriptive audio and video features, might produce
a set of features that is able to describe the complex audio and video

Quality Metric Based on a Deep Autoencoder (NAViDAd). The model visual features
are natural scene statistics (NSS) and spatial-temporal measures of the video

spectrogram representation of the audio component. The model is formed by a
2-layer framework that includes a deep autoencoder layer and a classification
layer. These two layers are stacked and trained to build the deep neural
network model. The model is trained and tested using a large set of stimuli,
containing representative audio and video artifacts. The model performed well
when tested against the UnB-AV and the LiveNetflix-II databases. %Results shows
that this type of approach produces quality scores that are highly correlated

life unaffected by interactions with the large LG spirals and therefore offer
the opportunity to learn about the intrinsic characteristics of this class of
objects. Here we explore the internal kinematic and metallicity properties of
one of the three isolated LG dwarf spheroidal galaxies, i.e. the Tucana dSph.
This is an intriguing system, as it has been found in the literature to have an
internal rotation of up to 16 km/s, a much higher velocity dispersion than
other dSphs of similar luminosity, and a possible exception to the
too-big-too-fail problem. We present results for a new VLT/FORS2 spectroscopic
dataset in the CaII triplet region for 50 candidate red giant branch stars in
the direction of Tucana, which yielded line-of-sight velocity and metallicity
([Fe/H]) measurements of 39 effective members. This doubles the number of
Tucana's stars with such measurements. In addition, we re-reduce and include in
our analysis the other two spectroscopic datasets presented in the literature,
the VLT/FORS2 sample by Fraternali et al. (2009) and the VLT/FLAMES one by
Gregory et al. (2019). We measure a systemic velocity of $180.0\pm1.3$ km/s,
consistently across the various datasets analyzed, and find that a
dispersion-only model is moderately favored over models accounting also for
internal rotation. Our best estimate of the internal velocity dispersion is
$6.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s, much smaller than the values reported in the
literature and in line with similarly luminous dSphs; this is consistent with
Tucana not being an exception to the too-big-to-fail problem, nor living in a
dark matter halo much more massive than those of its siblings. As for the
metallicity properties, we do not find anything unusual; there are hints of the
presence of a [Fe/H] gradient but more data are needed to pin its presence
down.

which with S\'ersic index $\it n \sim$ 1.3. There is probably little or no
bulge component assembled in IC 676. The luminosities of the double nuclei are
primarily dominated by young stellar populations within the ages of 1-10 Myr.
The northern nucleus has stronger star formation activity than the southern
one. The surface densities of the star formation rate in the double nuclei are
similar to those in starburst galaxies or the circumnuclear star forming
regions in spiral galaxies. Each of the double nuclei in IC 676 likely consists
of young massive star clusters, which can be resolved as bright knots in the

formation and evolutionary history. The secular processes driven by the stellar
bar and external accretion may dominate the formation and evolution of its
double nuclei. This indicates that the secular evolution involving the internal

vehicles is essential to enable the deployment of automated driving
technologies, due to the complex operational domain of automated vehicles. One
contributing method is scenario-based assessment in which test cases are
derived from real-world road traffic scenarios obtained from driving data.
Given the complexity of the reality that is being modeled in these scenarios,
it is a challenge to define a structure for capturing these scenarios. An
intensional definition that provides a set of characteristics that are deemed
to be both necessary and sufficient to qualify as a scenario assures that the
scenarios constructed are both complete and intercomparable.
  In this article, we develop a comprehensive and operable definition of the
notion of scenario while considering existing definitions in the literature.
This is achieved by proposing an object-oriented framework in which scenarios
and their building blocks are defined as classes of objects having attributes,
methods, and relationships with other objects. The object-oriented approach
promotes clarity, modularity, reusability, and encapsulation of the objects. We
provide definitions and justifications of each of the terms. Furthermore, the
framework is used to translate the terms in a coding language that is publicly
available.

damped exponential signals, has become an indispensable tool in various
scenarios, such as the structure and function determination, chemical analysis,
and disease diagnosis. NMR spectroscopy signals, however, are usually corrupted
by Gaussian noise in practice, raising difficulties in sequential analysis and
quantification of the signals. The low-rank Hankel property plays an important
role in the denoising issue, but selecting an appropriate parameter still
remains a problem. In this work, we explore the effect of the regularization
parameter of a convex optimization denoising method based on low-rank Hankel
matrices for exponential signals corrupted by Gaussian noise. An accurate
estimate on the spectral norm of weighted Hankel matrices is provided as a
guidance to set the regularization parameter. The bound can be efficiently
calculated since it only depends on the standard deviation of the noise and a
constant. Aided by the bound, one can easily obtain an auto-setting
regularization parameter to produce promising denoised results. Our experiments
on synthetic and realistic NMR spectroscopy data demonstrate a superior
denoising performance of our proposed approach in comparison with the typical
Cadzow and the state-of-the-art QR decomposition methods, especially in the low
signal-to-noise ratio regime.

generators (RNG) is considered. Currently, there are hundreds of RNG
statistical tests that are often combined into so-called batteries, each
containing from a dozen to more than one hundred tests.
  When a battery test is used, it is applied to a sequence generated by the
RNG, and the calculation time is determined by the length of the sequence and
the number of tests. Generally speaking, the longer the sequence, the smaller
deviations from randomness can be found by a specific test. So, when a battery
is applied, on the one hand, the ""better"" tests are in the battery, the more
chances to reject a ""bad"" RNG. On the other hand, the larger the battery, the
less time can be spent on each test and, therefore, the shorter the test
sequence. In turn, this reduces the ability to find small deviations from
randomness. To reduce this trade-off, we propose an adaptive way to use
batteries (and other sets) of tests, which requires less time but, in a certain
sense, preserves the power of the original battery. We call this method
time-adaptive battery of tests.

network reconstruction means estimating a network's adjacency matrix from a

developed model, and a comparison is made of the reconstructed network with the

permutation and the size of a set is not fixed in advance. Many real-world
problems, such as image tagging and object detection, have outputs that are
naturally expressed as sets of entities. This creates a challenge for
traditional deep neural networks which naturally deal with structured outputs
such as vectors, matrices or tensors. We present a novel approach for learning
to predict sets with unknown permutation and cardinality using deep neural
networks. In our formulation we define a likelihood for a set distribution
represented by a) two discrete distributions defining the set cardinally and
permutation variables, and b) a joint distribution over set elements with a
fixed cardinality. Depending on the problem under consideration, we define
different training models for set prediction using deep neural networks. We
demonstrate the validity of our set formulations on relevant vision problems
such as: 1) multi-label image classification where we outperform the other
competing methods on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, 2) object detection,
for which our formulation outperforms popular state-of-the-art detectors, and
3) a complex CAPTCHA test, where we observe that, surprisingly, our set-based

operators associated with noncommutative polydomains ${\bf D_f^m}$, ${\bf
m}:=(m_1,\ldots, m_k)\in {\bf N}^k$, generated by $k$-tuples ${\bf
f}:=(f_1,\ldots, f_k)$ of positive regular free holomorphic functions in a
neighborhood of the origin. These operators are acting on the tensor product
$F^2(H_{n_1})\otimes \cdots \otimes F^2(H_{n_k})$ of full Fock spaces with
$n_i$ generators or, equivalently, they can be viewed as multi-Toeplitz
operators acting on tensor products of weighted full Fock spaces. For a large
class of polydomains, we show that there are no non-zero compact multi-Toeplitz
operators. We characterize the weighted multi-Toeplitz operators in terms of
bounded free $k$-pluriharmonic functions on the radial part of ${\bf D_f^m}$
and use the result to obtain an analogue of the Dirichlet extension problem for
free $k$-pluriharmonic functions. We show that the weighted multi-Toeplitz
operators have noncommutative Fourier representations which can be viewed as
noncommutative symbols and can be used to recover the associated operators. We
also prove that the weighted multi-Toeplitz operators satisfy a Brown-Halmos
type equation associated with the polydomain ${\bf D_f^m}$.

lasers (i.e. external cavity diode lasers: ECDLs), DFB lasers can be
frequency-scanned more largely and rapidly without mode-hopping. In addition,
because of the fast scan speed of the DFB laser, a single soliton comb is
generated simply by controlling the injection current of the DFB laser, greatly
simplifying the system without having any additional optical modulators such as
a carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulator (CS-SSB modulator),
acousto-optic modulator (AOM), and auxiliary CW laser.

is challenging and crucial for modern recommender systems. Most existing

  In this paper, we argue that the influence from the past events on a user's

Thus, we propose a Contextualized Temporal Attention Mechanism that learns to
weigh historical actions' influence on not only what action it is, but also
when and how the action took place. More specifically, to dynamically calibrate
the relative input dependence from the self-attention mechanism, we deploy
multiple parameterized kernel functions to learn various temporal dynamics, and
then use the context information to determine which of these reweighing kernels
to follow for each input. In empirical evaluations on two large public

However, most of these methods focus on graph feature aggregation rather than

a few problems. First, to construct the pooled graph topology, current top-k
selection methods evaluate the importance of the node from a single perspective
only, which is simplistic and unobjective. Second, the feature information of
unselected nodes is directly lost during the pooling process, which inevitably
leads to a massive loss of graph feature information. To solve these problems
mentioned above, we propose a novel graph self-adaptive pooling method with the
following objectives: (1) to construct a reasonable pooled graph topology,
structure and feature information of the graph are considered simultaneously,
which provide additional veracity and objectivity in node selection; and (2) to
make the pooled nodes contain sufficiently effective graph information, node
feature information is aggregated before discarding the unimportant nodes;
thus, the selected nodes contain information from neighbor nodes, which can
enhance the use of features of the unselected nodes. Experimental results on
four different datasets demonstrate that our method is effective in graph

including sampled or missing network data. The autologistic actor attribute
model (ALAAM) is a statistical model based on the well-established exponential
random graph model (ERGM) for social networks. ALAAMs can be regarded as a
social influence model, predicting an individual-level outcome based on the
actor's network ties, concurrent outcomes of his/her network partners, and
attributes of the actor and his/her network partners. In particular, an ALAAM
can be used to measure contagion effects, that is, the propensity of two actors
connected by a social network tie to both have the same value of an attribute.
We investigate the effect of using simple random samples and snowball samples

it is safer to take a snowball sample of the network and estimate conditional

models of molecular interactions is a long-standing challenge in systems
biology: low-level chemical reaction network (CRN) models give raise to a
highly-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) which is computationally
demanding and often prohibitive to analyse in practice. A recently proposed
abstraction method uses deep learning to replace this CTMC with a discrete-time
continuous-space process, by training a mixture density deep neural network
with traces sampled at regular time intervals (which can obtained either by
simulating a given CRN or as time-series data from experiment). The major
advantage of such abstraction is that it produces a computational model that is
dramatically cheaper to execute, while preserving the statistical features of
the training data. In general, the abstraction accuracy improves with the
amount of training data. However, depending on a CRN, the overall quality of
the method -- the efficiency gain and abstraction accuracy -- will also depend
on the choice of neural network architecture given by hyper-parameters such as
the layer types and connections between them. As a consequence, in practice,
the modeller would have to take care of finding the suitable architecture
manually, for each given CRN, through a tedious and time-consuming
trial-and-error cycle. In this paper, we propose to further automatise deep
abstractions for stochastic CRNs, through learning the optimal neural network
architecture along with learning the transition kernel of the abstract process.
Automated search of the architecture makes the method applicable directly to
any given CRN, which is time-saving for deep learning experts and crucial for
non-specialists. We implement the method and demonstrate its performance on a
number of representative CRNs with multi-modal emergent phenotypes.

continuum physics. Notably, in multiphysics applications, it encodes
thermodynamic coupling between different fields. It thereby gives rise to
driving forces on the dynamics of interaction between the constituent
phenomena. In mechano-chemically interacting materials systems, even
consideration of only compositions, order parameters and strains can render the
free energy to be reasonably high-dimensional. In proposing the free energy as
a paradigm for scale bridging, we have previously exploited neural networks for
their representation of such high-dimensional functions. Specifically, we have
developed an integrable deep neural network (IDNN) that can be trained to free
energy derivative data obtained from atomic scale models and statistical
mechanics, then analytically integrated to recover a free energy density
function. The motivation comes from the statistical mechanics formalism, in
which certain free energy derivatives are accessible for control of the system,
rather than the free energy itself. Our current work combines the IDNN with an
active learning workflow to improve sampling of the free energy derivative data
in a high-dimensional input space. Treated as input-output maps, machine
learning accommodates role reversals between independent and dependent
quantities as the mathematical descriptions change with scale bridging. As a
prototypical system we focus on Ni-Al. Phase field simulations using the
resulting IDNN representation for the free energy density of Ni-Al demonstrate
that the appropriate physics of the material have been learned. To the best of
our knowledge, this represents the most complete treatment of scale bridging,
using the free energy for a practical materials system, that starts with
electronic structure calculations and proceeds through statistical mechanics to
continuum physics.

sensitive or even mission critical data. To protect confidentiality of data
stored in mobile devices, major mobile operating systems use full disk
encryption, which relies on traditional encryption mechanisms and requires that
decryption keys will not be disclosed. This however, is not necessarily true,
since an active attacker may coerce victims for decryption keys. Plausibly
deniable encryption (PDE) can defend against such a coercive attacker by
disguising the true secret key with a decoy key. Leveraging concept of PDE,
various deniable storage systems have been built for both PC and mobile
platforms. However, a secure PDE system for mobile devices is still missing
which can be compatible with mainstream mobile devices and, meanwhile, remains
secure when facing a strong multi-snapshot adversary. In this work, we propose
a preliminary PDE system design for mobile computing devices using flash memory

devices which has the following new design features: 1) it is compatible with
mainstream mobile devices due to its integration of PDE into flash translation
layer (FTL), the most popular form of flash memory being used by modern mobile
devices; and 2) it can defend against the multi-snapshot adversary by denying
hidden writes (over the flash memory) caused by hidden sensitive data using

pedestrian detection accuracy more difficult. The objective of this study is to
develop a real-time error-bounded lossy compression (EBLC) strategy to
dynamically change the video compression level depending on different

  global circulation","15 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With improved measurement and modelling technology, variability has emerged
as an essential feature in non-equilibrium processes. While traditionally, mean
values and variance have been heavily used, they are not appropriate in
describing extreme events where a significant deviation from mean values often
occurs. Furthermore, stationary Probability Density Functions (PDFs) miss
crucial information about the dynamics associated with variability. It is thus
critical to go beyond a traditional approach and deal with time-dependent PDFs.
Here, we consider atmospheric data from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate
Model (WACCM) model and calculate time-dependent PDFs and the information
length from these PDFs, which is the total number of statistically different
states that a system passes through in time. Time-dependent PDFs are shown to
be non-Gaussian in general, and the information length calculated from these
PDFs shed us a new perspective of understanding variabilities, correlation
among different variables and regions. Specifically, we calculate
time-dependent PDFs and information length and show that the information length
tends to increase with the altitude albeit in a complex form. This tendency is
more robust for flows/shears than temperature. Also, much similarity among
flows and shears in the information length is found in comparison with the
temperature. These results also suggest the importance of high
latitude/altitude in the information budge in the Earth's atmosphere, the
spatial gradient of the information as a useful proxy for the transport of
physical quantities.

  Bayesian Neural Network Approach","IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, 2020",,,,"physics.data-an cond-mat.supr-con eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Much research in recent years has focused on using empirical machine learning
approaches to extract useful insights on the structure-property relationships
of superconductor material. Notably, these approaches are bringing extreme
benefits when superconductivity data often come from costly and arduously
experimental work. However, this assessment cannot be based solely on an open
black-box machine learning, which is not fully interpretable, because it can be
counter-intuitive to understand why the model may give an appropriate response
to a set of input data for superconductivity characteristic analyses, e.g.,
critical temperature. The purpose of this study is to describe and examine an
alternative approach for predicting the superconducting transition temperature
$T_c$ from SuperCon database obtained by Japan's National Institute for
Materials Science. We address a generative machine-learning framework called
Variational Bayesian Neural Network using superconductors chemical elements and
formula to predict $T_c$. In such a context, the importance of the paper in
focus is twofold. First, to improve the interpretability, we adopt a
variational inference to approximate the distribution in latent parameter space
for the generative model. It statistically captures the mutual correlation of
superconductor compounds and; then, gives the estimation for the $T_c$. Second,
a stochastic optimization algorithm, which embraces a statistical inference
named Monte Carlo sampler, is utilized to optimally approximate the proposed
inference model, ultimately determine and evaluate the predictive performance.

continuously monitor users and their environment, generating an abundance of
user behavioural data. Such data may support improving the quality of service,
but may also lead to adverse usages such as surveillance and advertisement. In
parallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive
fields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple
concerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus
intrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics
of data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the
requirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We
specifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and
development of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the
remaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can
benefit from these methods.

aromatic ring systems by considering one dimensional motion of the proton along
a line perpendicular to the plane of the ring. The potential for the motion of
(H$^{+}$) from one side of the ring to the other through the center of the ring
is found to be a symmetric double well and such complexes are suggested as
molecular rattles which can exhibit a ring umbrella like inversion. Our study
reveals C$_{2}$H$_{2}$P$_{3}^{-}$ - H$^{+}$ to be a molecular rattle with a
barrier height of 44.277 kcal mol$^{-1}$ and exciting it to the third
vibrational level makes easy for the proton to go through the ring.
