alular feathers, or alula, stems from the maintenance of an attached
leading-edge vortex (LEV) over their thin-profiled, outer hand-wing. Here, we
investigate the connection between the alula and LEV attachment via flow
measurements in a wind tunnel. We show that a model alula, whose wetted area is
1% that of the wing, stabilizes a recirculatory aft-tilted LEV on a
steadily-translating unswept wing inclined at post-stall incidences. The
attached vortex is the result of the alula's ability to smoothly merge
otherwise separate leading- and side-edge vortical flows. We identify two key
processes that facilitate this merging: i) the steering of spanwise vorticity
generated at the wing's leading edge back to the wing plane and ii) an
aft-located wall-jet of high-magnitude root-to-tip spanwise flow (>80% that of
the freestream velocity). The latter feature induces LEV roll-up while the
former feature tilts LEV vorticity aft and evacuates this flow toward the wing
tip via an outboard vorticity flux. We identify the alula's streamwise position
(relative to the leading-edge of the thin wing) as important for vortex
steering and the alula's cant angle as important for high-magnitude spanwise
flow generation. These findings advance our understanding of the likely ways
bird's leverage LEVs to augment slow flight.

potentially better performance than perfect quantum error correction codes, it
is pertinent to quantify their performance. While quantum weight enumerators
establish some of the best upper bounds on the minimum distance of quantum
error-correcting codes, these bounds do not directly apply to AQEC codes.
Herein, we introduce quantum weight enumerators for amplitude damping (AD)
errors and work within the framework of approximate quantum error correction.
In particular, we introduce an auxiliary exact weight enumerator that is
intrinsic to a code space and moreover, we establish a linear relationship
between the quantum weight enumerators for AD errors and this auxiliary exact
weight enumerator. This allows us to establish a linear program that is
infeasible only when AQEC AD codes with corresponding parameters do not exist.
To illustrate our linear program, we numerically rule out the existence of
three-qubit AD codes that are capable of correcting an arbitrary AD error.

technology wherein sensors concurrently transmit their measurements over the

the accurate power alignment of individual transmissions, addressed previously
by using conventional precoding methods. In this paper, we investigate a

the complicated precoding at sensors, where UAV first collects sum channel

improvements of up to 10 dB in MSE compared to that of a benchmark case where
UAV is incognizant of sum channel gains.

computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical
approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element
for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of
complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is
often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases,
researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed
data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard
techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary
statistics of the data or are at risk of producing severe biases in the
estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS),
which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and
without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model
until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a
function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is
uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and
we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical
arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for
maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we
take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational
and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error
in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative
sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results
demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement
method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.

energy scale of the texture, parametrized by $\epsilon$, to be $\epsilon=

that the deviation of the subvoid amplitudes from unity and the inability of
the texture and some of the void profiles to reproduce the hot ring indicate
theoretical insufficiencies, either in the construction of the model or in the
assumed gravitational and cosmological framework leading to the imprints for
the structures.

terms of a single integration over the parallel wavevector, as the angular
integrations leading to numerical instability are evaluated analytically. Using
this formulation, the spatial correlation length in the near field of a film
made of silicon carbide (SiC) supporting surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) in
the infrared is analyzed. It is shown that the spatial correlation length of a
SiC heat source suspended in vacuum decreases substantially by decreasing its
thickness owing to SPhP coupling. In the limit of a 10-nm-thick SiC film, the
spatial correlation length is similar to that of a blackbody. The results also
reveal that it is possible to control the spatial coherence of a thin SiC heat
source via dielectric and metallic substrates, respectively allowing and
preventing SPhP coupling. This suggests that active modulation of thermal
emission via thin films supporting surface polaritons in the infrared is
possible by using a phase change material substrate such as vanadium dioxide.

method (relying, e.g., on proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)) suffer from
severe limitations when dealing with nonlinear time-dependent parametrized
PDEs, because of the fundamental assumption of linear superimposition of modes
they are based on. For this reason, in the case of problems featuring coherent
structures that propagate over time such as transport, wave, or
convection-dominated phenomena, the RB method usually yields inefficient
reduced order models (ROMs) if one aims at obtaining reduced order
approximations sufficiently accurate compared to the high-fidelity, full order
model (FOM) solution. To overcome these limitations, in this work, we propose a
new nonlinear approach to set reduced order models by exploiting deep learning
(DL) algorithms. In the resulting nonlinear ROM, which we refer to as DL-ROM,
both the nonlinear trial manifold (corresponding to the set of basis functions
in a linear ROM) as well as the nonlinear reduced dynamics (corresponding to
the projection stage in a linear ROM) are learned in a non-intrusive way by
relying on DL algorithms; the latter are trained on a set of FOM solutions
obtained for different parameter values. In this paper, we show how to
construct a DL-ROM for both linear and nonlinear time-dependent parametrized
PDEs; moreover, we assess its accuracy on test cases featuring different
parametrized PDE problems. Numerical results indicate that DL-ROMs whose
dimension is equal to the intrinsic dimensionality of the PDE solutions
manifold are able to approximate the solution of parametrized PDEs in
situations where a huge number of POD modes would be necessary to achieve the
same degree of accuracy.

complex-tribimaximal (TBM) seesaw mixing arises from the vacuum structure of a
minimal number of familons, resulting in an alignment between the Yukawa and

$m_{\nu_1} = 27.6\ \mathrm{meV}$, $m_{\nu_2} = 28.9\ \mathrm{meV}$ and
$m_{\nu_3} = 57.8\ \mathrm{meV}$. Their sum almost saturates Planck's
cosmological upper bound ($120$ $\text{meV}$). The right-handed neutrino masses
are expressed in terms of two parameters for a particular choice of familon
vacuum alignment. We predict the $\require{cancel}\cancel{CP}$

current PDG estimate, and Majorana invariants $|\mathcal{I}_1| = 0.106$ and

two possibilities for the invariant mass parameter $|m_{\beta \beta}|$: $13.02$

block model and improving its spatial fidelity given new mesh surfaces. Using
surfaces that represent geological boundaries, the objectives are to identify
areas where refinement is needed, increase spatial resolution to minimize
surface approximation error, reduce redundancy to increase the compactness of
the model and identify the geological domain on a block-by-block basis. These
objectives are fulfilled by four system components which perform block-surface
overlap detection, spatial structure decomposition, sub-blocks consolidation
and block tagging, respectively. The main contributions are a coordinate-ascent
merging algorithm and a flexible architecture for updating the spatial
structure of a block model when given multiple surfaces, which emphasizes the
ability to selectively retain or modify previously assigned block labels. The
techniques employed include block-surface intersection analysis based on the
separable axis theorem and ray-tracing for establishing the location of blocks
relative to surfaces. To demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the
proposed block merging strategy in a more narrow setting, it is used to reduce
block fragmentation in an existing model where surfaces are not given and the
minimum block size is fixed. To obtain further insight, a systematic comparison
with octree subblocking subsequently illustrates the inherent constraints of
dyadic hierarchical decomposition and the importance of inter-scale merging.
The results show the proposed method produces merged blocks with less extreme
aspect ratios and is highly amenable to parallel processing. The overall
framework is applicable to orebody modelling given geological boundaries, and
3D segmentation more generally, where there is a need to delineate spatial
regions using mesh surfaces within a block model.

that can generate an assembly of circularly- and linearly-polarized beams with
simultaneously the capability of independent encoding desired wavefront to each
individual polarization channel, which we believe will greatly enhance the
information capacities of the meta-devices. Two proof-of-concept designs are
experimentally demonstrated in microwave region. Upon the excitation of an
arbitrary linear polarization, the first device can generate distinct vortex
beams with desired two linear and two circular orthogonal polarizations,
whereas the second one can generate multi-foci containing components of full
polarizations. This approach to generate versatile polarizations with tailored
wavefront may pave a way to achieve advanced, flat and multifunctional

galaxies in the local Universe. We demonstrate that the asymmetry in a HI
spectrum is strongly linked to its signal-to-noise meaning that, contrary to
what was done in previous works, asymmetry distributions for different samples
cannot be compared at face value. We develop a method to account for
noise-induced asymmetry and find that the typical galaxy detected by xGASS
exhibits higher asymmetry than what can be attributed to noise alone, with 37%
of the sample showing asymmetry greater than 10% at an 80% confidence level. We
find that asymmetric galaxies contain, on average, 29% less HI mass compared to
their symmetric counterparts matched in both stellar mass and signal-to-noise.
We also present clear evidence that satellite galaxies, as a population,
exhibit more asymmetric HI spectra than centrals and that group central
galaxies show a slightly higher rate of HI asymmetries compared to isolated
centrals. All these results support a scenario in which environmental
processes, in particular those responsible for gas removal, are the dominant

detect SETs at the inputs of sequential elements and correct them via
re-sampling. Because SERAD only pays the delay penalty in the presence of an
SET, which rarely occurs, its average performance is comparable to the baseline

Verilog simulations and evaluated its impact on area, frequency, and power on
an open-core MIPS-like processor using a NCSU 45nm cell library. Our

vehicles, roadside transportation infrastructures, pedestrian smart-phones and

services. Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I)

The concerns of location privacy and secure communication further deter the
adoption of this smarter and safe transportation. In this paper, we present a

  publication",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper considers a wireless network with a base station (BS) conducting
timely transmission to two clients in a slotted manner via hybrid
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)/orthogonal multiple access (OMA).
Specifically, the BS is able to adaptively switch between NOMA and OMA for the
downlink transmission to minimize the information freshness, characterized by
Age of Information (AoI), of the network. If the BS chooses OMA, it can only
serve one client within a time slot and should decide which client to serve; if
the BS chooses NOMA, it can serve both clients simultaneously and should decide
the power allocated to each client. To minimize the weighted sum of expected
AoI of the network, we formulate a Markov Decision Process (MDP) problem and
develop an optimal policy for the BS to decide whether to use NOMA or OMA for
each downlink transmission based on the instantaneous AoI of both clients. We
prove the existence of optimal stationary and deterministic policy, and perform
action elimination to reduce the action space for lower computation complexity.
The optimal policy is shown to have a switching-type property with obvious
decision switching boundaries. A suboptimal policy with lower computation
complexity is also devised, which can achieve near-optimal performance
according to our simulation results. The performance of different policies
under different system settings is compared and analyzed in numerical results
to provide useful insights for practical system designs.

Then, what will be driven when a magnetic-gradient occurs in solar atmospheric
plasmas? Considering the ubiquitous distribution of magnetic-gradient in solar
plasma loops, this work demonstrates that magnetic-gradient pumping (MGP)
mechanism is valid even in the partial ionized solar photosphere, chromosphere
as well as in the corona. It drives energetic particle flows which carry and
convey kinetic energy from the underlying atmosphere to move upwards,
accumulate around the looptop and increase there temperature and pressure, and
finally lead to eruptions around the looptop by triggering ballooning
instabilities. This mechanism may explain the formation of the observing hot
cusp-structures above flaring loops in most preflare phases, therefore, the
magnetic-gradient should be a natural driver of solar eruptions. Furthermore,
we may also apply to understand many other astrophysical phenomena, such as the
temperature distribution above sunspots, the formation of solar plasma jets,
type-II spicule, and fast solar wind above coronal holes, as well as the fast
plasma jets related to white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes.

Next, we describe the uniformly most powerful test for comparing the rates of

""rate test""). A common argument against using this test is that real world data
rarely follows the Poisson point process. We thus investigate what happens when
the distributional assumptions of tests like these are violated and the test
still applied. We find a non-pathological example (using the rate test on a
Compound Poisson distribution with Binomial compounding) where violating the
distributional assumptions of the rate test make it perform better (lower error
rates). We also find that if we replace the distribution of the test statistic
under the null hypothesis with any other arbitrary distribution, the
performance of the test (described in terms of the false negative rate to false
positive rate trade-off) remains exactly the same. Next, we compare the
performance of the rate test to a version of the Wald test customized to the

from medical images, models based on state-of-the-art convolutional neural
network architectures often exhibit performance loss due to dataset shift.
Models trained using data from one hospital system achieve high predictive
performance when tested on data from the same hospital, but perform
significantly worse when they are tested in different hospital systems.
Furthermore, even within a given hospital system, deep learning models have
been shown to depend on hospital- and patient-level confounders rather than
meaningful pathology to make classifications. In order for these models to be
safely deployed, we would like to ensure that they do not use confounding
variables to make their classification, and that they will work well even when
tested on images from hospitals that were not included in the training data. We
attempt to address this problem in the context of pneumonia classification from
chest radiographs. We propose an approach based on adversarial optimization,
which allows us to learn more robust models that do not depend on confounders.
Specifically, we demonstrate improved out-of-hospital generalization
performance of a pneumonia classifier by training a model that is invariant to
the view position of chest radiographs (anterior-posterior vs.
posterior-anterior). Our approach leads to better predictive performance on
external hospital data than both a standard baseline and previously proposed
methods to handle confounding, and also suggests a method for identifying
models that may rely on confounders. Code available at

asymptotic exponential decay rate of probabilities, sharp large deviation
estimates also provide the ""prefactor"" in front of the exponentially decaying
term. For fixed $p \in (1,\infty)$, consider independent sequences
$(X^{(n,p)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ and $(\Theta^n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of random

(quenched) sharp large deviation estimates are established for suitably
normalized (scalar) projections of $X^{(n,p)}$ onto $\theta^n$, that are
asymptotically exact (as the dimension $n$ tends to infinity). Furthermore, the
case when $(X^{(n,p)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ is replaced with
$(\mathscr{X}^{(n,p)})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, where $\mathscr{X}^{(n,p)}$ is

(quenched) large deviation rate function, the prefactor exhibits a dependence
on the projection directions $(\theta^n)_{n \in\mathbb{N}}$ that encodes
additional geometric information that enables one to distinguish between
projections of balls and spheres. Moreover, comparison with numerical estimates

  performance through noise and error suppression","56 pages, 17 figures",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Manipulating quantum computing hardware in the presence of imperfect devices
and control systems is a central challenge in realizing useful quantum
computers. Susceptibility to noise limits the performance and capabilities of
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as any future quantum
computing technologies. Fortunately quantum control enables efficient execution
of quantum logic operations and algorithms with built-in robustness to errors,
without the need for complex logical encoding. In this manuscript we introduce
software tools for the application and integration of quantum control in
quantum computing research, serving the needs of hardware R&D teams, algorithm
developers, and end users. We provide an overview of a set of python-based
classical software tools for creating and deploying optimized quantum control
solutions at various layers of the quantum computing software stack. We
describe a software architecture leveraging both high-performance distributed
cloud computation and local custom integration into hardware systems, and
explain how key functionality is integrable with other software packages and
quantum programming languages. Our presentation includes a detailed
mathematical overview of central product features including a flexible
optimization toolkit, filter functions for analyzing noise susceptibility in
high-dimensional Hilbert spaces, and new approaches to noise and hardware
characterization. Pseudocode is presented in order to elucidate common
programming workflows for these tasks, and performance benchmarking is reported
for numerically intensive tasks, highlighting the benefits of the selected
cloud-compute architecture. Finally, we present a series of case studies
demonstrating the application of quantum control solutions using these tools in
real experimental settings for both trapped-ion and superconducting quantum
computer hardware.

there has been a growing interest in applying deep neural networks (DNNs) to

the adoption of DNNs in IMU-based tasks. In this paper, we present and release
the Oxford Inertial Odometry Dataset (OxIOD), a first-of-its-kind public

ground-truth on all sequences. Furthermore, to enable more efficient inference
at the edge, we propose a novel lightweight framework to learn and reconstruct
pedestrian trajectories from raw IMU data. Extensive experiments show the

  Computation with Spikes","15 pages, 5 figures","published 2019",,,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Neuroprosthesis, as one type of precision medicine device, is aiming for
manipulating neuronal signals of the brain in a closed-loop fashion, together
with receiving stimulus from the environment and controlling some part of our
brain/body. In terms of vision, incoming information can be processed by the
brain in millisecond interval. The retina computes visual scenes and then sends
its output as neuronal spikes to the cortex for further computation. Therefore,
the neuronal signal of interest for retinal neuroprosthesis is spike.
Closed-loop computation in neuroprosthesis includes two stages: encoding
stimulus to neuronal signal, and decoding it into stimulus. Here we review some
of the recent progress about visual computation models that use spikes for
analyzing natural scenes, including static images and dynamic movies. We
hypothesize that for a better understanding of computational principles in the
retina, one needs a hypercircuit view of the retina, in which different
functional network motifs revealed in the cortex neuronal network should be
taken into consideration for the retina. Different building blocks of the
retina, including a diversity of cell types and synaptic connections, either
chemical synapses or electrical synapses (gap junctions), make the retina an
ideal neuronal network to adapt the computational techniques developed in
artificial intelligence for modeling of encoding/decoding visual scenes.
Altogether, one needs a systems approach of visual computation with spikes to
advance the next generation of retinal neuroprosthesis as an artificial visual
system.

vision problem even for the cutting edge deep learning technologies. To achieve
a robust image classification for occluded images, this paper proposes a novel
scheme using subspace decomposition based estimation (SDBE). The proposed
SDBE-based classification scheme first employs a base convolutional neural
network to extract the deep feature vector (DFV) and then utilizes the SDBE to
compute the DFV of the original occlusion-free image for classification. The
SDBE is performed by projecting the DFV of the occluded image onto the linear
span of a class dictionary (CD) along the linear span of an occlusion error
dictionary (OED). The CD and OED are constructed respectively by concatenating
the DFVs of a training set and the occlusion error vectors of an extra set of
image pairs. Two implementations of the SDBE are studied in this paper: the
$l_1$-norm and the squared $l_2$-norm regularized least-squares estimates. By
employing the ResNet-152, pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 training set, as the
base network, the proposed SBDE-based classification scheme is extensively
evaluated on the Caltech-101 and ILSVRC2012 datasets. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed SDBE-based scheme dramatically boosts the
classification accuracy for occluded images, and achieves around $22.25\%$
increase in classification accuracy under $20\%$ occlusion on the ILSVRC2012
dataset.

outstanding improvements in natural image matting. Many of these methods can
generate visually plausible alpha estimations, but typically yield blurry
structures or textures in the semitransparent area. This is due to the local
ambiguity of transparent objects. One possible solution is to leverage the
far-surrounding information to estimate the local opacity. Traditional
affinity-based methods often suffer from the high computational complexity,
which are not suitable for high resolution alpha estimation. Inspired by
affinity-based method and the successes of contextual attention in inpainting,
we develop a novel end-to-end approach for natural image matting with a guided
contextual attention module, which is specifically designed for image matting.
Guided contextual attention module directly propagates high-level opacity
information globally based on the learned low-level affinity. The proposed
method can mimic information flow of affinity-based methods and utilize rich
features learned by deep neural networks simultaneously. Experiment results on
Composition-1k testing set and alphamatting.com benchmark dataset demonstrate

APEX observations of C$^{17}$O, C$^{18}$O, N$_2$H$^+$, and N$_2$D$^+$ line
emission, and 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission towards the target sources.
The o-H$_2$D$^+$ line was detected in all three prestellar cores, but in only

The Orion B9 cores were found to be consistent with the relationship between
the o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance and gas temperature obeyed by other low-mass dense

The o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundances in the Orion B9 cores are in line with those found
in other low-mass cores and larger than derived for high-mass star-forming
regions. The higher o-H$_2$D$^+$ abundance in prestellar cores compared to that

higher concentrations of gas-phase CO and elevated gas temperature accelerate
the destruction of H$_2$D$^+$. The validity of using the

indicated by the sensitive dependence of the critical temperature (T$_C$) on

KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (T$_C$=33.5\,K) which consists of stacking FeAs blocks

structure calculations reproduce the observed bilayer splitting by identifying
interlayer interorbital interaction between the two FeAs layers within one FeAs
block. All the hole-like pockets around the zone center exhibit Fermi
surface-dependent and nodeless superconducting gap. The gap functions with
short-range antiferromagetic fluctuations are proposed and the gap symmetry can
be well understood when the interlayer pairing is considered. The particularly
strong interlayer pairing is observed for one of the bands. Our observations

the source to retransmit the successfully received status updates that have not
been correctly delivered to the destination, but the retransmission of the
relay can be preempted by the arrival of a new status update at the source. By
carefully analyzing the evolution of AoI, we derive a closed-form expression of
the average AoI for the proposed AoR protocol. We further minimize the average
AoI by optimizing the generation probability of the status updates at the
source. Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate
that the average AoI performance of the proposed AoR protocol is superior to

to our equations, such as inefficient choice of parameters and unprovable
stability for high-dimensional problems. To overcome these difficulties, a new
kernel-based formulation is designed to approach the spatial derivatives. It
maintains the good properties of the original one, including the high order
accuracy and unconditionally stable for one-dimensional problems, hence
allowing much larger time step evolution compared with other explicit schemes.
In additional, without extra computational cost, the proposed scheme can
enlarge the available interval of the special parameter in the formulation,
leading to less errors and higher efficiency. Moreover, theoretical

$\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$. Such an assertion is questionable, we refute the
assertion in details, and choose an axialvector current and a tensor current to
examine the outcome of the assertion. After detailed analysis, we observe that
the meson-meson scattering states cannot saturate the QCD sum rules, while the
tetraquark molecular states can saturate the QCD sum rules. The Landau equation
is of no use to study the Feynman diagrams in the QCD sum rules for the
tetraquark molecular states, the tetraquark molecular states begin to receive

  without maximum principle","40 pages; to appear in ""Analysis & PDE""",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 1985, V. Scheffer discussed partial regularity results for what he called
solutions to the ""Navier-Stokes inequality"". These maps essentially satisfy the
incompressibility condition as well as the local and global energy inequalities
and the pressure equation which may be derived formally from the Navier-Stokes
system of equations, but they are not required to satisfy the Navier-Stokes
system itself.
  We extend this notion to a system considered by Fang-Hua Lin and Chun Liu in
the mid 1990s related to models of the flow of nematic liquid crystals, which
include the Navier-Stokes system when the ""director field"" $d$ is taken to be
zero. In addition to an extended Navier-Stokes system, the Lin-Liu model
includes a further parabolic system which implies an a priori maximum principle
for $d$ which they use to establish partial regularity (specifically,
$\mathcal{P}^{1}(\mathcal{S})=0$) of solutions.
  For the analogous ""inequality"" one loses this maximum principle, but here we
nonetheless establish certain partial regularity results (namely
$\mathcal{P}^{\frac 92 + \delta}(\mathcal{S})=0$, so that in particular the
putative singular set $\mathcal{S}$ has space-time Lebesgue measure zero).
Under an additional assumption on $d$ for any fixed value of a certain
parameter $\sigma \in (5,6)$ (which for $\sigma =6$ reduces precisely to the
boundedness of $d$ used by Lin and Liu), we obtain the same partial regularity
($\mathcal{P}^{1}(\mathcal{S})=0$) as do Lin and Liu. In particular, we recover
the partial regularity result ($\mathcal{P}^{1}(\mathcal{S})=0$) of
Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (1982) for ""suitable weak solutions"" of the
Navier-Stokes system, and we verify Scheffer's assertion that the same hold for
solutions of the weaker ""inequality"" as well.

the system realizes a generalized Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a regime where
Dirac semimetallic states are subject to significant Mott-Hubbard interactions
and spin-orbit coupling. At charge neutrality, the system is close to a quantum
phase transition between a quantum spin Hall and an antiferromagnetic

two knobs to control topology and spin-orbit coupling in the system. Their
combination can drive it across hitherto unexplored grounds of correlated

firing rate and spike timing of neurons. In the case of synaptic plasticity,
although spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) depending on presynaptic and
postsynaptic spike times had been considered the most common rule, recent
studies have shown the inhibitory nature of the brain in vivo for precise spike
timing, which is key to the STDP. Thus, the importance of the firing frequency
in synaptic plasticity in vivo has been recognized again. However, little is
understood about how the frequency-dependent synaptic plasticity (FDP) is
regulated in vivo. Here, we focused on the presynaptic input pattern, the
intracellular calcium decay time constants, and the background synaptic
activity, which vary depending on neuron types and the anatomical and
physiological environment in the brain. By analyzing a calcium-based model, we
found that the synaptic weight differs depending on these factors
characteristic in vivo, even if neurons receive the same input rate. This
finding suggests the involvement of multifaceted factors other than input
frequency in FDP and even neural coding in vivo.

part of the operator product expansion of chiral fields in conformal field
theory. A Lie pseudoalgebra is a generalization of this structure, for which
the algebra of polynomials k[\partial] in the indeterminate is replaced by the
universal enveloping algebra U(d) of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra d over
the base field k. The finite (i.e., finitely generated over U(d)) simple Lie
pseudoalgebras were classified in our 2001 paper [BDK]. The complete list
consists of primitive Lie pseudoalgebras of type W, S, H, and K, and of current
Lie pseudoalgebras over them or over simple finite-dimensional Lie algebras.
The present paper is the third in our series on representation theory of simple
Lie pseudoalgebras. In the first paper, we showed that any finite irreducible
module over a primitive Lie pseudoalgebra of type W or S is either an
irreducible tensor module or the image of the differential in a member of the
pseudo de Rham complex. In the second paper, we established a similar result
for primitive Lie pseudoalgebras of type K, with the pseudo de Rham complex
replaced by a certain reduction, called the contact pseudo de Rham complex.
This reduction in the context of contact geometry was discovered by M. Rumin
[Rum]. In the present paper, we show that for primitive Lie pseudoalgebras of
type H, a similar to type K result holds with the contact pseudo de Rham
complex replaced by a suitable complex. However, the type H case in more
involved, since the annihilation algebra is not the corresponding Lie-Cartan
algebra, as in other cases, but an irreducible central extension. When the
action of the center of the annihilation algebra is trivial, this complex is
related to work by M. Eastwood [E] on conformally symplectic geometry, and we
call it conformally symplectic pseudo de Rham complex.

a scaling parameter, the mobility edges can exist while increasing the matrix
dimension $D\rightarrow\infty$, depending on the distribution of matrix
elements of the diagonal uncorrelated matrix. By applying those results to a
specific one-dimensional isolated quantum system of random diagonal elements,
we confirm the existence of a many-body mobility edge, connecting it with

proposition can never be attained via induction. In this paper, we study why
this happens and show how scientific theory enables us to overcome such a

resolution in agreement with the evidence by providing a new updating rule not

water equations are evaluated in this paper by considering different eigenvalue
solutions. Specifically, the accuracy and computational cost of numerical,
analytical, and approximated eigenvalue solvers are analysed when implemented
in Roe, Intermediate Field CaPturing (IFCP) and Polynomial Viscosity Matrix
(PVM) schemes. Several numerical tests are performed to examine the overall
efficiency of numerical schemes with different eigenvalue solvers when
computing two-layer shallow-water flows. The results show that analytical
solutions are much faster than numerical solvers, with a computational cost
closer to approximate expressions. Consequently, Roe schemes with analytical
solutions to the eigenstructure are much faster, with overall efficiency equal
to IFCP scheme. On the other hand, IFCP and PVM schemes with analytical
solutions to eigenvalues are found to be equally efficient as those with
approximated expressions. Analytical eigenvalues show slightly better results
when dealing with a larger density difference between the layers.

  AP Networks","submitted to ISIT 2020",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The operating range of a single millimeter wave (mmWave) access point (AP) is
small due to the high path loss and blockage issues of the frequency band. To
achieve the coverage similar to conventional sub-6GHz networks, the ultra-dense
deployments of APs are required by the mmWave network. In general, the mmWave
APs can be categorized into backhaul-connected APs and relay APs. Though the
spatial distribution of backhaul-connected APs can be captured by the Poison
point process (PPP), the desired locations of relay APs depend on the
transmission protocol operated in the mmWave network. In this paper, we
consider modeling the topology of mmWave AP network by incorporating the
multihop protocol. We first derive the topology of AP network with the spatial
multiplexing disabled for each transmission hop. Then we analyze the topology
when the spatial multiplexing is enabled at the mmWave APs. To derive the
network throughput, we first quantify the improvement in latency and the
degradation of coverage probability with the increase of spatial multiplexing
gain at mmWave APs. Then we show the impact of spatial multiplexing on the
throughput for the ultra-dense mmWave AP network.

tractable 3D occlusion model, amenable to optimal Bayesian multi-view
multi-object filtering, which seamlessly integrates, into a single Bayesian

for the construction of an efficient dominant eigensolver primitive, which has

information from the labelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain. Due
to the lack of supervision in the target domain, it is crucial to identify the
underlying similarity-and-dissimilarity relationships among the unlabelled
samples in the target domain. In order to use the whole data relationships
efficiently in mini-batch training, we apply a series of memory modules to
maintain an up-to-date representation of the entire dataset. Unlike the simple
exemplar memory in previous works, we propose a novel multi-level memory
network (MMN) to discover multi-level complementary information in the target
domain, relying on three memory modules, i.e., part-level memory,
instance-level memory, and domain-level memory. The proposed memory modules
store multi-level representations of the target domain, which capture both the
fine-grained differences between images and the global structure for the
holistic target domain. The three memory modules complement each other and
systematically integrate multi-level supervision from bottom to up. Experiments
on three datasets demonstrate that the multi-level memory modules cooperatively
boost the unsupervised cross-domain Re-ID task, and the proposed MMN achieves
competitive results.

BiGlobal stability approach, results suffer from a sensitivity to the
streamwise domain truncation length and boundary conditions. The methodology
proposed in this paper resolves this sensitivity by considering a moving frame
of reference. In that frame, the spectrum features discrete eigenvalues whose
corresponding eigenfunctions decay exponentially in both the up- and downstream
directions. Therefore, the truncation boundaries can be placed far enough that
both variations in the domain length and artificial boundary conditions have no
impact. The discrete nature of the spectrum enables the use of local and
non-local stability methods to perform an independent approximation of the
BiGlobal eigensolutions via global mode theory. We demonstrate that retrieving
set-up-independent solutions in the stationary frame of reference is likely
impossible for the considered flow.

held within a vertical cylinder, trapping a bubble but otherwise free to move
vertically, and when the outer rim of the film is held in a fixed circular wire
frame. Film deformation is greater in the second case, and the duration of the

Thanks to Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, the candidates as minimizers can be
found among extremal curves, solutions of a (non smooth) Hamiltonian dynamics
and the problem can be stated as a time minimal control problem with a terminal
target of codimension one. Using geometric control and singularity theory the
time minimal syntheses (closed loop optimal control) can be classified near the
terminal manifold under generic conditions. In this article we focus to the
case where the generalized Legendre-Clebsch condition is not satisfied, which
paves the road to complicated syntheses with several singular arcs. In
particular it is related to the situation for a weakly reversible network like
the McKeithan scheme of two reactions.

the research topics that investigates this scenario is referred to as domain
adaptation. Deep neural networks brought dramatic advances in pattern
recognition and that is why there have been many attempts to provide good
domain adaptation algorithms for these models. Here we take a different avenue
and approach the problem from an incremental point of view, where the model is
adapted to the new domain iteratively. We make use of an existing unsupervised
domain-adaptation algorithm to identify the target samples on which there is
greater confidence about their true label. The output of the model is analyzed
in different ways to determine the candidate samples. The selected set is then
added to the source training set by considering the labels provided by the
network as ground truth, and the process is repeated until all target samples
are labelled. Our results report a clear improvement with respect to the
non-incremental case in several datasets, also outperforming other

  appear in JCTA",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A well-known conjecture, often attributed to Ryser, states that the cover
number of an $r$-partite $r$-uniform hypergraph is at most $r - 1$ times larger
than its matching number. Despite considerable effort, particularly in the
intersecting case, this conjecture remains wide open, motivating the pursuit of
variants of the original conjecture. Recently, Bustamante and Stein and,
independently, Kir\'{a}ly and T\'{o}thm\'{e}r\'{e}sz considered the problem
under the assumption that the hypergraph is $t$-intersecting, conjecturing that
the cover number $\tau(\mathcal{H})$ of such a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is at
most $r - t$. In these papers, it was proven that the conjecture is true for $r
\leq 4t-1$, but also that it need not be sharp; when $r = 5$ and $t = 2$, one
has $\tau(\mathcal{H}) \leq 2$.
  We extend these results in two directions. First, for all $t \geq 2$ and $r
\leq 3t-1$, we prove a tight upper bound on the cover number of these
hypergraphs, showing that they in fact satisfy $\tau(\mathcal{H}) \leq
\lfloor(r - t)/2 \rfloor + 1$. Second, we extend the range of $t$ for which the
conjecture is known to be true, showing that it holds for all $r \leq
\frac{36}{7}t-5$. We also introduce several related variations on this theme.
As a consequence of our tight bounds, we resolve the problem for $k$-wise
$t$-intersecting hypergraphs, for all $k \geq 3$ and $t \geq 1$. We further
give bounds on the cover numbers of strictly $t$-intersecting hypergraphs and
the $s$-cover numbers of $t$-intersecting hypergraphs.

populations, MPs) in massive Galactic and extragalactic star clusters older
than about 2 Gyr is by now well established. Photometry of red giant branch
(RGB) stars has been and still is instrumental in enabling the detection and
characterization of cluster MPs, through the appropriate choices of filters,
colours and colour combinations, that are mainly sensitive to N and --to a
lesser degree-- C stellar surface abundances. An important issue not yet
properly addressed is that the translation of the observed widths of the
cluster RGBs to abundance spreads must account for the effect of the first
dredge-up on the surface chemical patterns, hence on the spectral energy
distributions of stars belonging to the various MPs. We have filled this gap by
studying theoretically the impact of the dredge-up on the predicted widths of
RGBs in clusters hosting MPs. We find that for a given initial range of N
abundances, the first dredge up reduces the predicted RGB widths in N-sensitive
filters compared to the case when its effect on the stellar spectral energy
distributions is not accounted for. This reduction is a strong function of age
and has also a dependence on metallicity. The net effect is an underestimate of
the initial N-abundance ranges from RGB photometry if the first dredge-up is
not accounted for in the modelling, and also the potential determination of
spurious trends of N-abundance spreads with age.

we theoretically propose an improved optical method of enantiomeric-specific
state transfer to effectively evade such an adverse impact of thermal
population by introducing ro-vibrational transitions for the cyclic three-level
system of chiral molecules. Then, at the typical temperature in experiments
approximately only the lowest state in the chosen three-level system is
thermally occupied and the optical method of enantiomeric-specific state
transfer works well. Comparing with the case of purely rotational transitions
where all the three states are thermally occupied, this modification will
remarkably increase the obtained state-specific enantiomeric enrichment with
enantiomeric excess approximately 100%.

with large flux for the steady Navier-Stokes system in a pipe are established
even when the external force is also suitably large in $L^2$. Furthermore, the
exponential convergence rate at far fields for the arbitrary steady solutions
with finite $H^2$ distance to the Hagen-Poiseuille flows is established as long
as the external forces converge exponentially at far fields. The key point to
get the existence of these large solutions is the refined estimate for the
derivatives in the axial direction of the stream function and the swirl
velocity, which exploits the good effect of the convection term. An important
observation for the asymptotic behavior of general solutions is that the
solutions are actually small at far fields when they have finite $H^2$ distance
to the Hagen-Poiseuille flows. This makes the estimate for the linearized
problem play a crucial role in studying the convergence of general solutions at
far fields.

(mIoT) via some radio access technologies, where the random access channel

However, the theoretical analysis of the RACH procedure for massive IoT devices
is challenging. To address this challenge, we first correlate the RACH request
of an IoT device with the status of its maintained queue and analyze the
evolution of the queue status. Based on the analysis result, we then derive the
closed-form expression of the random access (RA) success probability, which is
a significant indicator characterizing the RACH procedure of the device.
Besides, considering the agreement on converging different services onto a
shared infrastructure, we investigate the RAN slicing for mIoT and bursty
ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) service multiplexing.
Specifically, we formulate the RAN slicing problem as an optimization one to
maximize the total RA success probabilities of all IoT devices and provide
URLLC services for URLLC devices in an energy-efficient way. A slice resource
optimization (SRO) algorithm exploiting relaxation and approximation with
provable tightness and error bound is then proposed to mitigate the
optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SRO
algorithm can effectively implement the service multiplexing of mIoT and bursty

only quantitative measure (or ranking) of properties is a confidence score that
the statement is valid. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by
introducing a multi-faceted model of CSK statements and methods for joint

different dimensions of CSK statements: plausibility, typicality, remarkability
and salience, with scoring and ranking along each dimension. For example,
hyenas drinking water is typical but not salient, whereas hyenas eating
carcasses is salient. For reasoning and ranking, we develop a method with soft

disruption of a star on a parabolic orbit by a supermassive black hole (SMBH)

radiative transfer. We find that such a tidally disrupted star fragment and
form clumps soon after its tidal disruption. The fragmentation results from the
endothermic processes of ionization and dissociation that reduce the gas
pressure, leading to local gravitational collapse. Radiative cooling is less
effective because the stellar debris is still highly optically thick in such an
early time. Our simulations reveal that a solar-type star with a stellar
density profile of n=3 disrupted by a 10^6 solar mass black hole produces
$\sim20$ clumps of masses in the range of 0.1 to 12 Jupiter masses. The mass
fallback rate decays with time, with pronounced spikes from early to late time.
The spikes provide evidence for the clumps of the returning debris, while the
clumps on the unbound debris can be potentially freely-floating planets and
brown dwarfs. This ionization and dissociation induced fragmentation on a
tidally disrupted star are a promising candidate mechanism to form low-mass
stars to planets around an SMBH.

management systems (DBMS), which allow inserting, modifying, and querying data
using a domain-specific language called Structured Query Language (SQL).
Popular DBMS have been extensively tested by fuzzers, which have been
successful in finding crash bugs. However, approaches to finding logic bugs,
such as when a DBMS computes an incorrect result set, have remained mostly
untackled. Differential testing is an effective technique to test systems that
support a common language by comparing the outputs of these systems. However,
this technique is ineffective for DBMS, because each DBMS typically supports
its own SQL dialect. To this end, we devised a novel and general approach that
we have termed Pivoted Query Synthesis. The core idea of this approach is to
automatically generate queries for which we ensure that they fetch a specific,
randomly selected row, called the pivot row. If the DBMS fails to fetch the
pivot row, the likely cause is a bug in the DBMS. We tested our approach on
three widely-used and mature DBMS, namely SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. In
total, we reported 123 bugs in these DBMS, 99 of which have been fixed or
verified, demonstrating that the approach is highly effective and general. We
expect that the wide applicability and simplicity of our approach will enable
the improvement of robustness of many DBMS.

the text content from complex backgrounds. As vanilla GANs are not sufficiently
robust to generate sequence-like characters in natural images, we propose an
adversarial learning framework for the generation and recognition of multiple
characters in an image. The proposed framework consists of an attention-based
recognizer and a generative adversarial architecture. Furthermore, to tackle
the issue of lacking paired training samples, we design an interactive joint
training scheme, which shares attention masks from the recognizer to the
discriminator, and enables the discriminator to extract the features of each
character for further adversarial training. Benefiting from the character-level
adversarial training, our framework requires only unpaired simple data for
style supervision. Each target style sample containing only one randomly chosen
character can be simply synthesized online during the training. This is
significant as the training does not require costly paired samples or
character-level annotations. Thus, only the input images and corresponding text
labels are needed. In addition to the style normalization of the backgrounds,
we refine character patterns to ease the recognition task. A feedback mechanism
is proposed to bridge the gap between the discriminator and the recognizer.
Therefore, the discriminator can guide the generator according to the confusion
of the recognizer, so that the generated patterns are clearer for recognition.
Experiments on various benchmarks, including both regular and irregular text,
demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the difficulty of
recognition. Our framework can be integrated into recent recognition methods to
achieve new state-of-the-art recognition accuracy.

was applied in the literature for solving several counting problems

benchmarking instances for #SAT often have reasonably small treewidth. This
paper deals with counting problems for instances of small treewidth. We
introduce a general framework to solve counting questions based on
state-of-the-art database management systems (DBMS). Our framework takes
explicitly advantage of small treewidth by solving instances using dynamic
programming (DP) on tree decompositions (TD). Therefore, we implement the
concept of DP into a DBMS (PostgreSQL), since DP algorithms are already often
given in terms of table manipulations in theory. This allows for elegant
specifications of DP algorithms and the use of SQL to manipulate records and
tables, which gives us a natural approach to bring DP algorithms into practice.
To the best of our knowledge, we present the first approach to employ a DBMS

allow to deal with huge tables with a limited amount of main memory (RAM),

decades, mainly in the biomedical domain. Many papers have been published on
Relation Extraction using supervised machine learning techniques. Most of these
techniques rely on statistical methods, such as feature-based and
tree-kernels-based methods. Such statistical learning techniques are usually
based on a propositional hypothesis space for representing examples, i.e., they
employ an attribute-value representation of features. This kind of
representation has some drawbacks, particularly in the extraction of complex
relations which demand more contextual information about the involving
instances, i.e., it is not able to effectively capture structural information
from parse trees without loss of information. In this work, we present
OntoILPER, a logic-based relational learning approach to Relation Extraction
that uses Inductive Logic Programming for generating extraction models in the
form of symbolic extraction rules. OntoILPER takes profit of a rich relational
representation of examples, which can alleviate the aforementioned drawbacks.
The proposed relational approach seems to be more suitable for Relation

across multiple non-overlapping cameras. With the advancement of deep neural
networks and increasing demand of intelligent video surveillance, it has gained
significantly increased interest in the computer vision community. By
dissecting the involved components in developing a person Re-ID system, we
categorize it into the closed-world and open-world settings. The widely studied
closed-world setting is usually applied under various research-oriented
assumptions, and has achieved inspiring success using deep learning techniques
on a number of datasets. We first conduct a comprehensive overview with
in-depth analysis for closed-world person Re-ID from three different
perspectives, including deep feature representation learning, deep metric
learning and ranking optimization. With the performance saturation under
closed-world setting, the research focus for person Re-ID has recently shifted
to the open-world setting, facing more challenging issues. This setting is
closer to practical applications under specific scenarios. We summarize the
open-world Re-ID in terms of five different aspects. By analyzing the
advantages of existing methods, we design a powerful AGW baseline, achieving
state-of-the-art or at least comparable performance on twelve datasets for FOUR
different Re-ID tasks. Meanwhile, we introduce a new evaluation metric (mINP)
for person Re-ID, indicating the cost for finding all the correct matches,
which provides an additional criteria to evaluate the Re-ID system for real
applications. Finally, some important yet under-investigated open issues are
discussed.

amplitude on the Euro-Mediterranean summer climate is studied in two climate
models, namely CNRM-CM5 and EC-Earth3P. Large ensembles of idealized
experiments have been conducted in which North Atlantic sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) are relaxed towards different amplitudes of the observed
AMV anomalies. In agreement with observations, during a positive phase of the
AMV both models simulate an increase (decrease) of temperature and a decrease
(increase) of precipitation over the Mediterranean basin (northern half of
Europe). An increase in the number of heat wave (HW) days is also found over
the continental Mediterranean region. In terms of atmospheric circulation, an
anomalous ridge (trough) over the Mediterranean basin (northern Europe) induces
a thermodynamical response explaining the increase in the occurrence of HW. The
anticyclonic anomaly over the Mediterranean basin is associated with drier
soils and a reduction of cloud cover, which concomitantly induce a decrease
(increase) of the latent (sensible) heat flux and an increase of the downward
radiative fluxes over lands. The source mechanisms leading to the
mid-troposphere anomalies over North Atlantic and its adjacent continents are
discussed. It is found that both the tropical and extra-tropical parts of the
AMV modulate the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic region. The
number of HW days increases linearly with the amplitude of the AMV. However,
the strength of this relationship differs between the models, and depends on
their intrinsic biases, raising questions regarding the robustness of the
mechanisms of teleconnections associated with the AMV.

water subject to different stimuli from a diluted azobenzene hydrophobic probe.
When the molecular motor does not fold, it acts as a passive probe, modifying
the structure of water around it, while when the motor is active, it induces
elementary diffusion processes inside the medium acting mainly on the dynamics.
We study two particular densities, the density of ambient water and a lower
density around the ambient pressure ice density, chosen to favor high density
liquid and low density liquid (LDL) water, respectively. We find that the
passive probe induces ever an acceleration or a slowing down of the diffusion
process around it depending on the density of water, while the active probe
induces acceleration only.
  We find a crossover between the diffusion coefficients for the two densities
near the passive probe, around T = 215 K. This dynamical crossover is
associated with a modification of the structure of water near the probe.
Structure calculations show a crossover of the proportion of LDL water around
the same temperature, suggesting that it induces the observed dynamical
crossover. In opposition with these results, the active stimuli increase
diffusion for both densities and decrease the proportion of LDL water at low
temperatures. However, we also find for the active stimuli a crossover of the
LDL proportion between the two densities of study, showing remarkable
similarities between active and passive stimulus results.

  wander for oceanic optical turbulence",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Light propagation in ocean is influenced by the refractive-index which is
related to temperature, salinity, outer-scale, etc. Based on Hill's model 1
(H1), two kinds of oceanic refractive-index spectrum (ORIS) have been proposed
to describe the second order characteristic of refractive-index. Most recently,
several ORIS models were proposed based on Hill's model 4 (H4), which gave a
better precision in high wave-numbers (viscous-diffusive range). However, the
outer scale, as a key parameter related to practical environment, has not been
introduced into any oceanic H4-based spectra. In this paper, we take the
outer-scale parameter into an H4-based spectrum which is adapted to the
wide-range Prandtl/Schmidt number [Opt. Express. 20, 11111(2019)]. The proposed
outer-scaled spectrum could be used in analyzing wave propagation in limited
outer-scaled environment with different values of average temperature and
salinity. We further derived the beam wander formula of collimated laser beam.
Numerical calculations show that the beam wander influenced by outer-scale
length $L_{0}$ is more obvious than that influenced by average temperature
$\langle T\rangle$, when $L_{0}$ varies from $10 \rm m$ to $100 \rm m$, and
$\langle T\rangle$ ranges from $0^{\circ} \rm C$ to $30^{\circ} \rm C$. When
salinity fluctuations prevails ($\omega \rightarrow 0$), the influence of outer
scale becomes weaker. In contribution proportion of beam wander, the
temperature-salt coupling term is the much larger than that of temperature or
salinity term.

additional noise, random walks, rounding errors and/or drifts are increasingly
used for data analysis in fields such as biology, ecology, engineering and
economics where the length of the observed signals can be extremely large.
Performing inference on and/or prediction from these models can be highly
challenging for several reasons: (i) the data may contain outliers that can
adversely affect the estimation procedure; (ii) the computational complexity
can become prohibitive when models include more than just a few parameters
and/or the time series are large; (iii) model building and/or selection adds
another layer of (computational) complexity to the previous task; and (iv)
solutions that address (i), (ii) and (iii) simultaneously do not exist in
practice. For this reason, this paper aims at jointly addressing these
challenges by proposing a general framework for robust two-step estimation
based on a bounded influence M-estimator of the wavelet variance. In this
perspective, we first develop the conditions for the joint asymptotic normality
of the latter estimator thereby providing the necessary tools to perform
(direct) inference for scale-based analysis of signals. Taking advantage of the
model-independent weights of this first-step estimator that are computed only
once, we then develop the asymptotic properties of two-step robust estimators
using the framework of the Generalized Method of Wavelet Moments (GMWM), hence
defining the Robust GMWM (RGMWM) that we then use for robust model estimation
and inference in a computationally efficient manner even for large time series.
Simulation studies illustrate the good finite sample performance of the RGMWM
estimator and applied examples highlight the practical relevance of the
proposed approach.

propose CLING, an integration-level test case generation approach that exploits
how a pair of classes, the caller and the callee, interact with each other
through method calls. In particular, CLING generates integration-level test
cases that maximize the Coupled Branches Criterion (CBC). Coupled branches are
pairs of branches containing a branch of the caller and a branch of the callee
such that an integration test that exercises the former also exercises the
latter. CBC is a novel integration-level coverage criterion, measuring the
degree to which a test suite exercises the interactions between a caller and
its callee classes. We implemented CLING and evaluated the approach on 140
pairs of classes from five different open-source Java projects. Our results
show that (1) CLING generates test suites with high CBC coverage, thanks to the
definition of the test suite generation as a many-objectives problem where each
couple of branches is an independent objective; (2) such generated suites
trigger different class interactions and can kill on average 7.7% (with a
maximum of 50%) of mutants that are not detected by tests generated at the unit
level; (3) CLING can detect integration faults coming from wrong assumptions
about the usage of the callee class (32 for our subject systems) that remain
undetected when using automatically generated unit-level test suites.

100 ps time resolution. Our aim is to detect a possible deviation of the proton
range with respect to treatment planning within the first few irradiation spots
at the beginning of the session. The system consists of a diamond-based beam
hodoscope for single proton tagging, operated in time coincidence with one or
more gamma detectors placed downstream of the patient. The TOF between the
proton time of arrival in the hodoscope and the PG detection time provides an
indirect measurement of the proton range in the patient with a precision
strictly related to the system time resolution. With a single ~38 cm$^{3}$ BaF2
detector placed at 15 cm from a heterogeneous PMMA target, we obtained a
coincidence time resolution of 101 ps (rms). This system allowed us to measure
the thickness and position of an air cavity within a PMMA target, and the
associated proton range shift: a 3 mm shift can be detected at 2$\sigma$
confidence level within a single large irradiation spot (~10$^{8}$ protons). We
are currently conceiving a multi-channel PG timing detector with 3D target
coverage. Each pixel will provide the PG detection time and its hit position,
that can be used to reconstruct the 3D distribution of PG vertices in the
patient. Our approach does not require collimation and allows to dramatically
increase the detection efficiency. Since both signal detection and background
rejection are based on TOF, the constraints on energy resolution can be relaxed
to further improve time resolution.

exhibit huge errors for some elements, e.g. 0.19 $E_{h}$ for Th$^+$ and 0.13

Having shown the feasibility of the one-electron approach, partially
energy-optimized basis sets are formed for all atoms in the periodic table,

As the hydrogenic Gaussian basis sets suggested in the present work are built
strictly from first principles, also polarization shells can be obtained in the
same fashion in contrast to previous approaches. The accuracy of the polarized
basis sets is demonstrated by calculations on a small set of molecules by
comparison to fully numerical reference values, which show that chemical
accuracy can be reached even for challenging cases like SF$_6$. The present
approach is straightforward to extend to relativistic calculations, and could
facilitate studies beyond the established periodic table.

edge service providers (ESPs) may not have sufficient resources to satisfy
their applications according to the associated service-level agreements. On the
other hand, some ESPs may have additional unused resources. In this paper, we
propose a resource-sharing framework that allows different ESPs to optimally
utilize their resources and improve the satisfaction level of applications
subject to constraints such as communication cost for sharing resources across
ESPs. Our framework considers that different ESPs have their own objectives for
utilizing their resources, thus resulting in a multi-objective optimization
problem. We present an $N$-person \emph{Nash Bargaining Solution} (NBS) for

the equations themselves. The difference between imperfect models and reality
is termed model discrepancy, and we are often uncertain as to the size and
consequences of this discrepancy. Here we provide two examples of the
consequences of discrepancy when calibrating models at the ion channel and
action potential scales. Furthermore, we attempt to account for this
discrepancy when calibrating and validating an ion channel model using
different methods, based on modelling the discrepancy using Gaussian processes

spinning black hole observed by a comoving observer. We first consider that the
expansion is driven by a cosmological constant only and build the connection
between the Kerr-de Sitter metric and the FLRW metric. We clarify that the
notion of a comoving observer is well defined in the spacetime of a spinning
black hole only in the sense of being asymptotic. The angular size of the
shadow for a comoving observer is calculated. Significantly we find that the
angular size approaches a non-zero finite value for a distant comoving
observer, while it vanishes for a distant static observer. Furthermore, by
adopting the approximate method proposed in \cite{Bisnovatyi-Kogan:2018vxl} we
extend the study to the general multi-component universe case. The results show
that the difference between the horizontal and vertical angular size changes a
lot, while their ratio, i.e. the oblateness, keeps unchanged when the
supermassive spinning black hole is at a high redshift, due to the common
amplification factor exerted by the cosmic expansion. In addition, when $a=0$,
our results agree with the previous studies in

launched a new data journal Polar Data Journal (PDJ) in 2017 to review the
quality of data obtained in the polar region. To maintain transparency in this

inappropriate activity for the data in the peer review and considered
preventive measures. We designed a specific workflow for PDJ. This included two

polyomino placement mechanic is implemented in a constraint model using regular

with: explicit rotation handling; optional placements; and new constraints for
resource usage. Crucial for implementing good game playing agents is to have
great heuristics for guiding the search when faced with large branching
factors. This paper divides placing tiles into two parts: a policy used for
placing parts and an evaluation used to select among different placements.
Policies are designed based on classical packing literature as well as common
standard constraint programming heuristics. For evaluation, global propagation
guided regret is introduced, choosing placements based on not ruling out later
placements. Extensive evaluations are performed, showing the importance of
using a good evaluation and that the proposed global propagation guided regret
is a very effective guide.

  Cambridge Journal of Mathematics",,,,"math.DG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In Part I of this article we generalize the Linearized Doubling (LD)
approach, introduced in earlier work by NK, by proving a general theorem
stating that if $\Sigma$ is a closed minimal surface embedded in a Riemannian
three-manifold $(N,g)$ and its Jacobi operator has trivial kernel, then given a
suitable family of LD solutions on $\Sigma$, a minimal surface $\breve{M}$
resembling two copies of $\Sigma$ joined by many small catenoidal bridges can
be constructed by PDE gluing methods. (An LD solution $\varphi$ on $\Sigma$ is
a singular solution of the Jacobi equation with logarithmic singularities which
in the construction are replaced by catenoidal bridges.) We also determine the
first nontrivial term in the expansion for the area $|\breve{M}|$ of
$\breve{M}$ in terms of the sizes of its catenoidal bridges and confirm that it
is negative; $|\breve{M}| < 2 | \Sigma|$ follows.
  We demonstrate the applicability of the theorem by first constructing new
doublings of the Clifford torus. We then construct in Part II families of LD
solutions for general $(O(2)\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$-symmetric backgrounds
$(\Sigma, N,g)$. Combining with the theorem in Part I this implies the
construction of new minimal doublings for such backgrounds. (Constructions for
general backgrounds remain open.) This generalizes our earlier work for
$\Sigma=\mathbb{S}^2 \subset N=\mathbb{S}^3$ providing new constructions even
in that case.
  In Part III, applying the results of Parts I and II -- appropriately modified
for the catenoid and the critical catenoid -- we construct new self-shrinkers
of the mean curvature flow via doubling the spherical self-shrinker or the
Angenent torus, new complete embedded minimal surfaces of finite total
curvature in the Euclidean three-space via doubling the catenoid, and new free
boundary minimal surfaces in the unit ball via doubling the critical catenoid.

transfer these models for serving downstream tasks where only limited data

  In this paper, we delve on the task of effectively learning a single user
representation that can be applied to a diversity of tasks, from cross-domain
recommendations to user profile predictions. Fine-tuning a large pre-trained
network and adapting it to downstream tasks is an effective way to solve such
tasks. However, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient considering that an entire
model needs to be re-trained for every new task. To overcome this issue, we
develop a parameter efficient transfer learning architecture, termed as
PeterRec, which can be configured on-the-fly to various downstream tasks.
Specifically, PeterRec allows the pre-trained parameters to remain unaltered
during fine-tuning by injecting a series of re-learned neural networks, which
are small but as expressive as learning the entire network. We perform
extensive experimental ablation to show the effectiveness of the learned user
representation in five downstream tasks. Moreover, we show that PeterRec
performs efficient transfer learning in multiple domains, where it achieves
comparable or sometimes better performance relative to fine-tuning the entire

scattering (DPS) processes in high-energy heavy-ion (proton-nucleus and
nucleus-nucleus) collisions. We derive a simple generic DPS formula in nuclear
collisions by accommodating both the nuclear collision geometry and the
spatially dependent nuclear modification effect, under the assumption that the
impact-parameter dependence of nPDFs is only related to the nuclear thickness
function. While the geometric effect is widely adopted, the impact of the
spatially dependent nuclear modification on DPS cross sections has been
overlooked so far, which can, however, be significant when the initial nuclear
modification is large. In turn, the DPS cross sections in heavy-ion collisions
can provide useful information on the spatial dependence of nPDFs. They can be,
in general, obtained in minimum-bias nuclear collisions, featuring the virtue
of independence of Glauber modeling.

transmission mechanism of choice for battery-free devices that operate on
harvested energy. However, a limitation of recent backscatter systems is that
the communication range scales with the strength of the ambient carrier
signal(ACS). This means that to achieve a long range, a backscatter tag needs
to reflect a strong ACS, which in practice means that it needs to be close to
an ACS emitter. We present TunnelScatter, a mechanism that overcomes this
limitation. TunnelScatter uses a tunnel diode-based radio frequency oscillator
to enable transmissions when there is no ACS, and the same oscillator as a
reflection amplifier to support backscatter transmissions when the ACS is weak.
Our results show that even without an ACS, TunnelScatter is able to transmit
through several walls covering a distance of 18 meter while consuming a peak
biasing power of 57 microwatts. Based on TunnelScatter, we design battery-free
sensor tags, called TunnelTags, that can sense physical phenomena and transmit
them using the TunnelScatter mechanism.

droplets on superhydrophobic SH surfaces in the presence of a horizontal
magnetic field. A wide gamut of dynamics was observed by varying the impact
Weber number We, the Hartmann number Ha and the magnetic field strength
manifested through the magnetic Bond number Bom. For a fixed We 60, we observed
that at moderately low Bom 300, droplet rebound off the SH surface is
suppressed. The noted We is chosen to observe various impact outcomes and to
reveal the consequent ferrohydrodynamic mechanisms. We also show that
ferrohydrodynamic interactions leads to asymmetric spreading, and the droplet
spreads preferentially in a direction orthogonal to the magnetic field lines.
We show analytically that during the retraction regime, the kinetic energy of
the droplet is distributed unequally in the transverse and longitudinal
directions due to the Lorentz force. This ultimately leads to suppression of
droplet rebound. We study the role of Bom at fixed We 60, and observed that the
liquid lamella becomes unstable at the onset of retraction phase, through
nucleation of holes, their proliferation and rupture after reaching a critical
thickness only on SH surfaces, but is absent on hydrophilic surfaces. We
propose an analytical model to predict the onset of instability at a critical
Bom. The analytical model shows that the critical Bom is a function of the
impact We, and the critical Bom decreases with increasing We. We illustrate a
phase map encompassing all the post impact ferrohydrodynamic phenomena on SH
surfaces for a wide range of We and Bom.

tasks with different resource requirements. Efficient resource provisioning and
task scheduling in such systems are non-trivial and require close monitoring
and accurate forecasting of the state of the system, specifically resource
utilisation at its constituent machines. Two challenges present themselves
towards these objectives. First, collecting monitoring data entails substantial
communication overhead. This overhead can be prohibitively high, especially in
networks where bandwidth is limited. Second, forecasting models to predict
resource utilisation should be accurate and need to exhibit high inference
speed. Mission critical scheduling and resource allocation algorithms use these
predictions and rely on their immediate availability. To address the first
challenge, we present a communication-efficient data collection mechanism.
Resource utilisation data is collected at the individual machines in the system
and transmitted to a central controller in batches. Each batch is processed by
an adaptive data-reduction algorithm based on Fourier transforms and truncation
in the frequency domain. We show that the proposed mechanism leads to a
significant reduction in communication overhead while incurring only minimal
error and adhering to accuracy guarantees. To address the second challenge, we
propose a deep learning architecture using complex Gated Recurrent Units to
forecast resource utilisation. This architecture is directly integrated with
the above data collection mechanism to improve inference speed of our
forecasting model. Using two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, both in terms of forecasting accuracy and
inference speed. Our approach resolves challenges encountered in resource
provisioning frameworks and can be applied to other forecasting problems.

to handle high-dimensional tabular data sets, notably because of their good
predictive accuracy. However, when machine learning is used for decision-making
problems, settling for the best predictive procedures may not be reasonable
since enlightened decisions require an in-depth comprehension of the algorithm
prediction process. Unfortunately, random forests are not intrinsically
interpretable since their prediction results from averaging several hundreds of
decision trees. A classic approach to gain knowledge on this so-called
black-box algorithm is to compute variable importances, that are employed to
assess the predictive impact of each input variable. Variable importances are
then used to rank or select variables and thus play a great role in data
analysis. Nevertheless, there is no justification to use random forest variable
importances in such way: we do not even know what these quantities estimate. In
this paper, we analyze one of the two well-known random forest variable
importances, the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI). We prove that if input variables
are independent and in absence of interactions, MDI provides a variance
decomposition of the output, where the contribution of each variable is clearly
identified. We also study models exhibiting dependence between input variables
or interaction, for which the variable importance is intrinsically ill-defined.
Our analysis shows that there may exist some benefits to use a forest compared
to a single tree.

important step towards improving the interpretability of generative models.
Despite recent advances in disentangled representation learning, existing
approaches often suffer from the trade-off between representation learning and
generation performance i.e. improving generation quality sacrifices
disentanglement performance). We propose an Information-Distillation Generative
Adversarial Network (ID-GAN), a simple yet generic framework that easily
incorporates the existing state-of-the-art models for both disentanglement
learning and high-fidelity synthesis. Our method learns disentangled
representation using VAE-based models, and distills the learned representation
with an additional nuisance variable to the separate GAN-based generator for
high-fidelity synthesis. To ensure that both generative models are aligned to
render the same generative factors, we further constrain the GAN generator to
maximize the mutual information between the learned latent code and the output.
Despite the simplicity, we show that the proposed method is highly effective,
achieving comparable image generation quality to the state-of-the-art methods
using the disentangled representation. We also show that the proposed
decomposition leads to an efficient and stable model design, and we demonstrate
photo-realistic high-resolution image synthesis results (1024x1024 pixels) for
the first time using the disentangled representations.

statistically compatible with the light-curve obtained with K2. The modelled

Two-dimensional semiconductor heterostructures offer a unique method to create
a quantum light source: a small lattice mismatch or relative twist in a
heterobilayer can create moir\'e trapping potentials for excitons which are
predicted to create arrays of quantum emitters. While signatures of moir\'e
trapped excitons have been observed, their quantum nature has yet to be

the water counterpart, thereby posing a counter-intuitive phenomenon. The
reduction in the evaporation rates is directly dependent on the salt
concentration and the surface wettability. Natural convection around the
droplet and thermal modulation of surface tension is found to be inadequate to
explain the mechanisms. Flow visualisations using particle image velocimetry
PIV reveals that the morphed advection within the saline droplets is a probable
reason behind the arrested evaporation. Infrared thermography is employed to
map the thermal state of the droplets. A thermosolutal Marangoni based scaling
analysis is put forward. It is observed that the Marangoni and internal
advection borne of thermal and solutal gradients are competitive, thereby
leading to the overall decay of internal circulation velocity, which reduces
the evaporation rates. The theoretically obtained advection velocities conform
to the experimental results. This study sheds rich insight on a novel yet

optical nanoresonators and nonlinear nanoantennas. Recently, excitation of the
high-quality supercavity modes (quasi-BIC states) in individual subwavelength
dielectric particles has been predicted to boost the nonlinear frequency
conversion at the nanoscale. Here, we put forward the multipolar model which
captures the physics behind linear and nonlinear response driven by such
high-$Q$ modes in nanoresonators. We show that formation of the quasi-BIC state
in the AlGaAs nanodisk can be understood through multipolar transformations of
coupled leaky modes. In particular, the hybridized axially symmetric
TE-polarized modes can be viewed as superpositions of multipoles, with a basis
of parent multipoles constituted mainly by magnetic dipoles and octupole. The
quasi-BIC point in the parameter space appears where dipolar losses are totally
suppressed. The efficient optical coupling to this state is implemented via
azimuthally polarized beam illumination matching its multipolar origin. We
establish a one-to-one correspondence between the standard non Hermitian
coupled-mode theory and multipolar models that enables transparent
interpretation of scattering characteristics. Using our approach, we derive the
multipolar composition of the generated second-harmonic radiation from the
AlGaAs nanodisk and validate it with full-wave numerical simulations.
Back-action of the second-harmonic radiation onto the fundamental frequency is
taken into account in the coupled nonlinear model with pump depletion. A hybrid
metal-dielectric nanoantenna is proposed to augment the conversion efficiency
up to tens of per cent and actualize the nonlinear parametric downconversion.
Our findings delineate the in-depth conceptual framework and novel promising
strategies in the design of functional elements for nonlinear nanophotonics
applications.

certificates signed by Certificate Authorities (CAs). However, software
products do not trust the same CAs and therefore maintain different root
stores, each typically containing hundreds of trusted roots capable of issuing
""trusted"" certificates for any domain. Incidents with misissued certificates
motivated Google to implement and enforce Certificate Transparency (CT). CT
logs archive certificates in a public, auditable and append-only manner. The
adoption of CT changed the trust landscape. As a part of this change, CT logs
started to maintain their own root lists and log certificates that chain back
to one of the trusted roots. In this paper, we present the first
characterization of this emerging CT root store landscape, as well as the tool
that we developed for data collection, visualization, and analysis of the root
stores. We compare the logs' root stores and quantify their changes with
respect to both each other and the root stores of major software vendors, look
at evolving vendor CT policies, and show that root store mismanagement may be
linked to log misbehavior. Finally, we present and discuss the results of a
survey that we have sent to the log operators participating in Apple's and
Google's CT log programs.

the MPEG-4 and MPEG-7 standard bodies. The aim of this project is to define the
principles of self-descriptive video coding. In order to establish them, the
document is composed in five chapters that describe the various envisioned
techniques for developing such a new approach in visual coding: - image
segmentation, - computation of visual descriptors, - computation of perceptual
groupings, - building of visual dictionaries, - picture and video coding. Based
on the techniques of multiresolution computing, it is proposed to develop an
image segmentation made from piecewise regular components, to compute
attributes on the frame and the rendering of so produced shapes, independently
to the geometric transforms that can occur in the image plane, and to gather
them into perceptual groupings so as to be able in performing recognition of
partially hidden patterns. Due to vector quantization of shapes frame and
rendering, it will appear that simple shapes may be compared to a visual
alphabet and that complex shapes then become words written using this alphabet
and be recorded into a dictionary. With the help of a nearest neighbour
scanning applied on the picture shapes, the self-descriptive coding will then
generate a sentence made from words written using the simple shape alphabet.

continuation of [38] where the case without mutations is considered. When
mutations are taken into account, it is necessary to control the corrector

defining, by the Hopf transform, a Hamilton-Jacobi equation with an effective
Hamiltonian as in homogenization problems. Its solution carries the singular
part of the limiting density (typically Dirac masses) and the corrector defines
the weights. The main new result of this paper is to prove that the corrector
is uniformly bounded, using only the global Lipschitz and semi-convexity
estimates for the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We also
establish the limiting equation satisfied by the corrector. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first example where such bounds can be proved in such a
context.

verification based on vector addition systems with states (VASS), which are
equivalent to Petri nets and form one of the most studied and applied models of
concurrency. Reachability for VASS is also inter-reducible with a plethora of
problems from a number of areas of computer science. In spite of recent
progress, the complexity of the reachability problem remains unsettled, and it
is closely related to the lengths of shortest VASS runs that witness
reachability.
  We consider VASS of fixed dimension, and obtain three main results. For the
first two, we assume that the integers in the input are given in unary, and
that the control graph of the given VASS is flat (i.e., without nested cycles).
We obtain a family of VASS in dimension 3 whose shortest reachability
witnessing runs are exponential, and we show that the reachability problem is
NP-hard in dimension 7. These results resolve negatively questions that had
been posed by the works of Blondin et al. in LICS 2015 and Englert et al. in
LICS 2016, and contribute a first construction that distinguishes 3-dimensional
flat VASS from 2-dimensional VASS.
  Our third result, by means of a novel family of products of integer
fractions, shows that 4-dimensional VASS can have doubly exponentially long
shortest reachability witnessing runs. The smallest dimension for which this

information metrics, named information Newton's flows. Here two information
metrics are considered, including both the Fisher-Rao metric and the
Wasserstein-2 metric. A known fact is that overdamped Langevin dynamics
correspond to Wasserstein gradient flows of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence.
Extending this fact to Wasserstein Newton's flows, we derive Newton's Langevin
dynamics. We provide examples of Newton's Langevin dynamics in both
one-dimensional space and Gaussian families. For the numerical implementation,
we design sampling efficient variational methods in affine models and
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) to approximate Wasserstein Newton's
directions. We also establish convergence results of the proposed information
Newton's method with approximated directions. Several numerical examples from
Bayesian sampling problems are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method.

general criterion for proving decisiveness of general STSs. This criterion,
which is very natural but whose proof is rather technical, (strictly)
generalizes all known criteria from the literature. Second, we focus on
stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), a stochastic extension of hybrid systems. We
establish the decisiveness of a large class of SHSs and, under a few classical
hypotheses from mathematical logic, we show how to decide reachability problems
in this class, even though they are undecidable for general SHSs. This provides
a decidable stochastic extension of o-minimal hybrid systems. [ABM07] Parosh A.

finite ratios of the qubit and cavity frequencies in terms of the energy gap,
the order parameter, as well as the fidelity, if the Stark coupling strength is
the same as the cavity frequency. The critical exponents are derived
analytically. The energy gap and the length critical exponents are different
from those in the quantum Rabi model and the Dicke model. The finite size
scaling analysis for the order parameter and the fidelity susceptibility is
also performed. The universal scaling behaviors are demonstrated and several
finite size exponents can be then extracted. Furthermore, universal critical
behavior can be also established in terms of the bosonic Hilbert space
truncation number, and the corresponding critical scaling exponents are found.
Interestingly, the critical correlation length exponents in terms of the
photonic truncation number as well as the equivalently effective length scales
are different in the Rabi-Stark model and the quantum Rabi model, suggesting
they belong to different universality classes. The second-order quantum phase
transition is convincingly corroborated in the Rabi-Stark model at finite
frequency ratios, by contrast, it only emerges at the infinite frequency ratio
in the original quantum Rabi model without the Stark coupling.

based on CALIPSO (Classifying ALl Interacting Pairs in a Single shOt), a
classifier of human-object interactions. This new single-shot interaction
classifier estimates interactions simultaneously for all human-object pairs,
regardless of their number and class. State-of-the-art approaches adopt a
multi-shot strategy based on a pairwise estimate of interactions for a set of
human-object candidate pairs, which leads to a complexity depending, at least,
on the number of interactions or, at most, on the number of candidate pairs. In
contrast, the proposed method estimates the interactions on the whole image.
Indeed, it simultaneously estimates all interactions between all human subjects
and object targets by performing a single forward pass throughout the image.
Consequently, it leads to a constant complexity and computation time
independent of the number of subjects, objects or interactions in the image. In
detail, interaction classification is achieved on a dense grid of anchors
thanks to a joint multi-task network that learns three complementary tasks
simultaneously: (i) prediction of the types of interaction, (ii) estimation of
the presence of a target and (iii) learning of an embedding which maps
interacting subject and target to a same representation, by using a metric
learning strategy. In addition, we introduce an object-centric passive-voice
verb estimation which significantly improves results. Evaluations on the two
well-known Human-Object Interaction image datasets, V-COCO and HICO-DET,
demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method (2nd place) compared to
the state-of-the-art while having constant computation time regardless of the
number of objects and interactions in the image.

  theory?",,,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an interpretative framework for quantum mechanics corresponding to
the specifications of Louis de Broglie's double-solution theory. The principle
is to decompose the evolution of a quantum system into two wave functions: an
external wave function corresponding to the evolution of its center of mass and
an internal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its internal
variables in the center-of-mass system. Mathematical decomposition is only
possible in certain cases because there are many interactions linking these two
parts. In addition, these two wave functions will have different meanings and
interpretations. The external wave function ""pilots"" the center of mass of the
quantum system: it corresponds to the Broglie pilot wave. When the Planck
constant tends to zero, it results mathematically from the convergence of the
square of the module and the phase of the external wave function to a density
and a classical action verifying the Hamilton-Jacobi statistical equations.
This interpretation explains all the measurement results, namely those yielded
by interference, spin measurement (Stern and Gerlach) and non-locality (EPR-B)
experiments. For the internal wave function, several interpretations are
possible : the one of the pilot wave can be applied in cascade to the internal
wave function. However, the interpretation proposed by Erwin Schr{\""o}dinger at
the Solvay Congress in 1927 and restricted to the internal wave function is
also possible. For Schr{\""o}dinger, the particles are extended and the square
of the module of the (internal) wave function of an electron corresponds to the
density of its charge in space. We present many arguments in favour of this
interpretation, which like the pilot wave interpretation is realistic and
deterministic. Finally, we will see that this double interpretation serves as a
frame of reference by which to better understand the debates on the
interpretation of quantum mechanics and to review the relationships between
gravity and quantum mechanics.

conduction and convection heat transfers are considered. It consists of an
inner tube and an outer structure of casing, gravel, and cement layers. In the
reservoir, a similarity solution employing a moving boundary separating the
dissociated and undissociated zones is employed to build the analytical
solution. Two different operating schemes for water supply into wellbore heat
source have been studied: i) from the inner tube; and ii) from the annulus
section of the wellbore. Temperature distribution along the wellbore,
temperature and pressure distributions in the reservoir, hydrate dissociation
rate, and energy efficiency considering various initial and boundary conditions

have almost the same results with slightly higher gas production in the case of
hot water entry into annulus, which is in direct contact with the reservoir.
Increasing the inlet water temperature or decreasing the wellbore pressure
increases gas production. Applying them simultaneously results in a greater gas
production and energy efficiency. Some of the reservoir's properties, such as
porosity, thermal diffusivity, thermal conductivity, and reservoir thickness,
have direct relation with the dissociation rate, but the reservoir's

parameters in nuclear data libraries. To evaluate these parameters, campaigns
of measurements are fitted with a parametric model of nuclear cross sections
called R-matrix theory. In order to remove the arbitrary boundary parameters in
the Wigner-Eisenbud R-matrix parametrization, the community is considering
converting all nuclear data libraries to Brune parameters. In this article, we
show there are more Brune parameters than previously thought. Below the channel
threshold, we prove there exists two types of additional 'shadow poles' -
branch shadow poles and analytic shadow poles - depending on how we continue
R-matrix operators to complex wavenumbers (to do so we establish Mittag-Leffler
expansions of R-matrix operators). This entails there are more Brune resonance
energies than levels. Yet, we also prove that choosing any subset of Brune
poles will yield the same cross sections than using the entire set of Brune
poles, as long as it has at least the number of levels. In practice, this means
that shadow Brune poles can be discarded from the new nuclear data libraries.
Many isotopes are evaluated with the Reich-Moore approximation, introducing
complex resonance energies to eliminate certain channels. We generalize Brune's
parameterization to encompass the Reich-Moore approximation and the additional
shadow poles, and show that all Brune parameters depend on what convention we
choose to continue the R-matrix operators to complex wavenumbers. To convert
nuclear data libraries to Brune parameters, the nuclear scientists community
must thus first decide on such a convention. The authors argue in favor of
analytic continuation. The first evidence of shadow poles in Brune's
alternative parametrization of R-matrix theory is observed in isotope
xenon-134, spin-parity group 1/2(-).

while maintaining their form. Given the nature of this kind of neologisms, the
task of identifying these new word meanings is currently performed manually by
specialists at observatories of neology. To detect SN in a semi-automatic way,
we developed a system that implements a combination of the following
strategies: topic modeling, keyword extraction, and word sense disambiguation.
The role of topic modeling is to detect the themes that are treated in the
input text. Themes within a text give clues about the particular meaning of the
words that are used, for example: viral has one meaning in the context of
computer science (CS) and another when talking about health. To extract
keywords, we used TextRank with POS tag filtering. With this method, we can
obtain relevant words that are already part of the Spanish lexicon. We use a
deep learning model to determine if a given keyword could have a new meaning.
Embeddings that are different from all the known meanings (or topics) indicate
that a word might be a valid SN candidate. In this study, we examine the
following word embedding models: Word2Vec, Sense2Vec, and FastText. The models
were trained with equivalent parameters using Wikipedia in Spanish as corpora.
Then we used a list of words and their concordances (obtained from our database
of neologisms) to show the different embeddings that each model yields.
Finally, we present a comparison of these outcomes with the concordances of
each word to show how we can determine if a word could be a valid candidate for
SN.

Transliteration is a way to consider the context of word/sentence during

historical phonology of West Iranian languages. The West Iranian languages
(Persian, Kurdish, Balochi, and other languages) display a high degree of
non-Lautgesetzlich behavior. Most of this irregularity is undoubtedly due to
language contact; we argue, however, that an oversimplified view of the
processes at work has prevailed in the literature on West Iranian dialectology,
with specialists assuming that deviations from an expected outcome in a given
non-Persian language are due to lexical borrowing from some chronological stage
of Persian. It is demonstrated that this qualitative approach yields at times
problematic conclusions stemming from the lack of explicit probabilistic
inferences regarding the distribution of the data: Persian may not be the sole
donor language; additionally, borrowing at the lexical level is not always the
mechanism that introduces irregularity. In many cases, the possibility that
West Iranian languages show different reflexes in different conditioning
environments remains under-explored. We employ a novel Bayesian approach
designed to overcome these problems and tease apart the different determinants
of irregularity in patterns of West Iranian sound change. Our methodology
allows us to provisionally resolve a number of outstanding questions in the
literature on West Iranian dialectology concerning the dialectal affiliation of
certain sound changes. We outline future directions for work of this sort.

Although many machine learning techniques have been presented for assisting

can diagnose independently without relying on an ophthalmologist, i.e., there
is no technique that does not overlook any anomaly, including unlearned
diseases. As long as there is a risk of overlooking a disease with a technique,
ophthalmologists must double-check even those images that the technique
classifies as normal. Here, we show that our deep-learning-based binary
classifier (normal or abnormal) achieved a perfect classification on 108,308

true negative rate = 1.000000; hence, the area under the ROC curve = 1.0000000.
Although the test set included three types of diseases, two of these were not

Furthermore, we demonstrated that our scheme was able to cope with differences

Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of different hyperparameter settings

performance on par with state-of-the-art B-spline interpolation. The greatest
clinical benefit of GP-based interpolation is that it gives a reliable estimate

the strict conservation law of momentum always holds in the entangled state
form of the momentum eigenstates of a closed composite system with interactions
among subsystems, by expanding the total wave function to the sum of the
products of momentum eigenstates of subsystems. Common scenario is that one of
the two subsystems of a composite system is large or strong, its state remains
approximately unchanged in a short time and the entangled state can be
approximately written as a product state, which can be easily deduced from the
paper of Haroche's group in 2001. The considered micro-subsystem can be
approximately represented as the superposition of its different momentum
eigenstates; therefore, the approximation can be used to explain why the law
holds statistically for the subsystem and for any single particle due to
neglecting the interactions with the large subsystem or the environment. So the
two momentum conservation laws reasonably hold without conflicts.

students, which has been shown to improve educational outcomes. However, we
find limited discussion and empirical measurement of peer review in
visualization coursework. In addition to engagement, peer review provides
direct and diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts
through critical evaluation of others' work. In this paper, we discuss the
construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization
course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a
feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to
reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we
evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire
from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses. The results
indicate that course concepts are reinforced with peer review---82% reported
learning more because of peer review, and 75% of students recommended
continuing it. Finally, we provide a road-map for adapting peer review to other
visualization courses to produce more highly engaged students.

faced with the task of reducing their capital and operational expenses while
simultaneously improving network performance and addressing the increased

identified as a solution, several challenges must be addressed to ensure its
feasibility. In this paper, we address the Virtual Network Function (VNF)
placement problem by developing a machine learning decision tree model that
learns from the effective placement of the various VNF instances forming a
Service Function Chain (SFC). The model takes several performance-related
features from the network as an input and selects the placement of the various
VNF instances on network servers with the objective of minimizing the delay
between dependent VNF instances. The benefits of using machine learning are
realized by moving away from a complex mathematical modelling of the system and
towards a data-based understanding of the system. Using the Evolved Packet Core
(EPC) as a use case, we evaluate our model on different data center networks
and compare it to the BACON algorithm in terms of the delay between
interconnected components and the total delay across the SFC. Furthermore, a
time complexity analysis is performed to show the effectiveness of the model in
NFV applications.

number of web services at the Internet-scale, the service recommendation is
becoming a challenge nowadays. One of the prime aspects influencing the service
recommendation is the Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameter, which depicts the
performance of a web service. In general, the service provider furnishes the
value of the QoS parameters during service deployment. However, in reality, the
QoS values of service vary across different users, time, locations, etc.
Therefore, estimating the QoS value of service before its execution is an
important task, and thus the QoS prediction has gained significant research
attention. Multiple approaches are available in the literature for predicting
service QoS. However, these approaches are yet to reach the desired accuracy
level. In this paper, we study the QoS prediction problem across different
users, and propose a novel solution by taking into account the contextual
information of both services and users. Our proposal includes two key steps:
(a) hybrid filtering and (b) hierarchical prediction mechanism. On the one
hand, the hybrid filtering method aims to obtain a set of similar users and
services, given a target user and a service. On the other hand, the goal of the
hierarchical prediction mechanism is to estimate the QoS value accurately by
leveraging hierarchical neural-regression. We evaluate our framework on the
publicly available WS-DREAM datasets. The experimental results show the
outperformance of our framework over the major state-of-the-art approaches.

illustrious section of the French academia. In overfilled sessions at the
Coll\'{e}ge de France and the Sorbonne, Einstein explained his theories of
relativity, and prominent physicists, mathematicians and philosophers listened,
debated, questioned and explored facets of relativity. The 1922 visit had its
echoes in the life and works of many who participated, particularly decisive
for Einstein and the philosopher Henri Bergson. This essay examines that
eventful visit, focusing on the physical and logical aspects of Bergson's
critique, with physics commentaries, linking prominent French physicists and
mathematicians Langevin, Painlev\'{e}, Hadamard, Becquerel, Sagnac, and
Kastler. I give particular attention to the logical and empirical accuracy of
the physics issues involved, delineating Bergson's exact reasoning for his
philosophical enthusiasm in Einstein's theory and for the ensuing critique.
Bergson's philosophical stand on duration and simultaneity is reassessed in the
context of later developments in cosmological physics as well as the wealth of
empirical data involving comparison of atomic clocks. Finally we are led
naturally to a surprising completion of the philosopher's program on universal
time, duration and simultaneity, in harmony with the time of the physicist. In
the appendices after the main text I also give the physics background and
easily verifiable proofs for the assertions made in the text, pertaining to
relativity, simultaneity and time dilation, clearly distinguishing beliefs and
facts.

content popularity, optimal content caching probabilities can be found, e.g.,
from solving optimization problems, and existing results in the literature can
implement the optimal caching probabilities via static content placement. The
objective of this work is to design dynamic probabilistic caching that: i)
converge (in distribution) to the optimal content caching probabilities under
time-invariant content popularity, and ii) adapt to the time-varying
instantaneous content popularity under time-varying content popularity.
Achieving the above objective requires a novel design of dynamic content
replacement because static caching cannot adapt to varying content popularity
while classic dynamic replacement policies, such as LRU, cannot converge to
target caching probabilities (as they do not exploit any content popularity
information). We model the design of dynamic probabilistic replacement policy
as the problem of finding the state transition probability matrix of a Markov

matrix. Extensive numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness

is capable of providing a more general route to known Lie symmetries,
