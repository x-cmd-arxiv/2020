investment dynamics in the wine industry from the three European Union (EU)
largest producers. The wine sector deserves special attention to investigate
firms' investment behavior given the high competition imposed by the
latecomers. More precisely, we investigate how the capitalization, liquidity
and profitability influence the investment dynamics using firm-level data from
the wine industry from France (331 firms), Italy (335) firms and Spain (442)
firms. We use data from 2007 to 2014, drawing a comparison between these
countries, and relying on difference-and system-GMM estimators. Specifically,
the impact of profitability is positive and significant, while the
capitalization has a significant and negative impact on the investment dynamics
only in France and Spain. The influence of the liquidity ratio is negative and
significant only in the case of Spain. Therefore, we notice different
investment strategies for wine companies located in the largest producer
countries. It appears that these findings are in general robust to different
specifications of liquidity and profitability ratios, and to the different
estimators we use.

has drawn great attentions from social security and emergency service
department in recent years since intelligent surveillance aforehand could avail
the proper decision making before operations being carried out. However, due to
the influence of the wall effects, the obtained micro-Doppler signatures would
be severely degenerated by strong near zero-frequency DC components, which
would inevitably smear the detailed characteristic features of different behind
wall motions in time-frequency (TF) map and further hinder the motion
recognition and classification. In this paper, an ultra-wideband (UWB) radar
system is first employed to probe through the opaque wall to detect the behind
wall motions, which often span a certain number of range bin cells. By
employing such a system, a high resolution range map can be obtained, in which
the embedded rich range information is expected to be fully exploited to
improve the subsequent recognition and classification performance. Secondly, a
high-pass filter is applied to remove the effect of the wall in the raw range
map. Then, with the aim of enhancing the characteristic features of different
behind wall motions in TF maps, a novel range-max enhancement strategy is
proposed to extract the most significant micro-Doppler feature of each TF cell
along all range bins for a specific motion. Lastly, the effectiveness of the
proposed micro-Doppler signature enhancement strategy is investigated by means
of onsite experiments and comparative classification. Both the feature enhanced
TF maps and classification results show that the proposed approach outperforms
other state-of-art Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) based TF feature
extraction methods.

sea is a long-standing challenge in many-body physics. When the interactions
are short-ranged, two vastly different ground states exist: a polaron
quasiparticle and a molecule dressed by the majority atoms. In the
single-impurity limit, it is predicted that at a critical interaction strength,
a first-order transition occurs between these two states. Experiments, however,
are always conducted in the finite temperature and impurity density regime. The
fate of the polaron-to-molecule transition under these conditions, where the
statistics of quantum impurities and thermal effects become relevant, is still
unknown. Here, we address this question experimentally and theoretically. Our
experiments are performed with a spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas with
tunable interactions. Utilizing a novel Raman spectroscopy combined with a
high-sensitivity fluorescence detection technique, we isolate the quasiparticle
contribution and extract the polaron energy, spectral weight, and the contact
parameter. As the interaction strength is increased, we observe a continuous
variation of all observables, in particular a smooth reduction of the
quasiparticle weight as it goes to zero beyond the transition point. Our
observation is in good agreement with a theoretical model where polaron and
molecule quasiparticle states are thermally occupied according to their quantum
statistics. At the experimental conditions, polaron states are hence populated
even at interactions where the molecule is the ground state and vice versa. The
emerging physical picture is thus that of a smooth transition between polarons
and molecules and a coexistence of both in the region around the expected
transition.

very high brightness temperatures implying highly coherent emission. We suggest
that the FRBs are caused by the self-focusing of an electron beam interacting
with an ambient plasma right beyond the light cylinder radius of a neutron
star. The magnetic field at the light cylinder radius is relatively high which
can accommodate both young Crab-like systems and old millisecond pulsars
addressing the diverse environments of FRBs. At the first stage, the intense
pulsed-beam passing through the background plasma causes instabilities such
that the trapped particles in local Buneman-type cavitons saturate the local
field. The beam is then radially self-focused due to the circular electric
field developed by the two-stream instability which leads to Weibel instability
in the transverse direction. Finally, the non-linear saturation of the Weibel
instability results in the self-modulational formation of solitons due to
plasmoid instability. The resonant solitary waves are the breather-type
solitons hosting relativistic particles with self-excited oscillations. The
analytical solutions obtained for non-linear dispersion and solitons suggest
that, near the current sheets, the relativistic bunches are
accelerated/amplified by klystron-like structures due to self-excited
oscillations by the induced local electric field. Boosted coherent radio
emission propagates through a narrow cone with strong focusing due to radial
electric field and magnetic pinching. The non-linear evolution of solitons and
the stimulated emission are associated with the Buneman instability and the
possibility of the presence of nanosecond shots in FRBs are investigated.

cancellation occurs much more frequently than previously thought, we
analytically estimated the energy released from reconnection driven by

chromospheric and coronal heating (Priest et al., 2018). Using two-dimensional
simulations we validated the analytical estimates and studied the resulting
atmospheric response (Syntelis et al. 2019). In the present work, we set up
three-dimensional resistive MHD simulations of two cancelling polarities in a
stratified atmosphere with a horizontal external field to further validate and
improve upon the analytical estimates. The computational evaluation of the
parameters associated with the energy release are in good qualitative agreement
with the analytical estimates. The computational Poynting energy flux into the
current sheet is in good qualitative agreement with the analytical estimates,
after correcting the analytical expression to better account for the horizontal
extent of the current sheet. The atmospheric response to the cancellation is
the formation of hot ejections, cool ejections, or a combination of both hot
and cool ejections, which can appear with a time difference and/or be spatially
offset, depending on the properties of the cancelling region and the resulting

Earth, and the simultaneous detection of these gases in a planetary atmosphere
is an especially strong biosignature. However, these gases may be challenging
to detect together in the planetary atmospheres because photochemical oxygen
radicals destroy methane. Previous work has shown that the photochemical
lifetime of methane in oxygenated atmospheres is longer around M dwarfs, but M
dwarf planet habitability may be hindered by extreme stellar activity and
evolution. Here, we use a 1-D photochemical-climate model to show that K dwarf
stars also offer a longer photochemical lifetime of methane in the presence of
oxygen compared to G dwarfs. For example, we show that a planet orbiting a K6V
star can support about an order of magnitude more methane in its atmosphere
compared to an equivalent planet orbiting a G2V star. In the reflected light
spectra of worlds orbiting K dwarf stars, strong oxygen and methane features
could be observed at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Because K dwarfs
are dimmer than G dwarfs, they offer a better planet-star contrast ratio,
enhancing the signal-to-noise (SNR) possible in a given observation. For
instance, a 50 hour observation of a planet at 7 pc with a 15-m telescope
yields SNR = 9.2 near 1 um for a planet orbiting a solar-type G2V star, and SNR
= 20 for the same planet orbiting a K6V star. In particular, nearby mid-late K
dwarfs such as 61 Cyg A/B, Epsilon Indi, Groombridge 1618, and HD 156026 may be

Indistinguishability associated with the symmetry group -- SU($N$) or O($N$) in
gauge theory, and S$_N$ permutations in the system of identical bosons -- is
crucial for the formation of the condensed (confined) phase. We relate standard
criteria, based on off-diagonal long range order (ODLRO) for BEC and the
Polyakov loop for gauge theory. The constant offset of the distribution of the
phases of the Polyakov loop corresponds to ODLRO, and gives the order parameter
for the partially-(de)confined phase at finite coupling. We demonstrate this
explicitly for several quantum mechanical systems (i.e., theories at small or
zero spatial volume) at weak coupling, and argue that this mechanism extends to
large volume and/or strong coupling. This viewpoint may have implications for
confinement at finite $N$, and for quantum gravity via gauge/gravity duality.

shell geometries has been studied in past theoretical work, providing
strategies to produce liquid crystal shells with controlled defect structure or
valence. However, the predictions of such studies have not been experimentally
explored yet. In this work, we study the structural transformations undergone
by tetravalent nematic liquid crystal shells under a strong uniform magnetic
field, using both experiments and simulations. We consider two different cases
in terms of shell geometry and initial defect symmetry: i) homogeneous shells
with four s = +1/2 defects in a tetrahedral arrangement, and ii) inhomogeneous
shells with four s = +1/2 defects localized in their thinner parts.
Consistently with previous theoretical results, we observe that the initial
defect structure evolves into a bipolar one, in a process where the defects
migrate towards the poles. Interestingly, we find that the defect trajectories
and dynamics are controlled by curvature walls that connect the defects by
pairs. Based on the angle between Bs, the local projection of the magnetic
field on the shell surface, and n+ 1/2 , a vector describing the defect
orientations, we are able to predict the nature and shape of those inversion
walls, and therefore, the trajectory and dynamics of the defects. This rule,
based on symmetry arguments, is consistent with both experiments and
simulations and applies for shells that are either homogeneous or inhomogeneous
in thickness. By modifying the angle between Bs and n+1/2, we are able to
induce, in controlled way, complex routes towards the final bipolar state. In
the case of inhomogeneous shells, the specific symmetry of the shell allowed us
to observe a hybrid splay-bend Helfrich wall for the first time.

important design criterion for our descriptor is the robustness to different

significantly overfit to a particular resolution or even a particular

between two incompressible fluids of different densities and viscosities in

where the latter is due to surface tension. To leading order, both the Muskat
problems with and without surface tension effect are scaling invariant in the
Sobolev space $H^{1+\frac{d}{2}}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, where $d$ is the dimension of
the interface. We prove that for any subcritical data satisfying the
Rayleigh-Taylor condition, solutions of the Muskat problem with surface tension
$\frak{s}$ converge to the unique solution of the Muskat problem without
surface tension locally in time with the rate $\sqrt{\frak{s}}$ when
$\frak{s}\to 0$. This allows for initial interfaces that have unbounded or even

swirling jets from a global instability. In this work, the PVC is investigated
under highly turbulent conditions. The goal is to characterize the receptivity
of the PVC to active flow control, both theoretically and experimentally. Based
on stereoscopic particle image velocimetry and surface pressure measurements,
the experimental studies are facilitated by Fourier decomposition and proper
orthogonal decomposition. The frequency and the mode shape of the PVC are
extracted and a very good agreement with the theoretical prediction by global
linear stability analysis (LSA) is found. By employing an adjoint LSA, it is
found that the PVC is particularly receptive inside the duct upstream of the
swirling jet. Open-loop zero net mass flux actuation is applied at different
axial positions inside the duct with the goal of frequency synchronization of
the PVC. The actuation is shown to have the strongest effect close to the exit
of the duct. There, frequency synchronization is reached primarily through
direct mode-to-mode interaction. Applying the actuation farther upstream,
synchronization is only achieved by a modification of the mean flow that
manipulates the swirl number. These experimental observations match
qualitatively well with the theoretical receptivity derived from adjoint LSA.
Although the process of synchronization is very complex, it is concluded that
adjoint LSA based on mean field theory sufficiently predicts regions of high
and low receptivity. Furthermore, the adjoint framework promises to be a
valuable tool for finding ideal locations for flow control applications.

framework of causal tensors, i.e., multilinear stochastic maps that transform
source data into destination data. This framework enables us to express an
indirect association in terms of the constituting, direct associations. This is
not possible when using average measures like mutual information or transfer
entropy. From this, an intuitive definition of redundant and unique information
arises. The proposed redundancy satisfies the three axioms stated by introduced
by Williams and Beer. The symmetry and self-redundancy properties follow
directly from our definition. The Data Processing Inequality ensures that the
monotonicity axiom is satisfied. Additional, two other proposed axioms are
satisfied: the identity property, and the left monotonicity axiom. Because
causal tensors can describe both mutual information as transfer entropy, the
proposed partial information decomposition applies to both measures. Results
show that the decomposition closely resembles the decomposition of another
approach that expresses associations in terms of mutual information a
posteriori. It is furthermore demonstrated that negative contributions can
arise when our assumptions about completeness of the data set, or what should
be included as a source, are incorrect.

interest, receiving much attention in recent years. Some localization
algorithms use the Euclidean distance as a similarity measure between the local
image acquired by a camera and a global map, which acts as side information.
The global map is typically expressed in terms of the coordinate system of the
road plane. Yet, a road image captured by a camera is subject to distortion in
that nearby features on the road have much larger footprints on the focal plane
of the camera compared with those of equally-sized features that lie farther
ahead of the vehicle. Using commodity computational tools, it is
straightforward to execute a transformation and, thereby, bring the distorted
image into the frame of reference of the global map. However, this nonlinear
transformation results in unequal noise amplification. The noise profile
induced by this transformation should be accounted for when trying to match an
acquired image to a global map, with more reliable regions being given more
weight in the process. This physical reality presents an algorithmic
opportunity to improve existing localization algorithms, especially in harsh
conditions. This article reviews the physics of road feature acquisition
through a camera, and it proposes an improved matching method rooted in
statistical analysis. Findings are supported by numerical simulations.

studies of single hydrogen-rich stars, the results of evolution in close binary
systems. The effects of varying the mass-loss rate and metallicity are
calculated using a simple semi-analytic approach to stellar evolution that is
tuned to reproduce detailed numerical calculations. Though the total fraction
of black holes made in stellar collapse events varies considerably with
metallicity, mass-loss rate, and mass cutoff, from 5$\%$ to 30$\%$, the shapes
of their birth functions are very similar for all reasonable variations in
these quantities. Median neutron star masses are in the range 1.32 - 1.37
$M_\odot$ regardless of metallicity. The median black hole mass for solar
metallicity is typically 8 to 9 $M_\odot$ if only initial helium cores below 40
$M_\odot$ (ZAMS mass less than 80 $M_\odot$) are counted, and 9 - 13 $M_\odot$,
in most cases, if helium cores with initial masses up to 150 $M_\odot$ (ZAMS

limit the number of false alarms while being computational efficient for

Isolator is to maximise the number of vertices which are not incident to any
edges claimed by Toucher, and the aim of Toucher is to minimise this number.
Let $u\left(G\right)$ be the number of isolated vertices when both players play
optimally. Dowden, Kang, Mikala\v{c}ki and Stojakovi\'{c} proved that
$\left\lceil \frac{n+2}{8}\right\rceil \le u\left(T\right)\leq\left\lfloor

  The aim of this paper is to improve the lower bound to

is associated with a random set $e(x) \subseteq [n]$ of buckets with capacity
$\ell \geq 1$ by hash functions. This setting is captured by the hypergraph $H
= ([n],\{e(x) \mid x \in S\})$. Accomodating each key in an associated bucket
amounts to finding an $\ell$-orientation of $H$ assigning to each hyperedge an
incident vertex such that each vertex is assigned at most $\ell$ hyperedges. If
each subhypergraph of $H$ has minimum degree at most $\ell$, then an
$\ell$-orientation can be found greedily and $H$ is called $\ell$-peelable.
Peelability has a central role in invertible Bloom lookup tables and can speed
up the construction of retrieval data structures, perfect hash functions and
cuckoo hash tables.
  Many hypergraphs exhibit sharp density thresholds with respect to
$\ell$-orientability and $\ell$-peelability, i.e. as the density $c =
\frac{m}{n}$ grows past a critical value, the probability of these properties
drops from almost $1$ to almost $0$. In fully random $k$-uniform hypergraphs
the thresholds $c_{k,\ell}^*$ for $\ell$-orientability significantly exceed the
thresholds for $\ell$-peelability. In this paper, for every $k \geq 2$ and
$\ell \geq 1$ with $(k,\ell) \neq (2,1)$ and every $z > 0$, we construct a new
family of random $k$-uniform hypergraphs with i.i.d. random hyperedges such
that both the $\ell$-peelability and the $\ell$-orientability thresholds
approach $c_{k,\ell}^*$ as $z \rightarrow \infty$.
  We exploit the phenomenon of threshold saturation via spatial coupling
discovered in the context of low-density parity-check codes. Once the
connection to data structures is in plain sight, a framework by Kudekar,

classifying vertebral levels with high accuracy is challenging due to the
similar appearance of each vertebra, the curvature of the spine, and the
possibility of anomalies such as fractured vertebrae, implants, lumbarization

system that can accurately and robustly identify the L1 level in large
heterogeneous datasets. The first approach we study is using a 3D U-Net to
segment the L1 vertebra directly using the entire scan volume to provide
context. We also tested models for two class segmentation of L1 and T12 and a
three class segmentation of L1, T12 and the rib attached to T12. By increasing
the number of training examples to 249 scans using pseudo-segmentations from an
in-house segmentation tool we were able to achieve 98% accuracy with respect to
identifying the L1 vertebra, with an average error of 4.5 mm in the
craniocaudal level. We next developed an algorithm which performs iterative
instance segmentation and classification of the entire spine with a 3D U-Net.
We found the instance based approach was able to yield better segmentations of
nearly the entire spine, but had lower classification accuracy for L1.

that is currently gloomed by the key challenge of learning a good control
policy in a short period of time in an online and continuing fashion. To tackle
this challenge, an event-triggered -- as opposed to classic time-triggered --

only for problems with sufficient structure. While it is well known that query
problems with full permutation symmetry can have at most polynomial quantum
speedup -- even for partial functions -- it is unclear how far this condition
must be relaxed to enable exponential speedup. In particular, it is natural to
ask whether exponential speedup is possible for (partial) graph properties, in
which the input describes a graph and the output can only depend on its
isomorphism class. We show that the answer to this question depends strongly on
the input model. In the adjacency matrix model, we prove that the bounded-error
randomized query complexity $R$ of any graph property $\mathcal{P}$ has
$R(\mathcal{P}) = O(Q(\mathcal{P})^{6})$, where $Q$ is the bounded-error
quantum query complexity. This negatively resolves an open question of
Montanaro and de Wolf in the adjacency matrix model. More generally, we prove
$R(\mathcal{P}) = O(Q(\mathcal{P})^{3l})$ for any $l$-uniform hypergraph
property $\mathcal{P}$ in the adjacency matrix model. In direct contrast, in
the adjacency list model for bounded-degree graphs, we exhibit a promise
problem that shows an exponential separation between the randomized and quantum

observed data are noise-free in the input attributes. Nevertheless, scenarios

machine learning method is expected to perform sub-optimally. In this paper, we
focus on multi-class classification problems and use Gaussian processes (GPs)
as the underlying classifier. Motivated by a data set coming from the
astrophysics domain, we hypothesize that the observed data may contain noise in
the inputs. Therefore, we devise several multi-class GP classifiers that can
account for input noise. Such classifiers can be efficiently trained using
variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent

be known before-hand. If this is the case, it can be readily introduced in the
proposed methods. This prior information is expected to lead to better
performance results. We have evaluated the proposed methods by carrying out
several experiments, involving synthetic and real data. These include several
data sets from the UCI repository, the MNIST data set and a data set coming

sparked debate on whether the gas is primordial or secondary. Since secondary
gas released from planetesimals is poor in H$_2$, it was thought that CO would
quickly photodissociate never reaching the high levels observed around the
majority of A stars with bright debris discs. Kral et al. 2019 showed that
neutral carbon produced by CO photodissociation can effectively shield CO and
potentially explain the high CO masses around 9 A stars with bright debris
discs. Here we present a new model that simulates the gas viscous evolution,
accounting for carbon shielding and how the gas release rate decreases with
time as the planetesimal disc loses mass. We find that the present gas mass in
a system is highly dependant on its evolutionary path. Since gas is lost on
long timescales, it can retain a memory of the initial disc mass. Moreover, we
find that gas levels can be out of equilibrium and quickly evolving from a
shielded onto an unshielded state. With this model, we build the first
population synthesis of gas around A stars, which we use to constrain the disc
viscosity. We find a good match with a high viscosity ($\alpha\sim0.1$),
indicating that gas is lost on timescales $\sim1-10$ Myr. Moreover, our model
also shows that high CO masses are not expected around FGK stars since their
planetesimal discs are born with lower masses, explaining why shielded discs
are only found around A stars. Finally, we hypothesise that the observed carbon
cavities could be due to radiation pressure or accreting planets.

effectively samples H$\alpha$ emitters over a wide range of luminosities,

$L_{R}=2\times10^{15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$, and lower limit on linear
polarization of $|Q/I|>0.12\pm0.04$. We examine the characteristics common to
these new AU Mic events and those from Proxima Cen previously reported in
MacGregor et al. (2018) - namely short durations, negative spectral indices,
and significant linear polarization - to provide new diagnostics of conditions
in outer stellar atmospheres and details of stellar flare particle
acceleration. The event rates ($\sim20$ and $4$ events day$^{-1}$ for AU Mic

but have been undetected until now. Analysis of the flare observing frequency
and consideration of possible incoherent emission mechanisms confirms the
presence of MeV electrons in the stellar atmosphere occurring as part of the
flare process. The spectral indices point to a hard distribution of electrons.
The short durations and lack of pronounced exponential decay in the light curve
are consistent with formation in a simple magnetic loop, with radio emission
predominating from directly precipitating electrons. We consider the
possibility of both synchrotron and gyrosynchrotron emission mechanisms,
although synchrotron is favored given the linear polarization signal. This
would imply that the emission must be occurring in a low density environment of
only modest magnetic field strength. A deeper understanding of this newly
discovered and apparently common stellar flare mechanism awaits more
observations with better-studied flare components at other wavelengths.

spin changes that BHs experience during both coalescence events and gas
accretion phases. For the latter, we assume that spin changes are coupled with
the bulge assembly. This assumption leads to predictions for the median spin
values of z=0 BHs that depend on whether they are hosted by pseudobulges,
classical bulges or ellipticals, being a ~ 0.9, 0.7 and 0.4, respectively. The
outcomes of the model display a good consistency with z<4 quasar luminosity

the disruption of satellite galaxies (orphan wBH) and ejections due to
gravitational recoils (ejected wBH). The model points to a number density of
wBHs that increases with decreasing redshift, although this population is
always ~2 dex smaller than the one of nuclear black holes. At all redshifts,
wBHs are typically hosted in M_{halo}>10^{13} M_{\odot} and M_{stellar}>10^{10}
M_{\odot}, being orphan wBHs the dominant type. Besides, independently of
redshift and halo mass, \textit{ejected} wBHs inhabit the central regions

depletion of nuclear BHs with decreasing redshift and stellar mass. Moreover,
ejection events lead to changes in the predicted local black hole-bulge

semiconductor-superconductor Majorana nanowires is in contrast with the typical
expectations based on the presence of Majorana zero modes localized at the ends
of the system, when the amplitude of the hybridization energy oscillations is
predicted to increase with the applied magnetic field. These observations have
been theoretically justified recently by considering a position-dependent,
step-like spin-orbit coupling near end of the nanowire, which could arise due
to the presence of tunnel gates in a standard tunneling conductance experiment.
Here, we show that the window in parameter space where this phenomenology
occurs is vanishingly small, when compared to the parameter region where
Majorana oscillations increase in amplitude with the applied field. Further,
including a position-dependent effective potential, which is also induced
naturally near the end of the wire by, e.g., tunnel gates, practically removes
the small window associated with decaying oscillations. Using extensive
numerical calculations, we show that, as expected, increasing amplitude
oscillations of the hybridization energy represent a generic property of
topological Majorana zero modes, while decreasing amplitude oscillations are a
generic property of low-energy trivial Andreev bound states that typically
emerge in non-homogeneous systems. By averaging over several realistic
parameter configurations, we identify robust features of the hybridization
energy that can be observed in a typical differential conductance experiment
without fine-tuning the control parameters.

produce $\sim$100 km sized objects. Still, the conditions under which
planetesimal formation occurs remain unclear. For collapse to proceed, the
self-gravity of an overdensity must overcome stellar tidal disruption on large
scales and turbulent diffusion on small scales. Here, we relate the scales of
streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which both regulate particle
densities on the scales of gravitational collapse, directly to planetesimal
formation. We support our analytic findings by performing 3D hydrodynamical
simulations of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and planetesimal
formation. We find that the vertical extent of the particle mid-plane layer and
the radial width of streaming instability filaments are set by the same
characteristic length scale, thus governing the strength of turbulent diffusion
on the scales of planetesimal formation. We present and successfully test a
collapse criterion: $0.1 Q \beta \epsilon^{-1}Z^{-1} \lesssim 1$ and show that
even for Solar metallicities, planetesimals can form in dead zones of
sufficiently massive disks. For a given gas Toomre-parameter $Q$, pressure
gradient $\beta$, metallicity $Z$ and local particle enhancement $\epsilon$,
the collapse criterion also provides a range of unstable scales, instituting a
promising path for studying initial planetesimal mass distributions. Streaming
instability is not required for planetesimal collapse, but by increasing

effective field theory is employed at next-to-leading order. Hyperon-nucleon
three-body forces are approximated using saturation by decuplet baryons and are
transcribed to density-dependent effective two-body interactions. These
together are taken as input in a Brueckner-Bethe-Goldstone equation with
explicit treatment of the $\Lambda N\leftrightarrow\Sigma N$ and $\Lambda
NN\leftrightarrow\Sigma NN$ coupled channels. Single-particle potentials of a
$\Lambda$ hyperon in symmetric nuclear matter and neutron matter are
calculated. With parameters of the $\Lambda NN$ three-body force constrained by
hypernuclear phenomenology, extrapolations to high baryon density are
performed. By comparison of the $\Lambda$ and neutron chemical potentials at
densities characteristic of the core of neutron stars it is found that the
combined repulsive effects of two- and three-body correlations makes the
appearance of $\Lambda$ hyperons in neutron stars energetically unfavourable,
thus offering a possible solution to a longstanding question.

theory, a converging surface seismic wave excited by the main shock returns to
the epicenter about 3 hours after the main shock and stimulates the excitation

full trajectories into sub-trajectory clusters based on transition points,

including atmospheric reflection, emission, ellipsoidal variations and Doppler
beaming to the combined phase curve and occultation data. This allows us to
infer that WASP-100b has a geometric albedo of A_g = 0.16 (+0.04, -0.03) in the
TESS bandpass, with a maximum dayside brightness temperature of (2710 +/- 100)
K and a warm nightside temperature of (2380 [+170, -200]) K. Additionally, we
find evidence that WASP-100b has a high thermal redistribution efficiency,
manifesting as a substantial eastward hotspot offset of (71 [+2, -4]) degrees.
These results present the first measurement of a thermal phase shift among the
phase curves observed by TESS so far, and challenge the predicted efficiency of
heat transport in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters.

help our project and install our tool. Then, we use a Convolution Neural

evaluate our approach, we manually label a data collection of 10k ads as
political or non-political and then we provide an in-depth evaluation of
proposed approach for identifying political ads by comparing it with classic

shows the ads identified as related to politics. We noticed that not all
political ads we detected were present in the Facebook Ad Library for political
ads. Our results emphasize the importance of enforcement mechanisms for

typical disk radii are small, and that radial dust drift affects the
distribution of solids in disks. Here we explore the consequences of these
features in planet population synthesis models. A key feature of our model is
planet traps - barriers to otherwise rapid type-I migration of forming planets
- for which we include the ice line, heat transition, and outer edge of the
dead zone. We find that the ice line plays a fundamental role in the formation
of warm Jupiters. In particular, the ratio of super Earths to warm Jupiters
formed at the ice line depend sensitively on the initial disk radius. Initial
gas disk radii of $\sim$50 AU results in the largest super Earth populations,
while both larger and smaller disk sizes result in the ice line producing more
gas giants near 1 AU. This transition between typical planet class formed at
the ice line at various disk radii confirms that planet formation is
fundamentally linked to disk properties (in this case, disk size), and is a
result that is only seen when dust evolution effects are included in our
models. Additionally, we find that including radial dust drift results in the
formation of more super Earths between 0.1 - 1 AU, having shorter orbital radii
than those produced in models where dust evolution effects are not included.

Most critically, in sparse chemical spaces where few stoichiometries have

study analyzed the dependencies of encounter impact-parameters with kinematic,
geometric, and habitability parameters of the system. We also used kinematic
properties of various stellar regions and estimated encounter rates of the
events. The expected number of threatening stellar encounters in the Solar
neighborhood is $\approx3.9\times10^{-4}$ in 4 billion years, while for the
Galactic bulge environment, we expect approximately 5.5 times the value. The
encounter rates for other stellar environments are calculated and spheroidal
dwarf galaxies and globular clusters encounter rates are estimated. The results
show that in contrast with the solar neighborhood, close stellar encounters can
play a significant role in the expected number of planets with continuous
habitability in dense stellar environments. Another notable result shows that
threatening stellar encounter rate follows the number density of stars, and is
not strongly dependent of the region's velocity dispersion. Further
investigations are needed to study long-term multiple planetary systems and how

the superiority of TFQKD in long-distance communication. All previous
experimental implementations of TFQKD have been done over optical channels with

strategies, that are (1) applying asymmetric signal intensities and (2) adding
extra losses, and verify that strategy (1) provides much better key rate.
Moreover, the higher the loss, the more key rate enhancement it can achieve. By
applying asymmetric signal intensities, TFQKD with asymmetric channel losses
not only surpasses the fundamental limit of key rate of point-to-point QKD for
50 dB overall loss, but also has key rate as high as $2.918\times10^{-6}$ for
56 dB overall loss. Whereas no keys are obtained with strategy (2) for 56 dB
loss. The increased key rate and enlarged distance coverage of TFQKD with

can do approximately as well as a prophet with foreknowledge of all the values.
In this work, we investigate this problem when the values are allowed to be

  A key challenge is that threshold-based algorithms, which are commonly used
for prophet inequalities, no longer guarantee good performance for linear
correlations. We relate this roadblock to another ""augmentations"" challenge
that might be of independent interest: many existing prophet inequality
algorithms are not robust to slight increase in the values of the arriving
items. We leverage this intuition to prove bounds (matching up to constant
factors) that decay gracefully with the amount of correlation of the arriving
items. We extend these results to the case of selecting multiple items by
designing a new $(1+o(1))$ approximation ratio algorithm that is robust to

therefore be used directly in typical bidirectional speech recognition models.
The pre-trained networks can then be fine-tuned on a smaller amount of
supervised data for speech recognition. Experiments with this approach on the
LibriSpeech and Wall Street Journal corpora show promising results. We find
that the main factors that lead to speech recognition improvements are: masking
segments of sufficient width in both time and frequency, pre-training on a much
larger amount of unlabeled data than the labeled data, and domain adaptation
when the unlabeled and labeled data come from different domains. The gain from
pre-training is additive to that of supervised data augmentation.

example during development or in response to altered auditory cues such as a
modified pinna. We studied neural network models that learn to localise a
single sound source in the horizontal plane using binaural cues based on
limited supervisions. These supervisions can be unreliable or sparse in real
life. First, a simple model that has unreliable estimation of the sound source
location is built, in order to simulate the unreliable auditory orienting
response of newborns. It is used as a Teacher that acts as a source of
unreliable supervisions. Then we show that it is possible to learn a continuous
auditory space map based only on noisy left or right feedbacks from the
Teacher. Furthermore, reinforcement rewards from the environment are used as a
source of sparse supervision. By combining the unreliable innate response and
the sparse reinforcement rewards, an accurate auditory space map, which is hard
to be achieved by either one of these two kind of supervisions, can eventually
be learned. Our results show that the auditory space mapping can be calibrated
even without explicit supervision. Moreover, this study implies a possibly more
general neural mechanism where multiple sub-modules can be coordinated to
facilitate each other's learning process under limited supervisions.

  admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.04229",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Object pose recovery has gained increasing attention in the computer vision
field as it has become an important problem in rapidly evolving technological
areas related to autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing
review-related studies have addressed the problem at visual level in 2D, going
through the methods which produce 2D bounding boxes of objects of interest in
RGB images. The 2D search space is enlarged either using the geometry
information available in the 3D space along with RGB (Mono/Stereo) images, or
utilizing depth data from LIDAR sensors and/or RGB-D cameras. 3D bounding box
detectors, producing category-level amodal 3D bounding boxes, are evaluated on
gravity aligned images, while full 6D object pose estimators are mostly tested
at instance-level on the images where the alignment constraint is removed.
Recently, 6D object pose estimation is tackled at the level of categories. In
this paper, we present the first comprehensive and most recent review of the
methods on object pose recovery, from 3D bounding box detectors to full 6D pose
estimators. The methods mathematically model the problem as a classification,
regression, classification & regression, template matching, and point-pair
feature matching task. Based on this, a mathematical-model-based categorization
of the methods is established. Datasets used for evaluating the methods are
investigated with respect to the challenges, and evaluation metrics are
studied. Quantitative results of experiments in the literature are analyzed to
show which category of methods best performs across what types of challenges.
The analyses are further extended comparing two methods, which are our own
implementations, so that the outcomes from the public results are further
solidified. Current position of the field is summarized regarding object pose
recovery, and possible research directions are identified.

approximating the full Langevin dynamics. We then apply homogenisation and
matched-asymptotics techniques to obtain an explicit expression for the

when inertia is neglected, increases for particles heavier than the fluid and
decreases for lighter particles. In particular, when $\mathrm{St} \gg

performance, and provenance. Binary analysis applications often construct
control flow graphs, analyze data flow, and use debugging information to
understand how machine code relates to source lines, inlined functions, and
data types. To date, binary analysis has been single-threaded, which is too
slow for applications such as performance analysis and software forensics,
where it is becoming common to analyze binaries that are gigabytes in size and
in large batches that contain thousands of binaries.
  This paper describes our design and implementation for accelerating the task
of constructing control flow graphs (CFGs) from binaries with multithreading.
Existing research focuses on addressing challenging code constructs encountered
during constructing CFGs, including functions sharing code, jump table
analysis, non-returning functions, and tail calls. However, existing analyses
do not consider the complex interactions between concurrent analysis of shared
code, making it difficult to extend existing serial algorithms to be parallel.
A systematic methodology to guide the design of parallel algorithms is
essential. We abstract the task of constructing CFGs as repeated applications
of several core CFG operations regarding to creating functions, basic blocks,
and edges. We then derive properties among CFG operations, including operation
dependency, commutativity, monotonicity. These operation properties guide our
design of a new parallel analysis for constructing CFGs. We achieved as much as
25$\times$ speedup for constructing CFGs on 64 hardware threads. Binary
analysis applications are significantly accelerated with the new parallel
analysis: we achieve 8$\times$ for a performance analysis tool and 7$\times$
for a software forensic tool with 16 hardware threads.

with a topological transition from a topologically non-trivial system to a
topologically trivial one. This topological transition is driven by the
modification of the dielectric functions in the unit cell. Our interpretation
is further supported by an exact mapping between the solutions of Maxwell's

compressed sensing and machine learning. These mappings may be used to embed
the data into a significantly lower dimension while at the same time preserving
useful information. This is done by approximately preserving the distances
between data points, which are assumed to belong to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Thus, the
performance of these mappings is usually captured by how close they are to an
isometry on the data. Gaussian linear mappings have been the object of much
study, while the sub-Gaussian settings is not yet fully understood. In the
latter case, the performance depends on the sub-Gaussian norm of the rows. In
many applications, e.g., compressed sensing, this norm may be large, or even
growing with dimension, and thus it is important to characterize this
dependence.
  We study when a sub-Gaussian matrix can become a near isometry on a set, show
that previous best known dependence on the sub-Gaussian norm was sub-optimal,
and present the optimal dependence. Our result not only answers a remaining
question posed by Liaw, Mehrabian, Plan and Vershynin in 2017, but also
generalizes their work. We also develop a new Bernstein type inequality for
sub-exponential random variables, and a new Hanson-Wright inequality for
quadratic forms of sub-Gaussian random variables, in both cases improving the
bounds in the sub-Gaussian regime under moment constraints. Finally, we
illustrate popular applications such as Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings, null
space property for 0-1 matrices, randomized sketches and blind demodulation,
whose theoretical guarantees can be improved by our results (in the
sub-Gaussian case).

plethora of Internet of Things (IoT), ranging from smart-lights to security
cameras. While IoT networks have the potential to benefit our lives, they
create privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks.
Due to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not
often aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is
functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This thesis is the culmination of
our efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral pattern of
IoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect
anomalous behavior indicative of cyber-attacks.
  We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing current
approaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral
monitoring. For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and
characterize the network behavior of IoT devices via attributes from traffic
patterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference engine trained
with these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT
devices with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the
classification by reducing the cost of attribute extraction while also
identifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and evaluation
demonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect
behavioral changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution
develops a modularized unsupervised inference engine that dynamically
accommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates to existing ones,
without requiring system-wide retraining of the model. We demonstrate via
experiments that our model can automatically detect attacks and firmware
changes in ten IoT devices with over 94% accuracy.

simulations of radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto non-rotating black

understand the resulting flow structure. A simulation with adiabatic index
Gamma = 4/3 and small initial alternating poloidal magnetic field loops is run
to a time of 440,000 GM/c^3, reaching inflow equilibrium inside a radius of 370
GM/c^2. Variations with larger alternating field loops and with Gamma = 5/3 are
run to 220,000 GM/c^3, attaining equilibrium out to 170 GM/c^2 and 440 GM/c^2.
There is no universal self-similar behavior obtained at radii in inflow
equilibrium: the Gamma = 5/3 simulation shows a radial density profile with
power law index ranging from -1 in the inner regions to -1/2 in the outer
regions, while the others have a power-law slope ranging from -1/2 to close to
-2. Both simulations with small field loops reach a state with polar inflow of
matter, while the more ordered initial field has polar outflows. However,
unbound outflows remove only a factor of order unity of the inflowing material
over a factor of ~300 in radius. Our results suggest that the dynamics of
radiatively inefficient accretion flows are sensitive to how the flow is fed
from larger radii, and may differ appreciably in different astrophysical
systems. Millimeter images appropriate for Sgr A* are qualitatively (but not

latency guarantees, while at the same time envisioning massive connectivity. As
a result, choosing the optimal multiple access (MA) technique to achieve low
latency is a key enabler of B5G. In particular, this issue is more acute in
uplink transmissions due to the potentially high number of collisions. On this
premise, in the present contribution we discuss the issue of delay-sensitive
uplink connectivity using optimized MA techniques; to this end, we perform a
comparative analysis of various MA approaches with respect to the achievable
effective capacity (EC). As opposed to standard rate (PHY) or throughput (MAC)
analyses, we propose the concept of the effective capacity as a suitable metric
for characterizing jointly PHY-MAC layer delays. The palette of investigated MA
approaches includes standard orthogonal MA (OMA) and power domain non
orthogonal MA (NOMA) in uplink scenarios, both considering random pairing and
optimized pairing alternatives. It further extends to encompass a recently
proposed third alternative, referred to as NOMA-Relevant (NOMA-R), which
extends OMA and NOMA approaches by flexibly selecting the MA technique. We show
that optimizing both user pairing and MA selection increases the network EC,
especially when stringent delay constraints are in place; thus a flexible MA is
a potentially preferable strategy for future low latency applications

and efficiency properties. It is one of the most prominent protocols for the
random assignment problem. However, Probabilistic Serial is not
incentive-compatible, thereby these desirable properties only hold for the
agents' declared preferences, rather than their genuine preferences. A
substantial utility gain through strategic behaviors would trigger
self-interested agents to manipulate the mechanism and would subvert the very
foundation of adopting the mechanism in practice. In this paper, we
characterize the extent to which an individual agent can increase its utility
by strategic manipulation. We show that the incentive ratio of the mechanism is
$\frac{3}{2}$. That is, no agent can misreport its preferences such that its
utility becomes more than 1.5 times of what it is when reports truthfully. This
ratio is a worst-case guarantee by allowing an agent to have complete
information about other agents' reports and to figure out the best response
strategy even if it is computationally intractable in general. To complement
this worst-case study, we further evaluate an agent's utility gain on average
by experiments. The experiments show that an agent' incentive in manipulating
the rule is very limited. These results shed some light on the robustness of
Probabilistic Serial against strategic manipulation, which is one step further
than knowing that it is not incentive-compatible.

promising weakly-supervised learning method which trains a binary classifier
only from positive data equipped with confidence. However, in practice, the
confidence may be skewed by bias arising in an annotation process. The Pconf
classifier cannot be properly learned with skewed confidence, and consequently,
the classification performance might be deteriorated. In this paper, we
introduce the parameterized model of the skewed confidence, and propose the
method for selecting the hyperparameter which cancels out the negative impact
of skewed confidence under the assumption that we have the misclassification
rate of positive samples as a prior knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed method through a synthetic experiment with simple linear models

Si Ly$\alpha$, S He$\alpha$, S Ly$\alpha$, Ar He$\alpha$, and Ca He$\alpha$
originating from solar flares as well as fluorescent Ar K$\alpha$ and Ar
K$\beta$ from the Earth atmosphere. Absolute elemental abundances (X/H)
averaged over the four flares are obtained to be $\sim$2.0 (Ca), $\sim$0.7
(Si), $\sim$0.3 (S), and $\sim$0.9 (Ar) at around flare peaks. This abundance
pattern is similar to those of active stars' coronae showing inverse first
ionization potential (i-FIP) effects, i.e., elemental abundances decrease with
decreasing FIP with a turnover at the low end of FIP. The abundances are almost
constant during the flares, with an exception of Si which increases by a factor
of $\sim$2 in the decay phase. The evolution of the Si abundance is consistent
with a picture that the i-FIP plasma originates from the chromosphere
evaporation and then mixes with the surrounding low-FIP biased materials.
Flare-to-flare abundance varied by a factor of 2, agreeing with past
observations of solar flares. Finally, we emphasize that Earth albedo data
acquired by X-ray astronomy satellites like Suzaku and XRISM can significantly

understanding where in the solar atmosphere the ALMA emission originates.
Recent theoretical studies have suggested that ALMA bands at 1.2 (band 6) and 3
mm (band 3) form in the middle and upper chromosphere at significantly
different heights. We study the formation of ALMA diagnostics using a 2.5D
radiative MHD model that includes the effects of ion-neutral interactions

Our results suggest that in active regions and network regions, observations at

increases the opacity in the chromosphere so that ALMA mostly observe spicules
and fibrils along the canopy fields. We combine these modeling results with
observations from IRIS, SDO and ALMA to suggest a new interpretation for the

inference attacks, i.e., inferring whether individuals' data have been used for
training models. The lack of understanding about factors contributing success
of these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information
leakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine
learning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information
leakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of
information leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence
of an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this
measure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more
amenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the
Kullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success
for a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record
belongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the
mutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset
size and the regularization weight. We also prove that, if the sensitivity of
the machine learning model (defined in terms of the derivatives of the fitness
with respect to model parameters) is high, more membership information is
potentially leaked. This illustrates that complex models, such as deep neural
networks, are more susceptible to membership inference attacks in comparison to
simpler models with fewer degrees of freedom. We show that the amount of the
membership information leakage is reduced by
$\mathcal{O}(\log^{1/2}(\delta^{-1})\epsilon^{-1})$ when using Gaussian

disentangle the factors into three disjoint sets corresponding to the

and (ii) what is the effect of the prior? Several measures have been proposed
for quantifying effective prior sample size, for example Clarke [1996] and
Morita et al. [2008]. However, these measures typically ignore the likelihood
for the inference currently at hand, and therefore address (i) rather than
(ii). Since in practice (ii) is of great concern, Reimherr et al. [2014]
introduced a new class of effective prior sample size measures based on
prior-likelihood discordance. We take this idea further towards its natural
Bayesian conclusion by proposing measures of effective prior sample size that
not only incorporate the general mathematical form of the likelihood but also
the specific data at hand. Thus, our measures do not average across datasets
from the working model, but condition on the current observed data.
Consequently, our measures can be highly variable, but we demonstrate that this
is because the impact of a prior can be highly variable. Our measures are Bayes
estimates of meaningful quantities and well communicate the extent to which
inference is determined by the prior, or framed differently, the amount of
effort saved due to having prior information. We illustrate our ideas through a
number of examples including a Gaussian conjugate model (continuous
observations), a Beta-Binomial model (discrete observations), and a linear
regression model (two unknown parameters). Future work on further developments
of the methodology and an application to astronomy are discussed at the end.

for ejecta with electron fraction ($Y_e$) of $0.2-0.3$, $\dot{\epsilon}_{\rm

change in timing of $\beta^-$ decay through the isomeric states of ${}^{123,

isomers on $\dot{\epsilon}_{\rm nuc}$ are prominent for ejecta of $Y_e \sim

observed in GW170817. When the excitation from a ground state to its isomeric
state is important, the isomers of ${}^{129} \rm Sb$ and ${}^{129, 131} \rm Te$
also cause additional and appreciable change in $\dot{\epsilon}_{\rm nuc}$.

function is nonconvex, the obtained subgradient is an element of Clarke's
generalized gradient, but the result appears to be novel even for convex
functions. The function is not required to be represented in any particular
form, and no further assumptions are required, though the result is
strengthened when the function is additionally L-smooth in the sense of
Nesterov. For certain optimal-value functions and certain parametric solutions
of differential equation systems, these new results appear to provide the only
known way to compute a subgradient. These results also imply that centered
finite differences will converge to a subgradient for bivariate nonsmooth

strengths ranging from a few kG up to about 1000 MG. However, the incidence of
magnetism varies when the white dwarf population is broken down into different
spectral types providing clues on the formation of magnetic fields in white
dwarfs. Several scenarios for the origin of magnetic fields have been proposed
from a fossil field origin to dynamo generation at various stages of evolution.
Offset dipoles are often assumed sufficient to model the field structure,
however time-resolved spectropolarimetric observations have revealed more
complex structures such as magnetic spots or multipoles. Surface mapping of
these field structures combined with measured rotation rates help distinguish
scenarios involving single star evolution from other scenarios involving binary
interactions. I describe key observational properties of magnetic white dwarfs
such as age, mass, and field strength, and confront proposed formation
scenarios with these properties.

capability necessary for on-orbit spacecraft servicing and assembly tasks. Pose
estimation of objects in space is more challenging than for objects on Earth
due to space images containing widely varying illumination conditions, high
contrast, and poor resolution in addition to power and mass constraints. In
this paper, a convolutional neural network is leveraged to uniquely determine
the translation and rotation of an object of interest relative to the camera.
The main idea of using CNN model is to assist object tracker used in on space
assembly tasks where only feature based method is always not sufficient. The
simulation framework designed for assembly task is used to generate dataset for
training the modified CNN models and, then results of different models are
compared with measure of how accurately models are predicting the pose. Unlike
many current approaches for spacecraft or object in space pose estimation, the
model does not rely on hand-crafted object-specific features which makes this
model more robust and easier to apply to other types of spacecraft. It is shown
that the model performs comparable to the current feature-selection methods and
can therefore be used in conjunction with them to provide more reliable

data centers. Evolving it to high-fidelity {\em digital twin} is desirable for
the management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating
CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain
expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing
automatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models
apply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined
parameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires
long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches
impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a
knowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration
by iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on
CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through
neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the
found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using
sensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is
offloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's
iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior
knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate
design to improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on
a 32-core processor, Kalibre achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of $0.81^o$C
and $0.75^o$C in calibrating two CFD models for two production data halls
hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes
than existing baseline approaches.

they allow to calculate deviations from General Relativity without recurring to
exact solutions, which can be difficult to find. When applied to models such as
$f(R)$ gravity, these techniques introduce corrections in the field equations
that involve higher order derivatives. Such corrections must be handled
carefully to have a well defined perturbative scheme, and this can be achieved
through the method of perturbative constraints, where the coefficient of the
additional term in the action is used as expansion parameter for the quantities
of interest. In this work, we implement a perturbative framework that compares
solutions in modified theories of gravity with solutions of the Einstein field
equations, by following the guidelines of perturbation theory constructed in
General Relativity together with the perturbative constraints rationale. By
using this formalism, we demonstrate that a consistent $f(R)$ perturbation
theory in vacuum, for an important class of $f(R)$ functions, produces no
additional effects with respect to what is expected from the perturbation
theory of General Relativity. From this result, we argue that there are
fundamental limitations that explain why the solutions of some $f(R)$ models
can be disconnected from their general relativistic counterparts, in the sense
that the limit that leads from the $f(R)$ action to General Relativity does not
transform the solutions accordingly.

be effectively tuned by inner-layer strains and it will be transferred into

than that (23/134 = $17\% \pm 4\%$) of a comparison sample of star-forming
galaxy pairs, lending support to the optical AGN classification. In the
conservative case where X-ray contamination from star formation is removed, the
X-ray detection rate becomes $27\% \pm 4\%$, consistent with predictions from
latest galaxy merger simulations. The 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity $L_{2-10~{\rm

decrease with decreasing projected separation at $r_p \lesssim 15$ kpc, which
is contradictory to predictions from merger simulations. The apparent decrease
in $L_{2-10~{\rm keV}}$ of AGN pairs at $r_p \lesssim 15$ kpc may be caused by:
(i) enhanced absorbing columns from merger-induced gas inflows, (ii) feedback

X-ray studies with larger samples are needed to put our results on firmer

suggested. Future observations are expected to provide more information about
BBH distributions, and it will help us to distinguish the two formation

investigated. However, recent simulations have suggested that BBH formation in
open clusters is not negligible. We estimate a local merger rate density of
BBHs originated from open clusters using the results of our $N$-body
simulations of open clusters with four different metallicities. We find that
the merger rate per cluster is the highest for our 0.1 solar metallicity model.
Assuming a cosmic star formation history and a metallicity evolution with
dispersion, we estimate the local merger rate density of BBHs originated from
open clusters to be $\sim 70~{\rm yr}^{-1} {\rm Gpc}^{-3}$. This value is
comparable to the merger rate density expected from the first and second
observation runs of LIGO and Virgo. In addition, we find that BBH mergers
obtained from our simulations can reproduce the distribution of primary mass

W43 GMC complex, which have clumpy structures. We found at least two clouds
with a velocity difference of $\sim$ 10-20 km s$^{-1}$, both of which are
likely to be physically associated with these high-mass star-forming regions
based on the results of high $^{13}$CO $J=$ 3-2 to $J =$ 1-0 intensity ratio
and morphological correspondence with the infrared dust emission. The velocity
separation of these clouds in W43 Main, G30.5, and W43 South is too large for
each cloud to be gravitationally bound. We also revealed that the dense gas in
the W43 GMC has a high local column density, while ""the current SFE"" of entire

SNNs trained through this method are limited to a shallow network with only one

STDP-based competitive learning and outperforms the baseline modules on
learning capability, learning efficiency, and robustness. 2)We proposed a
Pooling-Reshape-Activate (PRA) layer to make the Sp-Inception module stackable.
3)We stacked multiple Sp-Inception modules to construct multi-layer SNNs. Our

Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations from 8.4~GHz to 43~GHz over a
10-week period as well as an X-ray observation with NuSTAR. This was the third
campaign of VLBA monitoring that we have obtained. The 43~GHz VLBA was degraded
in all epochs with only 7 of 10 antennas available in three epochs and 8 in the
first epoch. However, useful results were obtained due to a fortuitous
capturing of a complete short 100~mJy flare at 17.6~GHz: growth and decay. This
provided useful constraints on the physical model of the ejected plasma that
were not available in previous campaigns. We consider four classes of models,
discrete ejections (both protonic and positronic) and jetted (protonic and
positronic). The most viable model is a ""dissipative bright knot"" in a faint
background leptonic jet with an energy flux $\sim10^{43}$ ergs/sec. Inverse
Compton scattering calculations (based on these models) in the ambient quasar
photon field explains the lack of a detectable increase in X-ray luminosity
measured by NuSTAR. We show that the core (the bright knot) moves towards a
nearby secondary at $\approx 0.97$c. The background jet is much fainter.
Evidently, the high frequency VLBA core does not represent the point of origin
of blazar jets, in general, and optical depth ""core shift"" estimates of jet
points of origin can be misleading.

tachyonic instabilities of neutron star solutions in general relativity with
$A_{\mu}=0$. Such a phenomenon is called spontaneous vectorization, which is
analogous to spontaneous scalarization in scalar-tensor theories with
nonminimal couplings to the curvature or matter. For the nonminimal coupling
$\beta X R$, where $\beta$ is a coupling constant and $X=-A_{\mu}A^{\mu}/2$, we
show that there exist both 0-node and 1-node vector-field solutions,
irrespective of the choice of the equations of state of nuclear matter. The
0-node solution, which is present only for $\beta=-{\cal O}(0.1)$, may be
induced by some nonlinear effects such as the selected choice of initial
conditions. The 1-node solution exists for $\beta=-{\cal O}(1)$, which suddenly
emerges above a critical central density of star and approaches the general
relativistic branch with the increasing central density. We compute the mass
$M$ and radius $r_s$ of neutron stars for some realistic equations of state and
show that the $M$-$r_s$ relations of 0-node and 1-node solutions exhibit

sequences that include data-dependent operations. This paper proposes to
increase the throughput of SFQ pipelines by re-designing the datapath to accept
and operate on least-significant bits (LSBs) clock cycles earlier than more
significant bits. This skewed datapath approach reduces the latency of the LSB

bits into 4-bit blocks that are operatedon concurrently and create block-skewed

data-dependent operation to start evaluating as soon as the first 4-bit block
completes. Using this general approach, we developa block-skewed

residual light from the excitation laser should be suppressed without

revealing the dependence of the energy gaps on the anisotropy parameter. The
relation between the two and the one dimensional scattering lengths as well as
the Tan contacts is established. The contact, capturing the two-body short
range correlations, shows an increasing tendency for a larger anisotropy.
Subsequently, the interaction quench dynamics from attractive to repulsive

by means of the time-averaged fidelity, the spectra of the spatial extent of

write than the program; if it is too weak, the synthesised program might not
match the user's intent. In this work we explore the use of annotations for
restricting memory access permissions in program synthesis, and show that they
can make specifications much stronger while remaining surprisingly concise.
Specifically, we enhance Synthetic Separation Logic (SSL), a framework for
synthesis of heap-manipulating programs, with the logical mechanism of
read-only borrows. We observe that this minimalistic and conservative SSL
extension benefits the synthesis in several ways, making it more (a) expressive
(stronger correctness guarantees are achieved with a modest annotation
overhead), (b) effective (it produces more concise and easier-to-read
programs), (c) efficient (faster synthesis), and (d) robust (synthesis
efficiency is less affected by the choice of the search heuristic). We explain
the intuition and provide formal treatment for read-only borrows. We
substantiate the claims (a)--(d) by describing our quantitative evaluation of
the borrowing-aware synthesis implementation on a series of standard benchmark

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) framework towards enabling scalable
ultra-reliable low-latency communications (sURLLC) in wireless systems beyond
5G. In this framework, the huge diversity gain associated with the large-scale
antenna array in massive MIMO systems is leveraged to ensure ultrahigh
reliability. To reduce the overhead and latency induced by the channel
estimation process, we advocate the noncoherent communication technique which
does not need the knowledge of instantaneous channel state information (CSI)
but only depends on the large-scale fading coefficients for information
decoding. To boost the scalability of the system considered, we enable the
non-orthogonal channel access of multiple users by devising a new differential
modulation scheme to assure that each transmitted signal matrix can be uniquely
determined in the noise-free case and be reliably estimated in noisy cases when
the antenna array size is scaled up. The key idea is to make the transmitted
signals from multiple users be superimposed properly over the air such that
when the sum-signal is correctly detected, the signals sent by all users can be
uniquely determined. To further improve the average error performance when the
array antenna number is large, we propose a max-min Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence-based design by jointly optimizing the transmitted powers of all
users and the sub-constellation assignment among them. Simulation results show
that the proposed design significantly outperforms the existing max-min
Euclidean distance-based counterpart in terms of error performance. Moreover,
our proposed approach also has a better error performance than the conventional
coherent zero-forcing (ZF) receiver with orthogonal channel training,
particularly for cell-edge users.

retains the L best paths with respect to metric at every decoding step.
However, the correct path might be among the L worst paths due to imposed
penalties. In this case, the correct path is pruned and the decoding process
fails. In this work, we propose a scheme for additional decoding attempts when
decoding fails, in which the pruning window does not necessarily select the L
best paths, but this window is shifted between positions 1 and 2L in the sorted
list. In the simplest form, the L worst paths are selected at the decoding step
where the probability of elimination of the correct paths is high.
Additionally, we generalize the scheme and propose a number of variants such as
constrained shifting, nested shifting and shifting under segmented decoding,
aiming to reduce the computational complexity. The numerical results for polar
codes of length 512 with code rates 0.5 and 0.8 and list sizes L=2, 8, 32, show
that the shifted-pruning scheme can provide 0.25-0.5 dB gain in error

perturbation theory, has been widely employed for studying various two-level
systems that are driven by external fields via the time-dependent longitudinal
(i.e., diagonal) couplings. However, three-level systems strongly driven by the
time-dependent transverse (i.e., off-diagonal) couplings have rarely been
investigated, due to the breakdown of the traditional rotating wave
approximation. Meanwhile, the conventional perturbation theory is not directly
applicable, since a small parameter for the perturbed part is no longer
apparent. Here we develop a double-unitary-transformation approach to deal with
the periodically modulated and strongly driven systems, where the
time-dependent Hamiltonian has large off-diagonal elements. The first unitary
transformation converts the strong off-diagonal elements to the diagonal ones,
and the second enables us to harness the generalized Van Vleck perturbation
theory to deal with the transformed Floquet matrix and also allows us to reduce
the infinite-dimensional Floquet Hamiltonian to a finite effective one. For a
strongly modulated three-level system, with the combination of the Floquet
theory and the transformed generalized Van Vleck perturbation theory, we obtain
analytical results of the system, which agree well with exact numerical
solutions. This method offers a useful tool to analytically study the
multi-level systems with strong transverse couplings.

near-optimal for very dense graphs; here $W$ is the ratio of the largest weight
in the graph to the smallest. Our algorithm also improves over the best known
partially dynamic \emph{randomized} algorithm for directed SSSP by Henzinger et
al. [STOC'14, ICALP'15] if $m=\omega(n^{1.1})$.
  We also provide improved conditional lower bounds. Henzinger et al. [STOC'15]
showed that under the OMv Hypothesis, the partially dynamic exact $s$-$t$
Shortest Path problem in undirected graphs requires amortized update or query
time $m^{1/2-o(1)}$, given polynomial preprocessing time. Under a hypothesis
about finding Cliques, we improve the update and query lower bound for
algorithms with polynomial preprocessing time to $m^{0.626-o(1)}$. Further,
under the $k$-Cycle hypothesis, we show that any partially dynamic SSSP
algorithm with $O(m^{2-\epsilon})$ preprocessing time requires amortized update
or query time $m^{1-o(1)}$.

origin is still unknown. Within a few astronomical units near an FRB source,
the electric field of the electromagnetic wave is so large that the electron
oscillation velocity becomes relativistic, which makes the classical Thomson
scattering theory and the linear plasma theory invalid. We discuss FRBs as
strong waves interacting with the ambient medium, in terms of both electron
motion properties and plasma properties. Several novel features are identified.
1. The cross section of Thomson scattering is significantly enhanced for the
scattering photons. 2. On the other hand, because of the nonlinear plasma
properties in strong waves, the near-source plasma is more transparent and has
a smaller effective dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the observed value.
For a repeating FRB source, the brighter bursts would have somewhat smaller DMs
contributed by the near-source plasma. 3. The radiation beam undergoes
relativistic self-focusing in a dense plasma, the degree of self-focusing (or
squeezing) depends on the plasma density. Such a squeezing effect would affect
the collimation angle and the true event rate of FRBs. 4. When an FRB
propagates in a nearby ambient plasma, a wakefield wave in the plasma will be
generated by the ponderomotive force of the FRB and accelerates electrons in
the ambient medium. However, such an effect is too weak to be observationally
interesting.

process transition density (the quasipotential) are obtained from the minimum
of the Freidlin-Wentzell action functional. Here we present a Ritz method that
searches for the minimum in a space of paths constructed from a global basis of
Chebyshev polynomials. The action is reduced, thereby, to a multivariate
function of the basis coefficients, whose minimum can be found by nonlinear
optimization. For minimisation regardless of path duration, this procedure is
most effective when applied to a reparametrisation-invariant ""on-shell"" action,
which is obtained by exploiting a Noether symmetry and is a generalisation of
the scalar work [Olender and Elber, 1997] for gradient dynamics and the

Multiwavelength and polarization observations of an FRB source would be helpful
to diagnose its progenitor and environment. So far only the first repeating
source FRB 121102 appears to be spatially coincident with a persistent radio
emission. Its bursts also have very large values of the Faraday rotation
measure (RM) i.e., $|{\rm RM}|\sim10^5~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$. We show that
theoretically there should be a simple relation between RM and the luminosity
of the persistent source of an FRB source if the observed RM mostly arises from
the persistent emission region. FRB 121102 follows this relation given that the
magnetic field in the persistent emission region is highly ordered and that the
number of relativistic electrons powering the persistent emission is comparable
to that of non-relativistic electrons that contribute to RM. The non-detections
of persistent emission sources from all other localized FRB sources are
consistent with their relatively small RMs ($\left|{\rm RM}\right|\lesssim{\rm
a~few}\times100~{\rm rad~m^{-2}}$) according to this relation. Based on this
picture, the majority of FRBs without a large RM are not supposed to be
associated with bright persistent sources.

is the reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). This technology provides
planar surfaces the capability to manipulate the reflected waves of impinging
signals, which leads to a more controllable wireless environment. One potential
use case of such technology is providing indirect line-of-sight (LoS) links
between mobile users and base stations (BSs) which do not have direct LoS
channels. Objects that act as blockages for the communication links, such as
buildings or trees, can be equipped with RISs to enhance the coverage
probability of the cellular network through providing extra indirect LoS-links.
In this paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry to study the effect of
large-scale deployment of RISs on the performance of cellular networks. In
particular, we model the blockages using the line Boolean model. For this
setup, we study how equipping a subset of the blockages with RISs will enhance
the performance of the cellular network. We first derive the ratio of the
blind-spots to the total area. Next, we derive the probability that a typical
mobile user associates with a BS using an RIS. Finally, we derive the
probability distribution of the path-loss between the typical user and its
associated BS. We draw multiple useful system-level insights from the proposed
analysis. For instance, we show that deployment of RISs highly improves the
coverage regions of the BSs. Furthermore, we show that to ensure that the ratio
of blind-spots to the total area is below 10^5, the required density of RISs
increases from just 6 RISs/km2 when the density of the blockages is 300
blockage/km^2 to 490 RISs/km^2 when the density of the blockages is 700

concentrate on Additively Separable Hedonic Games (ASHG's), in which each agent
has a non-negative value for every other agent and her utility is the sum of
the values she assigns to the members of her coalition. Unlike previous work,
we analyze a model where exactly $k$ coalitions must be formed, and the goal is
to maximize the utility of the agent which is worst off, i.e., the egalitarian
social welfare. We show that this problem is hard, even when the number of
agents should be equally divided among the coalitions. We thus propose a
heuristic that maximizes the egalitarian social welfare and maximizes the
average utility of each agent as a secondary goal. Using extensive simulations,
both on synthetic and real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Specifically, our heuristic provides solutions that are much fairer
than the solutions that maximize the average social welfare, while still
providing a relatively high average social welfare.

approaches have been introduced where the sample travels through a broad range
of magnetic fields in the course of the experiment, such as dissolution dynamic
nuclear polarization or high-resolution relaxometry. Understanding the
relaxation properties of nuclear spin systems over orders of magnitude of
magnetic fields is essential to rationalize the results of these experiments.
For example, during a high-resolution relaxometry experiment, the absence of
control of nuclear spin relaxation pathways during the sample transfers and
relaxation delays leads to systematic deviations of polarization decays from an
ideal mono-exponential decay with the pure longitudinal relaxation rate. These
deviations have to be taken into account to describe quantitatively the
dynamics of the system. Here, we present computational tools to (1) calculate
analytical expressions of relaxation rates for a broad variety of spin systems

understanding of nuclear spin relaxation, which is required to improve the

algorithms like Douglas--Rachford (DR), ADMM, and FISTA produce approximating
sequences that show signs of spiraling toward the solution. We present a
meta-algorithm that exploits such dynamics to potentially enhance performance.
The strategy of this meta-algorithm is to iteratively build and minimize
surrogates for the Lyapunov function that captures those dynamics.
  As a first motivating application, we show that for prototypical feasibility
problems the circumcentered-reflection method (CRM), subgradient projections,
and Newton--Raphson are all describable as gradient-based methods for
minimizing Lyapunov functions constructed for DR operators, with the former
returning the minimizers of spherical surrogates for the Lyapunov function.

these properties but with the added advantages that it: 1) does not rely on
subproblems (e.g. reflections) and so may be applied for any operator whose
iterates have the spiraling property; 2) provably has the aforementioned
Lyapunov properties with few structural assumptions and so is generically
suitable for primal/dual implementation; and 3) maps spaces of reduced
dimension into themselves whenever the original operator does. This makes
possible the first primal/dual implementation of a method that seeks the center
of spiraling iterates. We describe this method, and provide a computed example

of microbubble contrast agents. By tracking individual microbubbles, the
velocity and flow within microvessels can be estimated. However, a 2D
super-resolution image can only localize bubbles with sub-wavelength resolution
in the imaging plane whereas the resolution in the elevation plane is limited
by conventional beamwidth physics. Since ultrasound imaging integrates echoes
over the elevation dimension, velocity estimates at a single location in the
imaging plane include information throughout the imaging slice thickness. This
slice thickness is typically a few orders or magnitude larger than the
super-resolution limit. It is shown here that in order to estimate the
velocity, a spatial integration over the elevation direction must be
considered. This operation yields a multiplicative correction factor that
compensates for the elevation integration. A correlation-based velocity
estimation technique is then presented. Calibrated microtube phantom
experiments are used to validate the proposed velocity estimation method and
the proposed elevation integration correction factor. It is shown that velocity
measurements are in agreement with theoretical predictions within the

has been introduced and mostly studied qualitatively. Methods: We present a
computational model to describe the time-dependent change of oxygen
concentration in the tissue. The kinetic equation of the model is solved
numerically using the finite difference method. The model is used to analyze
the FLASH effect with the oxygen depletion hypothesis, and the brain tissue is
chosen as an example. Results: The oxygen distribution is determined by the
oxygen consumption rate of the tissue and the distance between capillaries. The
change of oxygen concentration with time after radiation has been found to
follow a negative exponential function, and the time constant is determined by
the distance between capillaries. When the dose rate is high enough, the same
dose results in the same change of oxygen concentration regardless of dose
rate. The analysis of FLASH effect in the brain tissue based on this model does
not support the explanation of the oxygen depletion hypothesis. Conclusions:
The oxygen depletion hypothesis remains controversial because oxygen in most
normal tissues cannot be depleted by FLASH radiation according to the
mathematical analysis with this model and experiments on the expression and
distribution of the hypoxia-inducible factors.

needs to be fulfilled for the growth of the subunits. In the present work, an
elastic phase-field model, which elegantly recovers the sharp-interface

energy on the evolution of the subunits. The primary finding of the current
analysis is that the role of eigenstrains in the bainite transformation is
apparently complicated to be directly quantified as the thermodynamic
constraint. It is realized that the inhomogeneous stress state, induced by the
growth of the primary subunit, renders a spatially dependent ill- and
well-favored condition for the growth of the secondary subunits. A favorability
contour, which encloses the sections that facilitate the elastically preferred
growth, is postulated based on the elastic interaction. Through the numerical
analyses, the enhanced growth of the subunits within the favorability-contour
is verified. Current investigations show that the morphology and size of the

the isosceles triangular domain wall network in twisted bilayer graphene under
shear strain can be determined through purely geometrical considerations.
Experimental analysis of the orientation of domain walls and period of the
triangular network would, on the one hand, contribute to understanding of the
interlayer interaction of graphene layers, and, on the other hand, serve for
detection of relative strains and rotation between the layers. Vice versa
external strains can be used to control the parameters of the triangular domain
wall network and, therefore, electronic properties of twisted bilayer graphene.

cosmological studies, and the line intensity mapping provides a powerful tool
for this kind of study. We propose to make use of multipole moments of
redshift-space line intensity power spectrum to constrain the cosmological and
astrophysical parameters, such as the equation of state of dark energy, massive
neutrinos, primordial non-Gaussianity, and star formation rate density. As an
example, we generate mock data of multipole power spectra for H-alpha 6563AA,
[OIII] 5007AA and [OII] 3727AA measured by SPHEREx experiment at z=1
considering contaminations from interloper lines, and use Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method to constrain the parameters in the model. We find a good
fitting result of the parameters compared to their fiducial values, which means
that the multipole power spectrum can effectively distinguish signal and
interloper lines, and break the degeneracies between parameters, such as line
mean intensity and bias. We also explore the cross power spectrum with CSST
(Chinese Space Station Telescope) spectroscopic galaxy survey in the
constraints. Since more accurate fitting results can be obtained by including
measurements of the emission lines at higher redshifts out to z=3 at least and
cross-correlations between emission lines can be involved, the line intensity
mapping is expected to offer excellent results in future cosmological and
astrophysical studies.

gradually increased, a reordering of the modes takes place. Since it is not
possible in crystals with orthorhombic or higher symmetry that a LO mode
crosses a transverse optical (TO) mode's position, this reordering takes place
via mode hybridization. During this mode hybridization, the plasmon or
plasmon-like LO mode gradually becomes the originally higher situated LO mode
while the latter morphs into the former. As a consequence, an inner (LO-TO) and
an outer (TO-LO) mode pair is formed. This process continues until the LO
oscillator strength is so high that all other phonons are inverted and form
LO-TO pairs within the outer TO-LO mode pair of the plasmon or plasmon-like

\emph{and} deletions, the All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) problem asks to
maintain a data structure that processes updates efficiently and returns after
each update the distance matrix to the current version of $G$. In two
breakthrough results, Italiano and Demetrescu [STOC '03] presented an algorithm
that requires $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ \emph{amortized} update time, and Thorup showed
in [STOC '05] that \emph{worst-case} update time $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$ can be
achieved. In this article, we make substantial progress on the problem. We
present the following new results:
  (1) We present the first deterministic data structure that breaks the
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$ worst-case update time bound by Thorup which has been
standing for almost 15 years. We improve the worst-case update time to
$\tilde{O}(n^{2+5/7}) = \tilde{O}(n^{2.71..})$ and to $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/5}) =
\tilde{O}(n^{2.6})$ for unweighted graphs.
  (2) We present a simple deterministic algorithm with $\tilde{O}(n^{2+3/4})$
worst-case update time ($\tilde{O}(n^{2+2/3})$ for unweighted graphs), and a
simple Las-Vegas algorithm with worst-case update time $\tilde{O}(n^{2+2/3})$
($\tilde{O}(n^{2 + 1/2})$ for unweighted graphs) that works against a
non-oblivious adversary. Both data structures require space $\tilde{O}(n^2)$.
These are the first exact dynamic algorithms with truly-subcubic update time
\emph{and} space usage. This makes significant progress on an open question
posed in multiple articles [COCOON'01, STOC '03, ICALP'04, Encyclopedia of
Algorithms '08] and is critical to algorithms in practice [TALG '06] where
large space usage is prohibitive. Moreover, they match the worst-case update
time of the best previous algorithms and the second algorithm improves upon a
Monte-Carlo algorithm in a weaker adversary model with the same running time
[SODA '17].

nonconvex optimization problems. These apply in both standard smooth and
composite non-smooth settings, and additionally allow convex or inexpensive
constraints. An adaptive regularization algorithm is then proposed to find such
approximate minimizers. Under suitable Lipschitz continuity assumptions,
whenever the feasible set is convex, it is shown that using a model of degree
$p$, this algorithm will find a strong approximate q-th-order minimizer in at
most ${\cal O}\left(\max_{1\leq j\leq q}\epsilon_j^{-(p+1)/(p-j+1)}\right)$
evaluations of the problem's functions and their derivatives, where
$\epsilon_j$ is the $j$-th order accuracy tolerance; this bound applies when
either $q=1$ or the problem is not composite with $q \leq 2$. For general
non-composite problems, even when the feasible set is nonconvex, the bound
becomes ${\cal O}\left(\max_{1\leq j\leq q}\epsilon_j^{-q(p+1)/p}\right)$

hand, initial correlations between the open system and its environment prevents
one from defining a completely positive dynamical map. Recently, dephasing
dynamics of photons has been used in both of these frameworks - theoretically
and experimentally - to demonstrate some fundamental and applicable aspects of
open system dynamics and memory effects. However, the earlier studies in this
context are often based solely on the concept of decoherence functions.
Therefore, we still lack explicit master equation descriptions for dynamics
induced by correlated composite initial environmental states. Also, a detailed
understanding how initial system-environment correlations influence qubit
dynamics in the photonic context is missing. In this paper, we derive generic
master equations for the reduced dephasing dynamics of the two-photon
polarization state when the bipartite environmental frequency degrees of
freedom are initially correlated. We thereby show the explicit dependence of
the operator form and the decay rates of the master equation on the initial
frequency correlations and the influence of various types of frequency
distributions. Furthermore, we use recently developed bath positive
decomposition method to treat initially correlated polarization-frequency state
of a photon, and demonstrate how this allows new insight and detailed

  Likelihoods and Smoothness","Accepted to JMLR",,,,"math.ST cs.LG cs.NA math.NA stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gaussian processes are ubiquitous in machine learning, statistics, and
applied mathematics. They provide a flexible modelling framework for
approximating functions, whilst simultaneously quantifying uncertainty.
However, this is only true when the model is well-specified, which is often not
the case in practice. In this paper, we study the properties of Gaussian
process means when the smoothness of the model and the likelihood function are
misspecified. In this setting, an important theoretical question of practial
relevance is how accurate the Gaussian process approximations will be given the
difficulty of the problem, our model and the extent of the misspecification.
The answer to this problem is particularly useful since it can inform our
choice of model and experimental design. In particular, we describe how the
experimental design and choice of kernel and kernel hyperparameters can be
adapted to alleviate model misspecification.

V$ and $\epsilon>0$, we consider the problem of maintaining
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest path distances from $s$ to all vertices in
$G$ over the sequence of deletions. Even and Shiloach (J.~ACM'$81$) give a
deterministic data structure for the exact version of the problem with total
update time $O(mn)$. Henzinger et al. (STOC'$14$, ICALP'$15$) give a Monte
Carlo data structure for the approximate version with improved total update
time $ O(mn^{0.9 + o(1)}\log W)$ where $W$ is the ratio between the largest and
smallest edge weight. A drawback of their data structure is that they only work
against an oblivious adversary, meaning that the sequence of deletions needs to
be fixed in advance. This limits its application as a black box inside
algorithms. We present the following $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate data
structures:
  (1) the first data structure is Las Vegas and works against an adaptive
adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O(m^{2/3}n^{4/3})$ for
unweighted graphs and $\tilde O(m^{3/4}n^{5/4}\log W)$ for weighted graphs,
  (2) the second data structure is Las Vegas and assumes an oblivious
adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O(\sqrt m n^{3/2})$ for
unweighted graphs and $\tilde O(m^{2/3}n^{4/3}\log W)$ for weighted graphs,
  (3) the third data structure is Monte Carlo and is correct w.h.p.~against an
oblivious adversary; it has total expected update time $\tilde O((mn)^{7/8}\log
W) = \tilde O(mn^{3/4}\log W)$.
  Each of our data structures can be queried at any stage of $G$ in constant
worst-case time; if the adversary is oblivious, a query can be extended to also
report such a path in time proportional to its length. Our update times are
faster than those of Henzinger et al.~for all graph densities.

first-order stationary point matches the well known worst-case optimal
complexity. This is, in fact, still given by O(epsilon^(-3/2)), with respect to
the first-order epsilon tolerance. Finally, numerical tests on nonconvex
finite-sum minimisation confirm that using inexact first and second-order

learn to interact with the other agents that have fixed policies. Modeling the
behavior of other agents (opponents) is essential in understanding the

advances in unsupervised learning, we propose modeling opponents using
variational autoencoders. Additionally, many existing methods in the literature
assume that the opponent models have access to opponent's observations and

a general model for the gas density distribution in the Galactic halo, and
investigate the gas evolution under radiative cooling with a series of 2D
hydrodynamic simulations. We find that the mass inflow rate in the developed
cooling flow increases with gas metallicity and the total gas mass in the halo.
For a fixed halo gas mass, the spatial gas distribution affects the onset time
of the cooling catastrophe, which starts earlier when the gas distribution is
more centrally-peaked, but does not substantially affect the final mass inflow
rate. The gravity from the Galactic bulge and disk affects gas properties in
inner regions, but has little effect on the final inflow rate either. We
confirm our results by investigating cooling flows in several density models
adopted from the literature, including the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) model, the
cored-NFW model, the Maller & Bullock model, and the $\beta$ model. Typical
mass inflow rates in our simulations range from $\sim 5 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to
$\sim 60 M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and are much higher than the observed star
formation rate in our Galaxy, suggesting that stellar and active galactic

distortions. In the existing works, a promising strategy is to apply parallel

fusion phase, a small number of operations would dominate the restoration
result due to the features' heterogeneity by different operations. To this end,
we introduce the tensor 1x1 convolutional layer by imposing high-order tensor
(outer) product, by which we not only harmonize the heterogeneous features but
also take additional non-linearity into account. To avoid the unacceptable
kernel size resulted from the tensor product, we construct the kernels with
tensor network decomposition, which is able to convert the exponential growth
of the dimension to linear growth. Armed with the new layer, we propose
High-order OWAN for multi-distorted image restoration. In the numerical

$p>0$ such that the following holds for every circle packing: If each disk is
retained with probability $p$ independently, then the probability that there is
a path of retained disks connecting the origin to infinity is zero. The
following conclusions are derived using results on circle packings of planar
graphs: (i) Site percolation with parameter $p$ has no infinite connected
component on recurrent simple plane triangulations, or on Benjamini--Schramm
limits of finite simple planar graphs. (ii) Site percolation with parameter
$1-p$ has an infinite connected component on transient simple plane
triangulations with bounded degree. These results lend support to recent
conjectures of Benjamini. Extensions to graphs formed from the packing of

to the long-time dynamics of NKGE with small initial data and $O(1)$
nonlinearity strength, while the amplitude of the initial data (and the
solution) is at $O(\varepsilon)$. By reformulating the NKGE into a relativistic
nonlinear Schr\""{o}dinger equation, we adapt the TSFP method to discretize it
numerically. By using the method of mathematical induction to bound the
numerical solution, we prove uniform error bounds at
$O(h^{m}+\varepsilon^{p-\beta}\tau^2)$ of the TSFP method with $h$ mesh size,
$\tau$ time step and $m\ge2$ depending on the regularity of the solution. The
error bounds are uniformly accurate for the long-time simulation up to the time
at $O(\varepsilon^{-\beta})$ and uniformly valid for $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$.
Especially, the error bounds are uniformly at the second order rate for the
large time step $\tau = O(\varepsilon^{-(p-\beta)/2})$ in the parameter regime
$0\le\beta <p$. Numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds in
the long-time regime. Finally, the TSFP method and its error bounds are
extended to a highly oscillatory complex NKGE which propagates waves with
wavelength at $O(1)$ in space and $O(\varepsilon^{\beta})$ in time and wave
velocity at $O(\varepsilon^{-\beta})$.

indexed by an order $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and a direction $u$ in the unit sphere
$\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$ of $\mathbb{R}^d$ --- or equivalently by a vector $\alpha
u$ in the open unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^d$. Recently, Girard and Stupfler
(2017) proved that (i) the extreme quantiles $\mu_{\alpha,u}(P)$ obtained as
$\alpha\to 1$ exit all compact sets of $\mathbb{R}^d$ and that (ii) they do so
in a direction converging to $u$. These results help understanding the nature
of these quantiles: the first result is particularly striking as it holds even
if $P$ has a bounded support, whereas the second one clarifies the delicate
dependence of spatial quantiles on $u$. However, they were established under
assumptions imposing that $P$ is non-atomic, so that it is unclear whether they
hold for empirical probability measures. We improve on this by proving these
results under much milder conditions, allowing for the sample case. This
prevents using gradient condition arguments, which makes the proofs very
challenging. We also weaken the well-known sufficient condition for uniqueness
of finite-dimensional spatial quantiles.

with radial fundamental modes ($n=1$) and overtones ($n\geqslant2$), where the
radial order assignment is made by using theoretical frequencies and observed

semiregulars is consistent with oscillations being solar-like. We identify that
the dipole modes, $l=1$, are dominant in the radial orders of $3\leq n \leq6$,
and that quadrupole modes, $l=2$, are dominant in the first overtone $n=2$. A
test of seismic scaling relations using Gaia DR2 parallaxes reveals the
possibility that the relations break down when $\nu_{\rm max}$ $\lesssim$ 3

Our homogeneous measurements of pulsation amplitude and period for 3213 LPVs

several successful software-based side-channel attacks have been developed that
break, or at least significantly weaken the isolation that these mechanisms

  This paper studies the problem of extending a processor with new features

concrete case of extending a microprocessor that supports enclaved execution
with secure interruptibility of these enclaves. This is a very relevant
instantiation as several recent papers have shown that interruptibility of

a design for interruptible enclaves, and prove that it satisfies our security

helicity is compromised by the inability to fully infer the magnetic field
vector from observations of solar spectra, caused by what is known as the ""pi
ambiguity"" of spectropolarimetric observations. We decompose linear
polarisation into parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarisations, which are
not affected by the ""pi ambiguity"". Furthermore, we study whether the
correlations of spatial Fourier spectra of B and parity-even quantities such as
E or temperature T are a robust proxy for magnetic helicity of solar magnetic
fields. We analyse polarisation measurements of active regions observed by the
Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics observatory.
Theory predicts the magnetic helicity of active regions to have, statistically,
opposite signs in the two hemispheres. We then compute the parity-odd E B and T
B correlations, and test for systematic preference of their sign based on the
hemisphere of the active regions. We find that: (i) E B and T B correlations
are a reliable proxy for magnetic helicity, when computed from linear
polarisation measurements away from spectral line cores, and (ii) E
polarisation reverses its sign close to the line core. Our analysis reveals
Faraday rotation to not have a significant influence on the computed parity-odd
correlations. The EB decomposition of linear polarisation appears to be a good
proxy for magnetic helicity independent of the ""pi ambiguity"". This allows us

importance in numerical simulations of massive star formation. We seek to
compare outflow and accretion mechanisms in star formation simulations. We
investigate the accuracy of a hybrid radiative transfer method using the gray
M1 closure relation for proto-stellar irradiation and gray flux-limited
diffusion (FLD) for photons emitted everywhere else. We have coupled the FLD
module of the adaptive-mesh refinement code Ramses with Ramses-RT, which is
based on the M1 closure relation. Our hybrid (M1+FLD) method takes an average
opacity at the stellar temperature for the M1 module, instead of the local
environmental radiation field. We have tested this approach in radiative
transfer tests of disks irradiated by a star for three levels of optical
thickness and compared the temperature structure with RADMC-3D and MCFOST. We
applied it to a radiation-hydrodynamical simulation of massive star formation.
Our tests validate our hybrid approach for determining the temperature
structure of an irradiated disk in the optically-thin and moderately
optically-thick regimes and the most optically-thick test shows the limitation
of our approach. The optically-thick setups highlight the ability of the hybrid
method to partially capture the self-shielding in the disk while the FLD
cannot. The radiative acceleration is 100 times greater with the hybrid method.
It consistently leads to about +50% more extended and wider-angle radiative
outflows in the massive star formation simulation. We obtain a $17.6 M_\odot$
at $t{\simeq}0.7 \tau_\mathrm{ff}$, while the accretion phase is ongoing.
Finally, despite the use of refinement to resolve the radiative cavities, no
Rayleigh-Taylor instability appears in our simulations, and we justify their
absence by physical arguments based on the entropy gradient. (abridged)

analysis based on the optical spectral signs of chromospheric activity on the
largest sample of contact binaries to date. We collected echelle spectra on 12
bright contact binaries and derived new radial velocity curves from our
observations. For quantifying the apparent chromospheric activity levels of the
systems, we subtracted self-constructed synthetic spectra from the observed
ones and measured the equivalent widths of the residual H$\alpha$-profiles at
each observed epoch. Our well-sampled data set allowed us to study the
short-term variations of chromospheric activity levels as well as to search for
correlations between them and some basic physical parameters of the systems.
Fitting the radial velocity curves, we re-determined the mass ratios and
systemic velocities of all observed objects. We found that chromospheric
activity levels of the studied systems show various changes during the orbital
revolution: we see either flat, or one-peaked, or two-peaked distributions of
equivalent width vs. the orbital phase. The first case means that the activity
level is probably constant, while the latter two cases suggest the presence of
one or two active longitudes at the stellar surfaces. Our correlation diagrams
show that mean chromospheric activity levels may be in connection with orbital
periods, B$-$V color indices, inverse Rossby numbers, and temperature
differences of the components. At the same time, no clear trend is visible with

While the idea can also be applied in the time domain, here we focus on the
frequency domain, which is most typically used to reduced computational cost in
gravitational wave data analysis. Our work extends the idea of multibanding,
which has been developed to accelerate frequency domain waveforms, to include
the merger and ringdown and spherical harmonics beyond the dominant quadrupole
spherical harmonic. The original method is based on a heuristic algorithm based
on the inspiral to de-refine the equi-spaced frequency grid used for data
analysis where a coarser grid is sufficient for accurate evaluation of a
waveform model. Here we use a different criterion, based on the local
interpolation error, which is more flexible and can easily be adapted to
general waveforms, if their phenomenology is understood. We discuss our
implementation in the LIGO Algorithm Library for the PhenomXHM frequency domain

wall media and indoor static non-human targets would cause clutters and
significantly corrupt the motion information of human subjects behind wall.
However, no relevant work is reported to effectively handle this problem. In
the present work, we aim to fill the gap and propose to use a low
center-frequency ultra-wideband (UWB) radar system to probe the behind wall

only to remove the stationary clutters in raw range slow-time map but also to
mitigate the multipath effects in the time-frequency map. Onsite experiments of
detecting human motions behind a single layer of concrete wall is carried out

causality-related properties in machine learning models generally, and in
generative models in particular. While that is well motivated, it inherits the
fundamental computational hardness of probabilistic inference, making exact
reasoning intractable. Probabilistic tractable models have also recently
emerged, which guarantee that conditional marginals can be computed in time
linear in the size of the model, where the model is usually learned from data.
Although initially limited to low tree-width models, recent tractable models
such as sum product networks (SPNs) and probabilistic sentential decision
diagrams (PSDDs) exploit efficient function representations and also capture
high tree-width models.
  In this paper, we ask the following technical question: can we use the
distributions represented or learned by these models to perform causal queries,
such as reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals? By appealing to some
existing ideas on transforming such models to Bayesian networks, we answer
mostly in the negative. We show that when transforming SPNs to a causal graph
interventional reasoning reduces to computing marginal distributions; in other
words, only trivial causal reasoning is possible. For PSDDs the situation is
only slightly better. We first provide an algorithm for constructing a causal
graph from a PSDD, which introduces augmented variables. Intervening on the
original variables, once again, reduces to marginal distributions, but when
intervening on the augmented variables, a deterministic but nonetheless
causal-semantics can be provided for PSDDs.

concepts have dual representations as indices and associated embeddings, two
constructs we believe are essential for the understanding of implicit and
explicit perception and memory in the brain. We argue that a biological
realization of perception and memory imposes constraints on information
processing. In particular, we propose that explicit perception and declarative
memories require a semantic decoder, which, in a simple realization, is based
on four layers: First, a sensory memory layer, as a buffer for sensory input,
second, an index layer representing concepts, third, a memoryless
representation layer for the broadcasting of information ---the ""blackboard"",
or the ""canvas"" of the brain--- and fourth, a working memory layer as a
processing center and data buffer. We discuss the operations of the four layers
and relate them to the global workspace theory. In a Bayesian brain
interpretation, semantic memory defines the prior for observable triple
statements. We propose that ---in evolution and during development--- semantic
memory, episodic memory, and natural language evolved as emergent properties in
agents' process to gain a deeper understanding of sensory information.

produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at LHC. We propose to measure the

the models. Since the masses of $^4{\rm He}$ and $^4{\rm Li}$ are almost equal,
the yield of $^4{\rm Li}$ is about 5 times bigger than that of $^4{\rm He}$ in
the thermal model because of different numbers of spin states of the two
nuclides. Their internal structures are, however, very different: the alpha
particle is well bound and compact while $^4{\rm Li}$ is weakly bound and
loose. Consequently, the ratio of yields of $^4{\rm Li}$ to $^4{\rm He}$ is
significantly smaller in the coalescence model and it strongly depends on the
collision centrality. Since the nuclide $^4{\rm Li}$ is unstable and it decays
into $^3{\rm He}$ and $p$, the yield of $^4{\rm Li}$ can be experimentally
obtained through a measurement of the $p\!-\!^3{\rm He}$ correlation function.
The function carries information not only about the yield of $^4{\rm Li}$ but
also about the source of $^3{\rm He}$ and allows one to determine through a
source-size measurement whether of $^3{\rm He}$ is directly emitted from the
fireball or it is formed afterwards. We compute the correlation function taking
into account the $s-$wave scattering and Coulomb repulsion together with the
resonance interaction responsible for the $^4{\rm Li}$ nuclide. We discuss how
to infer information about an origin of $^3{\rm He}$ from the correlation
function, and finally a method to obtain the yield of $^4{\rm Li}$ is proposed.

usually towards the nearest zeta zero. We show, however, that this is not
always the case, but depends upon the distance and number of nearby zeros on
each side of the corresponding distribution. The skewness, however, always
decreases when zeta zero is crossed from left to right, i.e., in increasing

maximum or, at least, a turning point at every zeta zero, i.e., local minimum
of the second derivative of the variance. In addition, it seems that the higher

cross-entropy between performance of the FL model on the local datasets and
that of the client local FL model on the benchmark dataset. Then, a credit
weighted orchestration is performed to adjust the weight assigned to clients in

The value of $\mu$ in each state is shown to be uniquely determined by $D$ and
also to depend on a type of liquids. Hence there exists such a universality
that there is only one solution for different liquids of a same type at a given
value of $D$. This may be consistent with the fact that strong liquids are
structurally quite different from fragile liquids. Thus, it is emphasized that
such a universality must be helpful to predict $q_m$ from experimental data.

temperature environments is instrumental in a broad range of fields including
quantum computing, superconducting electronics, single photon imaging and
space-based communications. A promising approach to overcome the limitations of
conventional wire-based readout is the use of optical fiber communication.
Optical fiber presents a 100-1,000x lower heat load than conventional
electrical wiring, relaxing the requirements for thermal anchoring, and is also
immune to electromagnetic interference, which allows routing of sensitive
signals with improved robustness to noise and crosstalk. Most importantly,
optical fibers allow for very high bandwidth densities (in the Tbps/mm$^2$
range) by carrying multiple signals through the same physical fiber (Wavelength
Division Multiplexing, WDM). Here, we demonstrate for the first time optical
readout of a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) directly
coupled to a CMOS photonic modulator, without the need for an interfacing
device. By operating the modulator in the forward bias regime at a temperature
of 3.6 K, we achieve very high modulation efficiency (1000-10,000 pm/V) and a
low input impedance of 500 $\Omega$ with a low power dissipation of 40 $\mu$W.
This allows us to obtain optical modulation with the low, millivolt-level
signal generated by the SNSPD. Optical communication is becoming the preferred
I/O solution in modern, room temperature high performance systems, and this
work demonstrates its suitability for scalable cryogenic readout, which could
help achieve the full potential of superconducting technologies.

preserving Poincar\'e transformations can be computed by transforming the

devices in a geographical area will be served simultaneously in non-orthogonal
multiple access scenarios by a large number of distributed access points (APs),
which coordinate with a centralized processing pool. For such a centralized
cell-free network with static predefined beamforming design, we first derive a
closed-form expression of the uplink per-user probability of outage. To
significantly reduce the complexity of joint processing of users' signals in
presence of a large number of devices and APs, we propose a novel dynamic
cell-free network architecture. In this architecture, the distributed APs are
partitioned (i.e. clustered) among a set of subgroups with each subgroup acting
as a virtual AP equipped with a distributed antenna system (DAS). The
conventional static cell-free network is a special case of this dynamic
cell-free network when the cluster size is one. For this dynamic cell-free
network, we propose a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-enabled signal
detection method and an inter-user-interference (IUI)-aware DAS's receive
diversity combining scheme. We then formulate the general problem of clustering
APs and designing the beamforming vectors with an objective to maximizing the
