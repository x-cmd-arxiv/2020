human hearing can, in some settings, cause adverse physiological and
psychological effects to individuals. In this paper, we investigate the
feasibility of cyber-attacks that could make smart consumer devices produce
possibly imperceptible sound at both high (17-21kHz) and low (60-100Hz)
frequencies, at the maximum available volume setting, potentially turning them
into acoustic cyber-weapons. To do so, we deploy attacks targeting different
smart devices and take sound measurements in an anechoic chamber. For
comparison, we also test possible attacks on traditional devices.
  Overall, we find that many of the devices tested are capable of reproducing
frequencies within both high and low ranges, at levels exceeding those
recommended in published guidelines. Generally speaking, such attacks are often
trivial to develop and in many cases could be added to existing malware
payloads, as they may be attractive to adversaries with specific motivations or
targets. Finally, we suggest a number of countermeasures, both

physical parameters at $1^{\circ}$ resolution are produced through Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) fits of spectral energy distributions (SEDs), approximating
the AME component with a log-normal distribution. AME is detected in excess of
$20\,\sigma$ at degree-scales around the entirety of the ring along
photodissociation regions (PDRs), with three primary bright regions containing
dark clouds. A radial decrease is observed in the AME peak frequency from
$\approx35\,$GHz near the free-free region to $\approx21\,$GHz in the outer

across a single region. A strong correlation between AME peak frequency,
emission measure and dust temperature is an indication for the dependence of
the AME peak frequency on the local radiation field. The AME amplitude
normalised by the optical depth is also strongly correlated with the radiation
field, giving an overall picture consistent with spinning dust where the local

server to receive relevant data, compromising their (location) privacy. To
alleviate this privacy compromise, the vehicle's location can be obfuscated by
adding artificial noise. Under limited available bandwidth, and since the area
including the vehicle's location increases with the noise, the server will
provide fewer data relevant to the vehicle's true location, reducing the
effectiveness of a location-based service. To alleviate this problem, we
propose that data relevant to a vehicle is also provided through direct, ad hoc
communication by neighboring vehicles. Through such Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V)
cooperation, the impact of location obfuscation is mitigated. Since vehicles
subscribe to data of (location-dependent) impact values, neighboring vehicles
will subscribe to largely overlapping sets of data, reducing the benefit of V2V
cooperation. To increase such benefit, we develop and study a non-cooperative
game determining the data that a vehicle should subscribe to, aiming at
maximizing its utilization while considering the participating (neighboring)
vehicles. Our analysis and results show that the proposed V2V cooperation and
derived strategy lead to significant performance increase compared to
non-cooperative approaches and largely alleviates the impact of privacy on

celestial objects, enabling studies of the evolution and internal physics of
stars, brown dwarfs, and planets. Brown dwarfs are hydrogen-rich objects that
are unable to sustain core fusion reactions but are supported from collapse by
electron degeneracy pressure. As they age, brown dwarfs cool, reducing their
radius and luminosity. Young exoplanets follow a similar behaviour. Brown dwarf
evolutionary models are relied upon to infer the masses, radii and ages of
these objects. Similar models are used to infer the mass and radius of directly
imaged exoplanets. Unfortunately, only sparse empirical mass, radius and age
measurements are currently available, and the models remain mostly unvalidated.
Double-line eclipsing binaries provide the most direct route for the absolute
determination of the masses and radii of stars. Here, we report the SPECULOOS
discovery of 2M1510A, a nearby, eclipsing, double-line brown dwarf binary, with
a widely-separated tertiary brown dwarf companion. We also find that the system
is a member of the $45\pm5$ Myr-old moving group, Argus. The system's age
matches those of currently known directly-imaged exoplanets. 2M1510A provides
an opportunity to benchmark evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and young
planets. We find that widely-used evolutionary models do reproduce the mass,
radius and age of the binary components remarkably well, but overestimate the
luminosity by up to 0.65 magnitudes, which could result in underestimated
photometric masses for directly-imaged exoplanets and young field brown dwarfs

changes in the device configuration may impact the overall charge transport
behavior of single-molecule junctions. Based on the allied approach of density
functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we explore
here the effect of junction heterogeneity on inelastic charge transport in
various metal-string based single-molecule devices. The constituent active
elements being sensitive to the resonant levels, transition metal centers are
found to influence stretching, bending, and torsional excitation modes, while
rocking and scissoring modes are controlled largely by the axial ligands. For
certain molecular conformations and electrode orientations, phonon-assisted
quantum interference effect may crop up, leading to the suppression of higher
wavenumber vibrational modes. The resulting inelastic spectra are likely to
take the shape of dominant Fano resonance or anti-resonance, depending on
whether phonons are emitted or absorbed. Such nanoscale quantum interference
effect is manifested especially in those metal-string molecular junctions for
which the energy gap (between localized and delocalized virtual states) lies
well within the optical phonon energies ($\Delta{E}_{|HOMO-LUMO|} <$ 40 meV).
It also turns out that single molecular shot noise can exhibit nearly
Poissonian behavior if the inter-channel tunneling through frontier orbitals is
accompanied by phonon absorption or emission following a slow relaxation
process. Our results thus suggest that charge transport properties across
metal-string complexes can be potentially tuned by selective architecture of
the metal centers and also, by preferred orientation of nanoscale electrodes in
a bid to build up molecular devices with desirable controllability.

This expression takes fully into account the environmental reorganization

  A theoretical analysis for the proposed algorithms is carried out, and some
sufficient conditions for the guaranteed success of sparse signal recovery via
these algorithms are established. Our results are shown under the restricted
isometry property which is one of the standard assumptions widely used in the

features such as scale-free degree distributions, high modularity, and low
average distance between connected genes. Such networks result from complex
evolutionary and adaptive processes difficult to track down empirically. On the
other hand, there exists detailed information on the developmental (or
evolutionary) stages of open-software networks that result from self-organized
growth across versions. Here, we study the evolution of the Debian GNU/Linux

features over time. Our results show that evolution has led to a network
structure in which the out-degree distribution is scale-free and the in-degree

directionality of information flow, and average distance between elements grew,
vulnerability decreased over time. These features resemble closely those
currently shown by gene regulatory networks, suggesting the existence of common
adaptive pathways for the architectural design of information-processing

there is a need for fast and reliable reconstruction algorithms yielding
surrogate networks having similar stochastic properties as the original ones.
The microvascular networks are constructed in a marching way by adding vessels
to the outlets of the vascular tree from the previous step. To optimise the
structure of the vascular trees, we use Murray's law to determine the radii of
the vessels and bifurcation angles. In each step, we compute the local gradient
of the partial pressure of oxygen and adapt the orientation of the new vessels
to this gradient. At the same time, we use the partial pressure of oxygen to
check whether the considered tissue block is supplied sufficiently with oxygen.
Computing the partial pressure of oxygen, we use a 3D-1D coupled model for
blood flow and oxygen transport. To decrease the complexity of a fully coupled
3D model, we reduce the blood vessel network to a 1D graph structure and use a
bi-directional coupling with the tissue which is described by a 3D homogeneous
porous medium. The resulting surrogate networks are analysed with respect to
morphological and physiological aspects.

topological winding number. This winding increases their robustness to

making them attractive as next-generation information carriers. Recently the
equation of motion for a skyrmion was derived using the approach pioneered by
Thiele, allowing for macroscopic skyrmion systems to be modeled efficiently.
This powerful technique suffers from the prerequisite that one must have a

alleviate this problem by providing a simple analytic expression which can
generate arbitrary repulsive interaction potentials from the micromagnetic

WASP-121~b an interesting target for additional atmospheric characterization.
In this paper, we present analysis of archival high-resolution optical spectra

We attribute the H$\alpha$ absorption to an extended Hydrogen atmosphere,

They parametrize CPV originating from the interference of $D^0$ decays with and
without dispersive mixing, and with and without absorptive mixing,
respectively, for CP conjugate hadronic final states $f$, $\bar f$. These are
distinct and separately measurable effects. For CP eigenstate final states,
indirect CPV only depends on $\phi_f^M$ (dispersive CPV), whereas
$\phi_f^\Gamma$ (absorptive CPV) can only be probed with non-CP eigenstate
final states. Measurements of the final state dependent phases $\phi_f^M$,
$\phi_f^\Gamma$ determine the intrinsic dispersive and absorptive mixing phases
$\phi_2^M$ and $\phi_2^\Gamma$. The latter are the arguments of the dispersive
and absorptive mixing amplitudes $M_{12}$ and $\Gamma_{12}$, relative to their
dominant ($\Delta U=2$) $U$-spin components. The intrinsic phases are
experimentally accessible due to approximate universality: in the SM, and in
extensions with negligible new CPV phases in Cabibbo favored/doubly Cabibbo
suppressed (CF/DCS) decays, the deviation of $\phi_f^{M,\Gamma}$ from
$\phi_2^{M,\Gamma}$ is negligible in CF/DCS decays $D^0 \to K^\pm X$, and below
$10\% $ in CF/DCS decays $D^0 \to K_{S,L} X$ (up to precisely known
$O(\epsilon_K)$ corrections). In Singly Cabibbo Suppressed (SCS) decays, QCD
pollution enters at $O(\epsilon)$ in $U$-spin breaking and can be significant,
but is $O(\epsilon^2)$ in the average over $f=K^+K^-$, $\pi^+\pi^-$. SM
estimates yield $\phi_2^M, \phi_2^\Gamma = O(0.2\%)$. A fit to current data
allows $O(10)$ larger phases at $2\sigma$, from new physics. A fit based on
naively extrapolated experimental precision suggests that sensitivity to
$\phi_2^{M}$ and $\phi_2^{\Gamma}$ in the SM may be achieved at the LHCb Phase

  Constraint",,,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The $\ell_0$-constrained empirical risk minimization ($\ell_0$-ERM) is a
promising tool for high-dimensional statistical estimation. The existing
analysis of $\ell_0$-ERM estimator is mostly on parameter estimation and
support recovery consistency. From the perspective of statistical learning,
another fundamental question is how well the $\ell_0$-ERM estimator would
perform on unseen samples. The answer to this question is important for
understanding the learnability of such a non-convex (and also NP-hard)
M-estimator but still relatively under explored.
  In this paper, we investigate this problem and develop a generalization
theory for $\ell_0$-ERM. We establish, in both white-box and black-box
statistical regimes, a set of generalization gap and excess risk bounds for
$\ell_0$-ERM to characterize its sparse prediction and optimization capability.
Our theory mainly reveals three findings: 1) tighter generalization bounds can
be attained by $\ell_0$-ERM than those of $\ell_2$-ERM if the risk function is
(with high probability) restricted strongly convex; 2) tighter uniform
generalization bounds can be established for $\ell_0$-ERM than the conventional
dense ERM; and 3) sparsity level invariant bounds can be established by
imposing additional strong-signal conditions to ensure the stability of
$\ell_0$-ERM. In light of these results, we further provide generalization
guarantees for the Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) algorithm which serves as
one of the most popular greedy pursuit methods for approximately solving
$\ell_0$-ERM. Numerical evidence is provided to confirm our theoretical
predictions when implied to sparsity-constrained linear regression and logistic
regression models.

statistical properties of galaxies that are consistent with observational data.
Yet, the adopted subgrid models strongly affect the simulation outcomes,
limiting the predictive power of these simulations. In this work, we perform a
suite of isolated galactic disk simulations under the {\it SMUGGLE} framework
and investigate how different subgrid models affect the properties of giant
molecular clouds (GMCs). We employ {\sc astrodendro}, a hierarchical
clump-finding algorithm, to identify GMCs in the simulations. We find that
different choices of subgrid star formation efficiency, $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$,
and stellar feedback channels, yield dramatically different mass and spatial
distributions for the GMC populations. Without feedback, the mass function of
GMCs has a shallower power-law slope and extends to higher mass ranges compared
to runs with feedback. Moreover, higher $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ results in faster
molecular gas consumption and steeper mass function slopes. Feedback also
suppresses power in the two-point correlation function (TPCF) of the spatial
distribution of GMCs. Specifically, radiative feedback strongly reduces the
TPCF on scales below 0.2~kpc, while supernova feedback reduces power on scales
above 0.2~kpc. Finally, runs with higher $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ exhibit a higher
TPCF than runs with lower $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, because the dense gas is
depleted more efficiently thereby facilitating the formation of well-structured
supernova bubbles. We argue that comparing simulated and observed GMC
populations can help better constrain subgrid models in the next-generation of
galaxy formation simulations.

is metal-poor, $\rm [Fe/H]\approx-2.3$, with little $\rm [Fe/H]$ spread and
some variation in $\rm [\alpha/Fe]$ abundances, which point to a common
globular cluster progenitor. At a fixed location along the stream, the median
radial velocity offset between the spur and the main stream is smaller than
$0.5\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, comparable to the measurement uncertainty. A flyby of a
massive, compact object can change orbits of stars in a stellar stream and
produce features like the spur observed in GD-1. In this scenario, the radial
velocity of the GD-1 spur relative to the stream constrains the orbit of the
perturber and its current on-sky position to $\approx5,000\,\rm deg^2$. The
family of acceptable perturber orbits overlaps the stellar and dark-matter

Consequently, taking into account the new high precision photo-z surveys, it is

Aims. In view of the forthcoming Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey
(PAUS) we propose and evaluate the performance of an identification algorithm
of projected close isolated galaxy pairs. We expect that the photometric
selected systems can adequately reproduce the observational properties and the
inferred lensing mass - luminosity relation of a pair of truly bound galaxies
that are hosted by the same dark matter halo. Methods. We develop an
identification algorithm that considers the projected distance between the
galaxies, the projected velocity difference and an isolation criteria in order
to restrict the sample to isolated systems. We apply our identification
algorithm using a mock galaxy catalog that mimics the features of PAUS. To
evaluate the feasibility of our pair finder, we compare the identified
photometric samples with a test sample that considers that both members are
included in the same halo. Also, taking advantage of the lensing properties
provided by the mock catalog, we apply a weak lensing analysis to determine the
mass of the selected systems. Results. Photometric selected samples tend to
show high purity values, but tend to misidentify truly bounded pairs as the
photometric redshift errors increase. Nevertheless, overall properties such as
the luminosity and mass distributions are successfully reproduced. We also
accurately reproduce the lensing mass - luminosity relation as expected for
galaxy pairs located in the same halo.

rates ($\dot{M}$) can have on the fate of massive stars. Red supergiant (RSG)
mass-loss is poorly understood theoretically, and so stellar models rely on
purely empirical \mdot-luminosity relations to calculate evolution. Empirical
prescriptions usually scale with luminosity and effective temperature, but
$\dot{M}$ should also depend on the current mass and hence the surface gravity
of the star, yielding more than one possible $\dot{M}$ for the same position on
the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. One can solve this degeneracy by measuring
$\dot{M}$ for RSGs that reside in clusters, where age and initial mass ($M_{\rm
init}$) are known. In this paper we derive $\dot{M}$ values and luminosities
for RSGs in two clusters, NGC 2004 and RSGC1. Using newly derived $M_{\rm
init}$ measurements, we combine the results with those of clusters with a range
of ages and derive an $M_{\rm init}$-dependent $\dot{M}$-prescription. When
comparing this new prescription to the treatment of mass-loss currently
implemented in evolutionary models, we find models drastically over-predict the
total mass-loss, by up to a factor of 20. Importantly, the most massive RSGs
experience the largest downward revision in their mass-loss rates, drastically
changing the impact of wind mass-loss on their evolution. Our results suggest
that for most initial masses of RSG progenitors, quiescent mass-loss during the
RSG phase is not effective at removing a significant fraction of the H-envelope
prior to core-collapse, and we discuss the implications of this for stellar
evolution and observations of SNe and SN progenitors.

large-scale and distributed matrix multiplication. In particular, univariate
polynomial codes have been shown to be effective in straggler mitigation by
making the computation time depend only on the fastest workers. However, these
schemes completely ignore the work done by the straggling workers resulting in
a waste of computational resources. To reduce the amount of work left
unfinished at workers, one can further decompose the matrix multiplication task
into smaller sub-tasks, and assign multiple sub-tasks to each worker, possibly
heterogeneously, to better fit their particular storage and computation
capacities. In this work, we propose a novel family of bivariate polynomial
codes to efficiently exploit the work carried out by straggling workers. We
show that bivariate polynomial codes bring significant advantages in terms of
upload communication costs and storage efficiency, measured in terms of the
number of sub-tasks that can be computed per worker. We propose two bivariate
polynomial coding schemes. The first one exploits the fact that bivariate
interpolation is always possible on a rectangular grid of evaluation points. We
obtain such points at the cost of adding some redundant computations. For the
second scheme, we relax the decoding constraints and require decodability for
almost all choices of the evaluation points. We present interpolation sets
satisfying such decodability conditions for certain storage configurations of
workers. Our numerical results show that bivariate polynomial coding
considerably reduces the average computation time of distributed matrix

  We show that the maximal equivariant compactification of a separably

be identified with the space $S_1(M)$ of 1-types over $M$, and is in particular
metrizable. This provides a unified understanding of the previous and other

between data and calculations for the full $p_{miss}$ range for $^3$H and for
$100 \le p_{miss} \le 350$ MeV/c for $^3$He. Including the effects of
rescattering of the outgoing nucleon improves agreement with the data at
$p_{miss} > 250$ MeV/c and suggests contributions from charge-exchange (SCX)
rescattering. The isoscalar sum of $^3$He plus $^3$H, which is largely
insensitive to SCX, is described by calculations to within the accuracy of the

allows for a system to be evaluated for specification conformance without an
accurate model of the environment. Our approach involves learning a
conservative reactive bound of the environment's behavior using data and
specification of the system's desired behavior. First, the approach begins by
learning a conservative reactive bound on the environment's actions that
captures its possible behaviors with high probability. This bound is then used
to assist verification, and if the verification fails under this bound, the
algorithm returns counter-examples to show how failure occurs and then uses
these to refine the bound. We demonstrate the applicability of the approach
through two case-studies: i) verifying controllers for a toy multi-robot
system, and ii) verifying an instance of human-robot interaction during a
lane-change maneuver given real-world human driving data.

responders to communicate with other rescue teams in order to provide feedback
to both the central office and the disaster survivors. To address this issue,
rapidly deployable systems are required to re-establish connectivity and assist
users and first responders in the region of incident. In this work, we describe
the design, implementation, and evaluation of a rapidly deployable system for
first response applications in post-disaster situations, named RDSP. The
proposed system helps early rescue responders and victims by sharing their
location information to remotely located servers by utilizing a novel routing
scheme. This novel routing scheme consists of the Dynamic ID Assignment (DIA)
algorithm and the Minimum Maximum Neighbor (MMN) algorithm. The DIA algorithm
is used by relay devices to dynamically select their IDs on the basis of all
the available IDs of networks. Whereas, the MMN algorithm is used by the client
and relay devices to dynamically select their next neighbor relays for the
transmission of messages. The RDSP contains three devices; the client device
sends the victim's location information to the server, the relay device relays
information between client and server device, the server device receives
messages from the client device to alert the rescue team. We deployed and
evaluated our system in the outdoor environment of the university campus. The
experimental results show that the RDSP system reduces the message delivery
delay and improves the message delivery ratio with lower communication
overhead.

unfortunately, this reduces the attainable level of detail hindering the

Even though various approaches may be used to re-introduce high-frequency
detail, it typically does not match the training data and is often not time
coherent. In the case of network inferred cloth, these sentiments manifest
themselves via either a lack of detailed wrinkles or unnaturally appearing
and/or time incoherent surrogate wrinkles. Thus, we propose a general strategy
whereby high-frequency information is procedurally embedded into low-frequency
data so that when the latter is smeared out by the network the former still
retains its high-frequency detail. We illustrate this approach by learning
texture coordinates which when smeared do not in turn smear out the
high-frequency detail in the texture itself but merely smoothly distort it.
Notably, we prescribe perturbed texture coordinates that are subsequently used
to correct the over-smoothed appearance of inferred cloth, and correcting the
appearance from multiple camera views naturally recovers lost geometric

necessary to control for other factors which may have confounding effects.
Because the ignorability assumption is not testable, however, it is usually
unclear which minimal set of controls is appropriate -- as is their appropriate
functional form in the model -- and effect estimation can be sensitive to these
choices. A common approach in this case is to fit several models, each with a
different control specification (under the assumption that the available
controls are sufficient but possibly not all necessary to deconfound the
treatment effect), but it is difficult to reconcile inference for the treatment
effect under the multiple resulting posterior distributions. Therefore we
propose a two-stage approach to measure the sensitivity of effect estimation
with respect to control specification. In the first stage, a model is fit with
all available controls using a prior carefully selected to adjust for
confounding. In the second stage, posterior distributions are calculated for
the treatment effect under submodels of nested sets of controls using projected
posteriors under the full model, providing valid Bayesian inference. We
demonstrate how our approach can be used to detect influential confounders in a
dataset, and apply it in a sensitivity analysis of an observational study

combinatorially using key Kohnert tableaux and lock Kohnert tableaux. In
particular, for the difference of a key minus a lock, we focus on the behavior
of crystal operators on Kohnert tableaux. The Type A Demazure crystal can be
realized on the vertex set of key Kohnert tableaux, and we show with an
explicit combinatorial definition that a similar crystal-like structure exists
on the vertex set of lock Kohnert tableaux. Finally, we construct an injective,
weight-preserving map from lock Kohnert tableaux to key Kohnert tableaux that
intertwines the crystal operators.

yet they remain difficult to accurately describe with ab initio methods due to
the presence of a large degree of dynamic electron correlation, and, in some
cases, strong static correlation which results from a manifold of low-lying
states. Progress has been hindered by a scarcity of high quality gas-phase
experimental data, while exact ab initio predictions are usually
computationally unaffordable due to the large size of the systems. In this
work, we present a data set of 34 3d metal-containing complexes with gas-phase
ligand-dissociation energies that have reported uncertainties of $\leq$ 2
kcal/mol. We perform all-electron phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo
(ph-AFQMC) utilizing multi-determinant trial wavefunctions selected by a
blackbox procedure. We compare the results with those from DFT with various
functionals, and DLPNO-CCSD(T). We find MAE of 1.09 $\pm$ 0.28 kcal/mol for our
best ph-AFQMC method, vs 2.89 kcal/mol for DLPNO-CCSD(T) and 1.57 - 3.87
kcal/mol for DFT. We find maximum errors of 2.96 $\pm$ 1.71 kcal/mol for our
best ph-AFQMC method, vs 9.15 kcal/mol for DLPNO-CCSD(T) and 5.98 - 13.69
kcal/mol for DFT. The reasonable performance of several functionals is in stark
contrast to the much poorer accuracy previously demonstrated for diatomics,
suggesting a moderation in electron correlation due to ligand coordination.
However, the unpredictably large errors for a small subset of cases with both
DFT and DLPNO-CCSD(T) leave cause for concern, especially due to the
unreliability of common multi-reference indicators. In contrast, the robust
and, in principle, systematically improvable results of ph-AFQMC for these
realistic complexes establish it as a useful tool for elucidating the
electronic structure of transition metal-containing complexes and predicting
their gas-phase properties.

model and publicly available datasets to examine future electricity generation,
CO2 emissions, and CO2 abatement costs for the North Carolina electric power
sector through 2050. Model scenarios include uncertainty in future fuel prices,
a hypothetical CO2 cap, and an extended renewable portfolio standard. Across
the modeled scenarios, solar photovoltaics represent the most cost-effective
low-carbon technology, while trade-offs among carbon constrained scenarios
largely involve natural gas and renewables. We also develop a new method to
calculate break-even costs, which indicate the capital costs at which different
technologies become cost-effective within the model. Significant variation in
break-even costs are observed across different technologies and scenarios. We
illustrate how break-even costs can be used to inform the development of an
extended renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina. Utilizing the
break-even costs to calibrate a tax credit for onshore wind, we find that the
resultant wind deployment displaces other renewables, and thus has a negligible
effect on CO2 emissions. Such insights can provide crucial guidance to

we demonstrate how the QKE of water molecules in path integral simulations can
be decomposed into translational, rotational and vibrational degrees of

unlabeled tissue sections, entirely avoiding the histochemical staining step,
has been demonstrated using tissue-stain specific deep neural networks. Here,
we present a new deep learning-based framework which generates
virtually-stained images using label-free tissue, where different stains are
merged following a micro-structure map defined by the user. This approach uses
a single deep neural network that receives two different sources of information
at its input: (1) autofluorescence images of the label-free tissue sample, and
(2) a digital staining matrix which represents the desired microscopic map of
different stains to be virtually generated at the same tissue section. This
digital staining matrix is also used to virtually blend existing stains,
digitally synthesizing new histological stains. We trained and blindly tested
this virtual-staining network using unlabeled kidney tissue sections to
generate micro-structured combinations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Jones
silver stain, and Masson's Trichrome stain. Using a single network, this
approach multiplexes virtual staining of label-free tissue with multiple types
of stains and paves the way for synthesizing new digital histological stains
that can be created on the same tissue cross-section, which is currently not

the global PES for the protonated imidazole dimer, a molecular system with $19$

from low energies ($< 10,000$ cm$^{-1}$), yielding a PES at high energies ($>

cost function approximation. The cost function is modeled as a p-median
relocation problem with minimum cost flow conservation and path-based charging
station capacities on a static node-charge graph structure. The cost function
is NP-complete, so a heuristic is proposed that ensures feasible solutions that
can be solved in an online system. The algorithm is validated in a case study
of electric carshare in Brooklyn, New York, with demand data shared from BMW
ReachNow operations in September 2017 (262 vehicle fleet, 231 pickups per day,
303 traffic analysis zones (TAZs)) and charging station location data (18
charging stations with 4 port capacities). The proposed non-myopic rebalancing
heuristic reduces the cost increase compared to myopic rebalancing by 38%.

situations where some species out-compete or dominate over some others are key
to describe natural ecosystems. Here we develop ecological theory using a
stochastic, synthetic framework for plant community assembly that leads to
predictions amenable to empirical testing. We propose two stochastic
continuous-time Markov models that incorporate competitive dominance through a
hierarchy of species heights. The first model, which is spatially implicit,
predicts both the expected number of species that survive and the conditions
under which heights are clustered in realized model communities. The second one
allows spatially-explicit interactions of individuals and alternative
mechanisms that can help shorter plants overcome height-driven competition, and
it demonstrates that clustering patterns remain not only locally but also
across increasing spatial scales. Moreover, although plants are actually
height-clustered in the spatially-explicit model, it allows for plant species
abundances not necessarily skewed to taller plants.

X-1, an
intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate, and X-2, an ultraluminous X-ray
pulsar (ULXP). Here we present a broadband X-ray spectral analysis of both
sources based on ten observations made simultaneously with Chandra and NuSTAR.
Chandra provides the high spatial resolution to resolve the crowded field in
the 0.5--8 keV band, and NuSTAR provides the sensitive hard X-ray spectral
data, extending the bandpass of our study above 10 keV. The observations, taken
in the period 2015--2016, cover a period of flaring from X-1, allowing us to
study the spectral evolution of this source with luminosity. During four of
these observations, X-2 was found to be at a low flux level, allowing an
unambiguous view of the emission from X-1. We find that the broadband X-ray
emission from X-1 is consistent with that seen in other ULXs observed in detail
with NuSTAR, with a spectrum that includes a broadened disk-like component and
a high-energy tail. We find that the luminosity of the disk scales with inner
disk temperature as L~T^-3/2 contrary to expectations of a standard accretion
disk and previous results. These findings rule out a thermal state for
sub-Eddington accretion and therefore do not support M82 X-1 as an IMBH
candidate. We also find evidence that the neutral column density of the
material in the line of sight increases with L$_X$, perhaps due to an increased
mass outflow with accretion rate. For X-2, we do not find any significant
spectral evolution, but we find the spectral parameters of the phase-averaged
broadband emission are consistent with the pulsed emission at the highest X-ray
luminosities.

such mergers are dynamically constrained by the conservation of the pertinent

tube. We also propose that in the direction perpendicular to the merging plane,
flux tubes evolve in critically-balanced fashion. These notions allow us to
construct an analytical model for how quantities such as the magnetic energy
and the energy-containing scale evolve as functions of time. Of particular
importance is the conclusion that, like its two-dimensional counterpart, this
system exhibits an inverse transfer of magnetic energy that terminates only at
the system scale. We perform direct numerical simulations that confirm these
predictions and reveal other interesting aspects of the evolution of the
system. We find, for example, that the early time evolution is characterized by
a sharp decay of the initial magnetic energy, which we attribute to the
ubiquitous formation of current sheets. We also show that a quantitatively
similar inverse transfer of magnetic energy is observed when the initial

extrapolation of both of these parameterizations to infinite width is
problematic. The standard parameterization leads to a divergent neural tangent

finite width networks such as: the dependence of training dynamics on relative

find that the vacuum energy normalized by the radius of the~$S^1$, $R$,

the renormalized 't~Hooft coupling~$\lambda_R$ as~$\Lambda\sim

these pulsations substantially modify the outer envelope's density structure

plateau observables such as the luminosity at day 50, $L_{50}$, time-integrated
shock energy $ET$, and plateau duration $t_{\rm p}$ are consistent with radial
scalings derived considering explosions of non-pulsating stars. Namely, most of
the effect of the pulsation is consistent with the behavior expected for a star
of a different size at the time of explosion. However, in the case of overtone
pulsations, the Lagrangian displacement is not monotonic. Therefore, in such
cases, excessively bright or faint SN emission at different times reflects the
underdense or overdense structure of the emitting region near the SN
photosphere.

the proposed framework, a deep neural network that is trained with available

derivatives, and the genetic algorithm is then employed to discover the
underlying PDE. Owing to the merits of the genetic algorithm, such as mutation

proposed DLGA-PDE is tested for discovery of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)

without the need for a complete candidate library, even in the presence of

spectral variability of the endmembers, what propagates significant mismodeling
errors throughout the whole unmixing process and compromises the quality of its
results. Therefore, large efforts have been recently dedicated to mitigate the
effects of spectral variability in SU. This resulted in the development of
algorithms that incorporate different strategies to allow the EMs to vary

known a priori, Bayesian, parametric, or local EM models. Each of these
approaches has different characteristics and underlying motivations. This paper
presents a comprehensive literature review contextualizing both classic and
recent approaches to solve this problem. We give a detailed evaluation of the
sources of spectral variability and their effect in image spectra. Furthermore,
we propose a new taxonomy that organizes existing works according to a

on the computational cost they require. We also review methods used to

their influence on vibrational, optical properties and carrier dynamics are
investigated. With atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy
(STEM), two stacking orders are determined as AA stacking with negligible
displacement across layers, and AB stacking with about a one-unit cell
displacement along the a axis. First-principle calculations confirm that these
two stacking orders correspond to two local energy minima. Raman spectra inform
a consistent difference of modes I & III, about 13 cm-1 for AA stacking, and 20
cm-1 for AB stacking, making a simple tool for determining the stacking orders
in ReS2. Polarized photoluminescence (PL) reveals that AB stacking possesses
blue-shifted PL peak positions, and broader peak widths, compared with AA
stacking, indicating stronger interlayer interaction. Transient transmission
measured with femtosecond pump probe spectroscopy suggests exciton dynamics
being more anisotropic in AB stacking, where excited state absorption related
to Exc. III mode disappears when probe polarization aligns perpendicular to b
axis. Our findings underscore the stacking-order driven optical properties and
carrier dynamics of ReS2, mediate many seemingly contradictory results in

ratio of light hydrocarbons confined in the nano-pores of kerogen remains
poorly understood, and consequently has engendered much debate. Towards
bringing a molecular-scale resolution to this problem, we present molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations of $^1$H NMR relaxation and diffusion of heptane in a
polymer matrix, where the high-viscosity polymer is a model for kerogen and
bitumen that provides an organic ""surface"" for heptane. We calculate the
autocorrelation function $G(t)$ for $^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole interactions of
heptane in the polymer matrix and use this to generate the NMR frequency
($f_0$) dependence of $T_1$ and $T_2$ relaxation times as a function of
$\phi_{C7}$. We find that increasing molecular confinement increases the
correlation time of the heptane molecule, which decreases the surface
relaxation times for heptane in the polymer matrix. For weak confinement
($\phi_{C7} > 50$ vol%), we find that $T_{1S}/T_{2S} \simeq 1$. Under strong
confinement ($\phi_{C7} \lesssim $ 50 vol%), we find that the ratio
$T_{1S}/T_{2S} \gtrsim 4$ increases with decreasing $\phi_{C7}$, and that the
dispersion relation $T_{1S} \propto f_0$ is consistent with previously reported
measurements of polymers and bitumen. Such frequency dependence in bitumen has
been previously attributed to paramagnetism, but our studies suggests that
$^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole interactions enhanced by organic nano-pore
confinement dominates the NMR response in saturated organic-rich shales,
without the need to invoke paramagnetism.

to automatically recognize electricity-theft behaviors. However, these methods,
which mainly assess users' electricity usage records, can be insufficient due
to the diversity of theft tactics and the irregularity of user behaviors.
  In this paper, we propose to recognize electricity-theft behavior via
multi-source data. In addition to users' electricity usage records, we analyze
user behaviors by means of regional factors (non-technical loss) and climatic
factors (temperature) in the corresponding transformer area. By conducting
analytical experiments, we unearth several interesting patterns: for instance,
electricity thieves are likely to consume much more electrical power than
normal users, especially under extremely high or low temperatures. Motivated by
these empirical observations, we further design a novel hierarchical framework
for identifying electricity thieves. Experimental results based on a real-world
dataset demonstrate that our proposed model can achieve the best performance in
electricity-theft detection (e.g., at least +3.0% in terms of F0.5) compared
with several baselines. Last but not least, our work has been applied by the

important role in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Various computer-aided
detection algorithms have been proposed for automated prostate cancer detection
by combining information from various mpMRI data components. However, there
exist other features of mpMRI, including the spatial correlation between voxels
and between-patient heterogeneity in the mpMRI parameters, that have not been
fully explored in the literature but could potentially improve cancer detection
if leveraged appropriately. This paper proposes novel voxel-wise Bayesian
classifiers for prostate cancer that account for the spatial correlation and
between-patient heterogeneity in mpMRI. Modeling the spatial correlation is
challenging due to the extreme high dimensionality of the data, and we consider
three computationally efficient approaches using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian
Process (NNGP), knot-based reduced-rank approximation, and a conditional
autoregressive (CAR) model, respectively. The between-patient heterogeneity is
accounted for by adding a subject-specific random intercept on the mpMRI
parameter model. Simulation results show that properly modeling the spatial
correlation and between-patient heterogeneity improves classification accuracy.
Application to in vivo data illustrates that classification is improved by
spatial modeling using NNGP and reduced-rank approximation but not the CAR
model, while modeling the between-patient heterogeneity does not further
improve our classifier. Among our proposed models, the NNGP-based model is
recommended considering its robust classification accuracy and high

ferromagnetic transition of FeS$_2$, a transition metal disulfide with the
pyrite structure. Using tight-binding parameters obtained from
maximally-localized Wannier functions, we calculate the magnetic susceptibility
across a wide doping range. We find that electrostatic gating requires a higher
electron concentration than the equivalent in Co doping to induce
ferromagnetism via a Stoner-like mechanism. We attribute this behavior to the
formation of a narrow Co band near the bottom of the conduction band under
chemical doping, which is absent in the electrostatic gating case. Our results
reveal that the effects of electrostatic gating go beyond a simple rigid band
shift, and highlight the importance of the changes in the crystal structure
promoted by gating.

documents. Many texts contain location information, such as city name or road

administrative area of the text and organize the hierarchy of area, called
location normalization. Existing detecting location systems either exclude
hierarchical normalization or present only a few specific regions. We propose a
system named ROIBase that normalizes the text by the Chinese hierarchical
administrative divisions. ROIBase adopts a co-occurrence constraint as the
basic framework to score the hit of the administrative area, achieves the
inference by special embeddings, and expands the recall by the ROI (region of
interest). It has high efficiency and interpretability because it mainly
establishes on the definite knowledge and has less complex logic than the
supervised models. We demonstrate that ROIBase achieves better performance
against feasible solutions and is useful as a strong support system for

these two stellar components. There is a central hard X-ray emission and an
extended soft X-ray emission that closely coincides with the ionization cone,
as seen in the [O III]$\lambda$5007 emission. The centroid of the [O
I]$\lambda$6300 emission does not coincide with the AGN, being shifted by 0.24
arcsec towards the ionization cone; this shift is probably caused by a
combination of differential dust extinction together with emission and
reflection in the ionization cone. The optical spectra extracted from the

also identify 10 H II regions, eight of them in a star forming ring that is

state-of-the-art abstractive summarization models based on encoder-decoder

summarization, especially of the length, is an important aspect for practical
applications. Previous studies on length-controllable abstractive summarization
incorporate length embeddings in the decoder module for controlling the summary
length. Although the length embeddings can control where to stop decoding, they
do not decide which information should be included in the summary within the
length constraint. Unlike the previous models, our length-controllable
abstractive summarization model incorporates a word-level extractive module in
the encoder-decoder model instead of length embeddings. Our model generates a
summary in two steps. First, our word-level extractor extracts a sequence of
important words (we call it the ""prototype text"") from the source text
according to the word-level importance scores and the length constraint.
Second, the prototype text is used as additional input to the encoder-decoder
model, which generates a summary by jointly encoding and copying words from
both the prototype text and source text. Since the prototype text is a guide to
both the content and length of the summary, our model can generate an
informative and length-controlled summary. Experiments with the CNN/Daily Mail
dataset and the NEWSROOM dataset show that our model outperformed previous
models in length-controlled settings.

polynomial channel matrix into polynomial eigenvectors and eigenvalues
matrices, then a precoder is designed based on the decomposed matrices. The
precoder acts as a filter applied to each subcarrier and to its adjacent
subcarriers. In addition, a new adaptive optimum energy algorithm is proposed
to truncate the insignificant precoder filter coefficients produced by the PEVD
algorithm and consequently reduce the computational complexity. A mathematical
model and algorithm for implementing the precoder are also presented.
Robustness of the proposed precoder has been analyzed and compared to existing

results demonstrate that the new precoder significantly outperforms the

time-convolutionless mode-coupling theory equation to study the dynamics of
glass-forming liquids. The numerical solutions are then compared with the
simulation results performed on fragile liquids and strong liquids. They are
shown to recover the simulation results in a supercooled state well within
error, except at a $\beta$-relaxation stage because of the ideal equation. A
temperature dependence of the nonlinearity $\mu$ in the memory function then
suggests that the supercooled state must be clearly separated into two
substates, a weakly supercooled state in which $\mu$ increases rapidly as $T$
decreases and a deeply supercooled state in which $\mu$ becomes constant up to
the glass transition as $T$ decreases. On the other hand, it is shown that in a
glass state $\mu$ increases rapidly as $T$ decreases, while it is constant in a
liquid state. Thus, it is emphasized that the new model for the simplified
memory function is much more reasonable than the conventional one proposed
earlier by the present author not only qualitatively but also quantitatively.

materials remains a central problem in many-particle quantum physics. A minimal
description of these systems is provided by the disordered Fermi-Hubbard model
(DFHM), which incorporates the interplay of motion in a disordered lattice with
local inter-particle interactions. Despite its minimal elements, many dynamical
properties of the DFHM are not well understood, owing to the complexity of
systems combining out-of-equilibrium behavior, interactions, and disorder in
higher spatial dimensions. Here, we study the relaxation dynamics of doubly
occupied lattice sites in the three-dimensional (3D) DFHM using
interaction-quench measurements on a quantum simulator composed of fermionic
atoms confined in an optical lattice. In addition to observing the widely
studied effect of disorder inhibiting relaxation, we find that the cooperation
between strong interactions and disorder also leads to the emergence of a
dynamical regime characterized by \textit{disorder-enhanced} relaxation. To
support these results, we develop an approximate numerical method and a
phenomenological model that each capture the essential physics of the decay
dynamics. Our results provide a theoretical framework for a previously
inaccessible regime of the DFHM and demonstrate the ability of quantum
simulators to enable understanding of complex many-body systems through minimal
models.

bright squeezed light (BSL) generator is demonstrated. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that BSL has been reported in a fiber-based system to date.
To obtain the BSL, a double-pass parametric amplifier based on surface-coated

parametric amplifier is blocked, a stable 1.85 dB squeezed vacuum is obtained.
With injected seed power of 80 {\mu}W, an output power of 18 {\mu}W and a

out-of-the-laboratory quantum technologies. Moreover, the BSL has a narrow
spectral width of 30 kHz, which is inherited from a narrow-linewidth

is significantly more stable than the known hexagonal germanene. We apply the
modern modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) and DFT1/2 schemes to obtain an accurate
band structure for our selected 2D materials. It is seen that GeO and GeC
exhibit the highest band gaps of more than 3 eV in this group of materials.
Moreover, we argue that, in contrast to the semi-metallic nature of hexagonal
germanene, the tile germanene is a very good conductor. The band edges of our
semiconducting 2D materials are accurately aligned to the vacuum level to
address the potential photocatalytic application of this system for water
splitting and carbon dioxide reduction. The optical properties, including
dielectric functions, refractive index, reflectivity, and Loss function of the
samples are investigated in the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter approach.

a standard tool for trapping and manipulating micron and submicron particles
with great success in the last decades. Although the nature of light enforces
restrictions on the minimum particle size that can be efficiently trapped due
to Abbe's diffraction limit, scientists have managed to overcome this problem
by engineering new devices that exploit near-field effects. Nowadays, metallic
nanostructures can be fabricated which, under laser illumination, produce a
secondary plasmonic field that does not suffer from the diffraction limit. This
advance offers a great improvement in nanoparticle trapping, as it relaxes the
trapping requirements compared to conventional optical tweezers. In this work,
we review the fundamentals of conventional optical tweezers, the so-called
plasmonic tweezers, and related phenomena. Starting from the conception of the
idea by Arthur Ashkin until recent improvements and applications, we present
some of the challenges faced by these techniques as well as their future
perspectives. Emphasis in this review is on the successive improvements of the
techniques and the innovative aspects that have been devised to overcome some

communities across the globe. Despite this, it is common for ERM systems to
follow myopic decision policies in the real world. Principled approaches to aid
ERM decision-making under uncertainty have been explored but have failed to be
accepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption ---
algorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident
dispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder \textit{after}
incidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates
that when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest
available responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of
planning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. This is
not a trivial planning problem --- a major challenge with dynamically balancing
the spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An
orthogonal problem in ERM systems is planning under limited communication,
which is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication
networks. We address both problems by proposing two partially decentralized
multi-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and exploit the
structure of the dispatch problem. We evaluate our proposed approach using
real-world data, and find that in several contexts, dynamic re-balancing the
spatial distribution of emergency responders reduces both the average response
time as well as its variance.

velocity to the velocity dispersion of the group,
$\sigma_{\mathrm{BGG}}/\sigma_{group}$, is on average $1.48 \pm 0.13$ for low

the {\sc Horizon-AGN} simulation reveals a similar increase in the spread of
peculiar velocities of BGGs with decreasing group mass, though consistency in
the amplitude, shape, and mode of the BGG peculiar velocity distribution is
only achieved for high mass groups. The groups hosting a BGG with a large
peculiar velocity are more likely to be offset from the $L_x-\sigma_{v}$
relation; this is probably because the peculiar motion of the BGG is influenced
by the accretion of new members.

framework of effective field theories (EFTs), from the standard model effective
field theory (SMEFT) through the low energy effective field theory (LEFT) to
chiral perturbation theory. We work to the first nontrivial orders in each
effective field theory, collect along the way the matching conditions and
renormalization group effects, and express the decay branching ratios in terms
of the Wilson coefficients associated with the dim-5 and dim-7 operators in
SMEFT. Our result is general in that it does not depend on dynamical details of
physics at a high scale that induce the effective interactions in SMEFT and in
that it does not appeal to any hadronic models. We find that the long-distance
contribution overwhelmingly dominates over the contact or short-distance one.
Assuming the new physics scale to be around a TeV, the branching ratios are
predicted to be below the current experimental upper bounds by several orders
of magnitude.

single-well harmonic potential to probe the dynamics of collective atomic
motion. The idea is to choose tunable scattering lengths through Feshbach
resonances such that the ground-state wave function for two types of the
condensates are spatially immiscible where one of the condensates, located at
the center of the potential trap, can be effectively treated as a potential
barrier between bilateral condensates of the second type of atoms. In the case
of small wave function overlap between bilateral condensates, one can
parametrize their spatial part of the wave functions in the two-mode
approximation together with the time-dependent population imbalance $z$ and the
phase difference $\phi$ between two wave functions. The condensate in the
middle can be approximated by a Gaussian wave function with the displacement of
the condensate center $\xi$. As driven by the time-dependent displacement of
the central condensate, we find the Josephson oscillations of the collective
atomic motion between bilateral condensates as well as their anharmonic
generalization of macroscopic self-trapping effects. In addition, with the
increase in the wave function overlap of bilateral condensates by properly
choosing tunable atomic scattering lengths, the chaotic oscillations are found
if the system departs from the state of a fixed point. The Melnikov approach
with a homoclinic solution of the derived $z,\,\phi$, and $\xi$ equations can
successfully justify the existence of chaos. All results are consistent with
the numerical solutions of the full time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equations.

processes of previous models. In this paper, we propose a novel generative
model for document networks by introducing random walkers on networks to
integrate the node centrality into link generation processes. The developed

several approximations, we establish a quantitative relationship between model

larger GSNR during training process leads to better generalization performance.
Moreover, we show that, different from that of shallow models (e.g. logistic

dynamics of DNNs naturally produces large GSNR during training, which is
probably the key to DNNs' remarkable generalization ability.

clone detection is still an open issue. We present semantic clone detection via
Probabilistic Software Modeling (PSM) as a robust method for detecting
semantically equivalent methods. PSM inspects the structure and runtime

Each PM in the network represents a method in the program and is capable of

accurately find semantic clones. Results show that the approach can detect
semantic clones in the complete absence of syntactic similarity with high

transport services where availability is often limited. As observed demand
cannot be higher than available supply, historical transport data typically
represents a biased, or censored, version of the true underlying demand
pattern. Without explicitly accounting for this inherent distinction,
predictive models of demand would necessarily represent a biased version of
true demand, thus less effectively predicting the needs of service users. To
counter this problem, we propose a general method for censorship-aware demand
modeling, for which we devise a censored likelihood function. We apply this
method to the task of shared mobility demand prediction by incorporating the
censored likelihood within a Gaussian Process model, which can flexibly
approximate arbitrary functional forms. Experiments on artificial and

decision). We (1) demonstrate how this framework may be used to provide
explanations for decisions made by general, data-driven AI systems that may
incorporate features with arbitrary data types and multiple predictive models,

methods that explain model predictions by weighting features according to their
importance (e.g., SHAP, LIME) and present two fundamental reasons why we should
carefully consider whether importance-weight explanations are well-suited to
explain system decisions. Specifically, we show that (i) features that have a
large importance weight for a model prediction may not affect the corresponding
decision, and (ii) importance weights are insufficient to communicate whether

overall runtime is close to linear. Consequently, our approach easily scales up
to knowledge graphs containing millions of triples. We evaluate our approach
against six state-of-the-art embedding approaches on the DrugBank and DBpedia
datasets in two series of experiments. The first series shows that the cluster
purity achieved by PYKE is up to 26% (absolute) better than that of the state

automatically detect landmark correspondences in pairs of two-dimensional (2D)

identify salient locations in images as landmarks and predict matching
probabilities for landmark pairs from two different images. We trained our
approach on 2D transverse slices from 168 lower abdominal Computed Tomography
(CT) scans. We tested the approach on 22,206 pairs of 2D slices with varying
levels of intensity, affine, and elastic transformations. The proposed approach
finds an average of 639, 466, and 370 landmark matches per image pair for
intensity, affine, and elastic transformations, respectively, with spatial
matching errors of at most 1 mm. Further, more than 99% of the landmark pairs
are within a spatial matching error of 2 mm, 4 mm, and 8 mm for image pairs
with intensity, affine, and elastic transformations, respectively. To
investigate the utility of our developed approach in a clinical setting, we
also tested our approach on pairs of transverse slices selected from follow-up

matches in both bony anatomical regions as well as in soft tissues lacking
prominent intensity gradients.

MIMO systems assume time-division duplexing mode, although frequency-division
duplexing (FDD) systems dominate current wireless standards. The key challenges
in FDD massive MIMO systems are channel-state information (CSI) acquisition and
feedback overhead. To address these challenges, we exploit the so-called angle
reciprocity of multipath components in the uplink and downlink, so that the
required CSI acquisition overhead scales only with the number of served users,
and not the number of AP antennas nor APs. We propose a low complexity
multipath component estimation technique and present linear angle-of-arrival
(AoA)-based beamforming/combining schemes for FDD-based cell-free massive MIMO
systems. We analyze the performance of these schemes by deriving closed-form
expressions for the mean-square-error of the estimated multipath components, as
well as expressions for the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency. Using
semi-definite programming, we solve a max-min power allocation problem that
maximizes the minimum user rate under per-user power constraints. Furthermore,
we present a user-centric (UC) AP selection scheme in which each user chooses a
subset of APs to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system.
Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed multipath component estimation
technique outperforms conventional subspace-based and gradient-descent based
techniques. We also show that the proposed beamforming and combining techniques
along with the proposed power control scheme substantially enhance the spectral
and energy efficiencies with an adequate number of antennas at the APs.

""photochromatic images"" he produced raised several questions, among which the
photochromic nature of the sensitized layer. Here, we present the first
characterization of the sensitized layer created at the surface of a silver
plate or a silver foil according to Becquerel's process, which
XIX$^{\text{th}}$ century scientists called ""silver photochloride"". It is
constituted by silver nanoparticles dispersed in a micrometric silver chloride
grains matrix. It is thus similar to the widely studied Ag/AgCl composites,
which suggests new synthesis routes for these photocatalysts. The chemical
composition of the sensitized layer has been identified by complementary
spectroscopies (EDX, XPS, HAXPES and EXAFS), while its morphology has been
studied by electron microscopies (SEM and STEM). These techniques involve X-ray
or electron beams, which can have an impact on the silver chloride-based
sensitized layer; a large part of this article hence introduces a study of the
beam effects and of the way of reducing them.

Various part-based methods have been extensively proposed for learning local
representations, which, however, are still inferior to the best-performing
methods for person re-identification. This paper proposes to construct a strong
lightweight network architecture, termed PLR-OSNet, based on the idea of
Part-Level feature Resolution over the Omni-Scale Network (OSNet) for achieving
feature diversity. The proposed PLR-OSNet has two branches, one branch for
global feature representation and the other branch for local feature
representation. The local branch employs a uniform partition strategy for
part-level feature resolution but produces only a single identity-prediction
loss, which is in sharp contrast to the existing part-based methods. Empirical
evidence demonstrates that the proposed PLR-OSNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance on popular person Re-ID datasets, including Market1501,
DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03, despite its small model size.

The nucleus brightened by more than 1 magnitude in the Gaia G-band over a
timescale of less than one year, before fading back to its pre-outburst state
over the following three years. The optical spectra of the source show broad
Balmer lines similar to the ones present in a pre-outburst spectrum. During the

not many papers consider edge computing in the novel context of wireless

computation tasks to the edge server located at the AP to reduce the associated

adjusts the IRS to maximize its earning while maintaining MDs' incentives for
offloading and guaranteeing each MD a customized information rate. This problem
can be formulated into a difficult optimization problem, which has a
sum-of-ratio objective function as well as a bunch of nonconvex constraints. To
solve this problem, we first develop an iterative evaluation procedure to
identify the feasibility of the problem when confronting an arbitrary set of

the problem being feasible and provides a feasible solution. Based on that we
develop an algorithm to optimize the objective function. Our numerical results
show that the presence of IRS enables the AP to guarantee higher information
rate to all MDs and at the same time improve the earning of the edge server.

SGX LibOSes support multitasking both securely and efficiently.
  This paper presents Occlum, a system that enables secure and efficient

Multi-Domain SFI (MMDSFI) and leverage MMDSFI to enforce the isolation of SIPs.
We also design an independent verifier to ensure the security guarantees of
MMDSFI. With SIPs safely sharing the single address space of an enclave, the
LibOS can implement multitasking efficiently. The Occlum LibOS outperforms the
state-of-the-art SGX LibOS on multitasking-heavy workloads by up to 6,600X on

inner radii and accretion rate of the disk are taken into account. In fact, the
frequency varies just as the dynamic frequency (i.e. the inverse of the sound

individual molecular clouds are not dominated by self-gravity but also track a
component that originates with orbital motion in the potential of the host
galaxy. This agrees with observed cloud line widths, which show systematic
variations from virial motions with environment, pointing at the influence of
the galaxy potential. In this paper, we hypothesize that these motions act to
slow down the collapse of gas and so help regulate star formation. Extending
the results of Meidt et al. (2018), we derive a dynamical collapse timescale
that approaches the free-fall time only once the gas has fully decoupled from
the galactic potential. Using this timescale we make predictions for how the
fraction of free-falling, strongly self-gravitating gas varies throughout the
disks of star-forming galaxies. We also use this collapse timescale to predict
variations in the molecular gas star formation efficiency, which is lowered
from a maximum, feedback-regulated level in the presence of strong coupling to
the galactic potential. Our model implies that gas can only decouple from the
galaxy to collapse and efficiently form stars deep within clouds. We show that
this naturally explains the observed drop in star formation rate per unit gas

lower bounds on the entropy production rate using only the mean and the
variance of fluctuating currents. Since the TURs do not refer to the full
details of the stochastic dynamics, it would be promising to apply the TURs for
estimating the entropy production rate from a limited set of trajectory data
corresponding to the dynamics. Here we investigate a theoretical framework for
estimation of the entropy production rate using the TURs along with machine
learning techniques without prior knowledge of the parameters of the stochastic
dynamics. Specifically, we derive a TUR for the short-time region and prove
that it can provide the exact value, not only a lower bound, of the entropy
production rate for Langevin dynamics, if the observed current is optimally
chosen. This formulation naturally includes a generalization of the TURs with
the partial entropy production of subsystems under autonomous interaction,
which reveals the hierarchical structure of the estimation. We then construct
estimators on the basis of the short-time TUR and machine learning techniques
such as the gradient ascent. By performing numerical experiments, we
demonstrate that our learning protocol performs well even in nonlinear Langevin
dynamics. We also discuss the case of Markov jump processes, where the exact
estimation is shown to be impossible in general. Our result provides a platform
that can be applied to a broad class of stochastic dynamics out of equilibrium,
including biological systems.

unpaired spins at the resonating hexagons, whose origin is solely related to
the opposite signs of intracluster and intercluster hoppings, in contrast to

Extreme Helium Stars (EHes). Overabundance of fluorine is a characteristic
feature for cool EHes and R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars and further enforces
their close connection. For hot EHes this relationship with the cooler EHes,
based on their fluorine abundance is unexplored. We present in this paper the
first abundance estimates of fluorine determined from singly ionised fluorine
lines (F\,{\sc ii}) for 10 hot EHe stars from optical spectra. Fluorine
abundances were determined using the F\,{\sc ii} lines in two windows centered
at 3505 \AA \ and 3850 \AA . Six of the 10 stars show significant enhancement
of fluorine similar to the cool EHes. Two carbon-poor hot EHes show no
signature of fluorine and have a significant low upper limit for the F
abundance. These fluorine abundances are compared with the other elemental
abundances observed in these stars which provide an idea about the formation
and evolution of these stars. The trends of fluorine with C, O, and Ne show
that significant helium burning after a CO-He white dwarf merger can account
for a majority of the observed abundances. Predictions from simulations of
white dwarf mergers are discussed in light of the observed abundances.

channel is investigated. The OWPN channel is a discrete-time point-to-point
channel with a multi-sample receiver in which the channel output is affected by
both additive and multiplicative noise. The additive noise is a white standard
Gaussian process while the multiplicative noise is a Wiener phase noise
process. This channel generalizes a number of channel models previously studied
in the literature which investigate the effects of phase noise on the channel
capacity, such as the Wiener phase noise channel and the non-coherent channel.
We derive upper and inner bounds to the capacity of OWPN channel: (i) an upper
bound is derived through the I-MMSE relationship by bounding the Fisher
information when estimating a phase noise sample given the past channel outputs
and phase noise realizations, then (ii) two inner bounds are shown: one relying
on coherent combining of the oversampled channel outputs and one relying on
non-coherent combining of the samples. After capacity, we study generalized
degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the OWPN channel for the case in which the
oversampling factor grows with the average transmit power $P$ as $P$? and the
frequency noise variance as $P^{\alpha}$?. Using our new capacity bounds, we
derive the GDoF region in three regimes: regime (i) in which the GDoF region
equals that of the classic additive white Gaussian noise (for $\beta \leq 1$),
one (ii) in which GDoF region reduces to that of the non-coherent channel (for
$\beta \geq \min \{\alpha,1\}$) and, finally, one in which partially-coherent
combining of the over-samples is asymptotically optimal (for $2 \alpha-1\leq
\beta \leq 1$). Overall, our results are the first to identify the regimes in
which different oversampling strategies are asymptotically optimal.

evaluate them on several common applications from machine learning and
high-performance computing. The proposed schemes are inspired by
error-correcting codes and employ parallel encoding and decoding over the data
stored in the cloud using serverless workers. This creates a fully distributed
computing framework without using a master node to conduct encoding or
decoding, which removes the computation, communication and storage bottleneck
at the master. On the theory side, we establish that our proposed scheme is
asymptotically optimal in terms of decoding time and provide a lower bound on
the number of stragglers it can tolerate with high probability. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our scheme outperforms existing schemes
such as speculative execution and other coding theoretic methods by at least

Degree of Concentration (i.e., the degree to which retweets concentrate on a

Degree of Originality and relatively high Degree of Concentration are observed
to be at greater risk of becoming unstable due to the potential disappearance

height of the steps to be crossed. When a growing graphene flake reaches a
monoatomic step, it extends jointly with the underlying Ni layer; for higher Ni
edges, a different process, involving step retraction and graphene landing,
becomes active. At step bunches, the latter mechanism leads to a peculiar
'staircase formation' behavior, where terraces of equal width form under the
overgrowing graphene, driven by a balance in the energy cost between C-Ni bond
formation and stress accumulation in the carbon layer. Our results represent a
step towards bridging the material gap in searching new strategies and methods

due to multiple band degeneracy are usually neglected in the thermoelectric
community. In this work, we investigate the (thermo)electric properties of
non-polar monolayer $\beta$- and $\alpha$-antimonene considering full mode- and
momentum-resolved electron-phonon interactions. We also analyze thoroughly the
selection rules on electron-phonon matrix-elements using group-theory
arguments. Our calculations reveal strong intervalley scattering between the
nearly degenerate valley states in both $\beta$- and $\alpha$-antimonene, and
the commonly-used deformation potential approximation neglecting the dominant
intervalley scattering gives inaccurate estimations of the electron-phonon
scattering and thermoelectric transport properties. By considering full
electron-phonon interactions based on the rigid-band approximation, we find
that, the maximum value of the thermoelectric figure of merits $zT$ at room
temperature reduces to 0.37 in $\beta$-antimonene, by a factor of 5.7 comparing
to the value predicted based on the constant relaxation-time approximation
method. Our work not only provides an accurate prediction of the thermoelectric
performances of antimonenes that reveals the key role of intervalley
scatterings in determining the electronic part of zT, but also showcases a
computational framework for thermoelectric materials.

attracted increasing attention in recent years. A typical OAD system mainly
consists of three modules: a frame-level feature extractor which is usually
based on pre-trained deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a temporal
modeling module, and an action classifier. Among them, the temporal modeling
module is crucial which aggregates discriminative information from historical
and current features. Though many temporal modeling methods have been developed
for OAD and other topics, their effects are lack of investigation on OAD
fairly. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive study on temporal modeling
for OAD including four meta types of temporal modeling methods, \ie temporal
pooling, temporal convolution, recurrent neural networks, and temporal
attention, and uncover some good practices to produce a state-of-the-art OAD
system. Many of them are explored in OAD for the first time, and extensively
evaluated with various hyper parameters. Furthermore, based on our
comprehensive study, we present several hybrid temporal modeling methods, which
outperform the recent state-of-the-art methods with sizable margins on
THUMOS-14 and TVSeries.

changes in the X-ray brightness and spectra were common. The INTEGRAL
monitoring campaign detected spectacular Eddington-limited X-ray flares, but
also rapid variations at much lower flux levels. On 2015 June 21 at 20 h 50
min, the 3-10 keV JEM-X data as well as simultaneous optical data started to
display a gradual brightening from one of these low-flux states. This was
followed 15 min later by an order-of-magnitude increase of flux in the 20-40
keV IBIS/ISGRI light curve in just 15 s. The best-fitting model for both the
pre- and post-transition spectra required a Compton-thick partially covering
absorber. The absorber parameters remained constant, but the spectral slope
varied significantly during the event, with the photon index decreasing from
$\Gamma \approx 3.7$ to $\Gamma \approx 2.3$. We propose that the rapid 20-40
keV flux increase was either caused by a spectral state transition that was
hidden from our direct view, or that there was a sudden reduction in the amount
of Compton down-scattering of the primary X-ray emission in the disk outflow.

it is found that the DM relic density can significantly exclude the free

eXtreme (HIX) galaxy sample. HIX galaxies host at least 2.5 times more atomic
gas (HI) than expected from their optical R-band luminosity. Previous
examination of their star formation activity and HI kinematics suggested that
these galaxies stabilise their large HI discs (radii up to 94 kpc) against star
formation due to their higher than average baryonic specific angular momentum.
A comparison to semi-analytic models further showed that the elevated baryonic
specific angular momentum is inherited from the high spin of the dark matter
host. In this paper we now turn to the gas-phase metallicity as well as stellar
and ionised gas kinematics in HIX galaxies to gain insights into recent
accretion of metal-poor gas or recent mergers. We compared the stellar,
ionised, and atomic gas kinematics, and examine the variation in the gas-phase
metallicity throughout the stellar disc of HIX galaxies. We find no indication
for counter-rotation in any of the components, the central metallicities tend
to be lower than average, but as low as expected for galaxies of similar HI
mass. Metallicity gradients are comparable to other less HI-rich, local star
forming galaxies. We conclude that HIX galaxies show no conclusive evidence for
recent major accretion or merger events. Their overall lower metallicities are
likely due to being hosted by high spin halos, which slows down their evolution
and thus the enrichment of their interstellar medium.

sensitive to the number of contributing bands even when the corresponding
excitation gaps are degenerate and cannot be distinguished. In particular, we
find that the crossover between superconductivity types I and II - the

condensates with diverse characteristic lengths coexisting in one system

to synchronize their clocks. For such observers, speed of light is a constant
by construction. However, one can use super-translations to change coordinates
from Einstein to BMS coordinates. From the point of view of BMS observers,
speed of light is not a constant all over the space-time and in all directions.
So in general, clocks which are synchronized for Einstein observers are not
synchronized for BMS observers, and vice versa. Based on this fact, we propose
a local observable for detecting the soft hairs, which is the variations in
speed of light for such observers. We also investigate the relation of this
observable to gravitational memory, which is a permanent change of position of
test particles at infinity, after a gravitational wave passes completely from
them. It is shown that the BMS time coordinate is the physical time after a
gravitational wave, and it is the legitimate time to be used to calculate the
light speed. Based on this argument, the analysis predicts a permanent change
in the speed of light rays which propagate in asymptotics after a gravitational
wave. Moreover, it is explained how this change is related to the gravitational
memory by comparing their significance in observations.

We consider a setting recently introduced for ontology-based data access, based

are annotated with provenance tokens. A consequence inherits the provenance of
the axioms involved in deriving it, yielding a provenance polynomial as an
annotation. We analyse the semantics for the ELHr case and show that the
presence of conjunctions poses various difficulties for handling provenance,
some of which are mitigated by assuming multiplicative idempotency of the

query answering.

generation of non-thermal high energy particles during solar flares is an
important open problem in solar physics. Magnetic reconnection plays a
fundamental role in the energy release and conversion processes taking place
during flares. A common approach for investigating particle acceleration is to
use test particles in fields derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations
of reconnection. These MHD simulations use anomalous resistivities that are
much larger than the Spitzer resistivity based on Coulomb collisions. The
processes leading to enhanced resistivity should also affect the test
particles. We explore the link between resistivity and particle orbits building
on a previous study using a 2D MHD simulation of magnetic reconnection. This
paper extends the previous investigation to a 3D magnetic reconnection
configuration and to study the effect on test particle orbits. We carried out
orbit calculations using a 3D MHD simulation of separator reconnection. We use
the relativistic guiding centre approximation including stochastic pitch angle
scattering. The effects of varying the resistivity and the models for pitch
angle scattering on particle orbit trajectories, final positions, energy
spectra, final pitch angle distribution, and orbit duration are all studied in
detail. Pitch angle scattering widens collimated beams of orbit trajectories,
allowing orbits to access previously unaccessible field lines; this causes
final positions to spread to topological structures that were previously
inaccessible. Scattered orbit energy spectra are found to be predominantly
affected by the level of anomalous resistivity, with the pitch angle scattering
model only playing a role in isolated cases. Scattering is found to play a
crucial role in determining the pitch angle and orbit duration distributions.

Lie group representations, 2-vector spaces and the tangent and the cotangent

geometric models for some kind of representations of Lie algebroids
(groupoids), namely 2-term representations up to homotopy. Finally, it is well
known that Lie groupoids are ""concrete"" incarnations of differentiable stacks,
hence VB-groupoids can be considered as representatives of vector bundles over
differentiable stacks, and VB-algebroids their infinitesimal versions. In this
work, we attach to every VB-algebroid and VB-groupoid a cochain complex
controlling its deformations, their linear deformation complex. Moreover, the
deformation complex of a VB-algebroid is equipped with a DGLA structure. The
basic properties of these complexes are discussed: their relationship with the
deformation complexes of the total spaces and the base spaces, particular cases
and generalizations. The main theoretical results are a linear van Est theorem,
that gives conditions for the linear deformation cohomology of a VB-groupoid to
be isomorphic to that of the corresponding VB-algebroid, and a Morita
invariance theorem, that implies that the linear deformation cohomology of a
VB-groupoid is really an algebraic invariant of the associated vector bundle of
differentiable stacks. Finally, several examples are discussed, showing how the
linear deformation cohomologies are related to other well-known cohomologies.

receivers for multidimensional overloaded NOMA systems. The framework is built
upon a novel compressive sensing (CS) regularized maximum likelihood
formulation of the discrete-input detection problem, in which the L0-norm is
introduced to enforce adherence of the solution to the prescribed discrete
symbol constellation. Unlike much of preceding literature, the method is not
relaxed into the L1-norm, but rather approximated with a continuous and
asymptotically exact expression without resorting to parallel interference
cancellation. The objective function of the resulting formulation is thus a sum
of concave-over-convex ratios, which is then tightly convexized via the
quadratic transform, such that its solution can be obtained via the iteration
of a simple closed-form expression that closely resembles that of the classic
zero-forcing (ZF) receiver. By further transforming the aforementioned problem
into a quadratically constrained quadratic program with one convex constraint
(QCQP-1), the optimal regularization parameter to be used at each step of the
iterative algorithm is then shown to be the largest generalized eigenvalue of a
pair of matrices which are given in closed-form. The method so obtained,
referred to as the IDLS, is then extended to address several factors of
practical relevance, such as noisy conditions, imperfect CSI, and hardware
impairments, thus yielding the Robust IDLS algorithm. Simulation results show
that the proposed art significantly outperforms both classic receivers, such as
the LMMSE, and recent CS-based alternatives, such as the SOAV and the SCSR
detectors.

flame-acoustic interactions during different dynamical states associated with
the longitudinal mode of the combustor. We simultaneously measure the acoustic
pressure and CH* chemiluminescence emission of the flame using a high-speed
camera. Upon increasing the equivalence ratio, the combustor undergoes the
following sequence of transition: combustion noise (CN) to low amplitude
longitudinal thermoacoustic instability (TAI) through the state of
intermittency (INT), and from low amplitude to high amplitude longitudinal TAI
through a secondary bifurcation. We report the first evidence of secondary
bifurcation from low amplitude TAI to high amplitude TAI for a turbulent
thermoacoustic system which allows us to test the flame response at two
different amplitude of perturbation in a natural setting. We find a significant
difference in the dynamics of the flame interactions during the periodic part
of intermittency and low and high amplitude TAI. Specifically, during the
periodic part of intermittency, the phase difference between the local heat
release rate (HRR) measured from various burners show significant phase slips
in time. During low amplitude TAI, there are fewer phase slips among the HRR
response of the burners, which result in a state of weak synchronization among
the flames. During high amplitude TAI, we find that the flames are in perfect
synchrony amongst themselves and with the pressure fluctuations. We then
quantify the degree of temporal and spatial synchronization between different
flames, and flames and pressure fluctuations using the Kuramoto order parameter
and the phase-locking value. We show that synchronization theory can be
conveniently used to characterize and quantify flame-acoustic interactions in
an annular combustor.

the reliability of dimensionality identification is therefore highly important.
In this work, we find that the existence of self-penetrating nets may lead to
incorrect results by previous methods. In stead of this, we use the quotient
graph to analysis the topologies of structures and compute their
dimensionalities. Based on the quotient graph, we can calculate not only the
dimensionality but also the multiplicity of self-penetrating structures. As a
demonstration, we screened the Crystallography Open Database using our method

dynamical system, from demonstrations of an expert regulating the system. The
standard approach to this problem is policy fitting, which fits a linear policy
by minimizing a loss function between the demonstrations and the policy's
outputs plus a regularization function that encodes prior knowledge. Despite
its simplicity, this method fails to learn policies with low or even finite
cost when there are few demonstrations. We propose to add an additional
constraint to policy fitting, that the policy is the solution to some LQR
problem, i.e., optimal in the stochastic control sense for some choice of
quadratic cost. We refer to this constraint as a Kalman constraint. Policy
fitting with a Kalman constraint requires solving an optimization problem with
convex cost and bilinear constraints. We propose a heuristic method, based on
the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), to approximately solve
this problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that adding the Kalman
constraint allows us to learn good, i.e., low cost, policies even when very few

at the foundations of AI. Recent efforts have shown various methods for
providing explanations. These approaches can be broadly divided into two
schools: those that provide a local and human interpreatable approximation of a
machine learning algorithm, and logical approaches that exactly characterise
one aspect of the decision. In this paper we focus upon the second school of
exact explanations with a rigorous logical foundation. There is an
epistemological problem with these exact methods. While they can furnish
complete explanations, such explanations may be too complex for humans to
understand or even to write down in human readable form. Interpretability
requires epistemically accessible explanations, explanations humans can grasp.
Yet what is a sufficiently complete epistemically accessible explanation still
needs clarification. We do this here in terms of counterfactuals, following
[Wachter et al., 2017]. With counterfactual explanations, many of the
assumptions needed to provide a complete explanation are left implicit. To do
so, counterfactual explanations exploit the properties of a particular data
point or sample, and as such are also local as well as partial explanations. We
explore how to move from local partial explanations to what we call complete
local explanations and then to global ones. But to preserve accessibility we
argue for the need for partiality. This partiality makes it possible to hide
explicit biases present in the algorithm that may be injurious or unfair.We
investigate how easy it is to uncover these biases in providing complete and
fair explanations by exploiting the structure of the set of counterfactuals
providing a complete local explanation.

evolution calculations with abundance variations representative of first and
second populations in GCs. From this we built synthetic chromosome maps for a
mixture of stars of different chemical compositions. We subsequently replaced a
fraction of stars with binaries, or stars with chromospheric emission, using
synthetic spectroscopy. We studied how the position of stars is affected in the
chromosome map. Binaries can, in principle, explain the extension of the first
population in the chromosome map. However, we find that given the binary
fraction reported for GCs, the density of stars in the extended part is too
small. Another difficulty of the binary explanation is that the shape of the
distribution of the first population in the chromosome map is different in
clusters with similar binary fractions. Additionally, we find that the
contribution of chromospheric emission lines to the HST photometry is too small
to have an observable impact on the shape of the chromosome map. Continuum
chromospheric emission has an effect qualitatively similar to binaries. We
conclude that binaries do have an impact on the morphology of the chromosome
map of GCs, but they are unlikely to explain entirely the shape of the extended
distribution of the first population stars. Uncertainties in the properties of
continuum chromospheric emission of stars in GCs prevent any quantitative
conclusion. Therefore, the origin of the extended first population remains
unexplained.

of the Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres which follow from work of M.~Katz and
(2) characterization (rigidity) results for spheres in terms of their
Vietoris-Rips persistence barcodes which follow from work of F.~Wilhelm.

dual-wavelength lasing via two distinct strategies. First, by using particle

selected individually using a linear polarizer. Second, by adjusting the

presence of a resonant circumsolar ring of dust associated with Venus. Attempts
to model this phenomenon as an analogue to the resonant ring of Earth - as a
result of migrating dust trapped in external mean-motion resonances (MMRs) -
have so far been unable to reproduce the observed dust feature. Other theories
of origin have recently been put forward. However, the reason for the low
trapping efficiency of Venus's external MMRs remains unclear. Aims. Here we
look into the nature of the dust trapping resonant phenomena that arise from
the multi-planet configuration of the inner Solar System, aiming to add to the
existent understanding of resonant dust rings in single planet systems.
Methods. We numerically modelled resonant dust features associated with the
inner planets and specifically looked into the dependency of these structures
and the trapping efficiency of particular resonances on the configuration of
planets. Results. Besides Mercury showing no resonant interaction with the
migrating dust cloud, we find Venus, Earth, and Mars to considerably interfere
with each other's resonances, influencing their ability to form circumsolar
rings. We find that the single most important reason for the weakness of
Venus's external MMR ring is the perturbing influence of its outer neighbour -
Earth. In addition, we find Mercury and Mars to produce crescent-shaped density
features, caused by a directed apsidal precession occurring in particles
traversing their orbital region.

on challenging tasks such as link prediction and node clustering. Graph AE, VAE
and most of their extensions rely on multi-layer graph convolutional networks
(GCN) encoders to learn vector space representations of nodes. In this paper,
we show that GCN encoders are actually unnecessarily complex for many
applications. We propose to replace them by significantly simpler and more
interpretable linear models w.r.t. the direct neighborhood (one-hop) adjacency
matrix of the graph, involving fewer operations, fewer parameters and no
activation function. For the two aforementioned tasks, we show that this
simpler approach consistently reaches competitive performances w.r.t. GCN-based
graph AE and VAE for numerous real-world graphs, including all benchmark
datasets commonly used to evaluate graph AE and VAE. Based on these results, we
also question the relevance of repeatedly using these datasets to compare
complex graph AE and VAE.

by our group over the last few years, in which gravity is modified at
cosmological distances by the introduction of nonlocal terms, assumed to emerge
at an effective level from the infrared behavior of the quantum theory. The
requirement of producing a viable cosmology turns out to be very stringent and
basically selects a unique model, in which the nonlocal term describes an
effective mass for the conformal mode. We discuss how such a specific structure
could emerge from a fundamental local theory of gravity, and we perform a
detailed comparison of this model with the most recent cosmological datasets,
confirming that it fits current data at the same level as $\Lambda$CDM.
  Most notably, the model has striking predictions in the sector of tensor
perturbations, leading to a very large effect in the propagation of
gravitational wave (GWs) over cosmological distances. At the redshifts relevant
for the next generation of GW detectors such as Einstein Telescope, Cosmic
Explorer and LISA, this leads to deviations from GR that could be as large as
$80\%$, and could be verified with the detection of just a single coalescing
binary with electromagnetic counterpart. This would also have potentially
important consequences for the search of the counterpart since, for a given
luminosity distance to the source, as inferred through the GW signal, the
actual source redshift could be significantly different from that predicted by
$\Lambda$CDM. At the redshifts relevant for advanced LIGO/Virgo/Kagra the
effect is smaller, but still potentially observable over a few years of runs at
target sensitivity.

Euclidean domain, recent years have seen a surge of interest in developing
neural networks for graphs and data supported on graphs. The graph is leveraged
at each layer of the neural network as a parameterization to capture detail at
the node level with a reduced number of parameters and computational
complexity. Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a general framework
that unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept
of EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use
different parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors. By
extrapolating this strategy to more iterations between neighboring nodes, the
EdgeNet learns edge- and neighbor-dependent weights to capture local detail.
This is a general linear and local operation that a node can perform and
encompasses under one formulation all existing graph convolutional neural
networks (GCNNs) as well as graph attention networks (GATs). In writing
different GNN architectures with a common language, EdgeNets highlight specific
architecture advantages and limitations, while providing guidelines to improve
their capacity without compromising their local implementation. An interesting
conclusion is the unification of GCNNs and GATs -- approaches that have been so
far perceived as separate. In particular, we show that GATs are GCNNs on a
graph that is learned from the features. This particularization opens the doors
to develop alternative attention mechanisms for improving discriminatory power.

outcomes or events. Typically, prognostic CPMs are derived to predict the risk
of a single future outcome. However, with rising emphasis on the prediction of
multi-morbidity, there is growing need for CPMs to simultaneously predict risks
for each of multiple future outcomes. A common approach to multi-outcome risk
prediction is to derive a CPM for each outcome separately, then multiply the
predicted risks. This approach is only valid if the outcomes are conditionally
independent given the covariates, and it fails to exploit the potential
relationships between the outcomes. This paper outlines several approaches that
could be used to develop prognostic CPMs for multiple outcomes. We consider
four methods, ranging in complexity and assumed conditional independence
assumptions: namely, probabilistic classifier chain, multinomial logistic
regression, multivariate logistic regression, and a Bayesian probit model.
These are compared with methods that rely on conditional independence: separate
univariate CPMs and stacked regression. Employing a simulation study and
real-world example via the MIMIC-III database, we illustrate that CPMs for
joint risk prediction of multiple outcomes should only be derived using methods
that model the residual correlation between outcomes. In such a situation, our
results suggest that probabilistic classification chains, multinomial logistic
regression or the Bayesian probit model are all appropriate choices. We call
into question the development of CPMs for each outcome in isolation when
multiple correlated or structurally related outcomes are of interest and
recommend more holistic risk prediction.

and becoming both highly accurate and hardware friendly. With carefully
designed patterns, the proposed pruning unprecedentedly and consistently
achieves accuracy enhancement and better feature extraction ability on
different DNN structures and datasets, and our pattern-aware pruning framework
also achieves pattern library extraction, pattern selection, pattern and
connectivity pruning and weight training simultaneously. Our approach on the
new pattern-based sparsity naturally fits into compiler optimization for highly
efficient DNN execution on mobile platforms. To the best of our knowledge, it
is the first time that mobile devices achieve real-time inference for the
large-scale DNN models thanks to the unique spatial property of pattern-based
sparsity and the help of the code generation capability of compilers.

of smart devices are deployed in a variety of environments aiming to improve
the quality of human life in a cost efficient way. Due to the increasingly
serious aging problem around the world, smart homes for elder healthcare have
become an important IoT-based application, which not only enables elders'
health to be properly monitored and taken care of, but also allows them to live
more comfortably and independently in their houses. However, elders' privacy
might be disclosed from smart homes due to non-fully protected network
communication. To show that elders' privacy could be substantially exposed, in
this paper we develop a Privacy Deduction Scheme (PDS for short) by
eavesdropping sensor traffic from a smart home to identify elders' movement
activities and speculating sensor locations in the smart home based on a series
of deductions from the viewpoint of an attacker. The experimental results based
on sensor datasets from real smart homes demonstrate the effectiveness of PDS
in deducing and disclosing elders' privacy, which might be maliciously
exploited by attackers to endanger elders and their properties.

distribution which cannot be described by parametric approaches. In order to
overcome the problem, an innovative framework called Data-Driven Kernel
Stochastic Programming (DDKSP) that integrates a non-parametric approach -
kernel density estimation (KDE) and a two-stage stochastic programming (SP)
model is proposed. Specifically, the probability distributions are derived from
historical data by KDE, which are used as the input uncertain parameters for
SP. Additionally, the CSRP is formulated as a two-stage SP model. Meanwhile, a
Monte Carlo method called sample average approximation (SAA) and Benders
decomposition algorithm are introduced to solve the large-scale optimization
model. Finally, the numerical experimental validations which are based on New
York taxi trip data sets show that the proposed framework outperforms the pure
parametric approaches including Gaussian, Laplace and Poisson distributions
with 3.72% , 4.58% and 11% respectively in terms of overall profits.

pay her bill by using a passive wearable device that forces a scan of your
credit card without your awareness. An important assumption of today's
Near-field Communication (NFC) enabled cards is the limited communication range
between the commercial reader and the NFC cards -- a distance below 5~cm.
Previous approaches to attacking this assumption effectively use mobile phones
and active relays to enlarge the communication range, in order to attack the
NFC cards. However, these approaches require a power supply at the adversary
side, and can be easily localized when mobile phones or active relays transmit
NFC signals.
  We propose ReCoil, a system that uses wearable passive relays to attack NFC
cards by expanding the communication range to 49.6 centimeters, a ten-fold
improvement over its intended commercial distance. ReCoil is a magnetically
coupled resonant wireless power transfer system, which optimizes the energy
transfer by searching the optimal geometry parameters. Specifically, we first
narrow down the feasible area reasonably and design the ReCoil-Ant Colony
Algorithm such that the relays absorb the maximum energy from the reader. In
order to reroute the signal to pass over the surface of human body, we then
design a half waist band by carefully analyzing the impact of the distance and
orientation between two coils on the mutual inductance. Then, three more coils
are added to the system to keep enlarging the communication range. Finally,
extensive experiment results validate our analysis, showing that our passive
relays composed of common copper wires and tunable capacitors expand the range
of NFC attacks to 49.6 centimeters.

explore the future decision space over several decades in order to deliver
policy-relevant insights. EEO models are a critical tool for decision-makers
who must make near-term decisions with long-term effects in the face of large
future uncertainties. While the number of model-based analyses proliferates,
insufficient attention is paid to transparency in model development and
application. Given the complex, data-intensive nature of EEO models and the
general lack of access to source code and data, many of the assumptions
underlying model-based analysis are hidden from external observers. This paper
discusses the simplifications and subjective judgments involved in the model
building process, which cannot be fully articulated in journal papers, reports,
or model documentation. In addition, we argue that for all practical purposes,
EEO model-based insights cannot be validated through comparison to real world
outcomes. As a result, modelers are left without credible metrics to assess a
model's ability to deliver reliable insight. We assert that EEO models should
be discoverable through interrogation of publicly available source code and
data. In addition, third parties should be able to run a specific model
instance in order to independently verify published results. Yet a review of
twelve EEO models suggests that in most cases, replication of model results is
currently impossible. We provide several recommendations to help develop and
sustain a software framework for repeatable model analysis.

training data for neural networks used for action categorization. Motivated by
the fact that texture and background of a video play little to no significant
roles in optical flow, we generated simplified texture-less and background-less
videos and utilized the synthetic data to train a Temporal Segment Network
(TSN). The results demonstrated that augmenting TSN with simplified synthetic
data improved the original network accuracy (68.5%), achieving 71.8% on HMDB-51
when adding 4,000 videos and 72.4% when adding 8,000 videos. Also, training
using simplified synthetic videos alone on 25 classes of UCF-101 achieved
30.71% when trained on 2500 videos and 52.7% when trained on 5000 videos.
Finally, results showed that when reducing the number of real videos of UCF-25
to 10% and combining them with synthetic videos, the accuracy drops to only
85.41%, compared to a drop to 77.4% when no synthetic data is added.

key aspect of the language is the level of abstraction it uses, which allows
scalable and compact hierarchical specification of biochemical entities. This
abstraction enables unique analysis techniques to reason about properties of
models written in the language on the semantic and syntactic level.

  chaotic systems",,,,,"eess.SP cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a hybrid method combining the deep long short-term memory (LSTM)
model with the inexact empirical model of dynamical systems to predict
high-dimensional chaotic systems. The deep hierarchy is encoded into the LSTM
by superimposing multiple recurrent neural network layers and the hybrid model
is trained with the Adam optimization algorithm. The statistical results of the
Mackey-Glass system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system are obtained under the
criteria of root mean square error (RMSE) and anomaly correlation coefficient
(ACC) using the singe-layer LSTM, the multi-layer LSTM, and the corresponding
hybrid method, respectively. The numerical results show that the proposed
method can effectively avoid the rapid divergence of the multi-layer LSTM model
when reconstructing chaotic attractors, and demonstrate the feasibility of the
combination of deep learning based on the gradient descent method and the
empirical model.

  Diseases",,,,,"cs.SD cs.LG eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper presents a robust deep learning framework developed to detect
respiratory diseases from recordings of respiratory sounds. The complete
detection process firstly involves front end feature extraction where
recordings are transformed into spectrograms that convey both spectral and
temporal information. Then a back-end deep learning model classifies the
features into classes of respiratory disease or anomaly. Experiments, conducted
over the ICBHI benchmark dataset of respiratory sounds, evaluate the ability of
the framework to classify sounds. Two main contributions are made in this
paper. Firstly, we provide an extensive analysis of how factors such as
respiratory cycle length, time resolution, and network architecture, affect
final prediction accuracy. Secondly, a novel deep learning based framework is
proposed for detection of respiratory diseases and shown to perform extremely
well compared to state of the art methods.

demonstrate this for a homogeneous road section using simulated vehicle
trajectories and then validate it using real-world data from NGSIM. Our results
show that with probe vehicle penetration levels as low as 5\%, the proposed
estimation method can provide a sound reconstruction of macroscopic traffic
speeds and reproduce realistic shockwave patterns, implying applicability in a
variety of traffic conditions. We further discuss the model's reconstruction
mechanisms and confirm its ability to differentiate various traffic behaviors
such as congested and free-flow traffic states, transition dynamics, and
shockwave propagation.

is limited by the speed of non-adiabatic dynamics.
