walk to other classes following a transition distribution which is named a
noise model. Well-studied noise models are all instance-independent, namely,
the transition depends only on the original label but not the instance itself,
and thus they are less practical in the wild. Fortunately, methods based on
instance-dependent noise have been studied, but most of them have to rely on
strong assumptions on the noise models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce
confidence-scored instance-dependent noise (CSIDN), where each instance-label
pair is equipped with a confidence score. We find with the help of confidence
scores, the transition distribution of each instance can be approximately
estimated. Similarly to the powerful forward correction for
instance-independent noise, we propose a novel instance-level forward
correction for CSIDN. We demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our
method through multiple experiments under synthetic label noise and real-world
unknown noise.

perform Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) analysis by using observational Hubble
data obtained from cosmic chronometric (CC) technique, cosmic microwave
background (CMB) baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), Pantheon compilation of
Supernovae type Ia (SNIa), their joint combination and a Gaussian prior on the
Hubble parameter $H_{0}$. It is obtained that the combination of all databases
plus $H_{0}$ prior marginalized over a present dark energy density gives
stringent constraints on the current value of coupling as $-0.001<\delta<0.041$

$\omega^{X}\approx -1$ and $\delta(\delta_{0})\approx 0$ which indicate that

in constant coupling model $(H_{0}=73.9^{+1.5}_{-0.95},

deflected in a gravitational field. In this work we apply the perturbative
method developed in Ref. \cite{Jia:2020dap} to compute the deflection angle of
both null and timelike rays in the weak field limit for four spacetimes. We
obtained the deflection angles for the Bardeen spacetime to the eleventh order
of $m/b$ where $m$ is the ADM mass and $b$ is the impact parameter, and for the
Hayward, Janis-Newman-Winicour and Einstein-Born-Infeld spacetimes to the
ninth, seventh and eleventh order respectively. The effect of the impact
parameter $b$, velocity $v$ and spacetime parameters on the deflection angle
are analyzed in each of the four spacetimes. It is found that in general, the
perturbative deflection angle depends on and only on the asymptotic behavior of
the metric functions, and in an order-correlated way. Moreover, it is shown
that although these deflection angles are calculated in the large $b/m$ limit,
their minimal valid $b$ can be as small as a few $m$'s as long as the order is
high enough. At these impact parameters, the deflection angle itself is also
found large. As velocity decreases, the deflection angle in all spacetime
studied increases. For a given $b$, if the spacetime parameters allows a
critical velocity $v_c$, then the perturbative deflection angle will deviate
from its true value as $v$ decreases to $v_c$. It is also found that if the
variation of spacetime parameters can only change the spacetime qualitatively
at small but not large radius, then these spacetime parameter will not cause a
qualitative change of the deflection angle, although its value is still
quantitatively affected. The application and possible extension of the work are

many integral aspects, and also a universal two-term tradeoff between task
performance and complexity, provides two feasible perspectives. In this thesis,
I address several key questions in some aspects of intelligence, and study the
phase transitions in the two-term tradeoff, using strategies and tools from
physics and information. Firstly, how can we make the learning models more
flexible and efficient, so that agents can learn quickly with fewer examples?
Inspired by how physicists model the world, we introduce a paradigm and an AI
Physicist agent for simultaneously learning many small specialized models
(theories) and the domain they are accurate, which can then be simplified,
unified and stored, facilitating few-shot learning in a continual way.
Secondly, for representation learning, when can we learn a good representation,
and how does learning depend on the structure of the dataset? We approach this
question by studying phase transitions when tuning the tradeoff hyperparameter.
In the information bottleneck, we theoretically show that these phase
transitions are predictable and reveal structure in the relationships between
the data, the model, the learned representation and the loss landscape.
Thirdly, how can agents discover causality from observations? We address part
of this question by introducing an algorithm that combines prediction and
minimizing information from the input, for exploratory causal discovery from
observational time series. Fourthly, to make models more robust to label noise,
we introduce Rank Pruning, a robust algorithm for classification with noisy
labels. I believe that building on the work of my thesis we will be one step
closer to enable more intelligent machines that can make sense of the world.

by solving empirically-adjusted estimating equations, or explicitly, by
subtracting the estimated bias from the original $M$-estimates, and applies to
models that are partially- or fully-specified, with either likelihoods or other
surrogate objectives. Automatic differentiation can be used to abstract away
the only algebra required to implement reduced-bias $M$-estimation. As a
result, the bias reduction methods we introduce have markedly broader
applicability with more straightforward implementation and less algebraic or
computational effort than other established bias-reduction methods that require
resampling or evaluation of expectations of products of log-likelihood
derivatives. If $M$-estimation is by maximizing an objective, then there always
exists a bias-reducing penalized objective. That penalized objective relates
closely to information criteria for model selection, and can be further
enhanced with plug-in penalties to deliver reduced-bias $M$-estimates with
extra properties, like finiteness in models for categorical data. The
reduced-bias $M$-estimators have the same asymptotic distribution as the
original $M$-estimators, and, hence, standard procedures for inference and
model selection apply unaltered with the improved estimates. We demonstrate and
assess the properties of reduced-bias $M$-estimation in well-used, prominent

equidimensional projective variety of dimension $d$. For a given $k \leq d +
1$, we are interested in the study of the variety of $k$-secants. The classical
trisecant lemma just considers the case where $k = 3$ while elsewhere the case
$k = d + 2$ is considered. Secants of order from $4$ to $d + 1$ provide service
for our main result. In this paper, we prove that if the variety of $k$-secants
($k \leq d + 1$) satisfies the three following conditions: (i) trough every
point in $X$, passes at least one $k$-secant, (ii) the variety of $k$-secant
satisfies a strong connectivity property that we defined in the sequel, (iii)
every $k$-secant is also a ($k+1$)-secant, then the variety $X$ can be embedded
into $P^{d+1}$. The new assumption, introduced here, that we called strong
connectivity is essential because a naive generalization that does not
incorporate this assumption fails as we show in some example. The paper
concludes with some conjectures concerning the essence of the strong
connectivity assumption.

diffusive processes. On reaching the inner disk, these perturbations can change
the disk luminosity, which in turn, can change the wind mass loss rate,
$\dot{M}_w$. It has been argued that this so-called ""wind driven relaxation
cycle"" might explain the observed variability in some disk accreting objects.
Here, we study the response of the innermost mass accretion rate $\dot{M}_a$ to
the loss of matter at different rates and radii. We allow the wind launching
radius, $R_L$, to scale with $\dot{M}_a$. We computed a grid of time-dependent
models for various $\dot{M}_w$-$\dot{M}_a$ and $R_{L}$-$\dot{M}_a$
dependencies. We find that the disk behaviour significantly differs for the
'variable $R_L$' case compared to the 'fixed $R_L$' case. In particular, much
stronger winds are required to destabilize the disk in the former than the
latter case. However, the $\dot{M}_a$ amplitude does not grow significantly
even for unstable cases because the oscillations saturate at a low level either
due to disk depletion or due to the wind being launched at very small radii, or
both. This result implies that disk winds are unlikely to be responsible for
state transitions as those require large changes in the inner disk. Despite
modest changes at the inner disk regions, the disk surface density at large
radii can vary with a large amplitude, i.e., from 0 to a few factors of the
steady state value. This dramatic variation of the outer disk could have
observable consequences.

with problems having a sparse reward. In the default configuration of the
OpenAI baseline and environment the reward function is calculated using the
distance between the target location and the robot end-effector. By weighting
the cost based on the distance of the end-effector from the goal in the x,y and

Grundy in 1939, Grundy Coloring has been examined for its structural and
algorithmic aspects. A brute-force $f(k)n^{2^{k-1}}$-time algorithm for Grundy
Coloring on general graphs is not difficult to obtain, where $k$ is the number
of colors required by the most adversarial vertex ordering. It was asked
several times whether the dependency on $k$ in the exponent of $n$ can be
avoided or reduced, and its answer seemed elusive until now. We prove that
Grundy Coloring is W[1]-hard and the brute-force algorithm is essentially
optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, thus settling this question by
the negative.

the half-graphs, we also prove that b-Chromatic Core is W[1]-hard, whose

Inclination effects lead to various morphological features, including
filamentary streams of gas stripped from the smaller galactic disc. The offset
of disc centres at impact determines whether or not these streams flow in a
single direction or multiple directions, even transverse to the motion of the
two galaxies. We also find that, across many types of direct collision,
independent of the inclination or offset, the distributions of weighted Mach
numbers and shock velocities in colliding clouds relax to a very similar form.
There is good evidence of prolonged turbulence in the gas of each splash bridge

reconstruct full images from under-sampled k-space data. However, these
algorithms are inadequate for two main reasons. Firstly, aliasing artifacts
generated in the image domain are structural and non-local, so that sole image
domain restoration is insufficient. Secondly, though MRI comprises multiple
protocols during one exam, almost all previous studies only employ the
reconstruction of an individual protocol using a highly distorted undersampled
image as input, leaving the use of fully-sampled short protocol (say T1) as
complementary information highly underexplored. In this work, we address the
above two limitations by proposing a Dual Domain Recurrent Network (DuDoRNet)

accelerating the acquisition of MRI with a long imaging protocol. Specifically,
a Dilated Residual Dense Network (DRDNet) is customized for dual domain

validated on clinical X-ray images, achieving accurate performance on both

is nearly perfect throughout the population except at point defects that carry
half-integer topological charge. We observe that new cell layers preferentially
form at the position of +1/2 defects, whereas holes preferentially open at -1/2
defects. To explain these findings, we model the bacterial colony as an
extensile active nematic fluid with anisotropic friction. In agreement with our
experimental measurements, this model predicts an influx of cells toward +1/2

observe that for these systems diffusive thermal transport is controlled by a
universal Planckian time scale $\tau\sim \hbar/k_BT$, and a unique velocity
$v_E$. Specifically, $v_E \approx v_{ph} $ for complex insulators, and $v_{ph}

Several alternative formulations are discussed involving time-homogenous cost

i.e., an index coding problem where a user can be satisfied by decoding any
message that is not in its side information set, where communication is
decentralized, i.e., it occurs among users rather than by the central server,
and secure, i.e., each user is allowed to decode only one message outside its
side information set and must not be able to collect any information about any
other message that is not its decoded one. Given the difficulty of the general
version of this problem, this paper focuses on the case where the side
information sets are `$s$~circular shifts', namely, user $u$'s side information
set is the set of messages indexed by $\{u, u+1, \ldots, u+s-1\}$ for some
fixed $s$ and where the indices are intended modulo the cardinality of the
message set. This particular setting has been studied in the `decentralized
non-secure' and in the `centralized secure' settings, thus allows one to
quantify the cost of decentralized communication under security constraints on
the number of transmissions. Interestingly, the decentralized vs the
centralized secure setting incurs a multiplicative gap of approximately~three.
This is in contrast to the cases without security constraint, where the
multiplicative gap is known to be at most two.

use error correcting codes (ECCs) to protect the weights. Different from
classic error correction in data storage, the optimization objective is to
optimize the NeuralNet's performance after error correction, instead of
minimizing the Uncorrectable Bit Error Rate in the protected bits. That is, by
seeing the NeuralNet as a function of its input, the error correction scheme is
function-oriented. A main challenge is that a deep NeuralNet often has millions
to hundreds of millions of weights, causing a large redundancy overhead for
ECCs, and the relationship between the weights and its NeuralNet's performance
can be highly complex. To address the challenge, we propose a Selective

show that the associated flux rope is of low inclination (roughly oriented in
the east-west direction), which enables the associated shock to extend to the

flux rope leg to infer that the high-energy protons must be precipitating
between the flux rope leg and the shock front. The durations of the
SOL2014-09-01 SGRE event and the type II radio burst agree with the linear
relationship between these parameters obtained for other SGRE events with
duration exceeding 3 hrs. The fluence spectrum of the SEP event is very hard,
indicating the presence of high-energy (GeV) particles in this event. This is
further confirmed by the presence of an energetic coronal mass ejection (CME)
with a speed more than 2000 km/s, similar to those in ground level enhancement
(GLE) events. The type II radio burst had emission components from metric to
kilometric wavelengths as in events associated with GLE events. All these

along with the strong field confinement stemming from its plasmonic behavior,
can be utilized to enhance several relative weak nonlinear effects at infrared
(IR) and terahertz (THz) frequencies. Towards this goal, various nonlinear
graphene metasurfaces are presented in this work to effectively increase the
efficiency of different optical nonlinear effects and, as a result, decrease
the required input intensity needed to be excited. In particular, we will show
that the efficiency of four-wave mixing (FWM) can be improved by several orders
of magnitude by using a nonlinear metasurface composed of patterned graphene
ribbons, a dielectric interlayer, and a metallic reflector acting as substrate.
We also demonstrate that the self-phase modulation (SPM) nonlinear process can
be enhanced by using an alternative graphene nonlinear metasurface, operating
as coherent perfect absorber, leading to a pronounced shift in the resonant
frequency of the coherent perfect absorption (CPA) effect of this structure as
the input intensity of the impinging incident waves is increased. This property
will provide a robust mechanism to dynamically tune and switch the CPA process.
Furthermore, it will be presented that strong negative reflection and
refraction can be achieved by a single graphene monolayer film due to the
enhancement of another nonlinear process, known as phase conjugation. This
nonlinear process is envisioned to be used in the construction of a perfect

referring to the correct input source. To inspire studies in this area, Wiseman
et al. (2017) introduced the RotoWire corpus on generating NBA game summaries
from the box- and line-score tables. However, limited attempts have been made
in this direction and the challenges remain. We observe a prominent bottleneck
in the corpus where only about 60% of the summary contents can be grounded to
the boxscore records. Such information deficiency tends to misguide a
conditioned language model to produce unconditioned random facts and thus leads
to factual hallucinations. In this work, we restore the information balance and
revamp this task to focus on fact-grounded data-to-text generation. We
introduce a purified and larger-scale dataset, RotoWire-FG (Fact-Grounding),

attract more research focuses in this direction. Moreover, we achieve improved
data fidelity over the state-of-the-art models by integrating a new form of

the utility function so that the optimal decision of an individual can be

effective solution in this complex domain represents a ""wicked design"" problem,
requiring a careful balance between trade-offs associated with drone autonomy

needs of different stakeholders. This paper focuses on designing for
situational awareness (SA) using a scenario-driven, participatory design

SA demons, and three new demons of importance to our domain. We then used these
SA cards to equip domain experts with SA knowledge so that they could more

reduce the total amount of artificial neural network parameters, an
auto-encoder network composed of these two types of network is designed as a
symmetrical parameter sharing structure. Second, this autoencoder network and a
pair of scalar quantizers are simultaneously learned in an end-to-end
self-supervised way. Third, considering the variation in the image spatial
distribution, each scalar quantizer is accompanied by an importance-indicator
map to generate MD tensors, rather than using direct quantization. Fourth, we
introduce the multiple description structural similarity distance loss, which
implicitly regularizes the diversified multiple description generations, to
explicitly supervise multiple description diversified decoding in addition to
MD reconstruction loss. Finally, we demonstrate that our MDC framework performs
better than several state-of-the-art MDC approaches regarding image coding

object viewpoint morphing. In this paper, we aim at transforming an image with
a fine-grained category to synthesize new images that preserve the identity of

recognition and few-shot learning tasks. The generated images, transformed with
large geometric deformation, do not necessarily need to be of high visual

To this end, we adopt a model based on generative adversarial networks to
disentangle the identity related and unrelated factors of an image. In order to
preserve the fine-grained contextual details of the input image during the
deformable transformation, a constrained nonalignment connection method is
proposed to construct learnable highways between intermediate convolution
blocks in the generator. Moreover, an adaptive identity modulation mechanism is
proposed to transfer the identity information into the output image
effectively. Extensive experiments on the CompCars and Multi-PIE datasets
demonstrate that our model preserves the identity of the generated images much
better than the state-of-the-art image-to-image transformation models, and as a
result significantly boosts the visual recognition performance in fine-grained

strategy with hard and soft attention modules to solve the segmentation

the hard-attention module generates coarse segmentation map using
multi-atlas-based method and the VoxelMorph tool, which guides subsequent
segmentation process and improves its robustness; 2) the soft-attention module
incorporates position attention to capture precise context information, which
further improves the segmentation accuracy; 3) we validate our method by
segmenting insula, thalamus and many other regions-of-interests (ROIs) that are
critical to quantify brain MR images of hydrocephalus patients in real clinical
scenario. The proposed method achieves much improved robustness and accuracy
when segmenting all 17 consciousness-related ROIs with high variations for

equals the intersection of annihilators of bounded weight
$\mathfrak{g}(2n)$-modules. To every primitive ideal $I$ of
$\mathfrak{g}(\infty)$ we attach a unique irreducible coherent local system of
bounded ideals, which is an analog of a coherent local system of
finite-dimensional modules, as introduced earlier by A. Zhilinskii. As a
result, primitive ideals of $U(\mathfrak{g}(\infty))$ are parametrized by
triples $(x,y,Z)$ where $x$ is a nonnegative integer, $y$ is a nonnegative
integer or half-integer, and $Z$ is a Young diagram. In the case of
$\mathfrak{o}(\infty)$, each primitive ideal is integrable, and our
classification reduces to a classification of integrable ideals going back to
A. Zhilinskii, A. Penkov and I. Petukhov. In the case of
$\mathfrak{sp}(\infty)$, only 'half' of the primitive ideals are integrable,
and nonintegrable primitive ideals correspond to triples $(x,y,Z)$ where $y$ is

Such effects are highly sensitive to the interfacial electronic properties,
such as electron wave function overlap and band alignment. The recent emergence
of van der Waals (vdW) magnets enables the possibility of tuning proximity
effects via designing heterostructures with atomically clean interfaces. In
particular, atomically thin CrI3 exhibits layered antiferromagnetism, where
adjacent ferromagnetic monolayers are antiferromagnetically coupled. Exploiting
this magnetic structure, we uncovered a layer-resolved magnetic proximity
effect in heterostructures formed by monolayer WSe2 and bi/trilayer CrI3. By
controlling the individual layer magnetization in CrI3 with a magnetic field,
we found that the spin-dependent charge transfer between WSe2 and CrI3 is
dominated by the interfacial CrI3 layer, while the proximity exchange field is
highly sensitive to the layered magnetic structure as a whole. These properties
enabled us to use monolayer WSe2 as a spatially sensitive magnetic sensor to
map out layered antiferromagnetic domain structures at zero magnetic field as
well as antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic domains near the spin-flip transition
in bilayer CrI3. Our work reveals a new way to control proximity effects and

localised Majorana bound states at the chain ends or dispersing chiral Majorana
modes at the island's boundary. Yet some of these experiments have not reached
the spectral resolution to clearly distinguish between topological Majorana and
trivial Shiba states due to very small superconducting gap sizes and
experiments performed at sub-Kelvin temperatures. Here we consider
superconducting substrates with unconventional spin-singlet pairing, including
high-temperature d-wave and extended s-wave superconductors. We derive
topological phase diagrams and compute edge states for cylinder and island

topological superconducting phases of the Zhang-Kane-Mele type are found and
discussed. Moreover, we study one-dimensional MSH structures and show that
parameters to realize topologically non-trivial magnetic chains embedded into a

on each transmitter's rate matches the MolavianJazi-Laneman bound (2015) in its
first- and second-order terms, improving the remaining terms to
$\frac12\frac{\log n}{n}+O \left(\frac 1 n \right)$ bits per channel use. The
result then extends to a RAC model in which neither the encoders nor the
decoder knows which of $K$ possible transmitters are active. In the proposed
rateless coding strategy, decoding occurs at a time $n_t$ that depends on the
decoder's estimate $t$ of the number of active transmitters $k$. Single-bit
feedback from the decoder to all encoders at each potential decoding time
$n_i$, $i \leq t$, informs the encoders when to stop transmitting. For this RAC
model, the proposed code achieves the same first-, second-, and third-order
performance as the best known result for the Gaussian MAC in operation.

ADCs) have attracted considerable attention in efforts to reduce power
consumption in millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO systems. This paper
presents an information-theoretic analysis with capacity bounds for classes of
linear transceivers with quantization. The transmitter modulates symbols via a
unitary transform followed by a DAC and the receiver employs an ADC followed by
the inverse unitary transform. If the unitary transform is set to an FFT
matrix, the model naturally captures filtering and spectral constraints which
are essential to model in any practical transceiver. In particular, this model
allows studying the impact of quantization on out-of-band emission constraints.
In the limit of a large random unitary transform, it is shown that the effect
of quantization can be precisely described via an additive Gaussian noise
model. This model in turn leads to simple and intuitive expressions for the
power spectrum of the transmitted signal and a lower bound to the capacity with
quantization. Comparison with non-quantized capacity and a capacity upper bound
that does not make linearity assumptions suggests that while low resolution
quantization has minimal impact on the achievable rate at typical parameters in
5G systems today, satisfying out-of-band emissions are potentially much more of
a challenge.

extended Thomas-Fermi calculations using the density functional BSk24 are
performed for cylindrical and plate-like cells. Unlike in our spherical-cell
calculations, we do not include shell and pairing corrections, but there are
grounds for expecting these corrections for pasta to be significantly smaller.
It is therefore meaningful to compare the ETF pasta results with the full
spherical-cell results, i.e., with shell and pairing corrections included.
However, in view of the many previous studies in which shell and pairing
corrections were omitted entirely, it is of interest to compare our pasta
results with the ETF part of the corresponding spherical calculations. Making
this latter comparison we find that as the density increases the cell shapes
pass through the usual sequence sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ plate before the
transition to the homogeneous core. The filling fractions found at the phase
transitions are in close agreement with expectations based on the liquid-drop
model. On the other hand, when we compare with the full spherical-cell results,
we find the sequence to be sphere $\to$ cylinder $\to$ sphere $\to$ cylinder
$\to$ plate. In neither case do any ""inverted"", i.e., bubble-like,
configurations appear. We provide accurate fitting formulas to all our
essential numerical results for each of the three phases, designed especially
for the density range where the nonspherical shapes are expected, which enable
one to capture not only the general behavior of the fitted functions, but also
the differences between them in different phases.

they include general approaches such as using the rate-distortion curve, as
well as more specific notions, such as the Renyi information dimension (RID).
The RID parameter indicates the concentration of the measure around
lower-dimensional subsets of the space. While the evaluation of such
compressibility parameters is well-studied for continuous and discrete
measures, the case of discrete-continuous measures is quite subtle. In this
paper, we focus on a class of multi-dimensional random measures that have
singularities on affine lower-dimensional subsets. This class of distributions
naturally arises when considering linear transformation of component-wise
independent discrete-continuous random variables. To measure the
compressibility of such distributions, we introduce the new notion of
dimensional-rate bias (DRB) which is closely related to the entropy and
differential entropy in discrete and continuous cases, respectively. Similar to
entropy and differential entropy, DRB is useful in evaluating the mutual
information between distributions of the aforementioned type. Besides the DRB,
we also evaluate the the RID of these distributions. We further provide an
upper-bound for the RID of multi-dimensional random measures that are obtained
by Lipschitz functions of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random
variables ($\mathbf{X}$). The upper-bound is shown to be achievable when the
Lipschitz function is $A \mathbf{X}$, where $A$ satisfies
{\changed$\spark({A_{m\times n}}) = m+1$} (e.g., Vandermonde matrices). When
considering discrete-domain moving-average processes with non-Gaussian
excitation noise, the above results allow us to evaluate the block-average RID
and DRB, as well as to determine a relationship between these parameters and
other existing compressibility measures.

valuable information and has been considered as a powerful tool for the
diagnosis of tumor tissue. We propose a non-staining, non-invasive and in-vivo
cancer diagnosis technique using an endoscope equipped with circularly
polarized light-emitting diodes (spin-LEDs). We studied the scattering process
of the circularly polarized light against cell nuclei in pseudo-healthy and
cancerous tissues using the existing Monte Carlo method. The calculation
results indicate that the resultant circular polarizations of light scattered
in pseudo tissues shows clear difference in a wide range of detection angle,
and the sampling depth depends on those detection angles. The structure of the
endoscope probe comprising spin-LEDs is designed based on the calculation
results, providing structural and depth information regarding biological
tissues simultaneously.

Remarkably, the study and classification of all flat Riemannian metrics on the

of equipment maintenance, especially for offshore wind farms. How to reduce the
maintenance cost, and hence increase profitability, is this article's focus. It
presents a binary linear optimization model whose solution may suggest the wind
turbine owners which components, and when, should undergo the next preventive
maintenance (PM) replacements. The suggested short-term scheduling strategy
takes into account eventual failure events of the multi-component system, in
that after the failed system is repaired, the previously scheduled PM plan
should be updated, assuming that the restored components are as good as new.
  The optimization algorithm of this paper, NextPM, is tested through numerical
case studies applied to a four component model of a wind turbine. The first
study addresses the important case of a single component system, used for
parameter calibration purposes. The second study analyses the case of seasonal
variations of mobilization costs, as compared to the constant mobilization cost
setting. Among other things, this analysis reveals a 35% cost reduction
achieved by the NextPM model, as compared to the pure corrective maintenance
(CM) strategy. %In these two case studies, the costs are reduced by around. The
third case study compares the NextPM model with another optimization model -
the preventive maintenance scheduling problem with interval costs (PMSPIC),
which was the major source of inspiration for this article. This comparison
demonstrates that the NextPM model is accurate and much faster in terms of
computational time.

of choice for many important problems in theoretical computer science. A
notorious one is controller synthesis, which can be rephrased through the
game-theoretic metaphor as the quest for a winning strategy of the system in a
game against its antagonistic environment. Depending on the specification,
optimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use
(possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which
settings allow for simple strategies.
  In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of
preference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game
objectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the
last fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community
toward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or
infinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers
of the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal
strategies still elude us.
  In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference
relations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory,
generalizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We
also prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical
interest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory
strategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player
games. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the
literature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory
(e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives),
and paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded
energy objectives).

tackle a challenging task of few-shot action recognition from videos. We build
on a C3D encoder for spatio-temporal video blocks to capture short-range action
patterns. Such encoded blocks are aggregated by permutation-invariant pooling
to make our approach robust to varying action lengths and long-range temporal
dependencies whose patterns are unlikely to repeat even in clips of the same
class. Subsequently, the pooled representations are combined into simple
relation descriptors which encode so-called query and support clips. Finally,
relation descriptors are fed to the comparator with the goal of similarity
learning between query and support clips. Importantly, to re-weight block
contributions during pooling, we exploit spatial and temporal attention modules
and self-supervision. In naturalistic clips (of the same class) there exists a
temporal distribution shift--the locations of discriminative temporal action
hotspots vary. Thus, we permute blocks of a clip and align the resulting
attention regions with similarly permuted attention regions of non-permuted
clip to train the attention mechanism invariant to block (and thus long-term
hotspot) permutations. Our method outperforms the state of the art on the
HMDB51, UCF101, miniMIT datasets.

  $\Delta$(1232) degrees of freedom",,,,,"nucl-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For the first time, elastic pion-nucleon scattering is analyzed in the
framework of chiral perturbation theory up to fourth order with explicit
$\Delta$ degrees of freedom. The analysis is performed within the heavy-baryon
expansion as well as in a covariant approach based on an extended on-mass-shell
renormalization scheme. The renormalization of low-energy constants in both
chiral approaches is discussed in detail and the explicit expressions to cancel
both power-counting breaking as well as decoupling breaking terms are given.
The low-energy constants from the $2\pi \bar{N}N$ interaction as well as
additional constants from the $\Delta$ sector are reliably constrained by fits
to experimental data. The traditional $K$-matrix unitarization is employed in
the near threshold region, whereas a complex mass approach is used to extend
the applicability of the theory up to the $\Delta$ pole region. Additionally,
we estimate a theoretical error based on the truncation of the chiral series as
employed in recent analyses of nuclear forces as well as pion-nucleon
scattering. The obtained results provide a clear evidence that the explicit
inclusion of $\Delta$ degrees of freedom is fundamental to describe
pion-nucleon physics at threshold. The resulting predictions for the
subthreshold and threshold parameters as well as phase shifts are in excellent
agreement with the ones determined by the recent Roy-Steiner analysis of
pion-nucleon scattering.

An external force is assumed to have zero mean, even so, induced perturbations
form a steady-state, which provides angular momentum transfer to the periphery
of the flow. The most effective scenario is based on the transient
amplification of induced vortices with the following emission of shearing sound
wave, wherein the maximum of the flux linearly depends on Reynolds number. Thus
such a mechanism is significant for astrophysical flows, for which enormous
Reynolds numbers are typical. At the same time, addressing the problem
analytically, we found that for incompressible fluid in the shearing box
approximation stochastic forcing does not lead to average angular momentum
transfer. Thus the compressibility of the fluid plays an important role here,
and one cannot neglect it.

paraphrase, children learn the concept of tiger from a few of actual examples

coverage in the elevation of up to 30{\deg} without using phase shifters. This
equips the proposed MIMO with a superior advantage of being an attractive low
cost technology for 5G and mm-wave applications. The proposed MIMO antennas
operate at the 28 GHz 5G band, with wide bandwidth performance exceeds 4 GHz
and with beam switching ability of up to 30{\deg} in the elevation plane. The
direction of the main beam of the single element antenna in the MIMO is steered
over the entire bandwidth through introducing a 3D printed walls with different
heights on the side of the 3D printed radiating antenna. Unlike all other
available beam steering techniques; the proposed wall is not only able to
change the direction of the beam of the antenna, but also it is able to
increase the overall directivity and gain of the proposed antenna and MIMO at
the same time over the entire bandwidth.

result, the SK scheme fails when implemented with low precision variables,

  Radio Networks",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Broadcasting in wireless networks is vulnerable to adversarial jamming. To
thwart such behavior, \emph{resource competitive analysis} is proposed. In this
framework, sending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot
costs one unit of energy. The adversary can employ arbitrary strategy to
disrupt communication, but has a limited energy budget $T$. The honest nodes,
on the other hand, aim to accomplish broadcast while spending only $o(T)$.
Previous work has shown, in a $C$-channels network containing $n$ nodes, for
large $T$ values, each node can receive the message in $\tilde{O}(T/C)$ time,
while spending only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n})$ energy. However, these
multi-channel algorithms only work for certain values of $n$ and $C$, and can
only tolerate an oblivious adversary.
  In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds for broadcasting in
multi-channel radio networks, from the perspective of resource competitiveness.
Our algorithms work for arbitrary $n,C$ values, require minimal prior
knowledge, and can tolerate a powerful adaptive adversary. More specifically,
in our algorithms, for large $T$ values, each node's runtime is $O(T/C)$, and
each node's energy cost is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n})$. We also complement
algorithmic results with lower bounds, proving both the time complexity and the
energy complexity of our algorithms are optimal or near-optimal (within a
poly-log factor). Our technical contributions lie in using ""epidemic broadcast""
to achieve time efficiency and resource competitiveness, and employing coupling
techniques in the analysis to handle the adaptivity of the adversary. At the
lower bound side, we first derive a new energy complexity lower bound for
1-to-1 communication in the multi-channel setting, and then apply simulation
and reduction arguments to obtain the desired result.

augmented Lagrangian due to Fortin appears in the subproblem. The remarkable
property of the augmented Lagrangian over the standard Lagrangian is that it is
always differentiable, and it is often semismoothly differentiable. This fact
allows us to employ a nonsmooth Newton method for computing an approximation to
the subproblem. The proximal term serves as the regularization of the objective
function and guarantees the solvability of the Newton system without assuming
strong convexity on the objective function. We exploit the theory of the

Each task can be served via three mechanisms, i.e., local computing with local
caching, local computing without local caching and computing at the MEC server.
To minimize the average bandwidth, we formulate the joint caching and computing
optimization problem under the latency, cache size and average power
constraints. We derive the closed-form expressions for the optimal policy and
the minimum bandwidth. The tradeoff among communications, computing and caching
is illustrated both analytically and numerically, which provides insightful

3+1 dimensional topologically massive model (TMM). This model contains equally
massive non-Abelian gauge fields without spontaneous symmetry breaking. In
earlier works, the bulk viscosity was found from the trace anomaly in massless
$\phi^4$ model and Yang-Mills (YM) theory and its dependence on the quantum
corrections was established. In TMM, the trace anomaly is absent due to the
presence of kinetic term of a two-form field $B$ in the action. This model also
provides the dependence of bulk viscosity on the mass of the gauge bosons. The
mass of the gauge bosons in TMM acts as magnetic mass in the perturbative
thermal field theory. This magnetic mass is gauge independent unlike what is
found in massless YM theory. The ratio of bulk viscosity and entropy density vs
temperature is plotted which shows the required behaviour near critical point.
We also observe that the strong coupling constant has the same behaviour at
high energy limit (i.e. asymptotic freedom) as that of massless YM theory at
zero temperature.

find that MDW and PEW respectively have different roles: magnetically driven
wind ejects materials from an inner disk in the early phase, whereas
photoevaporation has a dominant role in the late phase in the outer

MDW, PEW, and viscous accretion, shows a large variation of $\sim1$-$20\,$Myr;
the gas is dispersed mainly by the MDW and the PEW in the cases with a low

  governing microstructure evolution in materials: Inference over sparse and

materials physics, developmental biology and ecology, among many others. The
physics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded
by partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden
physics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying
such systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer
Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we
extend our variational system identification methods to address the challenges
presented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are
formally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time
intervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be
tracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving
microstructure in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern
evolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time
instants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales
that dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for
evolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from
different physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated,
sparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make
judicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the
dynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a
minimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a
confirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the
inferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that
reflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.

study the effect of stress-diffusion interactions in an elastoplastic material

local concentration in a one way coupled system, and vice versa in a two way
coupled system. The time-dependent transient coupled system is solved using a
finite element formulation in an open-source finite element solver FEniCS. This
paper attempts to computationally study the interaction of deformation and
diffusion and its effect on the localization of plastic strain. We investigate
the role of geometric discontinuities in scenarios involving diffusing species,
namely, a plate with a notch/hole/void and particle with a void/hole/core. We
also study the effect of stress concentrations and plastic yielding on the
diffusion-deformation. The developed code can be from

systematic approach on how to compute the explicit forms of the functions in

these functions only depends on a basis of the functions from $\Z_N$ to $\Z_q$
and representatives in the equivalent class of Butson-type Hadamard (BH)
matrices. Especially, the realization of Golay pairs from the our general form
exactly coincides with the standard Golay pairs. The realization of ternary

of the quaternary complementary sequences of size 4, almost all the sequences
derived here are never reported before. Generalized seed PU matrices and the
recursive constructions of the desired PU matrices are also studied, and a
large number of new constructions of CSSs and CCCs are given accordingly. From
the perspective of this paper, all the known results of CSSs and CCCs with

Model Order Reduction (PMOR) methodology for the problem of changing well
locations in an oil field, that can eventually be used for well placement
optimization to gain significant computational savings. In this work, we
propose a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) based PMOR strategy that is
non-intrusive to the simulator source code and hence extends its applicability
to any commercial simulator. The non-intrusiveness of the proposed technique
stems from formulating a novel Machine Learning (ML) based framework used with
POD. The features of ML model are designed such that they take into
consideration the temporal evolution of the state solutions and thereby
avoiding simulator access for time dependency of the solutions. We represent
well location changes as a parameter by introducing geometry-based features and
flow diagnostics inspired physics-based features. An error correction model
based on reduced model solutions is formulated later to correct for
discrepancies in the state solutions at well gridblocks. It was observed that
the global PMOR could predict the overall trend in pressure and saturation
solutions at the well blocks but some bias was observed that resulted in
discrepancies in prediction of quantities of interest (QoI). Thus, the error
correction model that considers the physics based reduced model solutions as
features, proved to reduce the error in QoI significantly. This workflow is
applied to a heterogeneous channelized reservoir that showed good solution
accuracies and speed-ups of 50x-100x were observed for different cases
considered. The method is formulated such that all the simulation time steps
are independent and hence can make use of parallel resources very efficiently
and also avoid stability issues that can result from error accumulation over
timesteps.

  Learning","mmasia 2019 accepted",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Conventional video summarization approaches based on reinforcement learning
have the problem that the reward can only be received after the whole summary
is generated. Such kind of reward is sparse and it makes reinforcement learning
hard to converge. Another problem is that labelling each frame is tedious and
costly, which usually prohibits the construction of large-scale datasets. To
solve these problems, we propose a weakly supervised hierarchical reinforcement
learning framework, which decomposes the whole task into several subtasks to
enhance the summarization quality. This framework consists of a manager network
and a worker network. For each subtask, the manager is trained to set a subgoal
only by a task-level binary label, which requires much fewer labels than
conventional approaches. With the guide of the subgoal, the worker predicts the
importance scores for video frames in the subtask by policy gradient according
to both global reward and innovative defined sub-rewards to overcome the sparse
problem. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our proposal has
achieved the best performance, even better than supervised approaches.

consequences for and reveal, up to now unacknowledged, differences to newer
formulations of the free energy principle. In particular, we reveal that
various definitions of the ""Markov blanket"" proposed in different works are not
equivalent. We show that crucial steps in the free energy argument which
involve rewriting the equations of motion of systems with Markov blankets, are
not generally correct without additional (previously unstated) assumptions. We
prove by counterexample that the original free energy lemma, when taken at face
value, is wrong. We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does
hold, implies equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density.
The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we
hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we
highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the
free energy principle and lemma are parameterised by different variables than
in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the
theory. Note that we only highlight some specific problems in the discussed
publications. These problems do not rule out conclusively that the general
ideas behind the free energy principle are worth pursuing.

chip-scale photonics devices for sensing and signal processing applications,
among which on-chip spectrometers are of particular interest for precision
wavelength monitoring and related applications. Most chip-scale spectrometers
suffer from a resolution-bandwidth trade-off, thus limiting the uses of the
device. Here we report on a novel passive, chip-scale, hybrid speckle-enhanced
Fourier transform device that exhibits a two order-of-magnitude improvement in
finesse (bandwidth/resolution) over the state-of-the art chip-scale speckle and
Fourier transform spectrometers. In our proof-of-principle device, we
demonstrate a spectral resolution of 140 MHz with 12-nm bandwidth for a finesse
of $10^4$ that can operate over a range of 1500-1600 nm. This chip-scale
spectrometer structure implements a typical spatial heterodyne discrete Fourier
transform interferometer network that is enhanced by speckle generated from the
wafer substrate. This latter effect, which is extremely simple to invoke,
superimposes the high wavelength resolution intrinsic to speckle generated from
a strongly guiding waveguide with a more broadband but lower resolution
discrete Fourier transform modality of the overarching waveguide structure.
This hybrid approach signifies a new pathway for realizing chip-scale
spectrometers capable of ultra-high resolution and broadband performance.

expected, which will lead to a new form of interaction between the real and the
virtual world. In this promising scenario, known as the Internet of Things, it
is expected that different objects, such as sensors, industrial robots, cars,
appliances, will be connected to the Internet. One of the main challenges of
the Internet of Things is the interoperability of highly heterogeneous devices,
mainly in terms of the communication capabilities and network protocols used.
As consequence, the interconnection model of the different devices involves an
intermediary device, known as gateway. This gateway is a centralized element
for the management of the devices that make up an IoT application. In addition,
it is essential for the transmission of information to the Internet, especially
when many IoT devices are not IP-based. This paper describes the implementation
of an IoT gateway that allows the exchange of data through different wireless
technologies and forwarding of such data to the Internet. The proposed gateway
has important advantages such as: supporting for multiprotocol
interconnectivity; remote configuration of wireless nodes for sensor and
actuators management; a flexible algorithm to translate the data obtained by
sensors into a uniform format for transmission to a cloud server; low energy
consumption due to efficient data transfer over the MQTT protocol. In order to
demonstrate the usefulness of the developed gateway, a proof-of-concept test
was implemented. The implemented scenario consists of 2 wireless nodes
responsible for sensing environmental variables and transmitting data to the
gateway node through different communication protocols. The obtained results
show the feasibility for simultaneous data transmission from the remote
wireless nodes to the gateway.

conditions, where the noisy factors are controlled, using them in field robotic
applications remains a challenge. This is constrained to the fiducial maker
systems, since they only work within the RGB image space. As a result, noises
in the image produce large pose estimation errors. In robotic applications,
fiducial markers have been mainly used in its original and simple form, as a
plane in a printed paper sheet. This setup is sufficient for basic visual
servoing and augmented reality applications, but not for complex swarm robotic
applications in which the setup consists of multiple dynamic markers (tags
displayed on LCD screen). This paper describes a novel methodology, called
AprilTags3D, that improves pose estimation accuracy of AprilTags in field
robotics with only RGB sensor by adding a third dimension to the marker

called extended emission (EE) lasting $\sim 10^{2-3}\,\rm s$, as well as a
plateau emission (PE) lasting $\sim10^{4-5}\,\rm s$. While a long-lasting
activity of the central engines is a promising explanation for powering both
emissions, their physical origin and their emission mechanisms are still
uncertain. In this work, we study the properties of the EEs and their
connection with the PEs. First, we constrain the minimal Lorentz factor
$\Gamma$ of the outflows powering EEs, using compactness arguments and find
that the outflows should be relativistic, $\Gamma\gtrsim10$. We propose a
consistent scenario for the PEs, where the outflow eventually catches up with
the jet responsible for the prompt emission, injecting energy into the forward
shock formed by the prior jet, which naturally results in a PE. We also derive
the radiation efficiency of EEs and the Lorentz factor of the outflow within
our scenario for 10 well-observed SGRBs accompanied by both EE and PE. The
efficiency has an average value of $\sim3\,\%$ but shows a broad distribution
ranging from $\sim0.01$ to $\sim100\%$. The Lorentz factor is $\sim20-30$,
consistent with the compactness arguments. These results suggest that EEs are
produced by a slower outflow via more inefficient emission than the faster
outflow which causes the prompt emission with a high radiation efficiency.

  Model Analysis","2 pages",,,,"cs.HC cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To achieve optimal human-system integration in the context of user-AI
interaction it is important that users develop a valid representation of how AI
works. In most of the everyday interaction with technical systems users
construct mental models (i.e., an abstraction of the anticipated mechanisms a
system uses to perform a given task). If no explicit explanations are provided
by a system (e.g. by a self-explaining AI) or other sources (e.g. an
instructor), the mental model is typically formed based on experiences, i.e.
the observations of the user during the interaction. The congruence of this
mental model and the actual systems functioning is vital, as it is used for
assumptions, predictions and consequently for decisions regarding system use. A
key question for human-centered AI research is therefore how to validly survey
users' mental models. The objective of the present research is to identify
suitable elicitation methods for mental model analysis. We evaluated whether
mental models are suitable as an empirical research method. Additionally,
methods of cognitive tutoring are integrated. We propose an exemplary method to
evaluate explainable AI approaches in a human-centered way.
