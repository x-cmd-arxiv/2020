compared to ordinary refractive lenses. For example, it is possible to tune the
focal length of a metalens doublet by varying the relative angle between the
two metalenses while fixing their distance, leading to an extremely compact
zoom lens. An improved polarization-insensitive design based on
silicon-nanocylinders on silica substrates is presented. This design is
realized and characterized experimentally at 1550 nm wavelength. By varying the
relative angle between the metalenses in steps of 10 degrees, tuning of the
doublet focal length is demonstrated from -54 mm to -+3 mm to +54 mm. This
results in a zoom factor of an imaging system varying between 1 and 18. For
positive focal lengths, the doublet focusing efficiency has a minimum of 34%
and a maximum of 83%. Experiment and theory are in very good agreement.

by a bounded impenetrable obstacle in three dimensions. The obstacle scattering
problem is formulated as a boundary value problem in a bounded domain by using
a Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator. An a posteriori error estimate is
derived for the finite element method with the truncated DtN operator. The a
posteriori error estimate consists of the finite element approximation error
and the truncation error of the DtN operator, where the latter is shown to
decay exponentially with respect to the truncation parameter. Based on the a
posteriori error estimate, an adaptive finite element method is developed for
the obstacle scattering problem. The truncation parameter is determined by the
truncation error of the DtN operator and the mesh elements for local refinement
are marked through the finite element approximation error. Numerical
experiments are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

approximate the rank function in affine matrix rank minimization problem and
translate the NP-hard affine matrix rank minimization problem into a

ability to train machine learning models in large-scale distributed

  In this paper, we introduce a general consistency condition covering

that error-feedback may not necessarily help in improving the convergence of

the theoretical analysis of HICODE on synthetic two-layer networks, where
layers are independent of each other and each layer is generated by stochastic

optimize modularity correspond to grounded layers, indicating
modularity-optimizing algorithms can detect strong layers; 2) we prove that
when reducing found layers, HICODE increases absolute modularities of all
unreduced layers, showing its layer reduction step makes weak layers more
detectable. Our work builds a solid theoretical base for HICODE, demonstrating
that it is promising in uncovering both weak and strong layers of communities

circuit consisting of the quantum dot (QD) coupled weakly to an electrode at
temperature $T+\Delta T$ and connected strongly to another electrode at the
reference temperature $T$ by a single-mode quantum point contact (QPC). To
account for the effects of Coulomb interaction in the QD-QPC setup operating in
the integer quantum Hall regime we describe the edge current in the quantum
circuit by Luttinger model characterized by the Luttinger parameter $g$. It is
shown that the temperature dependence of both electric conductance $G\propto
T^{2/g}$ and thermoelectric coefficient $G_T\propto T^{1+2/g}$ detours from the
Fermi-liquid (FL) theory predictions. The behaviour of the thermoelectric power
$S=G_T/G\propto T$ in a regime of a single-channel Kondo effect is, by
contrast, consistent with the FL paradigm. We demonstrate that the interplay
between the mesoscopic Coulomb blockade in QD and weak repulsive interaction in
the Luttinger Liquid $g=1-\alpha$ $(\alpha \ll 1)$ results in the enhancement
of the thermopower. This enhancement is attributed to suppression of the Kondo
correlations in the ""charge"" circuit by the destructive quantum interference

lineon-type excitations, we predict a generic formula for the critical point of
the quantum phase transition, characterized by the breaking-down of GSD. This
theory applies to a board class of FTOs, including X-cube model, and for more

engineering objective functions: minimum cost routing (MCR), load balancing

traffic engineering questions. For example, what are the differences among the
three objective functions? What is the impact of an objective function on link
utilization? How many candidate paths are enough to achieve optimality or
near-optimality with respect to a specific objective. This new software tool
allows us to conveniently perform various experiments and visualize the results

answer the questions for two traffic engineering problems: (1) how many paths
are required to obtain a solution that is within a few percent from the optimal
solution and whether that number is fixed for any network size? (2) how the
choice of single-path/multi-path routing affects the load in the network? For
the first problem, it turns out that the number of paths needed to achieve

The HARPS spectrograph provides state-of-the-art stellar radial
velocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are
extracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are

three-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply
the new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV
data set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved
by correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star
observed with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO
archive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero
points (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs
of the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is < 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL
RVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three
significant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software
used for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1
m/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical
timescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few
m/s. In addition, we find small (< 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in
DRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm
that the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly
depends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type
stars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be
retrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000
RVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP
corrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.

Most meteorological centres issue ensemble forecasts of TCC, however, these
forecasts are often uncalibrated and exhibit worse forecast skill than ensemble
forecasts of other weather variables. Hence, some form of post-processing is
strongly required to improve predictive performance. As TCC observations are
usually reported on a discrete scale taking just nine different values called
oktas, statistical calibration of TCC ensemble forecasts can be considered a
classification problem with outputs given by the probabilities of the oktas.
This is a classical area where machine learning methods are applied. We
investigate the performance of post-processing using multilayer perceptron
(MLP) neural networks, gradient boosting machines (GBM) and random forest (RF)
methods. Based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts global
TCC ensemble forecasts for 2002-2014 we compare these approaches with the
proportional odds logistic regression (POLR) and multiclass logistic regression
(MLR) models, as well as the raw TCC ensemble forecasts. We further assess
whether improvements in forecast skill can be obtained by incorporating
ensemble forecasts of precipitation as additional predictor. Compared to the
raw ensemble, all calibration methods result in a significant improvement in
forecast skill. RF models provide the smallest increase in predictive
performance, while MLP, POLR and GBM approaches perform best. The use of
precipitation forecast data leads to further improvements in forecast skill and
except for very short lead times the extended MLP model shows the best overall
performance.

devices exhibit 100 h operation at high brightness in excess of 800 cd/m2 under
constant current driving, achieving a maximum luminance of 3260 cd/m2 and power
efficiency of 9.1 Lm/W. This performance extrapolates to a 6700 h luminance

predicting sememes for unannotated words. We find that sememes of each word are
usually semantically matched to different words in its dictionary definition,
and we name this matching relationship local semantic correspondence.
Accordingly, we propose a Sememe Correspondence Pooling (SCorP) model, which is
able to capture this kind of matching to predict sememes. We evaluate our model
and baseline methods on a famous sememe KB HowNet and find that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, further quantitative analysis
shows that our model can properly learn the local semantic correspondence
between sememes and words in dictionary definitions, which explains the
effectiveness of our model. The source codes of this paper can be obtained from

We find that the impact dynamics of online news articles does not exhibit
popularity patterns found in many other social and information systems. In
particular, we find that a simple exponential distribution yields a better fit
to the empirical news impact distributions than a power-law distribution. This
observation is explained by the lack or limited influence of the otherwise
omnipresent rich-get-richer mechanism in the analyzed data. The temporal
dynamics of the news impact exhibits a universal exponential decay which allows
us to collapse individual news trajectories into an elementary single curve. We

confine light, produce sharp resonances for sensing applications and serve as
avenues for lasing action with topological characteristics. Recent experiments
have demonstrated the existence of exotic modes which occur in off-$\Gamma$\
points not accessible by symmetry-protected BICs, Freidrich-Wintgen (FW) BICs.
In previous works, FW BICs were formed by either varying the incident angle or
through geometric manipulation. On the contrary, in this work we demonstrate
the formation of FW BICs induced by different linear polarization states of
incident terahertz waves. Furthermore, as predicted by theory, the position of
the FW BIC region is verified to change as a function of asymmetry. This allows
for a unique parameter, incident polarization, to induce the FW BIC and
modulate the supercavity resonance with the degree of asymmetry. The
polarization-selective quasi-BICs observed near the FW BIC have potential
applications in lasing, spectral filtering and high-performance sensing
devices.

audio signals in real environments which, aside from the desired sources, often
contain several interfering sources such as background noise or concurrent
speakers. Blind Source Separation (BSS) provides a powerful approach to address
such problems. However, BSS algorithms typically treat all sources equally and
do not resolve uncertainty regarding the ordering of the separated signals at
the output of the algorithm, i.e., the outer permutation problem. This paper
addresses this problem by incorporating prior knowledge into the adaptation of
the demixing filters, e.g., the position of the sources, in a Bayesian
framework. We focus here on methods based on Independent Vector Analysis (IVA)
as it elegantly and successfully deals with the internal permutation problem.
By including a background model, i.e., a model for sources we are not
interested to separate, we enable the algorithm to extract the sources of
interest in overdetermined and underdetermined scenarios at a low computational
complexity. The proposed framework allows to incorporate prior knowledge about
the demixing filters in a generic way and unifies several known and newly
proposed algorithms using a Bayesian view. For all algorithmic variants, we
provide efficient update rules based on the iterative projection principle. The
performance of a large variety of representative algorithmic variants,
including very recent algorithms, is compared using measured room impulse
responses.

stringent limitations to deal with finite temperature simulations or

used to predict whether urban scenes are likely to be considered beautiful: it
turns out that these techniques are able to make accurate predictions. Yet they
fall short when it comes to generating actionable insights for urban design. To
support urban interventions, one needs to go beyond predicting beauty, and
tackle the challenge of recreating beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning
techniques have not been designed with that challenge in mind. Given their
""black-box nature"", these models cannot be directly used to explain why a
particular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we
propose a deep learning framework called Facelift, that is able to both
beautify existing urban scenes (Google Street views) and explain which urban
elements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate
our framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem
at hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones. These
new metrics should ideally capture the presence/absence of elements that make
urban spaces great. Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify
five main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual
complexity. We find that, across all the five metrics, the beautified scenes
meet the expectations set by the literature on what great spaces tend to be
made of. This result is further confirmed by a 20-participant expert survey in
which FaceLift have been found to be effective in promoting citizen
participation. All this suggests that, in the future, as our framework's
components are further researched and become better and more sophisticated, it
is not hard to imagine technologies that will be able to accurately and
efficiently support architects and planners in the design of spaces we
intuitively love.

density-functional theory (DFT) and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory, we have
calculated hyperfine tensors for electrons and holes in GaAs and crystalline
silicon. Accounting for relativistic effects near the nuclear core, we find
contact hyperfine interactions for electrons in GaAs that are consistent with
Knight-shift measurements performed on GaAs quantum wells and are roughly
consistent with prior estimates extrapolated from measurements on InSb. We find
that a combination of DFT and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ theory is necessary
to accurately determine the contact hyperfine interaction for electrons at a
conduction-band minimum in silicon that is consistent with bulk Knight-shift
measurements. For hole spins in GaAs, the overall magnitude of the hyperfine
couplings we find from DFT is consistent with previous theory based on
free-atom properties, and with heavy-hole Overhauser shifts measured in GaAs
(and InGaAs) quantum dots. In addition, we theoretically predict that the
heavy-hole hyperfine coupling to the As nuclear spins is stronger and almost
purely Ising-like, while the (weaker) coupling to the Ga nuclear spins has
significant non-Ising corrections. In the case of hole spins in silicon, we
find (surprisingly) that the strength of the hyperfine interaction in the
valence band is comparable to that in the conduction band and that the
hyperfine tensors are highly anisotropic (Ising-like) in the heavy-hole
subspace. These results suggest that the hyperfine coupling cannot be ruled out
as a limiting mechanism for coherence ($T_2^{\ast}$) times recently measured

structural analysis of thin shells that are described by general Kirchhoff-Love
kinematics. Their governing equation is a vector-valued, fourth-order,
nonlinear, partial differential equation (PDE) that requires at least
$C^1$-continuity within a displacement-based finite element formulation. The
second class are surface phase separations modeled by a phase field. Their
governing equation is the Cahn-Hilliard equation - a scalar, fourth-order,
nonlinear PDE - that can be coupled to the thin shell PDE. The third class are
brittle fracture processes modeled by a phase field approach. In this work,
these are described by a scalar, fourth-order, nonlinear PDE that is similar to
the Cahn-Hilliard equation and is also coupled to the thin shell PDE. Using a
direct finite element discretization, the two phase field equations also
require at least a $C^1$-continuous formulation. Isogeometric surface
discretizations - often composed of multiple patches - thus require constraints
that enforce the $C^1$-continuity of displacement and phase field. For this,
two numerical strategies are presented: For this, two numerical strategies are
presented: A Lagrange multiplier formulation and a penalty method. The
curvilinear shell model including the geometrical constraints is taken from
Duong et al. (2017) and it is extended to model the coupled phase field

multi-patches. Their accuracy and convergence are illustrated by several
numerical examples considering deforming shells, phase separations on evolving
surfaces, and dynamic brittle fracture of thin shells.

SDE representations. The second useful feature is that parameter estimation can
be performed semi-parametrically in the frequency domain using the Whittle

difficult to tell a priori which features are important for a particular
application. The latter problem has been empirically observed for predictors of
guest uptake in nanoporous materials: local and global porosity features become
dominant descriptors at low and high pressures, respectively. We investigate a
feature representation of materials using tools from topological data analysis.
Specifically, we use persistent homology to describe the geometry of nanoporous
materials at various scales. We combine our topological descriptor with
traditional structural features and investigate the relative importance of each
to the prediction tasks. We demonstrate an application of this feature
representation by predicting methane adsorption in zeolites, for pressures in
the range of 1-200 bar. Our results not only show a considerable improvement
compared to the baseline, but they also highlight that topological features
capture information complementary to the structural features: this is
especially important for the adsorption at low pressure, a task particularly
difficult for the traditional features. Furthermore, by investigation of the
importance of individual topological features in the adsorption model, we are
able to pinpoint the location of the pores that correlate best to adsorption at
different pressure, contributing to our atom-level understanding of
structure-property relationships.

sphaleron washout of baryon number violating processes leads to a lower bound
on the strength of the transition. The velocity of the boundary between the
phases, the so-called bubble wall, can become ultra-relativistic if the
friction due to the plasma of particles is not sufficient to retard the wall's
acceleration. This bubble ``runaway'' should not occur if a successful baryon
asymmetry generation due to the transition is required. Using Boedeker-Moore

standard model of particle physics with a real gauge-single scalar field, we
show that a non runaway transition requirement puts an upper bound on the

In this work, we improve over all previously known algorithms for this problem
for various parameters describing the input instance:
  * $\mathcal{D}\,$ being the maximum number of characters that match a fixed
character,
  * $\mathcal{S}\,$ being the number of pairs of matching characters,
  * $\mathcal{I}\,$ being the total number of disjoint intervals of characters

To conclude, we demonstrate first lower bounds for $\texttt{GPM}$. We start by
showing that any deterministic or Monte Carlo algorithm for $\texttt{GPM}$ must
use $\Omega(\mathcal{S})$ time, and then proceed to show higher lower bounds
for combinatorial algorithms. These bounds show that our algorithms are almost

analysts to consume and exploit data given aerial FMV. We have investigated and
designed a system capable of detecting events and activities of interest that
deviate from the baseline patterns of observation given FMV feeds. We have
divided the problem into three tasks: (1) Context awareness, (2) object
cataloging, and (3) event detection. The goal of context awareness is to
constraint the problem of visual search and detection in video data. A custom
image classifier categorizes the scene with one or multiple labels to identify
the operating context and environment. This step helps reducing the semantic
search space of downstream tasks in order to increase their accuracy. The
second step is object cataloging, where an ensemble of object detectors locates
and labels any known objects found in the scene (people, vehicles, boats,
planes, buildings, etc.). Finally, context information and detections are sent
to the event detection engine to monitor for certain behaviors. A series of
analytics monitor the scene by tracking object counts, and object interactions.
If these object interactions are not declared to be commonly observed in the
current scene, the system will report, geolocate, and log the event. Events of
interest include identifying a gathering of people as a meeting and/or a crowd,
alerting when there are boats on a beach unloading cargo, increased count of
people entering a building, people getting in and/or out of vehicles of

unsuitable for near-term devices with limited gate fidelities that cause high
physical errors. In addition, Trotter error caused by noncommuting terms can
accumulate and harm the overall circuit fidelity, thus causing algorithmic
errors. In this paper, we propose a new term ordering strategy, max-commute-tsp

First, we improve the Trotter fidelity compared with previously proposed
optimization by reordering Pauli terms and partitioning them into commuting
families. We demonstrate the practicality of this method by constructing and
evaluating quantum circuits that simulate different molecular Hamiltonians,
together with theoretical explanations for the fidelity improvements from our
term grouping method. Second, we describe a new gate cancellation technique
that reduces the high gate counts by formulating the gate cancellation problem
as a travelling salesperson problem, together with benchmarking experiments.

the gluon and quark propagators at the best-fit parameters for $N_F=2$ QCD have

In this work, we analyze the effect of initialization in deep linear networks,

networks, the width needed for efficient convergence to a global minimum with
orthogonal initializations is independent of the depth, whereas the width
needed for efficient convergence with Gaussian initializations scales linearly
in the depth. Our results demonstrate how the benefits of a good initialization

identified a method of combining self-play with paired input-output data

Theoretical analysis reveals how ASP shapes the policy space and the

The Clifford+CS gate set is universal for quantum computation and its elements
can be implemented fault-tolerantly in most error-correcting schemes through
magic state distillation. Since non-Clifford gates are typically more expensive
to perform in a fault-tolerant manner, it is often desirable to construct
circuits that use few CS gates. In the present paper, we introduce an efficient
and optimal synthesis algorithm for two-qubit Clifford+CS operators. Our
algorithm inputs a Clifford+CS operator U and outputs a Clifford+CS circuit for
U, which uses the least possible number of CS gates. Because the algorithm is
deterministic, the circuit it associates to a Clifford+CS operator can be
viewed as a normal form for that operator. We give an explicit description of
these normal forms and use this description to derive a worst-case lower bound
of 5log(1/epsilon)+O(1) on the number of CS gates required to
epsilon-approximate elements of SU(4). Our work leverages a wide variety of

articles, etc.) can leak sensitive latent attributes, such as religious and
political views, sexual orientation, ethnicity, gender, and others. To prevent
such information leakage, the goal of classical PIR is to hide the identity of
the content/message being accessed, which subsequently also hides the latent
attributes. This solution, while private, can be too costly, particularly, when
perfect (information-theoretic) privacy constraints are imposed. For instance,
for a single database holding $K$ messages, privately retrieving one message is
possible if and only if the user downloads the entire database of $K$ messages.
Retrieving content privately, however, may not be necessary to perfectly hide
the latent attributes.
  Motivated by the above, we formulate and study the problem of latent-variable
private information retrieval (LV-PIR), which aims at allowing the user
efficiently retrieve one out of $K$ messages (indexed by $\theta$) without
revealing any information about the latent variable (modeled by $S$). We focus
on the practically relevant setting of a single database and show that one can
significantly reduce the download cost of LV-PIR (compared to the classical
PIR) based on the correlation between $\theta$ and $S$. We present a general
scheme for LV-PIR as a function of the statistical relationship between
$\theta$ and $S$, and also provide new results on the capacity/download cost of
LV-PIR. Several open problems and new directions are also discussed.

the relativistic parameter {\sigma} given by the ratio of the central pressure

the adiabatic index for stability are determined, together with the critical

implemented a numerical method which is independent on the choice of the trial

also occur in a number of materials with strong spin-orbit coupling. In
contrast to the celebrated $S$=1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice, the
higher-spin Kitaev models are not exactly solvable. Hence, the existence of
quantum spin liquids in these systems remains an outstanding question. In this
work, we use the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods to
numerically investigate the $S$=1 Kitaev model with both ferromagnetic (FM) and
antiferromagnetic (AFM) interactions. Using results on a cylindrical geometry
with various circumferences, we conclude that the ground state of the $S$=1
Kitaev model is a quantum spin liquid with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge structure. We
also put a bound on the excitation gap, which turns out to be quite small. The
magnetic field responses for the FM and AFM models are similar to those of the
$S$=1/2 counterparts. In particular, in the AFM $S$=1 model, a gapless quantum
liquid state emerges in an intermediate window of magnetic field strength,
before the system enters a trivial polarized state.

an aggregate of dark matter (with the properties described in Paper I). Both
have large pressure-like components which dominate the density terms. Using one
form a simple model of the spiral galaxy halos is developed which can match the
observed `flat' outer rotation curves of some galaxies,including the Milky Way.
It can also represent the ascending outer rotational curves of small spiral
galaxies such as M33. See Figs. 1, 2. The halo dark matter (DM)`missing mass'
results from ignoring the pressure term's contribution to the source tensor.
  The analysis of the Milky Way rotation curve gives parameters characterizing
the DM intergalactic medium in which the halo is situated.. The dark matter
cannot come closer to the galactic center than $R \sim 4$ kpc. It reaches a
maximum flux at $R_h \simeq 8$ kpc and then falls rapidly with distance. It is
hoped that by analyzing other galactic rotation curves these models can be used
to infer properties of the intergalactic DM matter.
  The other form for $T^{\mu \nu}$ for DM is useful in cosmology. Then a
(non-constant) cosmological `constant' term $\Lambda$ needs to be added to
Einstein's equation in order to allow use for DM of the standard equation of
state relation of ordinary matter.. We suggest that at least some of the `dark
energy' present results from this requirement and may not be real; it simply
results from adopting an improper equation of state for DM.

GES merger is likely to have been gas-rich and contribute 10-50$\%$ of gas to a
merger-induced centrally concentrated starburst that results in the rapid
formation of a compact, rotationally supported thick disc that occupies the
typical chemical thick disc region of chemical abundance space. We find
evidence that gas-rich mergers heated the proto-disc of the Galaxy, scattering
stars onto less-circular orbits such that their rotation velocity and
metallicity positively correlate, thus contributing an additional component
that connects the Galactic thick disc to the inner stellar halo. We demonstrate
that the level of kinematic heating of the proto-galaxy correlates with the

sample produces ~10% of the 850 micron extragalactic background light. We
separate the submillimeter detected X-ray sources into star-forming galaxies
and AGNs using a star formation rate (SFR) versus X-ray luminosity calibration
for high SFR galaxies. We confirm this separation using the X-ray photon
indices. We measure the X-ray fluxes at the accurate positions of the 75 ALMA
sources and detect 70% at >3-sigma in either the 0.5-2 or 2-7 keV bands.
However, many of these may produce both their X-ray and submillimeter emission
by star formation. Indeed, we find that only 20% of the ALMA sources have
intermediate X-ray luminosities (rest-frame 8-28 keV luminosities of
10^42.5-10^44 erg/s), and none has a high X-ray luminosity (>10^44 erg/s).
Conversely, after combining the CDF-S with the CDF-N, we find extreme star
formation (SFR>300 solar masses per yr) in some intermediate X-ray luminosity
sources but not in any high X-ray luminosity sources. We argue that the
quenching of star formation in the most luminous AGNs may be a consequence of
the clearing of gas in these sources.

Submitted to MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa2224",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The flat star formation (SF) history of the Milky Way (MW) requires gas in
the Galactic disc to be replenished, most likely from a reservoir outside the
Galaxy. Such a replenishment may be achieved by a form of `positive' feedback,
whereby SF feedback creates a Galactic fountain cycle that collects and cools
additional gas from the hot halo surrounding the Galaxy. In this paper we
present a model of this process for the MW. A section of the Galactic disc is
allowed to form stars which subsequently explode as supernovae (SNe) and send
gas out into the hot halo. The gas that is sent out is colder than the hot halo
gas and, as it mixes, the halo gas is cooled, providing fuel for further SF as
the mixture falls back onto the Galactic disc. We find that this process can be
sufficient to maintain a roughly-constant cold gas mass in the MW over at least
3 Gyr. Our results further suggest that there is a positive feedback trend
whereby increasing SF leads to an increase in the cold gas budget at average SF
rates below 0.5 solar masses per year but above which becomes negative, where
further increasing the SFR causes the cold gas budget to decrease. We have
constructed an analytical model for this that reproduces the data well and
could have profound implications for galaxy evolution in feedback-dominated
regimes.

is `frothy' due to quantum fluctuations. Although the effect is expected to be
tiny, if these spacetime fluctuations grow over a large distance, the initial
state of a photon, such as its energy, is gradually washed out as the photon
propagates. Thus, in these models, even the most monochromatic light source
would gradually disperse in energy due to spacetime fluctuations over large
distances. In this paper, we use science verification observations obtained
with ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope to place a novel bound on the growth
of spacetime fluctuations. To achieve this, we directly measure the width of a
narrow Fe II absorption line produced by a quiescent gas cloud at redshift
z=2.34, corresponding to a comoving distance of ~5.8 Gpc. Using a heuristic
model where the energy fluctuations grow as sigma_E / E = (E/E_P)^alpha, where
E_P = 1.22 x 10^28 eV is the Planck energy, we rule out models with alpha <
0.634, including models where the quantum fluctuations grow as a random walk
process (alpha = 0.5). Finally, we present a new formalism where the
uncertainty accrued at discrete spacetime steps is drawn from a continuous
distribution. We conclude, if photons take discrete steps through spacetime and
accumulate Planck-scale uncertainties at each step, then our ESPRESSO

used to select pair fraction and the methods used to analyze survey data. This
paper explores the connection between stellar mass estimation and the pair
fraction of galaxies making use of STEEL, the Statistical sEmi-Emprical modeL.
Previous results have found the pair fraction is sensitive to choices made when
selecting what qualifies as a pair, for example luminosity or stellar mass
selections. We find that different estimations of stellar mass such as
photometric choice mass-to-light ratio or IMF that effect the stellar mass
function also significantly affect the derived galaxy pair fraction. By making
use of the galaxy halo connection we investigate these systematic affects on
the pair fraction. We constrain the galaxy halo connection using the
stellar-mass-halo-mass relationship for two observed stellar mass functions,
and the Illustris TNG stellar mass function. Furthermore, we also create a
suite of toy models where the stellar-mass-halo-mass relationship is manually
changed. For each stellar-mass-halo-mass relation the pair fraction, and its
evolution, are generated. We find that enhancements to the number density of
high mass galaxies cause steepening of the stellar-mass-halo mass relation,
resulting in a reduction of the pair fraction. We argue this is a considerable
cause of bias that must be accounted for when comparing pair fractions.

those of field RSGs, it has been claimed that there is an absence of
progenitors with luminosities $L$ above $\log(L/L_\odot) > 5.2$. This is in
tension with the empirical upper luminosity limit of RSGs at $\log(L/L_\odot) =
5.5$, a result known as the `Red Supergiant Problem'. This has been interpreted
as evidence for an upper mass threshold for the formation of black-holes. In
this paper, we compare the observed luminosities of RSG SN progenitors with the
observed RSG $L$-distribution in the Magellanic Clouds. Our results indicate
that the absence of bright SN II-P/L progenitors in the current sample can be
explained at least in part by the steepness of the $L$-distribution and a small
sample size, and that the statistical significance of the Red Supergiant
Problem is between 1-2$\sigma$ . Secondly, we model the luminosity distribution
of II-P/L progenitors as a simple power-law with an upper and lower cutoff, and
find an upper luminosity limit of $\log(L_{\rm hi}/L_\odot) =
5.20^{+0.17}_{-0.11}$ (68\% confidence), though this increases to $\sim$5.3 if
one fixes the power-law slope to be that expected from theoretical arguments.
Again, the results point to the significance of the RSG Problem being within
$\sim 2 \sigma$. Under the assumption that all progenitors are the result of
single-star evolution, this corresponds to an upper mass limit for the parent
distribution of $M_{\rm hi} = 19.2{\rm M_\odot}$, $\pm1.3 {\rm M_\odot

state-of-the-art cosmological simulations which tend to predict a factor of 2-4

We derive SFRs and stellar masses by mimicking different observational

infer the galaxy properties. We find that relations relying on infrared
wavelengths (e.g. 24 ${\rm \mu m}$, MIPS - 24, 70 and 160 ${\rm \mu m}$ or
SPIRE - 250, 350, 500 ${\rm \mu m}$) have SFRs that exceed the intrinsic
relation by 0.5 dex. Relations that rely on the spectral energy distribution
fitting technique underpredict the SFRs at a fixed stellar mass by -0.5 dex at
$z \sim 4$ but overpredict the measurements by 0.3 dex at $z \sim 1$. Relations
relying on dust-corrected rest-frame UV luminosities, are flatter since they
overpredict/underpredict SFRs for low/high star forming objects and yield
deviations from the intrinsic relation from 0.10 dex to -0.13 dex at $z \sim
4$. We suggest that the severe tension between different observational studies

for the high levels of uncertainty introduced by these power sources. This can
be accomplished with a system of many distributed grid-level storage devices.
However, developing a cost-effective and robust control policy in this setting
is a challenge due to the high dimensionality of the resource state and the
highly volatile stochastic processes involved. We first model the problem using
a carefully calibrated power grid model and a specialized hidden Markov
stochastic model for wind power which replicates crossing times. We then base
our control policy on a variant of stochastic dual dynamic programming, an
algorithm well suited for certain high dimensional control problems, that is
modified to accommodate hidden Markov uncertainty in the stochastics. However,
the algorithm may be impractical to use as it exhibits relatively slow
convergence. To accelerate the algorithm, we apply both quadratic
regularization and a risk-directed importance sampling technique for sampling
the outcome space at each time step in the backward pass of the algorithm. We
show that the resulting policies are more robust than those developed using
classical SDDP modeling assumptions and algorithms.

powerful concatenated code that can be efficiently decoded using list decoding.
To help design such systems, this paper presents an efficient algorithm for
identifying the distance-spectrum-optimal (DSO) CRC polynomial for a given
tail-biting convolutional code (TBCC) when the target undetected error rate
(UER) is small. Lou et al. found that the DSO CRC design for a given
zero-terminated convolutional code under low UER is equivalent to maximizing
the undetected minimum distance (the minimum distance of the concatenated
code). This paper applies the same principle to design the DSO CRC for a given
TBCC under low target UER. Our algorithm is based on partitioning the
tail-biting trellis into several disjoint sets of tail-biting paths that are
closed under cyclic shifts. This paper shows that the tail-biting path in each
set can be constructed by concatenating the irreducible error events (IEEs) and
circularly shifting the resultant path. This motivates an efficient collection
algorithm that aims at gathering IEEs, and a search algorithm that reconstructs
the full list of error events with bounded distance of interest, which can be
used to find the DSO CRC. Simulation results show that DSO CRCs can
significantly outperform suboptimal CRCs in the low UER regime.

visibility in the homodyne detector couples in additional vacuum noise, which

applications. Quite often, tight or dual framelets with high vanishing moments
are constructed through the popular oblique extension principle (OEP). Though
OEP can increase vanishing moments for improved sparsity, it has a serious
shortcoming for scalar framelets: the associated discrete framelet transform is
often not compact and deconvolution is unavoidable. Here we say that a framelet
transform is compact if it can be implemented by convolution using only
finitely supported filters. On the other hand, in sharp contrast to the
extensively studied scalar framelets, multiframelets (a.k.a. vector framelets)
derived through OEP from refinable vector functions are much less studied and
are far from well understood. Also, most constructed multiframelets often lack
balancing property which reduces sparsity. In this paper, we are particularly
interested in quasi-tight multiframelets, which are special dual multiframelets
but behave almost identically as tight multiframelets. From any compactly
supported \emph{refinable vector function having at least two entries}, we
prove that we can always construct through OEP a compactly supported
quasi-tight multiframelet such that (1) its associated discrete framelet
transform is compact and has the highest possible balancing order; (2) all
compactly supported framelet generators have the highest possible order of
vanishing moments, matching the approximation/accuracy order of its underlying
refinable vector function. This result demonstrates great advantages of OEP for
multiframelets (retaining all the desired properties) over scalar framelets.

their main weakness, susceptibility to overfitting. This novel construction
harnesses the meta-learning techniques of boosting and bagging simultaneously
and performs remarkably well on the ATLAS Higgs (H) to tau-tau data set (ATLAS

particle energy. The process may play an important role in the acceleration and
heating of the solar wind close to the Sun. Observations from Parker Solar
Probe provide a new opportunity to study this problem, as it measures the solar
wind at unprecedented close distances to the Sun. During the 1st orbit, PSP
encountered a large number of current sheets in the solar wind through
perihelion at 35.7 solar radii. We performed a comprehensive survey of these
current sheets and found evidence for 21 reconnection exhausts. These exhausts
were observed in heliospheric current sheets, coronal mass ejections, and
regular solar wind. However, we find that the majority of current sheets
encountered around perihelion, where the magnetic field was strongest and
plasma beta was lowest, were Alfv\'enic structures associated with bursty
radial jets and these current sheets did not appear to be undergoing local
reconnection. We examined conditions around current sheets to address why some
current sheets reconnected, while others did not. A key difference appears to

velocity shear for the 21 reconnection exhausts was 24% of the Alfv\'en
velocity shear, whereas the median shear across 43 Alfv\'enic current sheets
examined was 71% of the Alfv\'en velocity shear. This finding could suggest
that large, albeit sub-Alfv\'enic, velocity shears suppress reconnection. An
alternative interpretation is that the Alfv\'enic current sheets are isolated
rotational discontinuities which do not undergo local reconnection.

space is open. Nachbin observed that, more generally, the intersection of
compactly many open sets is open. Moreover, Nachbin applied this to obtain
elegant proofs of various facts concerning compact sets in topology and

well known fact that if a space $X$ is compact, then the projection map $Z
\times X \to Z$ is closed for every space $Z$. It is also well known that the
converse holds: if a space $X$ has the property that the projection $Z \times X

as a converse of Nachbin's observation, and apply this to obtain further

different binary formation channels. Using the data from Advanced LIGO and
Virgo's first and second observing runs, here we seek to carefully characterize
the distribution of effective spin among binary black holes, hierarchically
measuring the distribution's mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ while
accounting for selection effects and degeneracies between spin and other black
hole parameters. We demonstrate that the known population of binary black holes
have spins that are both small, with $\mu \sim 0$, and very narrowly
distributed, with $\sigma^2 \leq 0.07$ at 95% credibility. We then explore what
these ensemble properties imply about the spins of individual binary black hole
mergers, re-analyzing existing gravitational-wave events with a
population-informed prior on their effective spin. The binary black hole
GW170729, which previously excluded effective spin equal to zero, is now
consistent with zero effective spin at ~10% credibility. More broadly, we find
that uninformative spin priors generally yield overestimates for the effective
spin magnitudes of compact binary mergers.

Harary-Hill Conjecture for ""pseudolinear"" drawings of $K_n$, we introduce
""pseudospherical"" drawings of graphs. A spherical drawing of a graph $G$ is a
drawing in the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^2$ in which the vertices of $G$ are
represented as points -- no three on a great circle -- and the edges of $G$ are
shortest-arcs in $\mathbb{S}^2$ connecting pairs of vertices. Such a drawing
has three properties: (1) every edge $e$ is contained in a simple closed curve
$\gamma_e$ such that the only vertices in $\gamma_e$ are the ends of $e$; (2)
if $e\ne f$, then $\gamma_e\cap\gamma_f$ has precisely two crossings; and (3)
if $e\ne f$, then $e$ intersects $\gamma_f$ at most once, either in a crossing
or an end of $e$. We use Properties (1)--(3) to define a pseudospherical
drawing of $G$. Our main result is that, for the complete graph, Properties
(1)--(3) are equivalent to the same three properties but with ""precisely two
crossings"" in (2) replaced by ""at most two crossings"".
  The proof requires a result in the geometric transversal theory of
arrangements of pseudocircles. This is proved using the surprising result that
the absence of special arcs ( coherent spirals) in an arrangement of simple
closed curves characterizes the fact that any two curves in the arrangement
have at most two crossings.
  Our studies provide the necessary ideas for exhibiting a drawing of $K_{10}$

all pairs of pseudocircles crossing twice.

To this end, we also propose the so-called \emph{permutation test} for
persistence diagrams to delineate critical values and pairings of critical
values. For graph classification tasks, we note that while persistence pairing
yields consistent improvement over various benchmark datasets, it appears that
for various filtration functions tested, most discriminative power comes from
critical values. For shape segmentation and classification, however, we note
that persistence pairing shows significant power on most of the benchmark

those based on permutation tests. Our results help provide insights on when

First, the relative intensities of Raman active modes change as a function of
the excitation wavelength. Second, angle-resolved polarized Raman spectra show
systematic deviation from the Raman tensor theory. In particular, the $B_1^1$
mode is absent for 633 nm excitation, whereas the $B_1^2$ mode shows an unusual
two-fold symmetry instead of a four-fold symmetry for 488, 532, and 633 nm
excitations. These unconventional phenomena are attributed to the interference
effect in the Raman process owing to the existence of multiple carrier pockets

of boundaries. While the implementation of Dirac's program in the presence of
boundaries, as put forward by Regge and Teitelboim, is not new, there are some
instances in which this formalism is incomplete. Here we propose an extension
to the Dirac formalism --together with the Regge-Teitelboim strategy,-- that
includes generic cases of field theories. We see that there are two possible
scenarios, one where there is no contribution from the boundary to the
symplectic structure and the other case in which there is one, depending on the
dynamical details of the starting action principle. As a concrete system that
exemplifies both cases, we consider a theory that can be seen both as defined
on a four dimensional spacetime region with boundaries --the bulk theory--, or
as a theory defined both on the bulk and the boundary of the region --the mixed
theory--. The bulk theory is given by the 4-dimensional Maxwell + $U(1)$
Pontryagin action while the mixed one is defined by the 4-dimensional Maxwell +
3-dimensional $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action on the boundary. Finally, we show how
these two descriptions of the same system are connected through a canonical
transformation that provides a third description. The focus here is in defining
a consistent formulation of all three descriptions, for which we rely on the
geometric formulation of constrained systems, together with the extension of
the Dirac-Regge-Teitelboim (DRT) formalism put forward in the manuscript.

approach to the determination of mean free paths of electron scattering in
liquid water. This by no means new approach is based on a very simplistic two
channel model of electron scattering with only one fully elastic and one fully
inelastic (total loss) channel. The parameterization consists of an elastic
cross section, its angular dependence (DCS), and a cross section for electron
loss by inelastic scattering. The two cross sections (or the equivalent MFPs)
are determined from fits to experimental data (EALs and measured anisotropy
parameters). The elastic DCS is calculated ab initio for various cluster
models. Furthermore, they claim to find elastic and inelastic mean free paths
that are much shorter than those for amorphous ice. We find that there are a
number of issues both with the approach of the authors and with the comparison
of their results with the literature. As outlined in the comment, the reported
values for elastic and inelastic mean free paths are questionable and
conclusions regarding the difference between electron scattering in liquid
water and amorphous ice are invalid.

the sensors use a limited power source which after its depletion, since it is

they are vulnerable to many threats. One notable attack threating WSN is Denial

keeping the nodes from going into sleep and energy-saving mode. In this paper,
the Abnormal Sensor Detection Accuracy (ASDA-RSA) method is utilised to
counteract DoS attacks to reducing the amount of energy consumed. The ASDA-RSA

reconstruction is formulated into a penalized least-squares problem with

which is often stopped early after a small number of iterations. Besides the
phantom signal, measurements additionally include a background signal and a
noise signal. In order to obtain good reconstructions, a preprocessing step of

noise treatment, by viewing highly noisy measurements as outliers, and
employing the l1 data fitting, one popular approach from robust statistics.
When compared with the standard approach, it is easy to implement with a
comparable computational complexity. Experiments with a public domain dataset,

less prone to noisy measurements, which is illustrated by quantitative (PSNR /

However, just because it is theoretically possible to reformulate previous work

proposed examples of MLNs for musical analysis and consider their practical
disadvantages when compared to formulating the same musical dependence
relationships as (dynamic) Bayesian networks. We argue that a number of
practical hurdles such as the lack of support for sequences and for arbitrary

musical applications, both in terms of easy of formulation and computational
requirements due to their required inference algorithms. These conclusions are
not specific to music, but apply to other fields as well, especially when
sequential data with continuous observations is involved. Finally, we show that
the ideas underlying the proposed examples can be expressed perfectly well in

classification problems where the prediction is categorical, such as accepting
or rejecting a loan application. This is in part because classification
fairness measures are easily computed by comparing the rates of outcomes,
leading to behaviours such as ensuring that the same fraction of eligible men
are selected as eligible women. But such measures are computationally difficult
to generalise to the continuous regression setting for problems such as
pricing, or allocating payments. The difficulty arises from estimating
conditional densities (such as the probability density that a system will
over-charge by a certain amount). For the regression setting we introduce
tractable approximations of the independence, separation and sufficiency
criteria by observing that they factorise as ratios of different conditional
probabilities of the protected attributes. We introduce and train machine
learning classifiers, distinct from the predictor, as a mechanism to estimate

four structures from primitive (P) and gyroid (G) families (two structures

underlying progenitor mass distribution for short gamma-ray bursts produced by
binary neutron star mergers. The recently announced gravitational-wave
detection of GW190425 suggests this underlying distribution is different from

form from the latter distribution, the larger $M_\mathrm{TOV}$ needs to be to
satisfy the X-ray observations. Our measurements above are marginalised over

simulations, presented in He, Ricotti and Geen (2019), the formation of
individual massive stars are well resolved, and their UV radiation feedback and
lifetime on the main sequence are modeled self-consistently. We find that the
escape fraction of ionizing radiation from molecular clouds, $\langle f_{\rm

star cluster and with decreasing compactness. Molecular clouds with densities
typically found in the local Universe have negligible $\langle f_{\rm

times denser molecular clouds have $\langle f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm

globular cluster progenitors, have $\langle f_{\rm esc}^{\scriptscriptstyle \rm

metallicity, even when ignoring dust extinction, due to stronger radiation
feedback. However, the total number of escaping ionizing photons decreases with
decreasing metallicity because the star formation efficiency is reduced. We
conclude that the sources of reionization at $z>6$ must have been very compact
star clusters forming in molecular clouds about $100\times$ denser than in

aims to find all the k-bitrusses for k >= 0. The existing bottom-up techniques
need to iteratively peel the edges with the lowest butterfly support. In this

Volterra integral equation. We present versions of the method both for periodic
boundary conditions, and for free space problems with compactly supported
initial data and potential. A spatially uniform electric field may be included,
making the solver applicable to simulations of light-matter interaction.
  The primary computational challenge in using the Volterra formulation is the
application of a space-time history dependent integral operator. This may be
accomplished by projecting the solution onto a set of Fourier modes, and
updating their coefficients from one time step to the next by a simple
recurrence. In the periodic case, the modes are those of the usual Fourier
series, and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to alternate between
physical and frequency domain grids. In the free space case, the oscillatory
behavior of the spectral Green's function leads us to use a set of
complex-frequency Fourier modes obtained by discretizing a contour deformation
of the inverse Fourier transform, and we develop a corresponding fast transform
based on the FFT.
  Our approach is related to pseudo-spectral methods, but applied to an
integral rather than the usual differential formulation. This has several
advantages: it avoids the need for artificial boundary conditions, admits
simple, inexpensive high-order implicit time marching schemes, and naturally
includes time-dependent potentials. We present examples in one and two
dimensions showing spectral accuracy in space and eighth-order accuracy in time
for both periodic and free space problems.

enable broadband imaging or spectral characterization of exoplanets 1e8 fainter
than their star. Several solutions were proposed. Pupil apodizers can attenuate
the star intensity by a 1e10 factor but they transmit a few percents of the
planet light only. Cascades of phase/amplitude masks can both attenuate the
starlight and transmit most of the planet light but the number of optics to
align is not a practical solution for an instrument. Finally, vector phase
masks can be used to detect faint sources close to bright stars but they
require the use of high quality circular polarizers and as for the previous
solution, this leads to a complex instrument with numerous optics to align and
stabilize. We propose simple coronagraphs that need one scalar phase mask and
one binary Lyot stop only providing high transmission for the planet light
(>50%) and high attenuation of the starlight over a large spectral bandpass
(~30%) and a 360 degree field-of-view. From mathematical considerations, we
find a family of 2D-phase masks optimized for an unobscured pupil. One mask is
an azimuthal wrapped vortex phase ramp. We probe its coronagraphic performance
using numerical simulations and laboratory tests. From numerical simulations,
we predict the wrapped vortex can attenuate the peak of the star image by a
factor of 1e4 over a 29% bandpass and 1e5 over a 18% bandpass with transmission
of more than 50% of the planet flux at ~4 lambda/D. We confirm these
predictions in laboratory in visible light between 550nm and 870nm. We also
obtain laboratory dark hole images in which exoplanets with fluxes that are
3e-8 times the host star flux could be detected at 3sigma. Taking advantage of
a new technology for etching continuous 2D-functions, new type of masks can be
easily manufactured opening new possibilities for broadband coronagraphy.

better guidance to theories of new physics, new molecular probes will be
useful. These probes must have spectral transitions that are observable
astrophysically and have different sensitivities to variation in the

observations constrain the set of potential molecular probes and promising
sensitive transitions based on how the frequency and intensity of these

a common hand gesture to signal their support for a candidate. In this paper we
introduce a scalable automated visual recognition pipeline for discovering

underlying complex genetic diseases. Despite the massive influx of genome
sequencing data, identifying disease-relevant genes remains difficult as
individuals with the same disease may share very few, if any, genetic variants.
Protein-protein interaction networks provide a means to tackle this
heterogeneity, as genes causing the same disease tend to be proximal within
networks. Previously, network propagation approaches have spread signal across
the network from either known disease genes or genes that are newly putatively
implicated in the disease (e.g., found to be mutated in exome studies or linked
via genome-wide association studies). Here we introduce a general framework
that considers both sources of data within a network context. Specifically, we
use prior knowledge of disease-associated genes to guide random walks initiated
from genes that are newly identified as perhaps disease-relevant. In
large-scale testing across 24 cancer types, we demonstrate that our approach
for integrating both prior and new information not only better identifies
cancer driver genes than using either source of information alone but also
readily outperforms other state-of-the-art network-based approaches. To
demonstrate the versatility of our approach, we also apply it to genome-wide
association data to identify genes functionally relevant for several complex
diseases. Overall, our work suggests that guided network propagation approaches
that utilize both prior and new data are a powerful means to identify disease
genes.

conveniently deduced from one node to another node. For learning the inference
process, we further introduce meta-optimization on structure relations from
training nodes to validation nodes, such that the learnt graph inference
capability can be better self-adapted to testing nodes. Comprehensive

achieves a simple, highly systematic unity of logic by discarding the

this relation should be universal and true for galaxy clusters as well. In this

the resulting RAR of 52 non-cool-core galaxy clusters scatters in a large

which may even require psychologists to correctly categorize them. To the best
of our knowledge, the existing expression datasets are only limited to several
basic facial expressions, which are not sufficient to support our ambitions in
developing successful human-computer interaction systems. To this end, a novel
Fine-grained Facial Expression Database - F2ED is contributed in this paper,
and it includes more than 200k images with 54 facial expressions from 119
persons. Considering the phenomenon of uneven data distribution and lack of
samples is common in real-world scenarios, we further evaluate several tasks of
few-shot expression learning by virtue of our F2ED, which are to recognize the
facial expressions given only few training instances. These tasks mimic human
performance to learn robust and general representation from few examples. To
address such few-shot tasks, we propose a unified task-driven framework -
Compositional Generative Adversarial Network (Comp-GAN) learning to synthesize

describes a bouncing compact object. The corrections responsible for the bounce
are parameterized in a general way so as to remain agnostic about the specific
mechanism of singularity resolution at play. It thus develops an effective
theory based on a thin shell approach, inferring generic properties of such a
UV complete gravitational collapse. The main result comes in the form of a
strong constraint applicable to general UV models : if the dynamics of the
collapsing star exhibits a bounce, it always occurs below, or at most at the
energy threshold of horizon formation, so that only an instantaneous trapping
horizon may be formed while a trapped region never forms. This conclusion
relies solely on i) the assumption of continuity of the induced metric across
the time-like surface of the star and ii) the assumption of a classical
Schwarzschild geometry describing the (vacuum) exterior of the star. In
particular, it is completely independent of the choice of corrections inside
the star which leads to singularity-resolution. The present model provides thus
a general framework to discuss bouncing compact objects, for which the interior
geometry is modeled either by a classical or a quantum bounce. In the later
case, our no-go result regarding the formation of trapped region suggests that
additional structure, such as the formation of an inner horizon, is needed to
build consistent models of matter collapse describing black-to-white hole
bounces. Indeed, such additional structure is needed to keep quantum gravity
effects confined to the high curvature regime, in the deep interior region,
providing thus a new challenge for current constructions of quantum
black-to-white hole bounce models.

two overlapping galaxy images via a branched GAN model. However, it remains a
significant challenge to comprehend how the network works, which is
particularly difficult for non-expert users. This research focuses on behaviors
of one of the network's major components, the Discriminator, which plays a
vital role but is often overlooked, Specifically, we enhance the Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) scheme to generate a heatmap-based visualization.
We call this technique Polarized-LRP and it consists of two parts i.e. positive
contribution heatmaps for ground truth images and negative contribution
heatmaps for generated images. Using the Galaxy Zoo dataset we demonstrate that
our method clearly reveals attention areas of the Discriminator when
differentiating generated galaxy images from ground truth images. To connect
the Discriminator's impact on the Generator, we visualize the gradual changes
of the Generator across the training process. An interesting result we have
achieved there is the detection of a problematic data augmentation procedure
that would else have remained hidden. We find that our proposed method serves
as a useful visual analytical tool for a deeper understanding of GAN models.

Oppenheimer-Snyder (OS) collapse in which the singularity resolution is modeled
using the effective dynamics of the spatially closed loop quantum cosmology.
Imposing the minimal junction conditions, namely the Israel-Darmois conditions,
we glue this bouncing LQC geometry to the classical vacuum exterior
Schwarzschild geometry across a time-like thin-shell. Consistency of the
construction leads to several major deviations from the classical OS collapse
model. Firstly, no trapped region can form and the bounce occurs always above,
or at most at the Schwarzschild radius. Secondly, the bouncing star discussed
here admits an IR cut-off, additionally to the UV cut-off and corresponds
therefore to a pulsating compact object. Thirdly, the scale at which quantum
gravity effects become non-negligible is encoded in the ratio between the UV
cut-off of the quantum theory and the IR cut-off, which in turn, encodes the
minimal energy density $\rho_{\text{min}}$ of the star prior to collapse. This
energy density is no more fixed by the mass and maximal radius as in the
classical OS model, but is now a free parameter of the model. In the end, while
the present model cannot describe a black-to-white hole bounce as initially
suggested by the Planck star model, it provides a concrete realization of a
pulsating compact object based on LQC techniques. Consistency of the model
shows that its regime of applicability is restricted to Planckian relics while
macroscopic stellar objects are excluded. This first minimal construction
should serve as a platform for further investigations in order to explore the
physics of bouncing compact objects within the framework of loop quantum
cosmology.

interferometer close to a semiconducting and metallic surface. The decoherence
was determined through a contrast loss at different beam path separations,
surface distances and conductibilities. To clarify the current literature

out three of them and got good agreement with a theory based on macroscopic

sequentially, preventing residual error passing among the links of the MTM with
uneven mass distribution. A corresponding gravity compensation controller was
developed to compensate the gravitational and disturbance forces. The method
was validated with extensive experiments in the majority of the manipulator's

of the European Joint Conferences on Theory and Practice of Software (ETAPS

  QAPL focuses on quantitative aspects of computations, which may refer to the
use of physical quantities (time, bandwidth, etc.) as well as mathematical
quantities (e.g., probabilities) for the characterisation of the behaviour and
for determining the properties of systems. Such quantities play a central role
in defining both the model of systems (architecture, language design,
semantics) and the methodologies and tools for the analysis and verification of
system properties. The aim of the QAPL workshop series is to discuss the
explicit use of time and probability and general quantities either directly in
the model or as a tool for the analysis or synthesis of systems.
  The 16th edition of QAPL also focuses on discussing the developments,
challenges and results in this area covered by our workshop in its nearly
20-year history.

region, where water is confined between a tapered fiber and a flat substrate,
is made possible by coating the probe with metal and opening a small aperture(
0.1 $\mu$m to 1 $\mu$m) at its end. A well-controlled cut using an ion beam
ensures desired lateral confinement area as well as adequate illumination of
the confinement gap. The probe is mounted on a tuning-fork based force sensor
to control the separation between the probe and the substrate with nm
precision. Fluctuations in fluorescence intensity due to diffusion of a dye
molecule in water confined between probe and the sample are recorded using a
confocal arrangement with a single photon precision. A Monte-Carlo method is
developed to determine the diffusion coefficient from the measured
autocorrelation of intensity fluctuations which accommodates the specific
geometry of confinement and the illumination profile. The instrument allows
measurement of diffusion laws under confinement. We found that the diffusion of
a tracer molecule is slowed down by more than ten times for the probe-substrate

For throughput tests, we use the Partial Drop Rate (PDR) to characterize a

new benchmarking methodologies as well as different SRv6 implementations. We

characteristics of legal and illegal channels. An embedding strategy is
proposed, and for a variant of it, we also make the corresponding analysis. For
accurately evaluating the performance of our approach, a theoretical model of
the noise in an illegal channel is established by using a generalized Gaussian
distribution. By comparing with the experimental results based on various
printers, scanners, and a mobile phone, it can be found that the sample
histogram and curve fitting of the theoretical model match well, so it can be
concluded that the theoretical model works well. For evaluating the security of
the proposed LCAC code, besides the direct-copying (DC) attack, the improved
version, which is the synthesized-copying (SC) attack, is also considered in
this paper. Based on the theoretical model, we build a prediction function to
optimize the parameters of our approach. The parameters optimization
incorporates the covertness requirement, the robustness requirement and a
tradeoff between the production cost and the cost of illegally-copying attacks
together. The experimental results show that the proposed LCAC code with two
printers and two scanners can detect the DC attack effectively and resist the
SC attack up to the access of 14 legal copies.

introduce two types of causal kinetic models that differ in how the randomness

Raman spectroscopy is limited by the maximum optical path length difference
that can be scanned within a short time in an interferometer. However,
alternatives to the Fourier-transform exist which can bypass this limitation
with certain assumptions. We apply one such approach to broadband coherent
Raman spectroscopy using interferometers with short delay line (low Fourier
spectral resolution) and large delay line (high Fourier spectral resolution).
With this method, we demonstrate broadband coherent Raman spectroscopy of
closely spaced vibrational bands is possible using a short delay line
interferometer, with superior spectral resolution to the longer delay line
instrument. We discuss how this approach may be particularly useful for more
complex Raman spectra, such as those measured from biological samples.

physics, chemistry, biology, computer vision, and social networks, to name a
few. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) were shown to be successful in
effectively representing graph structured data because of their good
performance and generalization ability. GNN is a deep learning based method
that learns a node representation by combining specific nodes and the
structural/topological information of a graph. However, like other deep models,
explaining the effectiveness of GNN models is a challenging task because of the
complex nonlinear transformations made over the iterations. In this paper, we
propose GraphLIME, a local interpretable model explanation for graphs using the
Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) Lasso, which is a nonlinear
feature selection method. GraphLIME is a generic GNN-model explanation
framework that learns a nonlinear interpretable model locally in the subgraph
of the node being explained. More specifically, to explain a node, we generate
a nonlinear interpretable model from its $N$-hop neighborhood and then compute
the K most representative features as the explanations of its prediction using
HSIC Lasso. Through experiments on two real-world datasets, the explanations of
GraphLIME are found to be of extraordinary degree and more descriptive in
comparison to the existing explanation methods.

metallic, as predicted by density functional theory calculations using

flakes are suggested to be magnetic insulators. Bernal flakes composed of an
even number of layers are insulating, while those composed of an odd number of

codes, we develop very accurate all-electron Gaussian basis sets for graphene
multilayers. We find that, in agreement with our previous calculations,
rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene are gapped for and magnetic. However,
the valence band curvature and the details of the electronic structure depend
crucially on the basis set. Only substantially extended basis sets are able to
correctly reproduce the effective mass of the valence band top at the K point,
while the popular POB-TZVP basis set leads to a severe overestimation. In the
case of Bernal stacking, we show that exact exchange gaps the flakes composed

pseudogap size and its behaviour as a function of thickness are not compatible

solution for 5 layers and a magnetic ground state for 5, 6 and 8 layers.
Magnetism is very weak with practically no effect on the electronic structure
and the magnetic moments are mostly concentrated in the central layers. Our
hybrid functional calculations on trilayer Bernal graphene multilayers are in

our calculations are a benchmark for manybody theoretical modeling of the low

finding is that the bulge stars at sub-solar metallicities, and that are older
than about eight billion years, does not show any sign of Li production, that
is, the Li trend with metallicity is flat (or even slightly declining). This
indicates that no lithium was produced during the first few billion years in
the history of the bulge. This finding is essentially identical to what is seen
for the (old) thick disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, and adds another
piece of evidence for a tight connection between the metal-poor bulge and the
Galactic thick disk. For the bulge stars younger than about eight billion
years, the sample contains a group of stars at very high metallicities at
[Fe/H]~+0.4 that have lithium abundances in the range A(Li)=2.6-2.8. In the
Solar neighbourhood the lithium abundances have been found to peak at a
A(Li)~3.3 at [Fe/H]~ +0.1 and then decrease by 0.4-0.5 dex when reaching
[Fe/H]~+0.4. The few bulge stars that we have at these metallicities, seem to
support this declining A(Li) trend. This could indeed support the recent claim
that the low A(Li) abundances at the highest metallicities seen in the Solar
neighbourhood could be due to stars from the inner disk, or the bulge region,
that have migrated to the Solar neighbourhood.

instabilities and fragmentation depends on the mass of its host star. We use 1D
disc models in conjunction with 3D SPH simulations to determine the critical
disc-to-star mass ratios at which discs become unstable against fragmentation,
finding that discs become increasingly prone to the effects of self-gravity as
we increase the host star mass. The actual limit for stability is sensitive to
the disc temperature, so if the disc is optically thin stellar irradiation can
dramatically stabilise discs against gravitational instability. However, even
when this is the case we find that discs around $2$M$_{\odot}$ stars are prone
to fragmentation, which will act to produce wide-orbit giant planets and brown

in principle support high disc-to-star mass ratios, and that higher mass stars
have discs that are more prone to fragmentation, which is qualitatively
consistent with observations that favour high-mass wide-orbit planets around
higher mass stars. We also find that the initial masses of these planets
depends on the temperature in the disc at large radii, which itself depends on

different models for the stellar luminosities. The critical disc-to-star mass
ratio for axisymmetry (for which we produce criteria) increases significantly
for low-mass stars. This could have important consequences for increasing the
potential mass reservoir in a proto Trappist-1 system, since even the efficient
Ormel et al. (2017) formation model will be influenced by processes like
external photoevaporation, which can rapidly and dramatically deplete the dust
reservoir. The aforementioned scaling of the critical $M_d/M_*$ for axisymmetry
occurs in part because the Toomre $Q$ parameter has a linear dependence on
surface density (which promotes instability) and only an $M_*^{1/2}$ dependence
on shear (which reduces instability), but also occurs because, for a given
$M_d/M_*$, the thermal evolution depends on the host star mass. The early phase
stellar irradiation of the disc (for which the luminosity is much higher than
at the zero age main sequence, particularly at low stellar masses) can also
play a key role in significantly reducing the role of self-gravity, meaning
that even Solar mass stars could support axisymmetric discs a factor two higher
in mass than usually considered possible. We apply our criteria to the DSHARP
discs with spirals, finding that self-gravity can explain the observed spirals
so long as the discs are optically thick to the host star irradiation.

nanorod arrays that are assembled by an advanced stacking method into
high-quality 3D woodpile structures. We observe intense and broad reflectivity
peak with stop bands that correspond to a broad gap in the photonic band
structures. The maximum reflectivity quickly reaches high values even for a few
crystal layers. Remarkably, the bandwidth of the stop bands hardly decreases
with increasing crystal thickness, in good agreement with FDTD simulations.
This behavior differs remarkably from the large changes observed earlier in
weakly interacting 3D photonic crystals. The nearly constant bandwidth and high
reflectivity are rationalized by multiple Bragg interference that occurs in
strongly interacting photonic band gap crystals, whereby the incident light
scatters from multiple reciprocal lattice vectors simultaneously, in particular
from oblique ones that are parallel to a longer crystal dimension and thus
experience hardly any finite size effects. Our new insights have favorable
consequences for the application of 3D photonic band gap crystals, notably

the one-loop effective action. The ultraviolet and infrared divergencies are
regularized by the energy cutoff in the Hamiltonian of the theory. The possible
infinite particle production is regulated by the corresponding counterdiabatic

losing their split pins. How to realize the automatic pin-missing defect
detection for bolts in transmission lines so as to achieve timely and efficient
trouble shooting is a difficult problem and the long-term research target of
power systems. In this paper, an automatic detection model called Automatic
Visual Shape Clustering Network (AVSCNet) for pin-missing defect is
constructed. Firstly, an unsupervised clustering method for the visual shapes
of bolts is proposed and applied to construct a defect detection model which
can learn the difference of visual shape. Next, three deep convolutional neural
network optimization methods are used in the model: the feature enhancement,
feature fusion and region feature extraction. The defect detection results are
obtained by applying the regression calculation and classification to the
regional features. In this paper, the object detection model of different
networks is used to test the dataset of pin-missing defect constructed by the
aerial images of transmission lines from multiple locations, and it is
evaluated by various indicators and is fully verified. The results show that
our method can achieve considerably satisfactory detection effect.

issues such as crystallisation and the glass and jamming transitions. Among the
available classes of soft colloids, microgels are emerging as the gold
standard. Since their great internal complexity makes their theoretical
characterization very hard, microgels are commonly modelled, at least in the
small-deformation regime, within the simple framework of linear elasticity
theory. Here we show that there exist conditions where its range of validity
can be greatly extended, providing strong numerical evidence that microgels
adsorbed at an interface follow the two-dimensional Hertzian theory, and hence
behave like 2D elastic particles, up to very large deformations, in stark
contrast to what found in bulk conditions. We are also able to estimate the
Young's modulus of the individual particles and, by comparing it with its
counterpart in bulk conditions, we demonstrate a significant stiffening of the
polymer network at the interface. Finally, by analyzing dynamical properties,
we predict multiple reentrant phenomena: by a continuous increase of particle
density, microgels first arrest and then re-fluidify due to the high
penetrability of their extended coronas. We observe this anomalous behavior in
a range of experimentally accessible conditions for small and loosely
crosslinked microgels. The present work thus establishes microgels at
interfaces as a new model system for fundamental investigations, paving the way
for the experimental synthesis and research on unique high-density liquidlike

a spatial correlation with the supplicant's one. In this setting, we assess and

reservoir in the second case. We perform a systematic investigation of the
rotational evolution using a grid of OB star models with surface magnetic
fields ($M_\star=5-60$ M$_\odot$, $\Omega/\Omega_{\rm crit} =0.2-1.0$, $B_{\rm

that magnetic massive stars arrive at the zero age main sequence with a range
of rotation rates, rather than with one common value. In particular, some stars
are required to have close-to-critical rotation at the ZAMS. However, magnetic
braking yields surface rotation rates converging to a common low value, making
it difficult to infer the initial rotation rates of evolved, slowly-rotating

Moreover, for any finite emitter, the modes form a compact set that can be
truncated. Each significant mode corresponds to one independent degree of

radar (SAR) images. However, speckle noise presented in SAR images has a much
negative effect on change detection. In this research, a novel two-phase
object-based deep learning approach is proposed for multi-temporal SAR image
change detection. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach
brings two main innovations. One is to classify all pixels into three
categories rather than two categories: unchanged pixels, changed pixels caused
by strong speckle (false changes), and changed pixels formed by real terrain
variation (real changes). The other is to group neighboring pixels into
segmented into superpixel objects (from pixels) such as to exploit local
spatial context. Two phases are designed in the methodology: 1) Generate
objects based on the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, and
discriminate these objects into changed and unchanged classes using fuzzy
c-means (FCM) clustering and a deep PCANet. The prediction of this Phase is the
set of changed and unchanged superpixels. 2) Deep learning on the pixel sets
over the changed superpixels only, obtained in the first phase, to discriminate
real changes from false changes. SLIC is employed again to achieve new
superpixels in the second phase. Low rank and sparse decomposition are applied
to these new superpixels to suppress speckle noise significantly. A further
clustering step is applied to these new superpixels via FCM. A new PCANet is
then trained to classify two kinds of changed superpixels to achieve the final
change maps. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with benchmark
methods, the proposed approach can distinguish real changes from false changes
effectively with significantly reduced false alarm rates, and achieve up to
99.71% change detection accuracy using multi-temporal SAR imagery.

control. Intense light fields have facilitated important milestones, such as
inducing novel states of matter, accelerating electrons ballistically, or
coherently flipping the valley pseudospin. These dynamics leave unique
signatures, such as characteristic bandgaps or high-order harmonic radiation.
The fastest and least dissipative way of switching the technologically most
important quantum attribute - the spin - between two states separated by a
potential barrier is to trigger an all-coherent precession. Pioneering
experiments and theory with picosecond electric and magnetic fields have
suggested this possibility, yet observing the actual dynamics has remained out
of reach. Here, we show that terahertz (1 THz = 10$^{12}$ Hz) electromagnetic
pulses allow coherent navigation of spins over a potential barrier and we
reveal the corresponding temporal and spectral fingerprints. This goal is
achieved by coupling spins in antiferromagnetic TmFeO$_{3}$ with the locally
enhanced THz electric field of custom-tailored antennas. Within their duration
of 1 ps, the intense THz pulses abruptly change the magnetic anisotropy and
trigger a large-amplitude ballistic spin motion. A characteristic phase flip,
an asymmetric splitting of the magnon resonance, and a long-lived offset of the
Faraday signal are hallmarks of coherent spin switching into adjacent potential
minima, in agreement with a numerical simulation. The switchable spin states
can be selected by an external magnetic bias. The low dissipation and the
antenna's sub-wavelength spatial definition could facilitate scalable spin
devices operating at THz rates.

improving performance of organizations. For that purpose, DEA analyses provide
information on both target setting and peer identification. However, the
identification of peers is actually a by-product of DEA. DEA models seek a
projection point of the unit under evaluation on the efficient frontier of the
production possibility set (PPS), which is used to set targets, while peers are
identified simply as the members of the so-called reference sets, which consist
of the efficient units that determine the projection point as a combination of
them. In practice, the selection of peers is crucial for the benchmarking,
because organizations need to identify a peer group in their sector or industry
that represent actual performances from which to learn. In this paper, we argue
that DEA benchmarking models should incorporate into their objectives criteria
for the selection of suitable benchmarks among peers, in addition to
considering the setting of appropriate targets (as usual). Specifically, we
develop models having two objectives: setting the closest targets and selecting
the most similar reference sets. Thus, we seek to establish targets that
require the less effort from organizations for their achievement in addition to
identifying peer groups with the most similar performances, which are potential
benchmarks to emulate and improve.

model, and (2) a texture transfer module to seamlessly integrate the warped
try-on cloth onto the target model image. Existing methods suffer from

introduce a multi-stage coarse-to-fine warping network to better model
fine-grained intricacies (while transforming the try-on cloth) and train it
with a novel perceptual geometric matching loss. Next, we introduce a try-on
cloth conditioned segmentation mask prior to improve the texture transfer
network. Finally, we also introduce a dueling triplet loss strategy for
training the texture translation network which further improves the quality of
the generated try-on results. We present extensive qualitative and quantitative

modest role for rotation in the atmospheric circulation. Nevertheless, there
exist a class of gas-giant, highly irradiated objects---brown dwarfs orbiting
white dwarfs in extremely tight orbits---whose orbital and hence rotation
periods are as short as 1-2 hours. Phase curves and other observations have
already been obtained for this class of objects, raising fundamental questions
about the role of increasing planetary rotation rate in controlling the
circulation. So far, most modeling studies have investigated rotation periods
exceeding a day, as appropriate for typical hot Jupiters. Here we investigate
atmospheric circulation of tidally locked atmospheres with decreasing rotation
periods down to 2.5 hours. With decreasing rotation period, the width of the
equatorial eastward jet decreases, consistent with the narrowing of the
equatorial waveguide due to a decrease of the equatorial deformation radius.
The eastward-shifted equatorial hot spot offset decreases accordingly, and the
off-equatorial westward-shifted hot areas become increasingly distinctive. At
high latitudes, winds become weaker and more rotationally dominated. The
day-night temperature contrast becomes larger due to the stronger influence of
rotation. Our simulated atmospheres exhibit variability, presumably caused by
instabilities and wave interactions. Unlike typical hot Jupiter models, thermal
phase curves of rapidly rotating models show a near alignment of peak flux to
secondary eclipse. This result helps to explain why, unlike hot Jupiters, many
brown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs exhibit IR flux peaks aligned with secondary
eclipse. Our results have important implications for understanding
fast-rotating, tidally locked atmospheres.

that all processes in a distributed system deliver the same set of messages.
The reason why this primitive is appealing is twofold: (i) we can implement it
deterministically in a completely asynchronous environment, unlike stronger
primitives like consensus and total-order broadcast, and yet (ii) reliable
broadcast is powerful enough to implement important applications like payment
systems.
  The problem we tackle in this paper is that of dynamic reliable broadcast,
i.e., enabling processes to join or leave the system. This property is
desirable for long-lived applications (aiming to be highly available), yet has
been precluded in previous asynchronous reliable broadcast protocols. We study
this property in a general adversarial (i.e., Byzantine) environment.
  We introduce the first specification of a dynamic Byzantine reliable
broadcast (DBRB) primitive that is amenable to an asynchronous implementation.
We then present an algorithm implementing this specification in an asynchronous
network. Our DBRB algorithm ensures that if any correct process in the system
broadcasts a message, then every correct process delivers that message unless
it leaves the system. Moreover, if a correct process delivers a message, then
every correct process that has not expressed its will to leave the system
delivers that message. We assume that more than $2/3$ of processes in the
system are correct at all times, which is tight in our context.
  We also show that if only one process in the system can fail---and it can
fail only by crashing---then it is impossible to implement a stronger
primitive, ensuring that if any correct process in the system broadcasts or
delivers a message, then every correct process in the system delivers that
message---including those that leave.

contains the heterogeneity of investors' beliefs to explain the mechanisms by
which corporate governance improves liquidity of the corporate stocks. In this
process we found that the existence of noise traders who are semi-informed in
the market is an important condition for corporate governance to have the
effect of improving liquidity of the stocks. We further find that the strength
of this effect is affected by the degree of noise traders' participation in

higher energy densities while also being safer than conventional liquid

lithium (dendrites) across the solid state electrolyte layer leads to premature
shorting of cells and limits their practical viability. The microscopic
mechanisms that lead to lithium dendrite growth in solid state cells are still
unclear. Using garnet based lithium ion conductor as a model solid state
electrolyte, we show that interfacial void growth during lithium dissolution
precedes dendrite nucleation and growth. Using a simple electrostatic model, we
show that current density at the edges of the voids could be amplified by as
much as four orders of magnitude making the cells highly susceptible to
dendrite growth after void formation. We propose the use of metallic
interlayers with low solubility and high nucleation overpotential for lithium
to delay void growth. These interlayers increase dendrite growth tolerance in
solid state electrolytes without the undue necessity for high stack pressures.

the strength of their contribution determined. This method could be used to
systematically improve phonon fragment calculations. More interestingly, using
the atom-projected vibrational spectra of the defect atoms directly, it is
possible to obtain a well-converged defect spectrum at lower computational
cost, which also incorporates the host-lattice interactions. Using diamond as
the host material, four test case defects, each presenting a distinctly
different vibrational behaviour, are considered: a heavy substitutional dopant
(Eu), two intrinsic defects (neutral vacancy and split interstitial), and the
negatively charged N-vacancy center. The heavy dopant and split interstitial
present localized modes at low and high frequencies, respectively, showing
little overlap with the host spectrum. In contrast, the neutral vacancy and the
N-vacancy center show a broad contribution to the upper spectral range of the
host spectrum, making them challenging to extract. Independent of the
vibrational behaviour, the main atoms contributing to the defect spectrum can
be clearly identified. Recombination of their atom-projected spectra results in
the isolated defect spectrum.

combined with the coherent potential approximation for an effective-medium

disorder-induced vertex corrections to the spin stiffness. The calculated
concentration dependence of the spin-wave stiffness of random fcc Ni-Fe alloys
can be ascribed to a variation of the reciprocal value of alloy magnetization.
Calculations for random iron-rich bcc Fe-Al alloys reveal that their spin-wave
stiffness is strongly reduced owing to the atomic ordering; this effect takes
place due to weakly coupled local magnetic moments of Fe atoms surrounded by a
reduced number of Fe nearest neighbors.

and binary AGN -- probing the scale where SMBHs are bound in a Keplerian binary
-- is an observational challenge. The study of AGN pairs (either dual or
binary) also represents an overarching theoretical problem in cosmology and
astrophysics. The AGN triggering calls for detailed knowledge of the
hydrodynamical conditions of gas in the imminent surroundings of the SMBHs and,
at the same time, their duality calls for detailed knowledge on how galaxies
assemble through major and minor mergers and grow fed by matter along the

proposes new avenues for their search. The current observational status is

shape optimization problems, which are subjected to linear elasticity
constraints and involve a special class of shape functionals which calculate
the failure rate of a mechanically loaded device w.r.t. the component shape.
These objectives are ill-defined for $H^1$-solutions of the state equation and
the shape derivatives are not defined for $H^1$-material derivatives. Thus, the
resulting optimal reliability problems can not be solved by the already
existing methods of shape calculus. We develop a general concept on Banach and
Hilbert spaces which is based on parameter depending variational equations,
classical PDE Solutions, Schauder estimates and compact embeddings and which
allows to transfer differentiability in lower Banach space topologies to higher
ones. We apply this framework to the linear elasticity equation and its
variational formulation, given that the domain is transformed according to the
speed method. We prove the existence of material and local shape derivatives in
H\""older spaces, the existence of shape derivatives and derive adjoint
equations. We also give a classification of the $L^2$-shape gradient w.r.t. its
regularity and its potential to sustain the domain regularity along a descent

family of retractions called $r$-skeleton (see \cite{kubis1}). Also we know
that there are compact spaces with $r$-skeletons which are not Valdivia. In
this paper, we shall study $r$-squeletons and special families of closed
subsets of compact spaces. We prove that if $X$ is a zero-dimensional compact
space and $\{r_s:s\in \Gamma\}$ is an $r$-skeleton on $X$ such that $|r_s(X)|
\leq \omega$ for all $s\in \Gamma$, then $X$ has a dense subset consisting of
isolated points. Also we give conditions to an $r$-skeleton in order that this
$r$-skeleton can be extended to an $r$-skeleton on the Alexandroff Duplicate of
the base space. The standard definition of a Valdivia compact spaces is via a
$\Sigma$-product of a power of the unit interval. Following this fact we
introduce the notion of $\pi$-skeleton on a compact space $X$ by embedding $X$
in a suitable power of the unit interval together with a pair
$(\mathcal{F},\varphi)$, where $\mathcal{F}$ is family of metric separable
subspaces of $X$ and $\varphi$ an $\omega$-monotone function which satisfy
certain properties. This new notion generalize the idea of a $\Sigma$-product.
  We prove that a compact space admits a retractional-skeleton iff it admits a
$\pi$-skeleton. This equivalence allows to give a new proof of the fact that
the product of compact spaces with retractional-skeletons admits an
retractional-skeleton (see \cite{cuth1}). In \cite{casa1}, the Corson compact
spaces are characterized by a special family of closed subsets. Following this
direction, we introduce the notion of weak $c$-skeleton which under certain

orbital basis set. The method is used to obtain the Raman spectra of 733
different monolayers selected from the computational 2D materials database

  for numerical homogenization",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerical multiscale methods usually rely on some coupling between a
macroscopic and a microscopic model. The macroscopic model is incomplete as
effective quantities, such as the homogenized material coefficients or fluxes,
are missing in the model. These effective data need to be computed by running
local microscale simulations followed by a local averaging of the microscopic
information. Motivated by the classical homogenization theory, it is a common
practice to use local elliptic cell problems for computing the missing
homogenized coefficients in the macro model. Such a consideration results in a
first order error $O(\varepsilon/\delta)$, where $\varepsilon$ represents the
wavelength of the microscale variations and $\delta$ is the size of the
microscopic simulation boxes. This error, called ""resonance error"", originates
from the boundary conditions used in the micro-problem and typically dominates
all other errors in a multiscale numerical method. Optimal decay of the
resonance error remains an open problem, although several interesting
approaches reducing the effect of the boundary have been proposed over the last
two decades. In this paper, as an attempt to resolve this problem, we propose a
computationally efficient, fully elliptic approach with exponential decay of
the resonance error.

conversational questions can be answered by only looking at the image without
any access to the context history, while others still need the conversation
context to predict the correct answers. We demonstrate that due to this reason,
previous joint-modality (history and image) models over-rely on and are more
prone to memorizing the dialogue history (e.g., by extracting certain keywords

generalizable (because they cannot memorize or extract keywords from history)

Hence, this observation encourages us to explicitly maintain two models, i.e.,
an image-only model and an image-history joint model, and combine their
complementary abilities for a more balanced multimodal model. We present
multiple methods for this integration of the two models, via ensemble and
consensus dropout fusion with shared parameters. Empirically, our models
achieve strong results on the Visual Dialog challenge 2019 (rank 3 on NDCG and

scales from 50 to 500~au and search for Keplerian rotation. We used
high-angular-resolution line observations obtained with the Plateau de Bure
Interferometer as part of the CALYPSO large program. From $\mathrm{^{13}CO}$
($J=2-1$), $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ ($J=2-1$) and SO ($N_{j}=5_{6}-4_{5}$) moment
maps, we find that seven sources show rotation about the jet axis at a few

NGC1333-IRAS4B, and SVS13-B. We analyzed the kinematics of these sources in the
$uv$ plane to derive the rotation profiles down to 50~au scales. We find
evidence for Keplerian rotation in only two sources, L1527 and L1448-C.
Overall, this suggests that Keplerian disks larger than 50 au are uncommon

could be optically thick and dominated by the envelope emission. Due to the
optical thickness of these envelopes, some of the disks could have remained

Network. In this framework, a specific role is assumed by short and long-range
interactions, and hence by the distance, between countries. Therefore, we
identify clusters through a new procedure that exploits Estrada communicability
distance and the vibrational communicability distance, which turn out to be
particularly suitable for catching the inner structure of the economic network.
The proposed methodology aims at finding the distance threshold that maximizes
a specific modularity function defined for general metric spaces. Main
advantages regard the computational efficiency of the procedure as well as the
possibility to inspect intercluster and intracluster properties of the
resulting communities. The numerical analysis highlights peculiar relationships
between countries and provides a rich set of information that can hardly be
achieved within alternative clustering approaches.

spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile,
detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an
arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to
discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network
(RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account
the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion
in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial
characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional
graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to
explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up
propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of
rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation, and a GCN with an
opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor
dispersion. Moreover, the information from the source post is involved in each
layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging
empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed
method over the state-of-the-art approaches.

It is important to establish the details of how massive stars provide

issues is an understanding of the evolution of massive stars, and the critical
role of mass loss via strongly structured winds and stellar binarity.
Ultimately, massive stellar clusters shape the structure and energetics of
galaxies. We aim to conduct high-resolution, deep field mapping at 21cm of the
core of the massive Cygnus OB2 association and to characterise the properties
of the massive stars and colliding winds at this waveband. We used seven
stations of the e-MERLIN radio facility, with its upgraded bandwidth and
enhanced sensitivity to conduct a 21cm census of Cygnus OB2. Based on 42 hours
of observations, seven overlapping pointings were employed over multiple epochs
during 2014 resulting in 1 sigma sensitivities down to ~21microJy and a
resolution of ~180mas. A total of 61 sources are detected at 21cm over a
~0.48deg x 0.48deg region centred on the heart of the Cyg OB2 association. Of
these 61 sources, 33 are detected for the first time. We detect a number of
previously identified sources including four massive stellar binary systems,
two YSOs, and several known X-ray and radio sources. We also detect the LBV
candidate (possible binary system) and blue hypergiant (BHG) star of Cyg OB2
#12. The 21cm observations secured in the COBRaS Legacy project provide data to
constrain conditions in the outer wind regions of massive stars; determine the
non-thermal properties of massive interacting binaries; examine evidence for
transient sources, including those associated with young stellar objects; and
provide unidentified sources that merit follow-up observations. The 21cm data
are of lasting value and will serve in combination with other key surveys of

spin, heat, and charge. The extensive thermodynamic quantity associated with
spin transport is the magnetization; its Onsager-conjugate force is in general
the derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetization. Spins are
carried in one of two ways: (1) by spin-polarized free electrons in magnetic
metals and doped semiconductors, or (2) by spin waves (magnons) that reside on
localized electrons on unfilled d- or f-shells of transition metal or
rare-earth elements. The paper covers both cases in separate chapters. In both
cases, it is possible to define a spin chemical potential whose gradient is the
more practical conjugate force to spin transport. The paper further describes
the anomalous Hall, spin Hall, and inverse spin Hall effects in magnetic and
non-magnetic solids with strong spin-orbit coupling because these effects are
used to generate and measure spin fluxes. Spin transport across interfaces is
described next, and includes spin pumping and spin transfer torque. The final
chapter then puts all these concepts together to describe the spin-Seebeck,
spin-Peltier, and magnon-drag effects, which exist in ferromagnetic,
antiferromagnetic, and even paramagnetic solids. Magnon-drag, in particular, is
a high-temperature effect that boosts the thermopower of metals by an order of
magnitude and that of semiconductors by a factor of 2 or 3 above the electronic
diffusion thermopower. This is the only example where a spin-driven effect is
larger than a charge-driven effect. Magnon drag leads a simple binary
paramagnetic semiconductor, MnTe, to have zT > 1 without optimization. This
shows how adding spin as an additional design parameter in thermoelectrics
research is a new and promising approach toward the quest for high-zT
materials.

dissolution of cell assemblies in the context of varying oscillatory states.
Here, we describe the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of cell assemblies
through temporal network formalism. We use a sliding window approach to extract
sequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus
and enthorinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise
functional connectivity properties evolve along time. First, we find that
information sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure
in which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units
link to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating
to the core or to the periphery substantially change across time-windows.
Second, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this
continuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between
network states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to
the core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory
states. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that
cells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory
cells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only
poorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells.
Cells can also change temporal connectivity style when the network changes
state. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information
mediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and enthorinal cortex cell
assemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been
identified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional
connectivity.

spin configurations and both are considered in this calculation. We use an
updated vertex functions, and inspired by the flavor SU(3) symmetry, we also
provide a new approach to derive the flavor-spin factors. With the obtained
transition form factors, we perform a phenomenological study of the
corresponding semi-leptonic decays of doubly heavy baryons induced by the $c\to

discs show signatures of young moderately massive planets. I show that this
result is paradoxical. The planets should evolve away from their observed
states by radial migration and gas accretion in about 1\% of the system age.
These systems should then hatch tens of giant planets in their lifetime, and
there should exist a very large population of bright planet-less discs; none of
this is observationally supported. An alternative scenario, in which the
population of bright ALMA discs is dominated by secondary discs recently
rejuvenated by deposition of new gas, is proposed. The data are well explained
if the gaseous mass of the discs is comparable to a Jovian planet mass, and
they last a small fraction of a Million years. Self-disruptions of dusty gas
giant protoplanets, previously predicted in the context of the Tidal Downsizing
theory of planet formation, provide a suitable mechanism for such injections of
new fuel, and yield disc and planet properties commensurate with ALMA
observations. If this scenario is correct, then the secondary discs have
gas-to-dust ratios considerably smaller than 100, and long look ALMA and
NIR/optical observations of dimmer targets should uncover dusty, not yet
disrupted, gas clumps with sizes of order an AU. Alternatively, secondary discs
could originate from late external deposition of gas into the system, in which
case we expect widespread signatures of warped outer discs that have not yet
come into alignment with the planets.

blind narrow-band Halpha+[NII] imaging survey of the Virgo cluster carried out
with MegaCam at the Canada-French-Hawaii telescope (CFHT). We use a new set of
data extracted from VESTIGE to study the impact of the hostile cluster
environment on the star formation process down to the scale of HII regions (~
50 pc). HII regions are identified and their parameters measured using the
HIIphot code on a sample of 114 late-type galaxies spanning a wide range in
morphological type (Sa-Sd, Im, BCD), stellar mass (10^6.5 <= M_star <= 10^11
Mo), and star formation activity (10^-3 <= SFR <= 10 Mo yr^-1). Owing to the
exquisite average resolution of the VESTIGE data (0.65 arcsec), we detect 11302
HII regions with an Halpha luminosity L(Halpha) >= 10^37 erg s^-1. We show that
the typical number of HII regions in gas-stripped objects is significantly
lower than in healthy late-types of similar stellar mass. We also show that in
these gas-stripped galaxies the number of HII regions significantly drops
outside the effective radius, suggesting that the quenching process occurs
outside-in, in agreement with other multifrequency observations. These new
results consistently confirm that the main mechanism responsible for the
decrease of the star formation activity observed in cluster galaxies is ram
pressure, allowing us to discard other milder processes such as starvation or
strangulation unable to reproduce the observed radially truncated profiles.

combinatorics with important implications for theoretical computer science. In
particular, it yields a very elegant proof of Kruskal's theorem. At the same
time, it is known that Kruskal's theorem does not require the full strength of
the minimal bad sequence argument. This claim can be made precise in the
framework of reverse mathematics, where the existence of minimal bad sequences
is equivalent to a principle known as $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension, which is much
stronger than Kruskal's theorem. In the present paper we give a uniform version
of Kruskal's theorem by relativizing it to certain transformations of well
partial orders. We show that $\Pi^1_1$-comprehension is equivalent to our
uniform Kruskal theorem (over $\mathbf{RCA}_0$ together with the
chain-antichain principle). This means that any proof of the uniform Kruskal
theorem must entail the existence of minimal bad sequences. As a by-product of
our investigation, we obtain uniform proofs of several Kruskal-type
independence results.

kinematics of a periodic orbit depends only on $(m',j')$, the irreducible
(relatively prime) version of $(m,j)$. In a rotating frame, the periodic orbit
has $j'$ braids, $|m'|$ identical sectors and $|m'|(j'-1)$ self-crossing
points; (2) thus, Lindblad resonances (with $j=1$) are free of self-crossing
points; (3) resonances with same $j'$ and opposite $m'$ have the same
kinematics, and are called $twins$; (4) the order of a resonance at a given
$n/\Omega$ depends on the symmetry of the potential. A potential that is
invariant under a $2\pi/k$-rotation creates only resonances with $m$ multiple
of $k$; (5) resonances with same $j$ and opposite $m$ have the same kinematics
and same dynamics, and are called $true~twins$; (6) A retrograde resonance
($n/\Omega < 0$) is always of higher order than its prograde counterpart
($n/\Omega > 0$); (7) the resonance strengths can be calculated in a compact

To suppress the formation of these defects, we explore the synthesis of GaN
nanowires at temperatures up to 915 ${\deg}C$ enabled by the use of thermally
stable TiN$_x$/Al$_2$O$_3$ substrates. These samples exhibit indeed bound
exciton decay times approaching those measured for state-of-the-art bulk GaN.
However, the decay time is not correlated with the growth temperature, but
rather with the nanowire diameter. The inverse dependence of the decay time on
diameter suggests that the nonradiative process in GaN nanowires is not
controlled by the defect density, but by the field ionization of excitons in
the radial electric field caused by surface band bending. We propose a unified
mechanism accounting for nonradiative recombination in GaN nanowires of

10%. Equipped with this module, the search method can reduce the latency by 20%

being transplanted to a wide range of hardware platforms with very few efforts,

configuration space doesn't grow exponentially as a function of the degrees of
freedom. The use of scaling expansions is a natural way to measure the
asymptotic growth of the configuration space volume in terms of the scaling
exponents of the system. These scaling exponents can, in turn, be used to
define universality classes that uniquely determine the statistics of a system.
Every system belongs to one of these classes. Here we derive the information
geometry of scaling expansions of sample spaces. In particular, we present the
deformed logarithms and the metric in a systematic and coherent way. We observe
a phase transition for the curvature. The phase transition can be well measured
by the characteristic length r, corresponding to a ball with radius 2r having
the same curvature as the statistical manifold. Increasing characteristic
length with respect to the size of the system is associated with
sub-exponential sample space growth is associated with strongly constrained and
correlated complex systems. Decreasing of the characteristic length corresponds
to super-exponential sample space growth that occurs for example in systems
that develop structure as they evolve. Constant curvature means exponential
sample space growth that is associated with multinomial statistics, and
traditional Boltzmann-Gibbs, or Shannon statistics applies. This allows us to
characterize transitions between statistical manifolds corresponding to
different families of probability distributions.

injective modules is in $\widetilde{\mathcal{GI}}$. (3) Every complex in
$dw(\mathcal{GI})$ is dg-Gorenstein injective. We show that the analogue result
for complexes of flat and Gorenstein flat modules also holds over arbitrary
rings. if moreover, the ring is $n$-perfect for some integer $n \ge 0$, then
the three equivalent statements for flat and Gorenstein flat modules are also
equivalent with their counterparts for projective and projectively coresolved
Gorenstein flat modules. We also prove the following characterization of
Gorenstein rings: Let $R$ be a commutative coherent ring. The following
statements are equivalent: (1) every exact complex of FP-injective modules has
all its cycles Ding injective modules. (2) every exact complex of injectives
has all its cycles Ding injective modules and every $R$-module M such that
$M^+$ is Gorenstein flat is Ding injective. If moreover the ring $R$ has finite
Krull dimension then statements (1), (2) above are also equivalent to (3) $R$
is a Gorenstein ring (in the sense of Iwanaga).

develops a novel approach, which bounds the solution norms, derives the
corresponding stability criteria, and estimates the trapping/stability regions
for some nonautonomous and nonlinear systems, which arise in various
application domains. Our inferences rest on deriving a scalar differential
inequality for the norms of solutions to the initial systems. Utility of the
Lipschitz inequality linearizes the associated auxiliary differential equation
and yields both the upper bounds for the norms of solutions and the relevant
stability criteria. To refine these inferences, we introduce a nonlinear
extension of the Lipschitz inequality, which improves the developed bounds and
allows estimation of the stability basins and trapping regions for the

Trees (BART) in such settings. First, we compare BART to several approaches
that have been proposed for continuous outcomes, including inverse probability
of treatment weighting (IPTW), targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE),
vector matching and regression adjustment. Results suggest that under
conditions of non-linearity and non-additivity of both the treatment assignment
and outcome generating mechanisms, BART, TMLE and IPTW using generalized
boosted models (GBM) provide better bias reduction and smaller root mean
squared error. BART and TMLE provide more consistent 95 per cent CI coverage
and better large-sample convergence property. Second, we supply BART with a
strategy to identify a common support region for retaining inferential units
and for avoiding extrapolating over areas of the covariate space where common
support does not exist. BART retains more inferential units than the
generalized propensity score based strategy, and shows lower bias, compared to
TMLE or GBM, in a variety of scenarios differing by the degree of covariate
overlap. A case study examining the effects of three surgical approaches for
non-small cell lung cancer demonstrates the methods.

being automated by deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on real-world data.
Driven partly by rapidly-expanding literature on DNN approximation theory
showing they can approximate a rich variety of functions, such tools are
increasingly being considered for problems in scientific computing. Yet, unlike
traditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the
principles of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational
efficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational
framework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical
performance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of
different widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including
smooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class
methods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main
conclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the
approximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs
performing relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong
approximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in
comparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap
further, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical
existence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training
procedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key
theoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy
guaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class
schemes. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the promise of practical DNN approx., by
highlighting potential for better schemes through careful design of DNN
architectures and training strategies.

(RP). Then, Carnap used the logical probability increment as the confirmation
measure. So far, many confirmation measures have been proposed. Measure F among
them proposed by Kemeny and Oppenheim possesses symmetries and asymmetries
proposed by Elles and Fitelson, monotonicity proposed by Greco et al., and
normalizing property suggested by many researchers. Based on the semantic
information theory, a measure b* similar to F is derived from the medical test.
Like the likelihood ratio, b* and F can only indicate the quality of channels
or the testing means instead of the quality of probability predictions. And, it
is still not easy to use b*, F, or another measure to clarify the RP. For this
reason, measure c* similar to the correct rate is derived. The c* has the
simple form: (a-c)/max(a, c); it supports the Nicod Criterion and undermines
the Equivalence Condition, and hence, can be used to eliminate the RP. Some
examples are provided to show why it is difficult to use one of popular
confirmation measures to eliminate the RP. Measure F, b*, and c* indicate that
fewer counterexamples' existence is more essential than more positive examples'
existence, and hence, are compatible with Popper's falsification thought.

Markov operators (acting on abstract state spaces) with respect to a projection
$P$, has been introduced and studied. It turned out that the introduced
coefficient was more effective than the usual ergodicity coefficient. In the
present work, by means of a left consistent Markov projections and the
generalized Dobrushin's ergodicity coefficient, we investigate uniform and weak
$P$-ergodicities of non-homogeneous discrete Markov chains (NDMC) on abstract
state spaces. It is easy to show that uniform $P$-ergodicity implies a weak
one, but in general the reverse is not true. Therefore, some conditions are
provided together with weak $P$-ergodicity of NDMC which imply its uniform
$P$-ergodicity. Furthermore, necessary and sufficient conditions are found by
means of the Doeblin's condition for the weak $P$-ergodicity of NDMC. The weak
$P$-ergodicity is also investigated in terms of perturbations. Several
perturbative results are obtained which allow us to produce nontrivial examples
of uniform and weak $P$-ergodic NDMC. Moreover, some category results are also
obtained. We stress that all obtained results have potential applications in
the classical and non-commutative probabilities.

Identification of Chimera, on one hand is essential due to its applicability in
various areas including neuroscience, and on other hand is challenging due to
its widely varied appearance in different systems and the peculiar nature of
its profile. Therefore, a simple yet universal method for its identification
remains an open problem. Here, we present a very distinctive approach using
machine learning techniques to characterize different dynamical phases and
identify the chimera state from given spatial profiles generated using various
different models. The experimental results show that the performance of the
classification algorithms varies for different dynamical models. The machine
learning algorithms, namely random forest, oblique random forest based on
tikhonov, parallel-axis split and null space regularization achieved more than
$96\% $ accuracy for the Kuramoto model. For the logistic-maps, random forest
and tikhonov regularization based oblique random forest showed more than $90\%$

than $80\%$ accuracy. The oblique random forest with null space regularization
achieved consistent performance (more than $83\%$ accuracy) across different
dynamical models while the auto-encoder based random vector functional link

direction for employing machine learning techniques to identify dynamical

cause huge changes in outputs. When the parameter varies within a certain time
scale, the rate will affect the tipping behaviors. These behaviors are
undesirable in thermoacoustic systems, which are widely used in aviation, power
generation and other industries. Thus, this paper aims at considering the
tipping behaviors of the thermoacoustic system with the time-varying parameters
and the combined excitations of additive and multiplicative colored noises.
Transient dynamical behaviors for the proposed thermoacoustic model are
implemented through the reduced Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation derived by a
standard stochastic averaging method. Then, the tipping problems of the
rate-dependent thermoacoustic systems with random fluctuations are studied by
virtue of the obtained probability density functions. Our results show that the
rate delays the value of the tipping parameter compared to the one with the
quasi-steady assumption, which is called as a rate-dependent tipping-delay
phenomenon. Besides, the influences of the initial values, the rate, the
changing time of the parameters, and the correlation time of the noises on the
rate-dependent tipping-delay phenomenon are analyzed in detail. These results
are of great significance for research in related fields such as aviation and

calculates the alignment and cohesion and then uses these behaviors with the

weights, the FDO uses the weight factor (wf), which is zero in most cases and
one in only a few cases. Conversely, the IFDO performs wf randomization in the
[0-1] range and then minimizes the range when a better fitness weight value is
achieved. In this work, the IFDO algorithm and its method of converging on the
optimal solution are demonstrated. Additionally, 19 classical standard test
function groups are utilized to test the IFDO, and then the FDO and three other
well-known algorithms, namely, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO), dragonfly
algorithm (DA), and genetic algorithm (GA), are selected to evaluate the IFDO
results. Furthermore, the CECC06 2019 Competition, which is the set of IEEE

category without glasses, more than 85% for the category night without glasses.
On average, more than 83% of accuracy was achieved in all categories. Moreover,
as for model size, complexity and storage, there is a marked reduction in the
new proposed model in comparison to the benchmark model where the maximum size
is 75 KB. The proposed CNN based model can be used to build a real-time driver
drowsiness detection system for embedded systems and Android devices with high
accuracy and ease of use.

nowadays, differ in their design, goals, and characteristics. Users who have to
decide which simulator is the most appropriate for their particular
requirements, are today lost, faced with a panoply of disparate and diverse
simulators. Hence, it is obvious the need for establishing guidelines that
support users in the tasks of selecting a simulator to suit their preferences
and needs. In previous works, we proposed a generic and novel approach to
evaluate networks simulators, considering a methodological process and a set of
qualitative and quantitative criteria. In particularly, for WSN simulators, the
criteria include relevant aspects for this kind of networks, such as energy
consumption modelling and scalability capacity. The aims of this work are: (i)
describe deeply the criteria related to WSN aspects; (ii) extend and update the
state of the art of WSN simulators elaborated in our previous works to identify
the most used and cited in scientific articles; and (iii) demonstrate the
suitability of our novel methodological approach by evaluating and comparing
the three most cited simulators, specially in terms of energy modelling and
scalability capacities. Results show that our proposed approach provides
researchers with an evaluation tool that can be used to describe and compare
WSN simulators in order to select the most appropriate one for a given scenario
