Quaternionic World of Ambidextral Reality"" by Joy~Christian, published in IEEE
Access. Christian's model does not generate the singlet correlations but in
fact simply reproduces the Bertlmann effect. John Bell's friend and colleague
Reinhold Bertlmann of CERN, in his younger days, always wore one pink and one
blue sock, at random. The moment you saw his left foot, you knew what colour
sock would be on his right foot. Action at a distance? As John Bell liked to
explain, quantum entanglement cannot be explained away in such an easy way. Yet
Christian's model assigns the two particles of the EPR-B experiment an equal
and opposite spin at the source, the choice being determined by a fair coin
toss. However they are measured, these spins are recovered. Christian's
computer simulation works by not actually simulating his model at all but by
almost directly tracing the negative cosine built into his computer algebra
package. Bell's theorem has not been disproved. Debate as to what it means for
the foundations of physics as well as for quantum information engineering
(quantum communication, computation) is more lively today than ever before.
Christian's paper, alas, does not contribute to the debate, but distracts from
it. A possible role for Geometric Algebra is still wide open and deserves
further investigation, informed by a proper understanding of the mathematical
content of Bell's theorem.

the self-adjoint part of a C*-algebra. Using a quantum logical setting, it is
shown that this can be achieved by postulating that there is a locally
tomographic model for a composite system consisting of two copies of the same
system. Local tomography is a feature of classical probability theory and
quantum mechanics; it means that state tomography for a multipartite system can
be performed by simultaneous measurements in all subsystems. The quantum
logical definition of local tomography is sufficient, but it is less restictive
than the prevalent definition in the literature and involves some subtleties
concerning the so-called spin factors.

is spread out over the real line, and the two firms simultaneously choose
location in this same space. When buying from one of the firms, consumers incur
the fixed price plus some transportation costs, which are increasing with their
distance to the firm. Under the assumption that each consumer is ready to buy
one unit of the good whatever the locations of the firms, firms converge to the
median location: there is ""minimal differentiation"". In this article, we relax
this assumption and assume that there is an upper limit to the distance a
consumer is ready to cover to buy the good. We show that the game always has at
least one Nash equilibrium in pure strategy. Under this more general
assumption, the ""minimal differentiation principle"" no longer holds in general.
At equilibrium, firms choose ""minimal"", ""intermediate"" or ""full""
differentiation, depending on this critical distance a consumer is ready to

through each user delay exponents in their effective capacity (EC). We propose
novel closed form expressions for the EC of the NOMA users and validate them

high signal to noise ratio (SNR) region, the strong NOMA user has a limited EC
no matter how large the transmit SNR is, under the same delay constraint as the
weak user. We show that for the weak user OMA achieves higher EC than NOMA at
small values of the transmit SNR and that NOMA become more beneficial at high
values of the transmit SNR. For the strong user, we show that NOMA achieves a
higher EC than OMA at small values of the transmit SNR and that at high values
of the transmit SNR OMA becomes more beneficial. By introducing user pairing
when more than two NOMA users are present, we show that NOMA with user pairing
outperforms OMA in term of the total link layer EC. Finally, we find the set of

behaviour of a model cluster crystal formed by ultrasoft particles under shear.
We investigate the evolution of stress as a function of strain for different
shear rates, $\dot{\gamma}$, and temperatures. The stress-strain relation
displays a pronounced maximum at the yielding point; the height of this
maximum, $\sigma_\text{p}$, increases via a power law with an increasing shear
range and tends to saturate to a finite value if the limit shear rate goes to
zero (at least within the considered temperature range). Interestingly, this
behaviour can be captured by the Herschel-Bulkley type model which, for a given
temperature, allows us to predict a static yield stress $\sigma^{0}_\text{p}$
(in the shear rate tending to zero limit), a characteristic timescale
$\tau_\text{c}$, and the exponent $\alpha$ of the above-mentioned power-law
decay of the $\sigma_\text{p}$ at high shear rates. Furthermore, for different
temperatures, the $\sigma_\text{p}$ can be scaled as functions of
$\dot{\gamma}$ onto a single master curve when scaled by corresponding
$\tau_\text{c}$ and ${\sigma}_\text{p}^{0}$. Moreover, for a given shear rate,
$\sigma_\text{p}$ displays a logarithmic dependence on temperature. Again, the

next generation of intelligent in-memory computing systems that can act and
learn locally at the edge. However, current approaches to in-memory machine
learning focus often on the implementation of models and algorithms which
cannot be reconciled with the true, physical properties of resistive memory.
Consequently, these properties, in particular cycle-to-cycle conductance
variability, are considered as non-idealities that require mitigation. Here by
contrast, we embrace these properties by selecting a more appropriate machine
learning model and algorithm. We implement a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling
algorithm within a fabricated array of 16,384 devices, configured as a Bayesian
machine learning model. The algorithm is realised in-situ, by exploiting the
devices as random variables from the perspective of their cycle-to-cycle
conductance variability. We train experimentally the memory array to perform an
illustrative supervised learning task as well as a malignant breast tissue
recognition task, achieving an accuracy of 96.3%. Then, using a behavioural
model of resistive memory calibrated on array level measurements, we apply the
same approach to the Cartpole reinforcement learning task. In all cases our
proposed approach outperformed software-based neural network models realised

hardware to the regime of practical applications. As a result, a significant
amount of decoding hardware is necessary to process the colossal amount of data
required to constantly detect and correct errors occurring over the millions of
physical qubits driving the computation. The implementation of a recent highly
optimized version of Shor's algorithm to factor a 2,048-bits integer would
require more 7 TBit/s of bandwidth for the sole purpose of quantum error
correction and up to 20,000 decoding units. To reduce the decoding hardware
requirements, we propose a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based
on surface codes with a cheap hard-decision decoder, the lazy decoder, combined
with a sophisticated decoding unit that takes care of complex error
configurations. Our design drops the decoding hardware requirements by several
orders of magnitude assuming that good enough qubits are provided. Given qubits
and quantum gates with a physical error rate $p=10^{-4}$, the lazy decoder
drops both the bandwidth requirements and the number of decoding units by a
factor 50x. Provided very good qubits with error rate $p=10^{-5}$, we obtain a
1,500x reduction in bandwidth and decoding hardware thanks to the lazy decoder.
Finally, the lazy decoder can be used as a decoder accelerator. Our simulations
show a 10x speed-up of the Union-Find decoder and a 50x speed-up of the Minimum

specific heat, and sound attenuation at intermediate frequencies. In computer
glasses, QLMs may assume the form of harmonic vibrational modes under a narrow
set of circumstances, however direct access to their full distribution over
frequency is hindered by hybridizations of QLMs with other low-frequency modes
(e.g.~phonons). Previous studies to overcome this issue have demonstrated that
the response of a glass to local force dipoles serves as a good proxy for its
QLMs; we therefore study here the statistical-mechanical properties of the
responses to local force dipoles in computer glasses, over a large range of
glass stabilities and in various spatial dimensions, with the goal of revealing
properties of the yet-inaccessible full distribution of QLMs' frequencies. We
find that, as opposed to the spatial-dimension-independent universal
distribution of QLMs' frequencies $\omega$ (and, consequently, also of their
stiffness $\kappa\!=\!\omega^2$), the distribution of stiffnesses associated
with responses to local force dipoles features a (weak) dependence on spatial
dimension. We rationalize this dependence by introducing a lattice model that
incorporates both the real-space profiles of QLMs --- associated with
dimension-dependent long-range elastic fields --- and the universal statistical
properties of their frequencies. Finally, we discuss possible connections

succession of bursts and interbursts. Each phase corresponds to an exploration
of a fraction of the phase-space, which contains three critical points (one
attractor and two saddles) separated by a two-dimensional stable manifold

with optical gain. In such lasers, the scattering of light provides the
necessary feedback for lasing action. Because of the light scattering, the
random lasing systems emit in all the directions in contrast with the
directional emission of the conventional lasers. While this property can be
desired in some cases, the control of the emission directionality remains
required for most of the applications. Besides, it is well known that the
excitation of cavity exciton-polaritons is intrinsically directional. Each
wavelength (energy) of the cavity polariton, which is a superposition of an
excitonic state and a cavity mode, corresponds to a well-defined propagation
direction. We demonstrate in this article that coupling the emission of a 2D
random laser with a cavity polaritonic resonance permits to control the
direction of emission of the random laser. This results in a directional random
lasing whose emission angle with respect to the microcavity axis can be tuned
in a large range of angles by varying the cavity detuning. The emission angles
reached experimentally in this work are 15.8$^\circ$ and 22.4$^\circ$.

many real-world networks are spatially embedded and their links have
characteristics length such as pipelines, power lines or ground transportation
lines they are not homogeneous but rather heterogeneous. For example, density
of links within cities are significantly higher than between cities. Here we
present and study numerically and analytically a similar realistic
heterogeneous spatial modular model using percolation process to better
understand the effect of heterogeneity on such networks. The model assumes that
inside a city there are many lines connecting different locations, while long
lines between the cities are sparse and usually directly connecting only a few
nearest neighbours cities in a two dimensional plane. We find that this model
experiences two distinct continues transitions, one when the cities disconnect

which interaction values should be modified, and by how much, in order to alter
the composition or resilience of a community towards a favorable direction.
While doing so, we also take into account the experimental difficulties in

Matter (WDM) regime characterized by moderate Coulomb coupling and electron
degeneracy. It is based on a recently proposed closure of the BBGKY hierarchy
that expands in terms of the departure of correlations from their equilibrium
value, rather than in terms of the strength of correlations. This kinetic
equation contains modifications to the collision term in addition to a second
term that models the non-ideal contributions to the equation of state. An
explicit collision operator is derived in the semiclassical limit that is
similar to that of the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, but where scattering is
mediated by the potential of mean force (PMF). As a demonstration, we use this
collision integral to evaluate temperature and momentum relaxation rates in
dense plasmas. We obtain degeneracy- and coupling-dependent 'Coulomb integrals'
that take the place of $\ln\Lambda$ in the scattering rates. We additionally
find a novel difference in the way in which degeneracy influences momentum
relaxation in comparison to temperature relaxation. Finally, we evaluate
electron-ion relaxation rates for the case of warm dense deuterium over a range
of density and temperature spanning the classical to quantum and weak to strong
coupling transitions. Results are compared with the Landau-Spitzer rate and
rates obtained from the quantum Landau-Fokker-Planck equation and Lee-More
model. We find that the models diverge significantly in the degenerate and
moderately coupled regime and attribute this difference to how the various
models treat the physics of Pauli blocking, correlations, large-angle
scattering, and diffraction.

in the mean field regime. As the network's widths increase, the network's
learning trajectory is shown to be well captured by a meaningful and
dynamically nonlinear limit (the \textit{mean field} limit), which is
characterized by a system of ODEs. Our framework applies to a broad range of
network architectures, learning dynamics and network initializations. Central
to the framework is the new idea of a \textit{neuronal embedding}, which
comprises of a non-evolving probability space that allows to embed neural
networks of arbitrary widths.
  Using our framework, we prove several properties of large-width multilayer
neural networks. Firstly we show that independent and identically distributed
initializations cause strong degeneracy effects on the network's learning
trajectory when the network's depth is at least four. Secondly we obtain
several global convergence guarantees for feedforward multilayer networks under
a number of different setups. These include two-layer and three-layer networks
with independent and identically distributed initializations, and multilayer
networks of arbitrary depths with a special type of correlated initializations
that is motivated by the new concept of \textit{bidirectional diversity}.
Unlike previous works that rely on convexity, our results admit non-convex
losses and hinge on a certain universal approximation property, which is a
distinctive feature of infinite-width neural networks and is shown to hold
throughout the training process. Aside from being the first known results for
global convergence of multilayer networks in the mean field regime, they
demonstrate flexibility of our framework and incorporate several new ideas and
insights that depart from the conventional convex optimization wisdom.

shape and center of astronomical object point spread functions (PSFs), which do
not have symmetric Gaussian profiles in short exposure (<4 s) guiding images.
Efforts to determine the PSF centroid are additionally complicated by the core
saturation of bright guide stars. We have applied both a two-dimensional
Gaussian fitting algorithm (2DGA) and center balancing algorithm (CBA) to
identify an appropriate method for IGRINS in the near-infrared K-band. The CBA
derives the expected center position along the slit-width by referencing the
spillover flux ratio of the PSF wings on both sides of the slit. In this
research, we have compared the accuracy and reliability of the CBA to the 2DGA
by using data from IGRINS commissioning observations at McDonald Observatory.
We find that the performance of each algorithm depends on the brightness of the

observing scenarios. The algorithms and test results we present can be utilized
with future spectroscopic slit observations in various observing conditions and

take place in conditions of ideological homogeneity, has recently gained
popularity as an explanation for patterns of political polarization and
radicalization observed in many democratic countries. However, while
micro-level experimental work has shown evidence that individuals may gravitate
towards information that supports their beliefs, recent macro-level studies
have cast doubt on whether this tendency generates echo chambers in practice,
instead suggesting that cross-cutting exposures are a common feature of digital
life. In this article, we offer an explanation for these diverging results.
Building on cognitive dissonance theory, and making use of observational trace
data taken from an online white nationalist website, we explore how individuals
in an ideological 'echo chamber' engage with opposing viewpoints. We show that
this type of exposure, far from being detrimental to radical online
discussions, is actually a core feature of such spaces that encourages people
to stay engaged. The most common 'echoes' in this echo chamber are in fact the
sound of opposing viewpoints being undermined and marginalized. Hence echo
chambers exist not only in spite of but thanks to the unifying presence of
oppositional viewpoints. We conclude with reflections on policy implications of
our study for those seeking to promote a more moderate political internet.

influencing their electronic properties. They give rise to new Dirac cones and
are also at the origin of the superconductivity observed in magic-angle bilayer
graphene. The modulation amplitude (corrugation) is an important yet largely
unexplored parameter in defining the properties of 2D superlattices. The
generally accepted view is that the corrugation monotonically decreases with
increasing twist angle, while its effects on the electronic structure diminish
as the layers become progressively decoupled. Here we found by lattice
relaxation of around 8000 different Moir\'e-superstructures using high scale
Classical Molecular Simulations combined with analytical calculations, that
even a small amount of strain can substantially change this picture, giving
rise to more complex behavior of superlattice corrugation as a function of
twist angle. One of the most surprising findings is the emergence of an
ultra-flat phase that can be present for arbitrary small twist angle having a
much lower corrugation level than the decoupled phase at large angles. A
possible experimental realization of the ultra-flat state is revealed by
Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) investigations of the graphene/graphite

world. Typically, the quality of a teleportation protocol is solely judged by
its average fidelity. In this work, we analyze the performance of teleportation
in terms of both fidelity and the deviation in fidelity. Specifically, we
define a quantity called teleportability score, which incorporates
contributions from both the fidelity and its deviation. It also takes into
account the sensitivity one requires for a protocol in which the teleportation
of a quantum state is required in one or many intermediate steps. We compute
the teleportability score in the noiseless scenario and find that it increases
monotonically with the entanglement content of the resource state. The result
remains same even if we consider an n-chain repeater-like configuration.
However, in the presence of noise, the teleportability score, can sometime
display a nonmonotonic behaviour with respect to the entanglement content of
the initially shared resource state. Specifically, under local bit-flip and
bit-phase-flip noise, lesser entangled states can have higher teleportability
score for certain choice of system parameters. In the presence of global
depolarizing noise, for low entangled resource states and high sensitivity
requirements, the noisy states can have better a teleportability score in
comparison to the noiseless scenario.

presence of rounding errors. The only approaches for achieving a numerical
proof of global optimality are interval branch and bound methods that
interleave branching of the search-space and pruning of the subdomains that

compute sharp enclosures of the objective function and the constraints on a
given subdomain; ii) to find a good approximation (an upper bound) of the
global minimum.
  State-of-the-art solvers are generally integrative methods, that is they
embed local optimization algorithms to compute a good upper bound of the global
minimum over each subspace. In this document, we propose a cooperative
framework in which interval methods cooperate with evolutionary algorithms. The
latter are stochastic algorithms in which a population of candidate solutions
iteratively evolves in the search-space to reach satisfactory solutions.
Evolutionary algorithms, endowed with operators that help individuals escape
from local minima, are particularly suited for difficult problems on which
traditional methods struggle to converge.
  Within our cooperative solver Charibde, the evolutionary algorithm and the
interval-based algorithm run in parallel and exchange bounds, solutions and

convergence toward local minima. A comparison of Charibde with state-of-the-art

Charibde converges faster by an order of magnitude. New optimality results are

distinguish high-mass BNSs and low-mass binary black holes (BBHs) solely from
their GW signals. To do this, we consider the imprint of the tidal
deformability of the neutron stars on the GW signal for systems undergoing
prompt black hole formation after merger. We model the BNS signals using hybrid
numerical relativity -- tidal effective-one-body waveforms. Specifically, we
consider a set of five nonspinning equal-mass BNS signals with masses of 2.7,
3.0, 3.2 Msun and with three different equations of state, as well as the
analogous BBH signals. We perform parameter estimation on these signals in
three networks: Advanced LIGO-Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO-Advanced
Virgo-KAGRA with sensitivities similar to O3 and O4, respectively, and a 3G
network of two Cosmic Explorers (CEs) and one Einstein Telescope, with a CE
sensitivity similar to Stage 2. Our analysis suggests that we cannot
distinguish the signals from high-mass BNSs and BBHs at a 90% credible level
with the O3-like network even at 40 Mpc. However, we can distinguish all but
the most compact BNSs that we consider in our study from BBHs at 40 Mpc at a >=
95% credible level using the O4-like network, and can even distinguish them at
a > 99.2% (>= 97%) credible level at 369 (835) Mpc using the 3G network.

does not hold in several real-world scenarios, e.g., when observations are
bounded or have extreme-value dependencies, a natural phenomenon in physics,
finance and social sciences. Although beyond-Gaussian stochastic processes have
caught the attention of the GP community, a principled definition and rigorous
treatment is still lacking. In this regard, we propose a methodology to
construct stochastic processes, which include GPs, warped GPs, Student-t
processes and several others under a single unified approach. We also provide
formulas and algorithms for training and inference of the proposed models in
the regression problem. Our approach is inspired by layers-based models, where
each proposed layer changes a specific property over the generated stochastic
process. That, in turn, allows us to push-forward a standard Gaussian white
noise prior towards other more expressive stochastic processes, for which
marginals and copulas need not be Gaussian, while retaining the appealing
properties of GPs. We validate the proposed model through experiments with
real-world data.

separation algorithms. Most prior studies on speech separation use
pre-segmented signals of artificially mixed speech utterances which are mostly
\emph{fully} overlapped, and the algorithms are evaluated based on
signal-to-distortion ratio or similar performance metrics. However, in natural
conversations, a speech signal is continuous, containing both overlapped and
overlap-free components. In addition, the signal-based metrics have very weak
correlations with automatic speech recognition (ASR) accuracy. We think that
not only does this make it hard to assess the practical relevance of the tested
algorithms, it also hinders researchers from developing systems that can be
readily applied to real scenarios. In this paper, we define continuous speech
separation (CSS) as a task of generating a set of non-overlapped speech signals
from a \textit{continuous} audio stream that contains multiple utterances that
are \emph{partially} overlapped by a varying degree. A new real recorded
dataset, called LibriCSS, is derived from LibriSpeech by concatenating the
corpus utterances to simulate a conversation and capturing the audio replays
with far-field microphones. A Kaldi-based ASR evaluation protocol is also
established by using a well-trained multi-conditional acoustic model. By using
this dataset, several aspects of a recently proposed speaker-independent CSS

a finite damping, the broadband character of the antenna emission in the wave
vector space imposes to take into account the growing decoherence of the
magnetization waves upon their spatial propagation. The transmission signal can
be viewed as resulting from two contributions: a first one from propagating
spin-waves leading to an oscillatory phase of the broadband transmission
coefficient, and another one originating from the distant induction of
ferromagnetic resonance because of the long-range stray fields of realistic
antennas. Depending on the relative importance of these two contributions, the
decay of the transmitted signal with the propagation distance may not be
exponential and the oscillatory character of the spin-wave phase upon

and other essential services, better models are needed to understand the
dynamics of natural gas networks during extreme events. This paper aims at
establishing appropriate and fast simulation models to capture the slow
dynamics of linepack depletion for ideal isothermal natural gas pipeline
networks. Instead of solving partial differential equations (PDE) on a large
scale, three alternative implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE)
simulation techniques are derived and discussed. The first one is commonly used
in the literature with a slack node assumption. We show that the system of
equations associated with this model is degenerate when flux injections are
controlled (i.e. specified) at all nodes. To recover regularity under such a
condition, two novel implicit ODE models are proposed, both with different
techniques for specifying boundary conditions. They are easy to derive and
efficient to simulate with standard ODE solvers. More importantly, they present
useful frameworks for analyzing how networks respond to system-wide mass flux
imbalances. These techniques offer different alternatives for simulating system
dynamics based on how sources and loads are chosen to be modeled, and they are
all proven to be regular (non-degenerate) in tree-structured networks. These
proposed techniques are all tested on the 20-node Belgium network. The
simulation results show that the conventional model with the slack node
assumption cannot effectively capture linepack depletion under long term

decoherence. Close to a quantum transition where the system develops critical
correlations with diverging length scales, the competition of the two drivings
is analyzed within a dynamic scaling framework, allowing us to identify a
regime (dynamic scaling limit) where the two mechanisms develop a nontrivial

The local measurement process generally tends to suppress quantum correlations,

the lepton asymmetry to the standard model baryons via quasi-Dirac heavy
neutral leptons (HNLs) and sphalerons. One of these HNLs, with mass $\lesssim
4.5\,$GeV, can be (partially) asymmetric dark matter (DM), whose asymmetry is
determined by that of the baryons. Its stability is directly related to the
vanishing of the lightest neutrino mass. Neutrino masses are generated by
integrating out heavy sterile neutrinos whose mass is above the inflation

transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and
cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this
magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters
provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this
is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way.
Here we introduce the \textsc{Mock-X} analysis framework, a multiwavelength
tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives
halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating
optical, Compton-$y$ and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image
analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring
hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations.
Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias
$b\approx0.13$ with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or
subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic
observations is mass-dependent, increasing to $b=0.3$ for the most massive
clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum
produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure
equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by
cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence.
The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical
method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current
observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive
clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.

entanglement cannot spread outside of a linear light cone, which expands at an
emergent velocity analogous to the speed of light. Local operations at
sufficiently separated spacetime points approximately commute -- given a
many-body state, $\mathcal{O}_x(t) \mathcal{O}_y |\psi\rangle \approx
\mathcal{O}_y\mathcal{O}_x(t) |\psi\rangle$ with arbitrarily small errors -- so
long as $|x-y|\gtrsim vt$, where $v$ is finite. Yet most non-relativistic
physical systems realized in nature have long-range interactions: two degrees
of freedom separated by a distance $r$ interact with potential energy $V(r)
\propto 1/r^{\alpha}$. In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously
establish a hierarchy of linear light cones: at the same $\alpha$, some quantum
information processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone while
others are not. In one spatial dimension, this linear light cone exists for
every many-body state when $\alpha>3$ (Lieb-Robinson light cone); for a typical
state chosen uniformly at random from the Hilbert space when
$\alpha>\frac{5}{2}$ (Frobenius light cone); for every state of a
non-interacting system when $\alpha>2$ (free light cone). These bounds apply to
time-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements. Our
theorems regarding the Lieb-Robinson and free light cones -- and their
tightness -- also generalize to arbitrary dimensions. We discuss the
implications of our bounds on the growth of connected correlators and of
topological order, the clustering of correlations in gapped systems, and the
digital simulation of systems with long-range interactions. In addition, we
show that universal quantum state transfer, as well as many-body quantum chaos,
are bounded by the Frobenius light cone, and therefore are poorly constrained
by all Lieb-Robinson bounds.

narrow-band, and spectroscopic surveys. The red tunable filter of the OSIRIS

most deeply explored Extended Groth Strip region. Careful data reduction using
improved techniques for sky ring subtraction, accurate astrometry, photometric
calibration, and source extraction enables us to compile the OTELO catalogue.
This catalogue is complemented with ancillary data ranging from deep X-ray to
far-infrared, including high resolution HST images, which allow us to segregate
the different types of targets, derive precise photometric redshifts, and
obtain the morphological classification of the extragalactic objects detected.
The OTELO multi-wavelength catalogue contains 11237 entries and is 50\%
complete at AB magnitude 26.38. Of these sources, 6600 have photometric
redshifts with an uncertainty $z_{phot}$ better than $0.2 (1+z_{phot})$. A
total of 4336 of these sources correspond to preliminary emission line
candidates, which are complemented by 81 candidate stars and 483 sources that

momentum (AM) transport mechanism is needed for subgiant and red giant stars. A
revised prescription for AM transport by the magnetic Tayler instability has
been recently proposed as a possible candidate for such a missing mechanism.
  Results: The revised prescription for the transport by the Tayler instability
leads to low core rotation rates after the main sequence that are in better
global agreement with asteroseismic measurements than those predicted by models
with purely hydrodynamic processes or with the original Tayler-Spruit dynamo. A
detailed comparison with asteroseismic data shows that the rotational
properties of at most two of the six subgiants can be correctly reproduced by
models accounting for this revised magnetic transport process. This result is
obtained independently of the value adopted for the calibration parameter in
this prescription. We also find that this transport by the Tayler instability
faces difficulties in simultaneously reproducing asteroseismic measurements
available for subgiant and red giant stars. The low values of the calibration
parameter needed to correctly reproduce the rotational properties of two of the
six subgiants lead to core rotation rates during the red giant phase that are
too high. Inversely, the higher values of this parameter needed to reproduce
the core rotation rates of red giants lead to a very low degree of radial
differential rotation before the red giant phase, which is in contradiction
with the internal rotation of subgiant stars.
  Conclusions: In its present form, the revised prescription for the transport
by the Tayler instability does not provide a complete solution to the missing
AM transport revealed by asteroseismology of evolved stars.

of such closure domains and estimate their sizes and relative contribution to

the magnetoresistance depends on the measurement geometry as well as on the
temperature. When the electric current ows perpendicular to the stripe
direction, the resistivity decreases when a magnetic field is applied along the
stripe direction (negative magnetoresistance) in all the studied temperature
range, and the calculations indicate that the main source is the anisotropic
magnetoresistance. In the case of current flowing parallel to the stripe
domains, the magnetoresistance changes sign, being positive at room temperature
and negative at 100 K. To explain this behavior, the contribution to
magnetoresistance from the domain walls must be considered besides the

planewave scattering from an arbitrarily shaped, compact body of homogeneous
electric susceptibility $\chi$ is found to predictively quantify and
differentiate the relative performance of dielectric and metallic materials
across all optical length scales. When the size of a device is restricted to be
much smaller than the wavelength (a subwavelength cavity, antenna,
nanoparticle, etc.), the maximum cross section enhancement that may be achieved
via material structuring is found to be much weaker than prior predictions: the
response of strong metals ($\mathrm{Re}[\chi] < 0$) exhibits a diluted
(homogenized) effective medium scaling $\propto |\chi| / \mathrm{Im}[\chi]$;
below a threshold size inversely proportional to the index of refraction
(consistent with the half-wavelength resonance condition), the maximum cross
section enhancement possible with dielectrics ($\mathrm{Re}[\chi] > 0$) shows
the same material dependence as Rayleigh scattering. In the limit of a bounding
volume much larger than the wavelength in all dimensions, achievable scattering
interactions asymptote to the geometric area, as predicted by ray optics. For
representative metal and dielectric materials, geometries capable of scattering
power from an incident plane wave within an order of magnitude (typically a
factor of two) of the bound are discovered by inverse design. The basis of the
method rests entirely on scattering theory, and can thus likely be applied to

that have analysed spectropolarimetric data have employed the
least-square-deconvolution method (LSD) and the first-order moment approach. We
present a series of numerical tests in which we review some important aspects
of this technique. First, we show that the selection of the profile widths,
i.e. integration range in the first-order moment equation, is independent of
the accuracy of the magnetic measurements, meaning that for any arbitrary
profile width it is always possible to properly determine the longitudinal
magnetic field. We also study the interplay between the line depth limit
adopted in the line mask and the normalisation values of the LSD profiles. We
finally show that the rotation of the stars has to be considered to correctly
infer the intensity of the magnetic field, something that has been neglected up
to now. We show that the latter consideration is crucial, and our test shows
that the magnetic intensities differ by a factor close to 3 for a moderate fast
rotator star with vsini of 50 km/s. Therefore, it is expected that in general
the stellar magnetic fields reported for fast rotators are stronger than what
was believed. All the previous results shows that the first-order moment can be
a very robust tool for measurements of magnetic fields, provided that the weak
magnetic field approximation is secured. We also show that when the magnetic
field regime breaks down, the use of the first-order moment method becomes
uncertain.

demonstrate their benefits in the context of multi-material Arbitrary
Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) compressible shock hydrodynamic applications. The
mesh optimization process is driven by information provided by the simulation
which uses the optimized mesh, such as shock positions, material regions, known
error estimates, etc. These simulation features are usually represented
discretely, for instance, as finite element functions on the Lagrangian mesh.
The discrete nature of the input is critical for the practical applicability of
the algorithms we propose and distinguishes this work from approaches that
strictly require analytical information. Our methods are based on node movement
through a high-order extension of the Target-Matrix Optimization Paradigm
(TMOP) of Knupp. The proposed formulation is fully algebraic and relies only on
local Jacobian matrices, so it is applicable to all types of mesh elements, in
2D and 3D, and any order of the mesh. We discuss the notions of constructing
adaptive target matrices and obtaining their derivatives, reconstructing
discrete data in intermediate meshes, node limiting that enables improvement of
global mesh quality while preserving space-dependent local mesh features, and
appropriate normalization of the objective function. The adaptivity methods are
combined with automatic ALE triggers that can provide robustness of the mesh
evolution and avoid excessive remap procedures. The benefits of the new
high-order TMOP technology are illustrated on several simulations performed in
the high-order ALE application BLAST.

based on the versatile interference patterns of two solitons within one
round-trip, enables wide reconfigurability of RF passband frequencies according
to their relative azimuthal angles. The proposed schemes demand neither an

overall image generation performance to several types of deep models. Instead
of performing a posterior distribution modeling in the pixel spaces of
generators, ACLs aim to jointly learn a latent code with another image
encoder/inference net, with a prior noise as its input. We conduct the learning
in an adversarial learning process, which bears a close resemblance to the
original GAN but again shifts the learning from image spaces to prior and
latent code spaces. ACL is a portable module that brings up much more
flexibility and possibilities in generative model designs. First, it allows
flexibility to convert non-generative models like Autoencoders and standard
classification models to decent generative models. Second, it enhances existing
GANs' performance by generating meaningful codes and images from any part of
the prior. We have incorporated our ACL module with the aforementioned
frameworks and have performed experiments on synthetic, MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
CelebA datasets. Our models have achieved significant improvements which
demonstrated the generality for image generation tasks.

enhancement recently. The state-of-the-art deep learning methods perform the
task by learning a ratio/binary mask that is applied to the mixture in the
time-frequency domain to produce the clean speech. Despite the great
performance in the single-channel setting, these frameworks lag in performance
in the multichannel setting as the majority of these methods a) fail to exploit
the available spatial information fully, and b) still treat the deep
architecture as a black box which may not be well-suited for multichannel audio
processing. This paper addresses these drawbacks, a) by utilizing complex ratio
masking instead of masking on the magnitude of the spectrogram, and more
importantly, b) by introducing a channel-attention mechanism inside the deep
architecture to mimic beamforming. We propose Channel-Attention Dense U-Net, in
which we apply the channel-attention unit recursively on feature maps at every
layer of the network, enabling the network to perform non-linear beamforming.
We demonstrate the superior performance of the network against the

which brain regions are associated with a health outcome. Vectorizing the
two-dimensional image arrays is an unsatisfactory approach since it destroys
the inherent spatial structure of the images and can be computationally
challenging. We present an alternative approach - regularized matrix regression
- where the matrix of regression coefficients is defined as a solution to the
specific optimization problem. The method, called SParsity Inducing Nuclear
Norm EstimatoR (SpINNEr), simultaneously imposes two penalty types on the
regression coefficient matrix---the nuclear norm and the lasso norm---to
encourage a low rank matrix solution that also has entry-wise sparsity. A
specific implementation of the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is used to build a fast and efficient numerical solver. Our simulations
show that SpINNEr outperforms other methods in estimation accuracy when the

arranged in well-connected communities. SpINNEr is applied to investigate
associations between HIV-related outcomes and functional connectivity in the

at redshift 0.0618, detected by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). DES16C3cje is a
unique SN. The spectra are characterized by extremely narrow photospheric lines
corresponding to very low expansion velocities of $\lesssim1500$ km s$^{-1}$,
and the light curve shows an initial peak that fades after 50 days before
slowly rebrightening over a further 100 days to reach an absolute brightness of
M$_r\sim -15.5$ mag. The decline rate of the late-time light curve is then
slower than that expected from the powering by radioactive decay of $^{56}$Co
but is comparable to that expected from accretion power. Comparing the
bolometric light curve with hydrodynamical models, we find that DES16C3cje can
be explained by either i) a low explosion energy (0.11 foe) and relatively
large $^{56}$Ni production of 0.075 M$_{\odot}$ from a $\sim15$ M$_{\odot}$ red
supergiant progenitor typical of other SNe II, or ii) a relatively compact
$\sim40$ M$_{\odot}$ star, explosion energy of 1 foe, and 0.08 M$_{\odot}$ of
$^{56}$Ni. Both scenarios require additional energy input to explain the
late-time light curve, which is consistent with fallback accretion at a rate of
$\sim0.5\times{10^{-8}}$ M$_{\odot}$ s$^{-1}$.

Typed Lambda Calculus (GTLC) of Siek and Taha (2006) and its underlying cast

al. (2009) investigated alternate cast evaluation strategies, and Herman et al.
(2010) replaced casts with coercions for space-efficiency. The meta-theory for
the GTLC has also expanded beyond type safety to include blame safety
(Tobin-Hochstadt and Felleisen 2006), space consumption (Herman et al. 2010),
and the gradual guarantees (Siek et al. 2015). These results have been proven
for some variations of the GTLC but not others. Furthermore, researchers
continue to develop variations on the GTLC but establishing all of the
meta-theory for new variations is time consuming.
  This article identifies abstractions that capture similarities between many
cast calculi in the form of two parameterized cast calculi, one for the
purposes of language specification and the other to guide space-efficient
implementations. The article then develops reusable meta-theory for these two
calculi, proving type safety, blame safety, the gradual guarantees, and space
consumption. Finally, the article instantiates this meta-theory for eight cast
calculi including five from the literature and three new calculi. All of these
definitions and theorems, including the two parameterized calculi, the reusable
meta-theory, and the eight instantiations, are mechanized in Agda making
extensive use of module parameters and dependent records to define the

adjacent blocks of genes in one chromosome. The Transposition Distance Problem
(TDP) aims to find the minimum number of transpositions required to transform
one chromosome into another, both represented as permutations. The TDP can be
reduced to the problem of Sorting by Transpositions (SBT).
  SBT is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard and the best approximation algorithm with a
$1.375$ ratio was proposed by Elias and Hartman. Their algorithm employs
simplification, a technique used to transform an input permutation $\pi$ into a
simple permutation $\hat{\pi}$, presumably easier to handle with. The
permutation $\hat{\pi}$ is obtained by inserting new symbols into $\pi$ in a
way that the lower bound of the transposition distance of $\pi$ is kept on
$\hat{\pi}$. The simplification is guaranteed to keep the lower bound, not the
transposition distance.
  In this paper, we first show that the algorithm of Elias and Hartman (EH
algorithm) may require one extra transposition above the approximation ratio of
$1.375$, depending on how the input permutation is simplified. Next, using an
algebraic approach, we propose a new upper bound for the transposition distance
and a new $1.375$-approximation algorithm to solve SBT skipping simplification
and ensuring the approximation ratio of $1.375$ for all $S_n$.
  We implemented our algorithm and EH's. Regarding the implementation of the EH
algorithm, two issues needed to be fixed. We tested both algorithms against all
permutations of size $n$, $2\leq n \leq 12$. The results show that the EH
algorithm exceeds the approximation ratio of $1.375$ for permutations with a
size greater than $7$. Finally, we investigate the performance of both
implementations on longer permutations of maximum length $500$.

classification models and showed that the test error of gradient descent (GD)
with logistic loss undergoes a DD. In this paper, we complement these results
by extending them to GD with square loss. We show that the DD phenomenon
persists, but we also identify several differences compared to logistic loss.
This emphasizes that crucial features of DD curves (such as their transition
threshold and global minima) depend both on the training data and on the
learning algorithm. We further study the dependence of DD curves on the size of
the training set. Similar to our earlier work, our results are analytic: we
plot the DD curves by first deriving sharp asymptotics for the test error under
Gaussian features. Albeit simple, the models permit a principled study of DD
features, the outcomes of which theoretically corroborate related empirical
findings occurring in more complex learning tasks.

techniques -- such as stacking -- to incorporate information from
non-detections. However, averages, and especially means, can be strongly
affected by outliers and can therefore give a misleading indication of the

binning their sample in terms of AGN power (approximated by the 2-10keV
luminosity of the AGN), and investigating how the SFR distribution differs
between these bins. These bin thresholds are often weakly motivated, and
binning implicitly assumes that sources within the same bin have similar (or
even identical) properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the
distribution of host SFRs -- relative to the locus of the star-forming main
sequence (i.e., $R_{\rm MS}$) -- changes continuously as a function of AGN
power. We achieve this by using a hierarchical Bayesian model that completely
removes the need to bin in AGN power. In doing so, we find strong evidence that
the $R_{\rm MS}$ distribution changes with 2-10keV X-ray luminosity. The
results suggest that higher X_ray luminosity AGNs have a tighter physical
connection to the star-forming process than lower X-ray luminosity AGNs, at
least within the $0.8 < z < 1.2$ redshift range considered here.

achieving MIMO capacity gains. To solve this problem, we propose Skin-MIMO, a
deep learning based CSI acquisition technique to accurately predict CSI

$\mathcal{H}$, the Learning Space $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$, which can be
employed to avoid \textit{overfitting} when estimating in a complex space with
relative shortage of examples. Also, we presented the U-curve property, which
can be taken advantage of in order to select a Hypotheses Space without
exhaustively searching $\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$. In this paper, we carry
further our agenda, by showing the consistency of a model selection framework
based on Learning Spaces, in which one selects from data the Hypotheses Space
on which to learn. The method developed in this paper adds to the
state-of-the-art in model selection, by extending Vapnik-Chervonenkis Theory to
\textit{random} Hypotheses Spaces, i.e., Hypotheses Spaces learned from data.
In this framework, one estimates a random subspace $\hat{\mathcal{M}} \in
\mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ which converges with probability one to a target
Hypotheses Space $\mathcal{M}^{\star} \in \mathbb{L}(\mathcal{H})$ with desired
properties. As the convergence implies asymptotic unbiased estimators, we have
a consistent framework for model selection, showing that it is feasible to
learn the Hypotheses Space from data. Furthermore, we show that the
generalization errors of learning on $\hat{\mathcal{M}}$ are lesser than those
we commit when learning on $\mathcal{H}$, so it is more efficient to learn on a
subspace learned from data.

differential geometric criterion currently known for the existence of a
Lagrangian and variational formulation, and derived by solution of the full
inverse problem of the calculus of variations for scalar fourth-order ODEs
respectively. However, our Lagrangians have significantly greater freedom since
our existence conditions are for individual coefficients in the Lagrangian. In
particular, the classes of Lagrangians derived here have four arbitrary or free
functions, including allowing the leading coefficient in the resulting
variational ODEs to be arbitrary, and with models based on the earlier general
criteria for a variational representation being special cases. For different
choices of leading coefficients, the resulting variational equations could also
represent traveling waves of various nonlinear evolution equations, some of

parameter regimes, with the embedded solitons occurring only on isolated curves

higher order Lagrangians, the resulting equations of motion, and their solitary

partially conserved axial current (PCAC) relation between the three form
factors, and the underestimation of the induced pseudoscalar coupling
$g_P^\ast$ and the axial charge radius $r_A$ compared to phenomenological
estimates. The small $g_P^\ast$ was a consequence of the failure of the
pion-pole dominance (PPD) hypothesis, especially at low $M_\pi^2$. The small
charge radius $r_A$ and the underestimate of $g_A$ were related. The dominant
systematic responsible is the lack of inclusion of low-energy ($N \pi$) states
that are not manifest in the multiexponential fit to the nucleon two-point
correlator. We show that this low-energy state can be determined from the
three-point correlator $\langle N A_4 N \rangle $ with the insertion of the
temporal component of the axial current $A_4$ within the nucleon state, ie, the
strategy labeled $S_{A4}$ [1]. Including this low-energy state in fits to
control excited-state contamination (ESC) gives results for $g_A$, $r_A$, and
$g_P^\ast$ that are consistent with experimental/phenomenological values.
However, the systematic uncertainties, especially in data at small $Q^2$, are
now much larger.

exoplanets, which can affect the development of a habitable environment on
their surfaces. The initial amount of 40K in the interior of these planets
depends on the composition of the interstellar clouds from which they formed.
Within this context, nuclear reactions that regulate the production of 40K
during stellar evolution can play a critical role. In this study, we constrain
for the first time the astrophysical reaction rate of 40K(n,p)40Ar, which is
responsible for the destruction of 40K during stellar nucleosynthesis. We
performed differential cross-section measurements on the 40Ar(p,n)40K reaction,
for six energies in the center-of-mass between 3.2 and 4.0 MeV and various
angles between 0-deg and 135-deg. The experiment took place at the Edwards
Accelerator Laboratory at Ohio University using the beam swinger target
location and a standard neutron time-of-flight technique. The total and partial
cross-sections varied with energy due to the contribution from isobaric analog
states and Ericson type fluctuations. The energy-averaged neutron angular
distributions were symmetrical relative to 90-deg and consistent with the
theoretical predictions of the statistical model. Based on the experimental
data, local transmission coefficients were extracted and were used to calculate
the astrophysical reaction rates of 40Ar(p,n)40K and 40K(n,p)40Ar reactions.
Our results support that the destruction rate of 40K in massive stars via the
40K(n,p)40Ar reaction is larger compared to previous estimates. This result
directly affects the predicted stellar yields of 40K from nucleosynthesis,
which is a critical input parameter for the galactic chemical evolution models

exoplanets.

$z=0$) power series $f(z)=z(\lambda +\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_iz^i)$ over a complete
non-Archimedean field of characteristic $0$ if $|\lambda|=1$ and $\lambda$ is
not a root of unity, then $f$ is locally linearizable at $z=0$. They ask the
same question for power series over fields of positive characteristic. In this
paper, we prove that, on opposite, most such power series in this case are more
likely to be non-linearizable. More precisely, given a complete non-Archimedean
field $\mathcal K$ of positive characteristic and a power series
$f(z)=z(\lambda +\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_iz^i) \in \mathcal K[\![z]\!]$ with
$\lambda$ not a root of unity and $|1-\lambda|<1$, we prove a sufficient
condition (Criterion~\star) for $f$ to be non-linearizable. This phenomenon of
prevalence for power series over fields of positive characteristic being
non-linearizable was initially conjectured in [Her87, p 147] by Herman, and
formulated into a concrete question by Lindahl as [Lin04, Conjecture 2.2]. As
applications of our criterion, we prove the non-linearizability of three
families of polynomials.

Flexible trajectory Tracking Control (MPFTC), which relaxes the trajectory

path can cause significant cracking during the AM build process that makes the
composition path unviable to produce these FGMs, but it is challenging to
predict which phases will be present in as-built additively manufactured parts
by analyzing only equilibrium phase relations. Solute segregation during
solidification can lead to the formation of non-equilibrium phases that are
stable at compositions far from the nominal composition of the melt, leading to
crack formation. In this work, we developed a Scheil-Gulliver simulation tool
based on pycalphad. We used this tool to compare the non-equilibrium phases
predicted to form during solidification using the Scheil-Gulliver model with
experimentally measured phases at several locations with different composition
in a Ti-6Al-4V to Invar-36 FGM and a commercially pure Ti to Invar-36 FGM. We
showed that the phases predicted to form by the Scheil-Gulliver model
outperform the predictions made by assuming equilibrium solidification.
Further, we demonstrated the use of our Scheil-Gulliver simulation tool as a
method of screening potential FGM pathways by calculating the solidification
phase fractions along the experimental gradient path in composition space.

between initial experimental conditions and final measurement outcomes,
expressed by the inner products of state vectors representing these conditions.
This representation of causality is in fundamental conflict with the classical
notion that causality should be expressed in terms of the continuity of
intermediate realities. Quantum mechanics essentially replaces this continuity
of reality with phase sensitive superpositions, all of which need to interfere
in order to produce the correct conditional probabilities for the observable
input-output relations. In this paper, I investigate the relation between the
classical notion of reality and quantum superpositions by identifying the
conditions under which the intermediate states can have real external effects,
as expressed by measurement operators inserted into the inner product. It is
shown that classical reality emerges at the macroscopic level, where the
relevant limit of the measurement resolution is given by the variance of the
action around the classical solution. It is thus possible to demonstrate that
the classical notion of objective reality emerges only at the macroscopic
level, where observations are limited to low resolutions by a lack of
sufficiently strong intermediate interactions. This result indicates that
causality is more fundamental to physics than the notion of an objective
reality, which means that the apparent contradictions between quantum physics
and classical physics may be resolved by carefully distinguishing between
observable causality and unobservable sequences of hypothetical realities ""out
there"".

factorization retains the locality property afforded by the ""proxy point
method,"" and allows for a parallelized implementation where different
processors work on different parts of the boundary simultaneously. Further,
when the boundary undergoes local geometric perturbations (such as movement of
an interior hole), the factorization can be recomputed efficiently with respect
to the number of modified discretization nodes. We present an application that
leverages a parallel implementation of skeletonization with updates in a shape
optimization regime.

excited because of the possible occurrence of inverse cascades to large, global
scales together with direct cascades to small, dissipative scales, as observed
in the atmosphere and oceans, or in the solar environment. In this context,
using direct numerical simulations with forcing, we analyze scale dynamics in
the presence of magnetic fields with a generalized Ohm's law including a Hall
current. The ion inertial length epsilon_H serves as the control parameter at
fixed Reynolds number. Both the magnetic and generalized helicity -- invariants
in the ideal case -- grow linearly with time, as expected from classical
arguments. The cross-correlation between the velocity and magnetic field grows
as well, more so in relative terms for a stronger Hall current. We find that
the helical growth rates vary exponentially with epsilon_H, provided the ion
inertial scale resides within the inverse cascade range. These exponential
variations are recovered phenomenologically using simple scaling arguments.
They are directly linked to the wavenumber power-law dependence of generalized
and magnetic helicity, k^(-2), in their inverse ranges. This illustrates and
confirms the important role of the interplay between large and small scales in
the dynamics of turbulent flows.

on domain labels. We experimentally evaluated the model predictive control
performance via imitation learning for continuous control of sparse reward
tasks in simulators and compared it with the performance of the existing SRL

is directly related to the quality of ball passing or player formations.
Previous studies have primarily focused on a field division approach wherein a
field is divided into dominant regions in which a certain player can arrive
prior to any other players. However, the field division approach is
oversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniform
herein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamental
framework for space evaluation based on field weighting. In particular, we
employed the motion model and calculated a minimum arrival time $ \tau $ for
each player to all locations on the football field. Our main contribution is
that two variables $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $
corresponding to the minimum arrival time for offense and defense teams are
considered; using $ \tau_{\textrm{of}} $ and $ \tau_{\textrm{df}} $, new
orthogonal variables $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ are defined. In particular, based
on real datasets comprising of data from 45 football games of the J1 League in
2018, we provide a detailed characterization of $ z_{1} $ and $ z_{2} $ in
terms of ball passing. By using our method, we found that $ z_{1}(\vec{x}, t) $
and $ z_{2}(\vec{x}, t) $ represent the degree of safety for a pass made to $
\vec{x} $ at $ t $ and degree of sparsity of $ \vec{x} $ at $ t $,
respectively; the success probability of passes could be well-fitted using a
sigmoid function. Moreover, a new type of field division approach and
evaluation of ball passing just before shoots using real game data are
discussed.

goal of quantum information science. Here we provide such a test using quantum
annealing. Specifically, we report on extensive experimental tests of
topological defect formation via the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising

quantum simulator results can indeed be explained by the KZM for open-system
quantum dynamics with phase-flip errors, with certain quantitative deviations
from the theory likely caused by factors such as random control errors and
transient effects. In addition, we probe physics beyond the KZM by identifying
signatures of universality in the distribution and cumulants of the number of
kinks and their decay, and again find agreement with the quantum simulator
results. This implies that the theoretical predictions of the generalized KZM
theory, which assumes isolation from the environment, applies beyond its
original scope to an open system. We support this result by extensive numerical
computations. To check whether an alternative, classical interpretation of
these results is possible, we used the spin-vector Monte Carlo model, a
candidate classical description of the D-Wave device. We find that the degree
of agreement with the experimental data from the D-Wave annealing devices is
better for the KZM, a quantum theory, than for the classical spin-vector Monte
Carlo model, thus favoring a quantum description of the device. Our work

Hawking temperature, then it will not suffer from ergoregion instability
(although the bound is looser at smaller spins). (2) We find how quantum black

effects appear through compactness (i.e., exotic compact objects) or frequency
(i.e., modified dispersion relation). (3) We find out that the overtone

  Using RDM Arithmetic",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State estimation (SE) of distribution networks heavily relies on pseudo
measurements that introduce significant errors, since real-time measurements
are insufficient. Interval SE models are regularly used, where true values of
system states are supposed to be within the estimated ranges. However,
conventional interval SE algorithms cannot consider the correlations of same
interval variables in different terms of constraints, which results in overly
conservative estimation results. In this paper, we propose a Linear Programming
(LP) Contractor algorithm that uses a relative distance measure (RDM) interval
operation to solve this problem. In the proposed model, measurement errors are
assumed to be bounded into given sets, thus converting the state variables to
RDM variables. In this case, the SE model is a non-convex model, and the
solution credibility cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, each nonlinear
measurement equation in the model is transformed into dual inequality linear
equations using the mean value theorem. The SE model is finally reformulated as
a linear programming contractor that iteratively narrows the upper and lower
bounds of the system state variables. Numerical tests on IEEE three-phase

conventional interval-constrained propagation, modified Krawczyk-operator and

Inpainting the CMB map can effectively reduce the uncertainty of parametric

The input and output of CosmoVAE are square images. To generate training,
validation, and test data sets, we segment the full-sky CMB map into many small

parameters of the VAE network by using the angular power spectrum of the

our model bridges data from source and auxiliary modalities by a modality

learns to compensate for the loss of skeletons at test time and even at

active area to study the mass dependence of the ""jet quenching"" effects both at
the RHIC and the LHC. In this talk, we present the first theoretical study on
the $D^0$ meson radial distributions relative to the jet axis both in p+p and
Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV, where a nice agreement of our
results with experimental data is observed. The in-medium parton propagations
are described by a Monte Carlo transport model which uses the next-to-leading
order (NLO) plus parton shower (PS) event generator SHERPA as input and
includes elastic (collisional) and inelastic (radiative) in-medium interaction
of heavy flavor jet. We find that, at low $D^0$ meson $p_T$, the radial
distribution significantly shifts to larger radius indicating a strong
diffusion effect, and the diffusion effects decrease quickly with $p_T$ ,which
is consistent with the recent CMS measurements. We demonstrate that the angular
deviation of charm quarks is sensitive to $D_s$ but not $\hat{q}$, which may
provide new constrains on the collisional and radiative heavy quark energy
loss.

relative angle between the electron momentum and the electromagnetic field wave

transition probabilities and the frequencies are found. For some special values
of the parameter $\alpha$ or by charge doping, the system behaves as a three

wound healing, tissue morphogenesis, and tumor progression. The leading front
of a collective migrating epithelial cell layer often destabilizes into
multicellular finger-like protrusions, each of which is guided by a leader cell
at the fingertip. Here, we develop a subcellular-element-based model of this
fingering instability, which incorporates leader cells and other related
properties of a monolayer of epithelial cells. Our model recovers multiple
aspects of the dynamics, especially the traction force patterns and velocity
fields, observed in experiments on MDCK cells. Our model predicts the necessity
of the leader cell and its minimal functions for the formation and maintenance
of a stable finger pattern. Meanwhile, our model allows for an analysis of the
role of supra-cellular actin cable on the leading front, predicting that while
this observed structure helps maintain the shape of the finger, it is not
required in order to form a finger. In addition, we also study the driving
instability in the context of continuum active fluid model, which justifies
some of our assumptions in the computational approach. In particular, we show
that in our model no finger protrusions would emerge in a phenotypically
homogenous active fluid and hence the role of the leader cell and its followers

and jamming attacks, becomes more challenging in resource-constrained networks
like Internet-of-Things. Towards this, physical layer security (PLS) has gained
significant attention due to its low complexity. In this paper, we address the
issue of random inter-node distances in secrecy analysis and develop a
comprehensive quality-of-service (QoS) aware PLS framework for the analysis of
both eavesdropping and jamming capabilities of attacker. The proposed solution
covers spatially stochastic deployment of legitimate nodes and attacker. We
characterise the secrecy outage performance against both attacks using
inter-node distance based probabilistic distribution functions. The model takes
into account the practical limits arising out of underlying QoS requirements,
which include the maximum distance between legitimate users driven by transmit
power and receiver sensitivity. A novel concept of eavesdropping zone is
introduced, and relative impact of jamming power is investigated. Closed-form
expressions for asymptotic secrecy outage probability are derived offering
insights into design of optimal system parameters for desired security level
against the attacker's capability of both attacks. Analytical framework,
validated by numerical results, establishes that the proposed solution offers
potentially accurate characterisation of the PLS performance and key design
perspective from point-of-view of both legitimate user and attacker.

optimization problems that serve as highly popular convex relaxations for many
important low-rank matrix recovery problems such as \textit{matrix completion},
\textit{phase retrieval}, and more. The computational limitation of applying
SGD to solving these relaxations in large-scale is the need to compute a
potentially high-rank singular value decomposition (SVD) on each iteration in
order to enforce the low-rank-promoting constraint. We begin by considering a
simple and natural sufficient condition so that these relaxations indeed admit
low-rank solutions. This condition is also necessary for a certain notion of
low-rank-robustness to hold. Our main result shows that under this condition
which involves the eigenvalues of the gradient vector at optimal points, SGD
with mini-batches, when initialized with a ""warm-start"" point, produces
iterates that are low-rank with high probability, and hence only a low-rank SVD
computation is required on each iteration. This suggests that SGD may indeed be
practically applicable to solving large-scale convex relaxations of low-rank
matrix recovery problems. Our theoretical results are accompanied with
supporting preliminary empirical evidence. As a side benefit, our analysis is
quite simple and short.

for all six-loop contents exactly predictable from five-loops RG properties.

primarily the RG invariant condensate, $\langle \bar q

a moderate size of superlattice larger than an exciton yet not large enough to
justify a continuum model treatment. We find that the local potential in the
midplane of the bilayer displays a conspicuous Moir\'e pattern. It further
leads us to reveal that the variation of the average local potential near Mo
atoms in both MoTe2 and MoS2 layers make intralayer Moir\'e potentials. They
are the result of mutual modulation and correlate directly with the spatial
variation of the valence band maximum and conduction band minimum. The
interlayer Moir\'e potential, defined as the difference between the two
intralayer Moir\'e potentials, has a depth of 0.11 eV and changes roughly in
proportion to the band gap variation in the Moir\'e cell, which has an
amplitude of 0.04 eV. We find the lattice corrugation is significant in both
MoTe2 (0.30{\AA}) and MoS2 (0.77{\AA}) layers, yet its effect on the electronic
properties is marginal. The wrinkling of the MoTe2/MoS2 bilayer enhances the
spatial variation of the local band gap by 5 meV, while its influence on the

synthesis systems by combining a vocal tract LP filter with a WaveRNN-based
vocal source (i.e., excitation) generator. However, the quality of synthesized
speech is often unstable because the vocal source component is insufficiently
represented by the mu-law quantization method, and the model is trained without
considering the entire speech production mechanism. To address this problem, we
first introduce LP-MDN, which enables the autoregressive neural vocoder to
structurally represent the interactions between the vocal tract and vocal
source components. Then, we propose to incorporate the LP-MDN to the LPCNet
vocoder by replacing the conventional discretized output with continuous
density distribution. The experimental results verify that the proposed system
provides high quality synthetic speech by achieving a mean opinion score of
4.41 within a text-to-speech framework.

`Replay Device Quality'. As a means of analyzing subsidiary information, we use
two frameworks to either subtract or include a category of subsidiary

we utilize an adversarial process framework which makes the code orthogonal to
the basis vectors of the subsidiary information. For addition, we utilize the
multi-task learning framework to include subsidiary information to the code.
All experiments are conducted using the ASVspoof 2019 physical access scenario

not reside enough in the code when the deep neural network is trained for

to have issues of reward sparsity and mode collapse that affect the quality and

self-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for improving GANs' performance in
text generation. In contrast to standard GANs that use a binary classifier as
its discriminator to predict whether a sample is real or generated, SAL employs
a comparative discriminator which is a pairwise classifier for comparing the
text quality between a pair of samples. During training, SAL rewards the
generator when its currently generated sentence is found to be better than its
previously generated samples. This self-improvement reward mechanism allows the
model to receive credits more easily and avoid collapsing towards the limited
number of real samples, which not only helps alleviate the reward sparsity
issue but also reduces the risk of mode collapse. Experiments on text
generation benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach substantially
improves both the quality and the diversity, and yields more stable performance

(CNN) is used to generate fixed-length vector embeddings for a dataset of

that some basic operations in our CNN model preserve edit distance.
Experimental results show that CNN-ED outperforms data-independent CGK

by a large margin. We also show that string similarity search can be
significantly accelerated using CNN-based embeddings, sometimes by orders of

with the general success of AI. This dates back to Alan Turing's epoch-making
work in the early 1950s, which proposes that a machine's intelligence can be
tested by how well it, the machine, can fool a human into believing that the
machine is a human through dialogue conversations. Many systems learn
generation rules from a minimal set of authored rules or labels on top of
hand-coded rules or templates, and thus are both expensive and difficult to
extend to open-domain scenarios. Recently, the emergence of neural network
models the potential to solve many of the problems in dialogue learning that
earlier systems cannot tackle: the end-to-end neural frameworks offer the
promise of scalability and language-independence, together with the ability to
track the dialogue state and then mapping between states and dialogue actions
in a way not possible with conventional systems. On the other hand, neural
systems bring about new challenges: they tend to output dull and generic
responses; they lack a consistent or a coherent persona; they are usually
optimized through single-turn conversations and are incapable of handling the
long-term success of a conversation; and they are not able to take the
advantage of the interactions with humans. This dissertation attempts to tackle
these challenges: Contributions are two-fold: (1) we address new challenges
presented by neural network models in open-domain dialogue generation systems;
(2) we develop interactive question-answering dialogue systems by (a) giving
the agent the ability to ask questions and (b) training a conversation agent
through interactions with humans in an online fashion, where a bot improves
through communicating with humans and learning from the mistakes that it makes.

mini-filament1 shows the partial signature of eruption in case of Jet1-3.
However, the mini-filament2 shows a complete eruption driving a full blow-out

eruption. The eruption of Jet4 triggers a coronal mass ejection (CME). The
plane-of-sky velocity of recurring jets (Jet1-4) results in 160 km/s, 106 km/s,
151 km/s and 369 km/s. The estimated velocity of CME is 636 km/s. The

eruption and first three jets (Jet1-3) are produced, but the rate of

erupts (perhaps because of a higher cancellation rate), and this triggers a
C-class flare and a CME-productive jet. At the base of first three jets

  schemes, fixed typos",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Boosting is a celebrated machine learning approach which is based on the idea
of combining weak and moderately inaccurate hypotheses to a strong and accurate
one. We study boosting under the assumption that the weak hypotheses belong to
a class of bounded capacity. This assumption is inspired by the common
convention that weak hypotheses are ""rules-of-thumbs"" from an ""easy-to-learn
class"". (Schapire and Freund~'12, Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David '14.) Formally,
we assume the class of weak hypotheses has a bounded VC dimension. We focus on
two main questions: (i) Oracle Complexity: How many weak hypotheses are needed
to produce an accurate hypothesis? We design a novel boosting algorithm and
demonstrate that it circumvents a classical lower bound by Freund and Schapire
('95, '12). Whereas the lower bound shows that $\Omega({1}/{\gamma^2})$ weak
hypotheses with $\gamma$-margin are sometimes necessary, our new method
requires only $\tilde{O}({1}/{\gamma})$ weak hypothesis, provided that they
belong to a class of bounded VC dimension. Unlike previous boosting algorithms
which aggregate the weak hypotheses by majority votes, the new boosting
algorithm uses more complex (""deeper"") aggregation rules. We complement this
result by showing that complex aggregation rules are in fact necessary to
circumvent the aforementioned lower bound. (ii) Expressivity: Which tasks can
be learned by boosting weak hypotheses from a bounded VC class? Can complex
concepts that are ""far away"" from the class be learned? Towards answering the
first question we {introduce combinatorial-geometric parameters which capture
expressivity in boosting.} As a corollary we provide an affirmative answer to
the second question for well-studied classes, including half-spaces and
decision stumps. Along the way, we establish and exploit connections with
Discrepancy Theory.

neutralize heterogeneous targets in an unknown and uncertain environment,
without any communication within the swarm. Here, some targets can be
neutralized by a single robot, while others need multiple robots in a
particular sequence to neutralize them. The complexity in the problem arises
due to the scalability and information uncertainty, which restricts the robot's
awareness of the swarm and the target distribution. In this paper, this problem
is addressed by proposing a novel Context-Aware Deep Q-Network (CA-DQN)
framework to obtain communication free cooperation between the robots in the
swarm. Each robot maintains an adaptive grid representation of the vicinity
with the context information embedded into it to keep the swarm intact while
searching and neutralizing the targets. The problem formulation uses a
reinforcement learning framework where two Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) handle
'conflict' and 'conflict-free' scenarios separately. The self-play-in-based
approach is used to determine the optimal policy for the DQNs. Monte-Carlo
simulations and comparison studies with a state-of-the-art coalition formation
algorithm are performed to verify the performance of CA-DQN with varying
environmental parameters. The results show that the approach is invariant to
the number of detected targets and the number of robots in the swarm. The paper
also presents the real-time implementation of CA-DQN for different scenarios

CA-DQN with low-power computing devices.

variations. In this paper, we propose to use the denoising autoencoder, a type
of deep neural network, to model the point spread function of wide field small

spread function modelling method, which uses calibration data from real

According to real observation conditions, different levels of random noise or
aberrations are added to point spread function templates, making them as
realizations of the point spread function, i.e., simulated star images. Then we
train the denoising autoencoder with realizations and templates of the point
spread function. After training, the denoising autoencoder learns the manifold
space of the point spread function and can map any star images obtained by wide

to induce far-from-equilibrium spin transport effects. Here, we use ultrafast
x-ray diffraction with unprecedented dynamic range to study the laser-induced
dynamics of labyrinth domain networks in ferromagnetic CoFe/Ni multilayers. We
detected azimuthally isotropic, odd order, magnetic diffraction rings up to 5th
order. The amplitudes of all three diffraction rings quench to different
degrees within 1.6 ps. In addition, all three of the detected diffraction rings
both broaden by 15% and radially contract by 6% during the quench process. We
are able to rigorously quantify a 31% ultrafast broadening of the domain walls
via Fourier analysis of the order-dependent quenching of the three detected
diffraction rings. The broadening of the diffraction rings is interpreted as a
reduction in the domain coherence length, but the shift in the ring radius,
while unambiguous in its occurrence, remains unexplained. In particular, we
demonstrate that a radial shift explained by domain wall broadening can be
ruled out. With the unprecedented dynamic range of our data, our results
provide convincing evidence that labyrinth domain structures are spatially
perturbed at ultrafast speeds under far-from-equilibrium conditions, albeit the
mechanism inducing the perturbations remains yet to be clarified.

highly charged nanoparticles, the theory is able to capture the non-monotonic

critical Coulomb interaction for the singlet/doublet transition decreases in
the presence of this exchange interaction for both ferro and anti-ferromagnetic

singlet phase, one of the pairs have zero spectral weight. We explore the
evolution of the in-gap states using the Anderson model. Away from the

Qualitatively, it explains the various phase transitions and spectral nature of
the in-gap states. Finally, we analyze the effects of magnetic anisotropic
fields of the core spin on in-gap states. Due to internal degrees of freedom of
the spin excited states, a multitude of new states emerges within the gap.
Depending on the sign and strength of the uniaxial anisotropic field, the

The interactions can take the form of two short waves with different

role of such three-wave interactions in a coupled Brusselator system. As well
as finding simple steady patterns when the waves reinforce each other, we can
also find spatially complex but steady patterns, including quasipatterns. When
the waves compete with each other, time varying states such as spatiotemporal
chaos are also possible. The signs of the quadratic coefficients in three-wave
interaction equations distinguish between these two cases. By manipulating
parameters of the chemical model, the formation of these various states can be
encouraged, as we confirm through extensive numerical simulation. Our arguments
allow us to predict when spatiotemporal chaos might be found: standard
nonlinear methods fail in this case. The arguments are quite general and apply
to a wide class of pattern-forming systems, including the Faraday wave

moments induced by the external fields are given by the product of particle
polarizability tensor and the field in the particle center. Here, we
demonstrate that the dipole response of non-spherical subwavelength dielectric

not only by the field in the particle center but also by the second-order
spatial derivatives of the field. As we prove, such nonlocal response is
especially pronounced in the vicinity of anapole minimum in the scattering
cross-section. We examine the excitation of high-index dielectric disk in

group-theoretical analysis and retrieving the nonlocal corrections to the

thought to have had a minor role in reionization. Our aim is to study the
possibility that AGN contributed to reionization not only through their
accretion disks, but also through ionizing photons coming from the AGN jets
interacting with the IGM. We adopt an empirically derived AGN luminosity
function at $z\simeq6$, use X-ray observations to correct it for the presence
of obscured sources, and estimate the density of jetted AGN. We then use
analytical calculations to derive the fraction of jet energy that goes into
ionizing photons. Finally, we compute the contribution of AGN jets to the H II
volume filling factor at redshifts $z\simeq15-5$. We show that the contribution
of the AGN jet lobes to the reionization of the Universe at $z\sim6$ might have
been as high as $\gtrsim 10$\% of that of star-forming galaxies, under the most
favorable conditions of jetted and obscuration fraction. The contribution of

momentum flux, with a leading-order (Newtonian-like) prefactor valid along

However, the typical kagome electronic bands, characterized by sets of the
Dirac-like band capped by a phase-destructive flat band, have not been clearly
observed, and their orbital physics are even less well investigated. Here, we
present close-to-textbook kagome bands with orbital differentiation physics in
CoSn, which can be well described by a minimal tight-binding model with
single-orbital hopping in Co kagome lattice. The capping flat bands with
bandwidth less than 0.2 eV run through the whole Brillouin zone, especially the
bandwidth of the flat band of out-of-plane orbitals is less than 0.02 eV along
G-M. The energy gap induced by spin-orbit interaction at the Dirac cone of
out-of-plane orbitals is much smaller than that of in-plane orbitals,
suggesting orbital-selective character of the Dirac fermions.

as the minimal number of arbitrary linear functionals which is needed to obtain
an $\varepsilon$-approximation for the $d$-variate problem. It is fully
determined in terms of the weights and univariate singular values. Exponential
tractability means that the information complexity is bounded by a certain
function which depends polynomially on $d$ and logarithmically on
$\varepsilon^{-1}$. The corresponding un-weighted problem was studied recently
by Hickernell, Kritzer and Wo\'{z}niakowski with many negative results for
exponential tractability. The product weights studied in the present paper
change the situation. Depending on the form of polynomial dependence on $d$ and
logarithmic dependence on $\varepsilon^{-1}$, we study exponential strong
polynomial, exponential polynomial, exponential quasi-polynomial, and
exponential $(s,t)$-weak tractability with $\max(s,t)\ge1$. For all these
notions of exponential tractability, we establish necessary and sufficient
conditions on weights and univariate singular values for which it is indeed
possible to achieve the corresponding notion of exponential tractability. The
case of exponential $(s,t)$-weak tractability with $\max(s,t)<1$ is left for
future study.

spectroscopy for studying chiral molecules in the gas phase using either
single-photon ionization or multiphoton ionization. In the short pulse limit
investigated with femtosecond lasers, resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization
(REMPI) is rather instantaneous and typically occurs simultaneously via more
than one vibrational or electronic intermediate state due to limited frequency
resolution. In contrast, vibrational resolution in the REMPI spectrum can be
achieved using nanosecond lasers. In this work, we follow the high-resolution
approach using a tunable narrow-band nanosecond laser to measure REMPI-PECD
through distinct vibrational levels in the intermediate 3s and 3p Rydberg
states of fenchone. We observe the PECD to be essentially independent of the
vibrational level. This behaviour of the chiral sensitivity may pave the way
for enantiomer specific molecular identification in multi-component mixtures:
one can specifically excite a sharp, vibrationally resolved transition of a
distinct molecule to distinguish different chiral species in mixtures.

algebras of $\bf G$ and $\bf H$, and let $\mathfrak{h}^{\bot}$ denote the

the annihilator variety of any irreducible $\mathfrak{h}$-distinguished
$\mathfrak{g}$-module intersects $\mathfrak{h}^{\bot}$. This generalizes a
result of Vogan.
  We apply this to Casselman-Wallach representations of real reductive groups
to obtain information on branching problems, translation functors and Jacquet

a symmetric subgroup of a real reductive group $G$, the existence of a tempered
$H$-distinguished representation of $G$ implies the existence of a generic
$H$-distinguished representation of $G$.
  Many models studied in the theory of automorphic forms involve an additive
character on the unipotent radical of $\bf H$, and we devised a twisted version
of our theorem that yields necessary conditions for the existence of those
mixed models. Our method of proof here is inspired by the theory of W-algebras.
As an application we derive necessary conditions for the existence of
Rankin-Selberg, Bessel, Klyachko and Shalika models. Our results are compatible
with the recent Gan-Gross-Prasad conjectures for non-generic representations.

their derived mass is at least an order of magnitude larger than the typical
ejecta masses obtained for classical novae. Specifically, we found
M$_{ej}\simeq$9$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ independent of the distance for a

$\varepsilon$ in the range 0.08-0.10, giving a mass 7$\times$10$^{-4}\lesssim$

characterized by unusually strong coronal emission lines, confines the ionizing
source energy to the range 20-250 eV, possibly peaking in the range 75-100 or

may result from a classical nova explosion occurring on a very low mass white

poloidal and toroidal magnetic field components (which can be determined from
Zeeman-Doppler imaging) and the stellar radius. We use a sample of 51 stars
across a mass range of 0.1-1.34 M$_\odot$ to show how the helicity density
relates to stellar mass, Rossby number, magnetic energy and age. We find that
the large-scale helicity density increases with decreasing Rossby number $R_o$,
peaking at $R_o \simeq 0.1$, with a saturation or decrease below that. For both
fully- and partially-convective stars we find that the mean absolute helicity
density scales with the mean squared toroidal magnetic flux density according
to the power law: $|\langle{h\,}\rangle|$ $\propto$
$\langle{\rm{B_{tor}}^2_{}\,\rangle}^{0.86\,\pm\,0.04}$. The scatter in this

dissolution front. Using a mean-field theory, we predict that the front emerges

diffusively. This elastic ripening can occur at much faster rates than
classical Ostwald ripening, thus driving the dynamics. Our work shows how

  This sort of revolution is often providing advantages, such as an increase in

grounds the algorithm took the decision.
  To address this issue we consider the LIME method. We give a general
background on LIME then, we focus on the stability issue: employing the method
repeated times, under the same conditions, may yield to different explanations.
  Two complementary indices are proposed, to measure LIME stability. It is
important for the practitioner to be aware of the issue, as well as to have a
tool for spotting it. Stability guarantees LIME explanations to be reliable,
therefore a stability assessment, made through the proposed indices, is
crucial.
  As a case study, we apply both Machine Learning and classical statistical
techniques to Credit Risk data. We test LIME on the Machine Learning algorithm
and check its stability. Eventually, we examine the goodness of the

and pollution reduction) and charging. For the electrical grid, the flexibility
of EV charging makes it a significant actor in ""Demand Response"" mechanisms.
Therefore, there is a need to design incentive mechanisms to foster customer
engagement. A congestion game approach is adopted to evaluate the performance
of such electrical transportation system with multiple classes of vehicles: EV
and Gasoline Vehicles. Both temporal and energy operating costs are considered.
The latter is nonseparable as it depends on the global charging need of all EV,
which is scheduled in time by a centralized aggregator in function of
nonflexible consumption at charging location. Thus, driving and charging
decisions are coupled. An adaptation of Beckmann's method proves the existence
of a Wardrop Equilibrium (WE) in the considered nonseparable congestion game;
this WE is unique when the charging unit price is an increasing function of the
global charging need. A condition on the nonflexible load is given to guarantee
the monotonicity of this function. This condition is tested on real consumption
data in France and in Texas, USA. Optimal tolls are used to control this
electrical transportation system and then computed in order to minimize an
environmental cost on a simple network topology.

inferring parameters in stochastic gene regulatory network models. Its
performance hinges critically on the ability to summarize high-dimensional
system responses such as time series into a few informative, low-dimensional
summary statistics. The quality of those statistics acutely impacts the
accuracy of the inference task. Existing methods to select the best subset out
of a pool of candidate statistics do not scale well with large pools of several
tens to hundreds of candidate statistics. Since high quality statistics are
imperative for good performance, this becomes a serious bottleneck when
performing inference on complex and high-dimensional problems. This paper
proposes a convolutional neural network architecture for automatically learning
informative summary statistics of temporal responses. We show that the proposed
network can effectively circumvent the statistics selection problem of the

two benchmark problem and one challenging inference problem learning parameters

of high interest. Recent progress in deep generative neural networks has
introduced new opportunities to tackle this problem. Here, we employ a recently
proposed large-scale bi-directional generative adversarial network, called
BigBiGAN, to decode and reconstruct natural scenes from fMRI patterns. BigBiGAN
converts images into a 120-dimensional latent space which encodes class and
attribute information together, and can also reconstruct images based on their
latent vectors. We computed a linear mapping between fMRI data, acquired over
images from 150 different categories of ImageNet, and their corresponding
BigBiGAN latent vectors. Then, we applied this mapping to the fMRI activity
patterns obtained from 50 new test images from 50 unseen categories in order to
retrieve their latent vectors, and reconstruct the corresponding images.
Pairwise image decoding from the predicted latent vectors was highly accurate
(84%). Moreover, qualitative and quantitative assessments revealed that the
resulting image reconstructions were visually plausible, successfully captured
many attributes of the original images, and had high perceptual similarity with
the original content. This method establishes a new state-of-the-art for
fMRI-based natural image reconstruction, and can be flexibly updated to take
into account any future improvements in generative models of natural scene

nanoscale resistive memory devices organized in crossbar arrays could store the

Accuracies comparable to those of floating-point implementations are achieved
without being constrained by the non-idealities associated with the PCM

hydrocalumite-like phase formation during processing. Close to 600$^\circ$C,
such phases are decomposed to lime and mayenite (12CaO$\cdot$7Al$_2$O$_3$),
where the latter, due to its intrinsic nanoporosity and high thermal
reactivity, generates bonds between the ceramic particles at ~700$^\circ$C,
resulting in microstructure strengthening. Based on this premise, the authors
concluded that other Ca$^{2+}$ sources could act similarly. Indeed,
compositions containing Ca(OH)$_2$ or CaO showed the same effect on the onset
strengthening temperature, which reinforces the proposed mechanism. The results
attained indicated that macroporous insulators could be thermally treated at
lower temperatures, just to acquire enough mechanical strength for
installation, finishing in situ their firing process. Besides that, lower
sintering temperatures could be used to produce macroporous ceramics that would
be applied in low thermal demand environments, e.g. aluminum industries.

machine learning approach to estimate the Black-Scholes implied volatility and
the dividend yield for American options in a fast and robust way. To determine
the implied volatility, the inverse function is approximated by an artificial

offline (training) and online (prediction) phases and thus eliminates the need
for an iterative process. For the implied dividend yield, we formulate the
inverse problem as a calibration problem and determine simultaneously the
implied volatility and dividend yield. For this, a generic and robust

estimate multiple parameters. It is shown that machine learning can be used as
an efficient numerical technique to extract implied information from American

their evolution. The latter is characterized by the mass-density probability
distribution function ($\rho$-PDF), which is a power-law with slope $q$. The
variety of MCs is divided in ensembles according to the PDF slope and each
ensemble is represented by a single spherical cloud. The cores are considered
as elements of self-similar structure typical for fractal clouds and are
modeled by spherical objects populating each cloud shell. Our model assumes
relations between size, mass and density of the statistical cores. Out of them
a core mass-density relationship $\rho\propto m^x$ is derived where
$x=1/(1+q)$. We found that $q$ determines the existence or non-existence of a
threshold density for core collapse. The derived general CMF is a power law of
slope $-1$ while the CMF of gravitationally unstable cores has a slope $(-1 +
x/2)$, comparable with the slopes of the high-mass part of the stellar initial
mass function and of observational CMFs.

This study helps to understand the fluidity and location of transition point of
matter through $\eta/s$ and $\zeta/s$ ($s$ is entropy density), respectively,
the sound attenuation through the Prandtl number (Pl), the nature of flow by
the Reynolds number (Rl), and the competition between momentum and charge
diffusions. The viscosities are calculated in the relaxation time approximation
of kinetic theory within the quasiparticle model. Compared to isotropic medium,
both $\eta$ and $\zeta$ get increased in magnetic field-driven (B-driven)
anisotropy, contrary to the decrease in expansion-driven anisotropy. $\eta$
increases with temperature faster in former case than in latter case whereas
$\zeta$ in former case decreases with temperature and in latter case, it is
meagre and diminishes at a specific temperature. So the viscosities can
distinguish aforesaid anisotropies. Thus, $\eta/s$ gets enhanced in former case
and in latter case, it becomes smaller than isotropic one. Similarly $\zeta/s$
gets amplified but decreases faster with the temperature in a strong magnetic
field. The Prandtl number gets increased in B-induced anisotropy and gets
decreased in expansion-induced anisotropy, compared to isotropic one. Since, Pl
is found larger than 1, the sound attenuation is governed by momentum
diffusion. The B-driven anisotropy makes the Reynolds number smaller than one,
whereas the expansion-driven anisotropy makes it larger. The ratio
($\frac{\eta}{s}/\frac{\sigma_{\rm el}}{T}$) gets amplified in B-driven
anisotropy whereas it gets reduced in expansion-driven anisotropy. Since, the
ratio is always more than one, the momentum diffusion prevails over the charge
diffusion.

to the description of glasses. These are modeled as continuum media with
embedded elastic string heterogeneities, randomly located and randomly
oriented, which oscillate around a straight equilibrium position with a
fundamental frequency depending on their length. The existence of a length
distribution reflects then in a distribution of oscillation frequencies which
is responsible for the Boson Peak in the glass density of states. Previously,
it has been shown that such a description can account for the elastic anomalies
reported at frequencies comparable with the Boson Peak. Here we start from the
generalized hydrodynamics to determine the dynamic correlation function
$S(k,\omega)$ associated with the coherent, dispersive and attenuated, sound
waves resulting from a sound-string interference. Once the vibrational density
of states has been measured, we can use it for univocally fixing the string
length distribution inherent to a given glass. The density-density correlation
function obtained using such distribution is strongly constrained, and able to
account for the experimental data collected on two prototypical glasses:
glycerol and silica. The obtained string length distribution is compatible with
the typical size of elastic heterogeneities previously reported for silica and
supercooled liquids, and the atomic motion associated to the string dynamics is
consistent with the soft modes recently identified in large scale numerical
simulations as non-phonon modes responsible for the Boson Peak. The theory is
thus in agreement with the most recent advances in the understanding of the
glass specific dynamics and offers an appealing simple understanding of the
microscopic origin of the latter, while raising new questions on the
universality or material-specificity of the string distribution properties.

implementations of the VSA operators. This paper provides an overview of eleven
available VSA implementations and discusses their commonalities and differences
in the underlying vector space and operators. We create a taxonomy of available
binding operations and show an important ramification for non self-inverse
binding operations using an example from analogical reasoning. A main
contribution is the experimental comparison of the available implementations in
order to evaluate (1) the capacity of bundles, (2) the approximation quality of
non-exact unbinding operations, (3) the influence of combining binding and
bundling operations on the query answering performance, and (4) the performance
on two example applications: visual place- and language-recognition. We expect
this comparison and systematization to be relevant for development of VSAs, and
to support the selection of an appropriate VSA for a particular task. The
implementations are available.

causing acoustic power to trickle downwards along the flux tube has been
described before and can be visualized in our simulations. We show that this
downward propagation causes the flux tube to act as an isolated source,
creating a characteristic surface wavefield. Measuring this wavefield at the
surface reveals subsurface properties of the magnetic field topology. Using
time distance helioseismology, we demonstrate how to detect such a flux tube
signal based on a group travel-time delay of $\varDelta t = 282.6$ sec due to
the wave packet spending time subsurface as a slow mode wave. Although the
amplitude is small and generally superimposed by the full wave field, it can be
detected if assumptions about $\varDelta t$ are made. We demonstrate this for a
simulation with solar like sources. This kind of study has the potential to
reveal subsurface information of sunspots based on the analysis of a surface

important problem with many applications. For such inverse problems, supervised
deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoising methods have shown
strong results, but the success of these supervised methods critically depends
on the availability of a high-quality training dataset of similar measurements.
For image denoising, methods are available that enable training without a
separate training dataset by assuming that the noise in two different pixels is
uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not hold for inverse problems,
resulting in artifacts in the denoised images produced by existing methods.
Here, we propose Noise2Inverse, a deep CNN-based denoising method for linear
image reconstruction algorithms that does not require any additional clean or
noisy data. Training a CNN-based denoiser is enabled by exploiting the noise
model to compute multiple statistically independent reconstructions. We develop
a theoretical framework which shows that such training indeed obtains a
denoising CNN, assuming the measured noise is element-wise independent and
zero-mean. On simulated CT datasets, Noise2Inverse demonstrates an improvement
in peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index compared to
state-of-the-art image denoising methods and conventional reconstruction
methods, such as Total-Variation Minimization. We also demonstrate that the

more involved than other more conceptual models, such as the extended
Klausmeier model, and the analysis a priori is more complicated. However, the
present model has a strong advantage over these more conceptual models in that
it can be more directly linked to ecological mechanisms and observations.
Moreover, we find that the model exhibits a richness of analytically tractable
patterns that exceeds that of Klausmeier-type models. Our study focuses on the
4-dimensional dynamical system associated with the reaction-diffusion model by
considering traveling waves in 1 spatial dimension. We use the methods of
geometric singular perturbation theory to establish the existence of a
multitude of heteroclinic/homoclinic/periodic orbits that `jump' between
(normally hyperbolic) slow manifolds, representing various kinds of localized
vegetation patterns. The basic 1-front invasion patterns and 2-front spot/gap
patterns that form the starting point of our analysis have a direct ecological
interpretation and appear naturally in simulations of the model. By exploiting
the rich nonlinear structure of the model, we construct many multi-front
patterns that are novel, both from the ecological and the mathematical point of
view. In fact, we argue that these orbits/patterns are not specific for the
model considered here, but will also occur in a much more general (singularly
perturbed reaction-diffusion) setting. We conclude with a discussion of the

nodes with a few connections are hierarchically nested within the neighbours of
nodes with more connections. Despite the abstract simplicity of this notion,
different mathematical definitions of nestedness have been proposed, sometimes
giving contrasting results. Moreover, there is an ongoing debate on the
statistical significance of nestedness, since even random networks where the
number of connections (degree) of each node is fixed to its empirical value are
typically as nested as real-world ones. Here we propose a clarification that
exploits the recent finding that random networks where the degrees are enforced
as hard constraints (microcanonical ensembles) are thermodynamically different
from random networks where the degrees are enforced as soft constraints
(canonical ensembles). We show that if the real network is perfectly nested,
then the two ensembles are trivially equivalent and the observed nestedness,
independently of its definition, is indeed an unavoidable consequence of the
empirical degrees. On the other hand, if the real network is not perfectly
nested, then the two ensembles are not equivalent and alternative definitions
of nestedness can be even positively correlated in the canonical ensemble and
negatively correlated in the microcanonical one. This result disentangles
distinct notions of nestedness captured by different metrics and highlights the
importance of making a principled choice between hard and soft constraints in
null models of ecological networks.

gap. On the other hand, individual partial dislocations terminating single SFs
only induce states very close to the gap edge. We conclude that partial
dislocation complexes, in particular the most abundant triple ones, are killer
defects in terms of favoring leakage currents. Suggestions coming from
theory/simulations for devising a strategy to lower their occurrence are
discussed.

relies on a mapping between wave-function calculations in a finite basis set

non-divergent interaction corresponding to the electron-electron Coulomb

RSDFT-type complementary density functionals to recover the dominant part of
the short-range correlation effects missing in this finite basis set. To study
both weak and strong correlation regimes we consider the potential energy
curves of the H10, N2, O2, and F2 molecules up to the dissociation limit, and
we explore various approximations of complementary functionals fulfilling two
key properties: spin-multiplet degeneracy (i.e., independence of the energy

investigate the dependence of the functional on different types of on-top pair
densities and spin polarizations. The key result of this study is that the
explicit dependence on the on-top pair density allows one to completely remove
the dependence on any form of spin polarization without any significant loss of
accuracy. Quantitatively, we show that the basis-set correction reaches
chemical accuracy on atomization energies with triple-zeta quality basis sets
for most of the systems studied here. Also, the present basis-set

breaking up a global assimilation into subproblems. This unsupervised
localization technique based on a linearizedstate-observation measure is
general and does not rely on any prior information such as relevant spatial
scales, empirical cut-off radius or homogeneity assumptions. It automatically
segregates the state and observation variables in an optimal number of clusters

assimilation.The application of this method does not require underlying
block-diagonal structures of prior covariance matrices. In order to deal with
inter-cluster connectivity, two alternative data adaptations are proposed. Once

for occluded faces (containing occlusion caused by other objects and

application-specific generation of hardware accelerators. Reconfiguration of

generation stars at these stages of stellar evolution. The two generations also
separate in magnitude and color on the HB, which allows us to find the
difference in He abundance between the two populations by fitting appropriate
ZAHBs. The broad range of distances from the cluster's center covered by our

Financing of renewable energy (RE) projects is achieved via two channels: small
RE projects are financed indirectly through local banks that draw loans from
the fund's assets, whereas large RE projects are directly financed from the
fund. In a bottom-up Gaussian copula framework, we examine the diversification

feature utilizing a graph-based basis transformation to extract spatial

Specifically, in the proposed graph-based cepstrum, the log-amplitude of a

For outdoor scenarios, the C-band is expected to provide wide area coverage and
throughput uniformity, whereas the mmWave band is expected to provide
ultra-high throughput to dedicated areas within the C-band coverage. Due to the
differences in the frequency bands, both systems are expected to be designed
with different transmit and receive parameters, naturally resulting in
performance variations proportional to the chosen parameters. Unlike many
previous works, this paper presents measurement evaluations in central
Auckland, New Zealand, from a pre-commercial deployment of a single-user,
single-cell 5G-NR system operating in both bands. The net throughput, coverage
reliability, and channel rank are analyzed across the two bands with baseband

considerably better than mmWave, with a consistently higher channel rank.
Furthermore, the spatial stationarity region (SSR) for the azimuth
angles-of-departure (AODs) is characterized, and a model derived from the
measured beam identities is presented. The SSR of azimuth AODs is seen to

require to develop an app that collects useful information from users while
they search on their phones or participate in a user study. In this paper, we
aim to address this need by providing a comprehensive Android app, called
Omicron, which can be used to collect mobile query logs and perform user
studies on mobile devices. Omicron, at its current version, can collect users'
mobile queries, relevant documents, sensor data as well as user activity and
interaction data in various study settings. Furthermore, we designed Omicron in
such a way that it is conveniently extendable to conduct more specific studies
and collect other types of sensor data. Finally, we provide a tool to monitor
the participants and their data both during and after the collection process.

infinitely many solutions if the driving signal is rough enough (e.g. of

further show that in our example, non-uniqueness holds almost surely when the

inspired by biological proofreading mechanisms. At equilibrium, product
discrimination, the selective formation of a ""correct"" product with respect to
an ""incorrect product"", is fundamentally limited by the free energy difference
between the two products. However, biological systems often far exceed this
limit, by using discriminatory networks that expend free energy to maintain
non-equilibrium steady states. Non-equilibrium systems are notoriously
difficult to analyze and no systematic methods exist for determining parameter
regimes which maximize discrimination. Here we introduce a measure that can be
computed directly from the biochemical rate constants and which provides a
necessary condition for proofreading. Non-equilibrium systems can discriminate
using binding energy (energetic) differences or using activation energy
(kinetic) differences, but in both cases, proofreading is optimal when
dissipation is maximized, so long as the necessary condition we introduce is
satisfied. We show that these constraints can be in opposition and that this
explains why the error rate is a non-monotonic function of the irreversible
drive in the original proofreading scheme of Hopfield and Ninio. Finally, we
introduce mixed networks, in which one product is favored energetically and the
other kinetically. In such networks, sensitive product switching can be
achieved simply by spending free energy. Biologically, this corresponds to the
ability to select between products by driving a single reaction without network
fine tuning. This may be used to explore alternate product spaces in
challenging environments.

atmosphere with a high wind energy potential. Here we use large-eddy
simulations to study the effect of LLJ height on the flow dynamics in a wind
farm with $10\times4$ turbines. We change the LLJ height and atmospheric
thermal stratification by varying the surface cooling rate. We find that the
first row power production is higher in the presence of a LLJ compared to a
neutral reference case without LLJ. Besides, we show that the first row power
production increases with decreasing LLJ height. Due to the higher turbulence
intensity, the wind turbine wakes recover faster in a neutral boundary layer
than in a stably stratified one. However, for strong thermal stratification
with a low-height LLJ, the wake recovery can be faster than for the neutral
reference case as energy can be entrained from the LLJ. Flow visualizations
reveal that under stable stratification the growth of wind farm's internal
boundary layer is restricted and the wind flows around the wind farm. Wind
farms extract energy from LLJs through wake meandering and turbulent
entrainment depending on the LLJ height. Both effects are advantageous for wake
recovery, which is beneficial for the performance of downwind turbines. This
finding is confirmed by an energy budget analysis, which reveals a significant
increase in the kinetic energy flux in the presence of a LLJ. The jet strength
reduces as it passes through consecutive turbine rows. For strong
stratification, the combined effect of buoyancy destruction and turbulence
dissipation is larger than the turbulent entrainment. Therefore, the power
production of turbines in the back of the wind farm is relatively low for
strong atmospheric stratifications.

exhibiting clustering in their deployment. We model the coverage region of such

according to a Poisson cluster process (PCP) and each sensor has an independent
sensing range around it. We consider two variants of PCP, in particular \matern
and Thomas cluster process to form Boolean \matern and Thomas cluster models.
We first derive the capacity functional of these models. Using the derived
expressions, we compute the sensing probability of an event and compare it with
sensing probability of a WSN modeled by a Boolean Poisson model where sensors
are deployed according to a Poisson point process. We also derive the power
required for each cluster to collect data from all of its sensors for the three
considered WSNs. We show that a BPCM WSN has less power requirement in
comparison to the Boolean Poisson WSN, but it suffers from lower coverage,
leading to a trade-off between per-cluster power requirement and the sensing
performance. A cluster process with desired clustering may provide better
coverage while maintaining low power requirements.

searching for either microwaves or clocks in a dataset of 4,366 images
(MS-COCO). We then used this behaviorally-annotated dataset and the machine
learning method of Inverse-Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to learn
target-specific reward functions and policies for these two target goals.
Finally, we used these learned policies to predict the fixations of 60 new
behavioral searchers (clock = 30, microwave = 30) in a disjoint test dataset of
kitchen scenes depicting both a microwave and a clock (thus controlling for
differences in low-level image contrast). We found that the IRL model predicted
behavioral search efficiency and fixation-density maps using multiple metrics.
Moreover, reward maps from the IRL model revealed target-specific patterns that
suggest, not just attention guidance by target features, but also guidance by
scene context (e.g., fixations along walls in the search of clocks). Using
machine learning and the psychologically-meaningful principle of reward, it is
possible to learn the visual features used in goal-directed attention control.

Ritz values yield properties of the spectrum of $A$ (specific properties are

is an important function space that has many applications in various areas of
research. Attributed to the inertia of a measurement instrument, it is
desirable in sampling theory to recover a function by its nonuniform sampling.
In the present paper, based on dual framelet systems for the Sobolev space pair
$(H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}), H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}))$, where $d/2<s<\varsigma$, we
investigate the problem of constructing the approximations to all the functions
in $H^{\varsigma}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ by nonuniform sampling. We first establish
the convergence rate of the framelet series in $(H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}),
H^{-s}(\mathbb{R}^{d}))$, and then construct the framelet approximation
operator that acts on the entire space $H^{\varsigma}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$. We
examine the stability property for the framelet approximation operator with
respect to the perturbations of shift parameters, and obtain an estimate bound
for the perturbation error. Our result shows that under the condition
$d/2<s<\varsigma$, the approximation operator is robust to shift perturbations.
Motivated by some recent work on nonuniform sampling and approximation in
Sobolev space (e.g., [20]), we don't require the perturbation sequence to be in
$\ell^{\alpha}(\mathbb{Z}^{d})$. Our results allow us to establish the
approximation for every function in $H^{\varsigma}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ by

brings forward a technique toward the manipulability of an internally
piezo-equipped active spherical carrier subjected to the progressive acoustic
plane waves as the handling contactless asset. It is assumed that the
piezoelectric part of the active carrier may be actuated as a bi-sectional body
(i.e., two continuous hemispherical parts), with prescribed phase difference,
and the polar position of the imaginary separating plane may be altered. This
issue brings about an asymmetry in the dynamics of the problem which leads to
emergence of position/frequency dependent acoustic radiation torque. It is
obtained that as the carrier is excited by imposing harmonic voltage with the
same amplitude and a $\pi$-radians phase difference,the zero-radiation force
situation is obtained for a specific amplitude and phase of voltage as a
function of frequency. This situation is treated as a criterion to determine
the optimal amplitude of operation voltage. It is shown that the net force's
direction exerted on the activated carrier may be steered along any desired
orientation, assuming the fixed direction of the incident wave field. The
explained method of excitation and controllability of the spatial position of
the divisor plane can possibly be a breakthrough in acoustic handling of active
carriers. Noticeably, by this new technique, the single beam acoustic based
contact-free methods and their applications in association with the concept of
active carriers are now one step forward.

allowing new fields of applications. A maskless and very flexible structuring
process is offered by ablation using ultra-short pulse laser irradiation.
Usually, certain areas of a functional thin film coating are locally removed to
yield the needed device structures. Micro laser patterning quality is not only
influenced by the beam properties (beam profile, fluence) but also by pulse
overlap, scan repetitions and many other factors such as substrate and coating
material. This makes process parameter optimization a challenging task. In this
paper, we present a systematic approach to efficiently find suitable parameters
for laser-induced ablation of thin films on susceptible polymer substrates. As
an example, we use a sputtered NiCr coating with a thickness of 100 $nm$ on a
polyimide film made by spin coating of PI-2611 precursor (@ 2000 $rpm$ > ca. 8
${\mu}m$, HD microsystems). Irradiation is conducted using a fs-laser with
infrared wavelength of 1030 $nm$ and a pulse length of 212 $fs$. The energy per
pulse is varied in the range of 0,29 ${\mu}J$ to 4,83 ${\mu}J$, yielding
fluence values between 70 $mJ/cm^2$ and 1,11 $J/cm^2$. Ablation threshold
fluence for a 100 $nm$ layer of NiCr was found to be ${\phi}_{th}$
($N_P$:1)=0,50 $J/cm^2$ and the incubation factor was evaluated to be
${\xi}$=0,53. A clear distinction must be made between the material ablation at
the surface of a bulk material and the selective removal of a thin film. In the
second case effects such as flaking occur in practice and influence the
ablation characteristic. We then investigate different varieties of thin film
removal including dot-, line- and areal-ablation. The methodology is presented
using a practical example, but can be applied to selective ablation of a wide
range of thin film systems.

reason is that these models are not tested against sufficient real world

semi-implicit time integrators are commonly used in operational atmospheric
forecast models. They guarantee the stable treatment of fast (acoustic and
gravity) waves, while not suffering from severe restrictions on the timestep
size. To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear
equation for the prognostic variables has to be solved at every timestep. Since
the nonlinearity is typically weak, this is done with a small number of Newton-
or Picard- iterations, which in turn require the efficient solution of a large
system on linear equations with $\mathcal{O}(10^6-10^9)$ unknowns. This linear
solve is often the computationally most costly part of the model. In this paper
an efficient linear solver for the LFRic next-generation model, currently
developed by the Met Office, is described. The model uses an advanced mimetic
finite element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient solvers
challenging compared to models using standard finite-difference and
finite-volume methods. The linear solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid
preconditioner of the Schur-complement system for the pressure correction. By
comparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance and robustness
of the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases and
realistic model setups. In production mode, the model will have to run in
parallel on 100,000s of processing elements. As confirmed by numerical
experiments, one particular advantage of the multigrid solver is its excellent
parallel scalability due to avoiding expensive global reduction operations.

This family of algorithms is based on recursive message passing-based

in a data-driven manner. In particular, we propose to use machine learning (ML)
tools to learn the factor graph, instead of the overall system task, which in
turn is used for inference by message passing over the learned graph. We apply
the proposed approach to learn the factor graph representing a finite-memory

BCJRNet, learns to implement the BCJR algorithm from a small training set, and
that the resulting receiver exhibits improved robustness to inaccurate training

learn factor graphs from labeled data, one can implement a broad range of
model-based algorithms, which traditionally require full knowledge of the

spatial/stochastic averaging or coarse-graining, with a machine-learning
strategy based on sparse regression that can be executed in two modes. The
first, direct equation-learning, discovers a differential operator from the
whole dictionary. The second, constrained equation-learning, discovers only
those terms in the differential operator that need to be discovered, i.e.,
learns closure approximations. We illustrate our approach by learning a
deterministic equation that governs the spatiotemporal evolution of the
probability density function of a system state whose dynamics are described by
a nonlinear partial differential equation with random inputs. A series of
examples demonstrates the accuracy, robustness, and limitations of our approach
to equation discovery.

neural networks is difficult, and previous methods for converting trained
artificial neural networks to spiking neurons were inefficient because the
neurons had to emit too many spikes. We show that a substantially more
efficient conversion arises when one optimizes the spiking neuron model for
that purpose, so that it not only matters for information transmission how many
spikes a neuron emits, but also when it emits those spikes. This advances the
accuracy that can be achieved for image classification with spiking neurons,
and the resulting networks need on average just two spikes per neuron for
classifying an image. In addition, our new conversion method improves latency
and throughput of the resulting spiking networks.

theories of relativity. The dual is based on an identity relating the observer
time and the proper time as a contact transformation on configuration space,
which leaves phase space invariant. The theory is dual in that, for a system of
$n$ particles, any inertial observer has two unique sets of global variables
$({\bf{X}}, t)$ and $({\bf{X}}, \tau)$ to describe the dynamics. Where
${\bf{X}}$ is the (unique) canonical center of mass. In the $({\bf{X}}, t)$
variables, time is relative and the speed of light is unique, while in the
$({\bf{X}}, \tau)$ variables, time is unique and the speed of light is relative
with no upper bound. The two sets of particle and Maxwell field equations are
mathematically equivalent, but the particle wave equations are not. The dual
version contains an additional longitudinal radiation term that appears
instantaneously with acceleration, does not depend on the nature of the force
and the Wheeler-Feynman absorption hypothesis is a corollary.
  The homogenous and isotropic nature of the universe is sufficient to prove
that a unique definition of Newtonian time exists with zero set at the big
bang. The isotopic dual of $\R$ is used to improve the big bang model, by
providing an explanation for the lack of antimatter in our universe, a natural
arrow for time, conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum. This
also solves the flatness and horizon problems without inflation.
  We predict that radiation from a betatron (of any frequency) will not produce
photoelectrons, that matter and antimatter are gravitationally repulsive and
that data from distant sources does not have a unique physical interpretation.
We provide a table showing the differences between the Minkowski, Einstein and
dual versions of the special theory.}

socio-economic consequences for households, yet policies aimed at promoting
uptake of LPG for cooking have not always been effective at promoting sustained
transition to cleaner cooking amongst intended beneficiaries. This paper uses a
two step approach combining predictive and descriptive analyses of the IHDS
panel dataset to identify different groups of households that switched stove
between 2004/5 and 2011/12. A tree-based ensemble machine learning predictive
analysis identifies key determinants of a switch from biomass to non-biomass
stoves. A descriptive clustering analysis is used to identify groups of
stove-switching households that follow different transition pathways. There are
three key findings of this study: Firstly non-income determinants of stove
switching do not have a linear effect on stove switching, in particular
variables on time of use and appliance ownership which offer a proxy for
household energy practices; secondly location specific factors including
region, infrastructure availability, and dwelling quality are found to be key
determinants and as a result policies must be tailored to take into account
local variations; thirdly clean cooking interventions must enact a range of
measures to address the barriers faced by households on different energy
transition pathways.

of physiological and pathological phenomena in most mammalian systems. All four
receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system, where they
modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal plasticity. A large number of
gene association studies have shown that common genetic variants of the
adenosine receptors (encoded by the ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B and ADORA3 genes)
have a neuroprotective or neurodegenerative role in neurologic/psychiatric
diseases. New genetic studies of rare variants and few novel associations with
depression or epilepsy subtypes have recently been reported. Here, we review
the literature on the genetics of adenosine receptors in neurologic and/or
psychiatric diseases in humans, and discuss perspectives for further genetic
research. We also provide an update on the genetic structures of the four human
adenosine receptor genes and their regulation - a topic that has not been
extensively addressed. Our review emphasizes the importance of (i) better
characterizing the genetics of adenosine receptor genes and (ii) understanding
how these genes are regulated.

driving. When performing semantic image segmentation, a wider field of view
(FoV) helps to obtain more information about the surrounding environment,
making automatic driving safer and more reliable, which could be offered by
fisheye cameras. However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and
the fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with
large distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be
directly utilized. In this paper, a seven degrees of freedom (DoF) augmentation
method is proposed to transform rectilinear image to fisheye image in a more
comprehensive way. In the training process, rectilinear images are transformed
into fisheye images in seven DoF, which simulates the fisheye images taken by
cameras of different positions, orientations and focal lengths. The result
shows that training with the seven-DoF augmentation can improve the model's
accuracy and robustness against different distorted fisheye data. This
seven-DoF augmentation provides a universal semantic segmentation solution for
fisheye cameras in different autonomous driving applications. Also, we provide
specific parameter settings of the augmentation for autonomous driving. At
last, we tested our universal semantic segmentation model on real fisheye
images and obtained satisfactory results. The code and configurations are
released at https://github.com/Yaozhuwa/FisheyeSeg.

localization capability of AnchorNet. We further use localized patches for
downstream classification tasks across widely applied networks. Experimental
results demonstrate that replacing the original inputs with their patches for
classification can get a clear inference acceleration with only tiny
performance degradation, which proves that localized patches can indeed retain
the most semantics and evidences of the original inputs.

  Brain's Extraordinary Energy Efficiency?","Based on invited talk at Models of Consciousness Conference,
  Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, September 2019",,"10.3390/e22030281",,"q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is proposed that both human creativity and human consciousness are
(unintended) consequences of the human brain's extraordinary energy efficiency.
The topics of creativity and consciousness are treated separately, though have
a common sub-structure. It is argued that creativity arises from a synergy
between two cognitive modes of the human brain (which broadly coincide with
Kahneman's Systems 1 and 2). In the first, available energy is spread across a
relatively large network of neurons. As such, the amount of energy per active
neuron is so small that the operation of such neurons is susceptible to thermal
(ultimately quantum decoherent) noise. In the second, available energy is
focussed on a small enough subset of neurons to guarantee a deterministic
operation. An illustration of how this synergy can lead to creativity with
implications for computing in silicon are discussed. Starting with a discussion
of the concept of free will, the notion of consciousness is defined in terms of
an awareness of what are perceived to be nearby counterfactual worlds in state
space. It is argued that such awareness arises from an interplay between our
memories on the one hand, and quantum physical mechanisms (where, unlike in
classical physics, nearby counterfactual worlds play an indispensable dynamical
role) in the ion channels of neural networks. As with the brain's
susceptibility to noise, it is argued that in situations where quantum physics
plays a role in the brain, it does so for reasons of energy efficiency. As an
illustration of this definition of consciousness, a novel proposal is outlined
as to why quantum entanglement appears so counter-intuitive.

convolutional network with local self-attention mechanism and query-aware
