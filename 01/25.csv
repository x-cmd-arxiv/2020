$\omega$) driven thermo-electric transport properties of type-I and type-II
multi-Weyl semimetals (mWSMs) in the high frequency limit. Considering the low
energy model, we employ the Floquet-Kubo formalism to compute the thermal Hall
and Nernst conductivities for both types of mWSMs. We show that the anisotropic
nature of the dispersion for arbitrary integer monopole charge $n>1$ plays an
important role in determining the effective Fermi surface behavior;
interestingly, one can observe momentum dependent corrections in Floquet mWSMs
in addition to momentum independent contribution as observed for Floquet single
WSMs. Apart from the non-trivial tuning of the Weyl node position $\pm Q \to
\pm Q- A_0^{2n}/\omega$, our study reveals that the momentum independent terms
result in leading order contribution in the conductivity tensor. This has the
form of $n$ times the single WSMs results with effective chemical potential
$\mu \to \mu -A_0^{2n}/\omega$. On the other hand, momentum dependent
corrections lead to sub-leading order terms which are algebraic function of
$\mu$ and are present for $n>1$. Remarkably, this analysis further allows us to
distinguish type-I mWSMs from their type-II counterparts. For type-II mWSMs, we
find that the transport coefficients for $n\geq 2$ exhibit algebraic dependence
on the momentum cutoff in addition to the weak logarithmic dependence as
noticed for $n=1$ WSMs. We demonstrate the variation and qualitative
differences of transport coefficients between type-I and type-II mWSM as a
function of external driving parameter $\omega$.

spatial-temporal tasks. We formalize the problem as a factored Markov decision
process subject to so-called graph temporal logic specifications. The
transition function and the spatial-temporal task of each agent depend on the
agent itself and its neighboring agents. The structure in the model and the
specifications enable to develop a distributed algorithm that, given a factored
Markov decision process and a graph temporal logic formula, decomposes the
synthesis problem into a set of smaller synthesis problems, one for each agent.
We prove that the algorithm runs in time linear in the total number of agents.
The size of the synthesis problem for each agent is exponential only in the
number of neighboring agents, which is typically much smaller than the number
of agents. We demonstrate the algorithm in case studies on disease control and
urban security. The numerical examples show that the algorithm can scale to
hundreds of agents.

resources are hardware limited and cannot support workload-driven

availability of all needed resources whenever a job request is made. This paper
challenges that assumption, since not all job requests from a Cloud server can
be scheduled on an Edge node. Thus, guaranteeing fairness among the clients
(Cloud servers offloading jobs) while accounting for priorities of the jobs
becomes a critical task. This paper presents four scheduling techniques, the
first is a naive first come first serve strategy and further proposes three
strategies, namely a client fair, priority fair, and hybrid that accounts for
the fairness of both clients and job priorities. An evaluation on a target
platform under three different scenarios, namely equal, random, and Gaussian
job distributions is presented. The experimental studies highlight the low
overheads and the distribution of scheduled jobs on the Edge node when compared

the versatility of horizontal-axis wind turbines, by widening their working

bend the blade along its chord, varying the pitch angle by means of
non-consuming mechanisms. Here we introduce a general method based on a
universal scaling, which finds the optimal soft materials for the blades to
maximize the overall turbine efficiency or rotational power, for any required
geometry of classical horizontal-axis turbines. The optimization problem, which
depends on various parameters, such as the wind velocity, the rotation rate,
the density, the rigidity and the geometry of the blade, is reduced to only two
dimensionless parameters: the Cauchy number and the centrifugal number. The
blade-element momentum theory is coupled to a torsion spring-based model for
the blade deformation. Taking into account realistic incoming wind-velocity
distributions in the North Sea and a large wind-turbine geometry, we found a
significant increase of the total harvested power, up to +35%. In addition, the
optimal soft material corresponding to the maximal efficiency over the entire
working range for a given wind turbine geometry is, within the limits of small
blade deformations, scale-independent. Thus experiments on small wind turbines
are a possible way to determine the optimal soft materials for larger ones.
These flexible blades are found to be between 5% and 20% lighter than the

gradual stripping of gas via ram pressure works better to fully reproduce the

a Long Short-Term Memories-based (LSTM-based) awareness approach to reveal the
reasons behind an anomaly case that occurs during a manipulation episode in an
unstructured environment. The proposed method takes into account the real-time
observations of the robot by fusing visual, auditory and proprioceptive sensory
modalities to achieve this task. We also provide a comparative analysis of our
method with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).
The symptoms of anomalies are first learned from a given training set, then
they can be classified in real-time based on the learned models. The approaches
are evaluated on a Baxter robot executing object manipulation scenarios. The
results indicate that the LSTM-based method outperforms the other methods with
a 0.94 classification rate in revealing causes of anomalies in case of an
unexpected deviation.

entanglement or quantum coherence, in the fundamental task of parameter
estimation. Here we consider the question of the estimation of the Unruh
temperature in the scenario of relativistic quantum metrology. Specifically, we
study two distinct cases. First, a single Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting
with a scalar quantum field undergoes an uniform acceleration for a finite
amount of proper time, and the role of coherence in the estimation process is
analyzed. After this, we consider two initially entangled detectors, one of
which is inertial while the other one undergoes acceleration. Our results show
that the maximum of the Fisher information, thus characterizing the maximum
possible precision according to Cramm\'{e}r-Rao bound, occurs only for small
accelerations, while it decreases fast when acceleration increases. Moreover,
the role of initial coherence ---in the single detector case---, or
entanglement ---in the two detectors case---, is to decrease Fisher
information. Therefore, under the considered protocol, internal coherence (or
entanglement) is not a resource for estimating Unruh temperature. These
unexpected results show that a detection of the Unruh effect can be even more
challenge than previously thought. Finally, by considering the connection
between Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, we discuss how our results can be
understood in the context of the estimation of Hawking temperature.

distinguishing features to their own neighboring points with the same label,
leading to the enhancement of the distinguishing ability of point-wise

fronthaul links of cloud-based small cell networks (C-SCNs), which deteriorates
users' quality of service (QoS) and requires substantial power consumption.
This paper proposes an efficient maximum distance separable (MDS) coded caching
framework for a cache-enabled C-SCNs, aiming at reducing long-term power
consumption while satisfying users' QoS requirements in short-term
transmissions. To achieve this goal, the cache resource in small-cell base
stations (SBSs) needs to be reasonably updated by taking into account users'
content preferences, SBS collaboration, and characteristics of wireless links.
Specifically, without assuming any prior knowledge of content popularity, we
formulate a mixed timescale problem to jointly optimize cache updating,
multicast beamformers in fronthaul and edge links, and SBS clustering.
Nevertheless, this problem is anti-causal because an optimal cache updating
policy depends on future content requests and channel state information. To
handle it, by properly leveraging historical observations, we propose a
two-stage updating scheme by using Frobenius-Norm penalty and inexact block
coordinate descent method. Furthermore, we derive a learning-based design,
which can obtain effective tradeoff between accuracy and computational
complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
two-stage framework.

less permanent traits. Although this finding is intuitive, there is no current
work identifying exactly where in the biometric analysis temporal persistence
makes a difference. In this paper, we answer this question. In a recent report,
we introduced the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) as an index of
temporal persistence for such features. In that report, we also showed that
choosing only the most temporally persistent features yielded superior
performance in 12 of 14 datasets. Motivated by those empirical results, we
present a novel approach using synthetic features to study which aspects of a
biometric identification study are influenced by the temporal persistence of
features. What we show is that using more temporally persistent features
produces effects on the similarity score distributions that explain why this
quality is so key to biometric performance. The results identified with the
synthetic data are largely reinforced by an analysis of two datasets, one based
on eye-movements and one based on gait. There was one difference between the
synthetic and real data: In real data, features are intercorrelated, with the
level of intercorrelation increasing with increasing ICC. This

for real datasets with a decorrelation step produced results which were very
similar to that obtained with synthetic features.

consecutive entries (thus the ordering is locally block-avoiding). We describe
a greedy algorithm which shows that such an ordering exists, provided that $n$
is sufficiently large when compared to $\ell$. This algorithm leads to improved
bounds on the number of points in cases where this was known, but also extends
the results to a significantly more general setting (which includes, for
example, orderings that avoid the blocks of a design). Similar results for a
cyclic variant of this situation are also established.
  We construct Steiner triple systems and quadruple systems where $\ell$ can be

generalise the Stinson--Veitch bound to a wider class of block designs and to

an ordering exists when the number of points is more than $15k-5$. By making
use of a greedy approach, the paper improves this bound to $9k+O(k^{2/3})$.

McKean-Vlasov evolution $ (\mu_t)_{t\in [0,\infty)} $ admits exactly three
stationary states. In this paper we study the long-time behaviour of the flow $
(\mu_t)_{t\in [0,\infty)} $ in this regime. The main result is that, for any
initial measure $ \mu_0 $, the flow $ (\mu_t)_{t\in [0,\infty)} $ converges to
a stationary state as $ t\rightarrow \infty $. Moreover, we show that if the
energy of the initial measure is below some critical threshold, then the
limiting stationary state can be identified. Finally, we also show some
topological properties of the basins of attraction of the McKean-Vlasov
evolution. The proofs are based on the representation of $ (\mu_t)_{t\in

  Some results of this paper are not entirely new. The main contribution here
is to show that the Wasserstein framework provides short and elegant proofs for
these results. However, up to the author's best knowledge, the statement on the

the export of entropy. The fastest and most accurate way to reset a qubit is
obtained by coupling the qubit to an ancilla on demand. Here, we derive
fundamental bounds on qubit reset in terms of maximum fidelity and minimum
time, assuming control over the qubit and no control over the ancilla. Using
the Cartan decomposition of the Lie algebra of qubit plus two-level ancilla, we
identify the types of interaction and controls for which the qubit can be
purified. For these configurations, we show that a time-optimal protocol
consists of purity exchange between qubit and ancilla brought into resonance,
where the maximum fidelity is identical for all cases but the minimum time
depends on the type of interaction and control. Furthermore, we find the
maximally achievable fidelity to increase with the size of the ancilla Hilbert
space, whereas the reset time remains constant.

the wakefield, which travels at the laser group velocity. We present a way to
overcome this limit within a single plasma stage. The amplitude of the
wakefield behind a train of laser pulses can be controlled in-flight by
modulating the density profile. This creates a succession of resonant
laser-plasma accelerator sections and non-resonant drift sections, within which
the wakefield disappears and the electrons rephase. A two-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulation with four 2.5TW laser pulses produces a 50MeV
electron energy gain, four times that obtained from a uniform plasma. Although
laser red-shift prevents operation in the blowout regime, the technique offers
increased energy gain for accelerators limited to the linear regime by the
available laser power. This is particularly relevant for laser-plasma x-ray
sources capable of operating at high repetition rates, which are highly sought

carefully study the parameters of spiral structure in 155 face-on spiral
galaxies, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, in the three $gri$ bands.
We use a method for deriving a set of parameters of spiral structure, such as
the width of the spiral arms, their fraction to the total galaxy luminosity and
their colour, which have not been properly studied before. Our method is based
on an analysis of a set of photometric cuts perpendicular to the direction of a
spiral arm. Based on the results of our study, we compare the main three
classes of spirals: grand design, multi-armed and flocculent. We conclude that:
i) for the vast majority of galaxies (86\%) we observe an increase of their arm
width with galactocentric distance; ii) more luminous spirals in grand design
galaxies exhibit smaller variations of the pitch angle with radius than less
luminous grand design spirals; iii) grand design galaxies show less difference
between the pitch angles of individual arms than multi-armed galaxies. Apart
from these distinctive features, all three spiral classes do not differ
significantly by their pitch angle, arm width, width asymmetry, and
environment. Wavelength dependence is found only for the arm fraction.
Therefore, observationally we find no strong difference (except for the view
and number of arms) between grand design, multi-armed and flocculent spirals in
the sample galaxies.

attachment - has proved controversial. Critics argue that measuring the
temporal evolution of a network directly is better than measuring the degree
distribution when looking for preferential attachment. However, many of the
established methods do not account for any potential time-dependence in the
attachment kernels of growing networks, or methods assume that node degree is
the key observable determining network evolution. In this paper, we argue that
these assumptions may lead to misleading conclusions about the evolution of
growing networks. We illustrate this by introducing a simple adaptation of the
Barab{\'a}si-Albert model, the ""k2 model"", where new nodes attach to nodes in
the existing network in proportion to the number of nodes one or two steps from
the target node. The k2 model results in time dependent degree distributions
and attachment kernels, despite initially appearing to grow as linear
preferential attachment, and without the need to include explicit time
dependence in key network parameters (such as the average out-degree). We show
that similar effects are seen in several real world networks where constant
network growth rules do not describe their evolution. This implies that
measurements of specific degree distributions in real networks are also likely
to change over time.

upcall. The network is trained on several thousand examples recorded at various

30-minute recordings from the years 2015-2017 containing over one thousand

iteratively generate pseudo-labels on a mini-batch of unsupervised utterances

investigations of our method, regarding the effect of data augmentation,
decoding beamsize for pseudo-label generation, and freshness of pseudo-labels.
On a commonly used semi-supervised ASR setting with the WSJ corpus, our method

between the freezing and thawing classes of models with current and forthcoming
observational facilities and using a parametrisation of the dark energy

fiducial paradigm. We illustrate how freezing and thawing models lead to
different redshift dependencies of $\alpha$, and use a combination of current
astrophysical observations and local experiments to constrain this class of

factor of two, despite considering a more extended parameter space than the one
used in previous studies. We also briefly discuss the improvements expected
from future facilities and comment on the practical limitations of this class
of parametrisations. In particular, we show that sufficiently sensitive data

nature of this entropy-diffusion relation in three deterministic systems where
an accurate estimate of both can be carried out. We study three deterministic
model systems, (a) the motion of a single point particle with constant energy
in a two-dimensional periodic potential energy landscape, (b) the same in
regular Lorentz gas where a point particle with constant energy moves between
collisions with hard disc scatterers and (c) motion of a point particle among
the boxes with small apertures. These models, introduced by Zwanzig, exhibit
diffusive motion in the limit where ergodicity is shown to exist. We then
explore the diffusion-entropy relation by an accurate calculation of both
diffusion and entropy for the aforementioned model systems. We estimate the
self-diffusion coefficient of the particle by employing computer simulations
and entropy by quadrature using Boltzmann's formula. We observe an interesting
crossover in the diffusion-entropy relation in some specific regions which is
attributed to the emergence of correlated returns. The crossover could herald a
breakdown of the Rosenfeld-like exponential scaling between the two, as
observed at low temperatures. Later, we modify the scaling relation to account

fluctuations during an early epoch of accelerated expansion. Yet, the patterns
we observe today do not distinguish between quantum or classical primordial
fluctuations; current cosmological data is consistent with either possibility.
We argue here that a detection of primordial non-Gaussianity can resolve the
present situation, and provide a litmus-test for the quantum origin of cosmic
structure. Unlike in quantum mechanics, vacuum fluctuations cannot arise in
classical theories and therefore long-range classical correlations must result
from (real) particles in the initial state. Similarly to flat-space scattering
processes, we show how basic principles require these particles to manifest
themselves as poles in the $n$-point functions, in the so-called folded
configurations. Following this observation, and assuming fluctuations are (i)
correlated over large scales, and (ii) generated by local evolution during an
inflationary phase, we demonstrate that: the absence of a pole in the folded
limit of non-Gaussian correlators uniquely identifies the quantum vacuum as the
initial state. In the same spirit as Bell's inequalities, we discuss how this
can be circumvented if locality is abandoned. We also briefly discuss the
implications for simulations of a non-Gaussian universe.

systematic, orderly manner, and we develop the associated equations of motion.
As evidence we show that the expected effects are fully apparent in the orbital
characteristics of the correlated bodies involved, including most strikingly
regarding their orbital planes, azimuth orientations and specific relative
angular momenta, which we show generates a highly unexpected form of resonance
in their relative angular momenta. We further show that the coordinates of
Planet 9's orbit are close to the original values proposed recently by other
authors, although we prove that its period has to be dramatically smaller than
that proposed in recent literature by Batygin and Brown, 2019, at about 3500
yrs, the eccentricity is near 0.65, and its mass approximately 8.4 times the
Earth's mass. Given the predicted orbit we show that the planet has apparently

coincident with electromagnetic counterpart emission. To solidify their role as
multimessenger sources, we present fully 3D, general relativistic,
magnetohydrodynamic simulations of spinning NSNSs initially on quasicircular
orbits that merge and undergo delayed collapse to a black hole (BH). The NSNSs
consist of two identical stars modeled as $\Gamma=2$ polytropes with spin
$\chi_{NS}= 0.36$ aligned along the direction of the total orbital angular
momentum $L$. Each star is initially threaded by a dynamical unimportant
interior dipole B-field. The field is extended into the exterior where a nearly
force-free magnetosphere resembles that of a pulsar. The magnetic dipole moment
$\mu$ is either aligned or perpendicular to $L$ and has the same initial
magnitude for each orientation. For comparison, we also impose symmetry across
the orbital plane in one case where $\mu$ in both stars is aligned along $L$.
We find that the lifetime of the transient hypermassive neutron star remnant,
the jet launching time, and the ejecta are very sensitive to the B-field
orientation. By contrast, the physical properties of the BH + disk remnant,
such as the mass and spin of the BH, the accretion rate, and the
electromagnetic luminosity, are roughly independent of the initial B-field
orientation. In addition, we find imposing symmetry across the orbital plane
does not play a significant role in the final outcome of the mergers. Our
results show that an incipient jet emerges only when the seed B-field has a
sufficiently large-scale poloidal component aligned to $L$. The lifetime

recent short-lived burst of star formation within the last 1.5 Gyr, i.e.
""post-starburst"" galaxies, however we show that good quality continuum spectra

burst age. Dust attenuation appears to be the primary cause for
misidentification of post-starburst galaxies, leading to contamination in
spectroscopic samples where only the [OII] emission line is available, as well
as a small fraction of objects lost from photometric samples. The 31 confirmed
post-starburst galaxies have formed 40-90% of their stellar mass in the last
1-1.5 Gyr. We use the derived star formation histories to find that the
post-starburst galaxies are visible photometrically for 0.5-1 Gyr. This allows
us to update a previous analysis to suggest that 25-50% of the growth of the
red sequence at z~1 could be caused by a starburst followed by rapid quenching.
We use the inferred maximum historical star formation rates of several 100-1000
Msun/yr and updated visibility times to confirm that sub-mm galaxies are likely

that $M_\star/L$ is correlated with color for both the optical and mid-IR and
report color vs. $M_\star/L$ relations (CMLRs) in M31 for filters used in the

Third, we show that the CMLR residuals correlate with recent SFH, such that
quiescent regions are offset to higher $M_\star/L$ than star-forming regions at

can also have implications for primordial black hole formation and CMB spectral

  The geometric random walk behavior of the spectator field allows us to
calculate the ensemble-averaged power spectrum of curvature perturbations
semi-analytically. For sufficiently large stochastic sourcing, the
ensemble-averaged power spectrum shows a scale dependence arising from the time
spent by modes outside the horizon during the period of particle production, in

bounded party. Specifically, we construct a protocol that allows a classical
verifier to robustly certify that a single computationally bounded quantum
device must have prepared a Bell pair and performed single-qubit measurements
on it, up to a change of basis applied to both the device's state and

achieve this, we build on techniques first introduced by Brakerski et al.

striking solitary wave-like instability. Theoretical modeling demonstrates that
these behaviors may be attributed to different bifurcations at the onset of

T1-mapping at 7T by optimizing the flip angle pair and carefully selecting RF
pulse shape and duration. Theory and Methods: Spoiled gradient echoes can be
used to estimate whole-brain maps of T1. This can be accomplished by using only
two acquisitions with different flip angles, i.e., a DFA-based approach.
Although DFA-based T1-mapping is seemingly straightforward to implement, it is
sensitive to bias caused by incomplete spoiling and incidental magnetization
transfer (MT) effects. Further bias is introduced by the increased B0 and B1+
inhomogeneities at 7T. Experiments were performed to determine the optimal flip
angle pair and appropriate RF pulse shape and duration. Obtained T1 estimates
were validated using inversion recovery prepared EPI and compared to literature
values. A multi-echo readout was used to increase SNR, enabling quantification
of R2* and susceptibility, X. Results: Incomplete spoiling was observed above a
local flip angle of approximately 20 degrees. An asymmetric gauss-filtered sinc
pulse with a constant duration of 700 us showed a sufficiently flat frequency
response profile to avoid incomplete excitation in areas with high B0 offsets.
A pulse duration of 700 us minimized effects from incidental MT. Conclusion:
When performing DFA-based T1-mapping one should (i) limit the higher flip angle
to avoid incomplete spoiling, (ii) use a RF pulse shape insensitive to B0
inhomogeneities and (iii) apply a constant RF pulse duration, balanced to
minimize incidental MT.

associativity propagating in varieties of loops.
  An equation $\varepsilon$ propagates in an algebra $X$ if
$\varepsilon(\overrightarrow y)$ holds whenever $\varepsilon(\overrightarrow

subalgebra of $X$ generated by $\overrightarrow x$. If $\varepsilon$ propagates
in $X$ then it propagates in all subalgebras and products of $X$ but not
necessarily in all homomorphic images of $X$. If $\mathcal V$ is a variety, the
propagating core $\mathcal V_{[\varepsilon]} = \{X\in\mathcal V:\varepsilon$
propagates in $X\}$ is a quasivariety but not necessarily a variety.
  We prove by elementary means Goursat's Lemma for loops and describe all
subdirect products of $X^k$ and all finitely generated loops in
$\mathbf{HSP}(X)$ for a nonabelian simple loop $X$. If $\mathcal V$ is a

simple or contained in $\mathcal V$, then associativity propagates in
$\mathbf{HSP}(X)\lor\mathcal V$.
  We study the propagating core $\mathcal S_{[x(yz)=(xy)z]}$ of Steiner loops

varieties contained in $\mathcal S_{[x(yz)=(xy)z]}$, each providing a solution

distance between $u$ and $w$ does not equal the distance between $v$ and $w$,
then $w$ is said to resolve $u$ and $v$. The metric dimension of $G$, denoted
$\beta(G)$, is the cardinality of a smallest set $W$ of vertices such that
every pair of vertices of $G$ is resolved by some vertex of $W$. The threshold
dimension of a graph $G$, denoted $\tau(G)$, is the minimum metric dimension
among all graphs $H$ having $G$ as a spanning subgraph. In other words, the
threshold dimension of $G$ is the minimum metric dimension among all graphs
obtained from $G$ by adding edges. If $\beta(G) = \tau(G)$, then $G$ is said to
be \emph{irreducible}; otherwise, we say that $G$ is reducible. If $H$ is a
graph having $G$ as a spanning subgraph and such that $\beta(H)=\tau(G)$, then
$H$ is called a threshold graph of $G$.
  The threshold dimension of a graph is expressed in terms of a minimum number
of strong products of paths that admits a certain type of embedding of the
graph. A sharp upper bound for the threshold dimension of trees is established.
It is also shown that the irreducible trees are precisely those of metric
dimension at most 2. Moreover, if $T$ is a tree with metric dimension 3 or 4,
then $T$ has threshold dimension $2$. It is shown, in these two cases, that a
threshold graph for $T$ can be obtained by adding exactly one or two edges to
$T$, respectively. However, these results do not extend to trees with metric
dimension $5$, i.e., there are trees of metric dimension $5$ with threshold
dimension exceeding $2$.

sparse reconstruction algorithm for the tumor initial location (TIL). This
problem is particularly challenging due to nonlinearity, ill-posedeness, and
ill conditioning. We propose a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution continuation
scheme with parameter decomposition to stabilize the inversion. We demonstrate
robustness and practicality of our method by applying the proposed method to
clinical data of 206 GBM patients. We analyze the extracted biomarkers and
relate tumor origin with patient overall survival by mapping the former into a
common atlas space. We present preliminary results that suggest improved
accuracy for prediction of patient overall survival when a set of imaging
features is augmented with estimated biophysical parameters. All extracted
features, tumor initial positions, and biophysical growth parameters are made
publicly available for further analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first
fully automatic scheme that can handle multifocal tumors and can localize the

assessing tumor sizes and monitoring changes in growth. However, not only is
manual lesion segmentation time-consuming, but it is also expensive and

Although these annotations are far from precise, they are widely used
throughout hospitals and are found in their picture archiving and communication

robust yet challenging means of weak supervision for training full lesion
segmentation models. In this work, we propose a weakly-supervised
co-segmentation model that first generates pseudo-masks from the RECIST slices
and uses these as training labels for an attention-based convolutional neural
network capable of segmenting common lesions from a pair of CT scans. To
validate and test the model, we utilize the DeepLesion dataset, an extensive
CT-scan lesion dataset that contains 32,735 PACS bookmarked images. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our co-segmentation approach

A common strategy in practice is to \emph{impute} the missing entries with an
appropriate substitute and then implement a standard statistical procedure
acting as if the covariates were fully observed. Recent literature on this
subject proposes instead to design a specific, often complicated or non-convex,
algorithm tailored to the case of missing covariates. We investigate a simpler
approach where we fill-in the missing entries with their conditional mean given
the observed covariates. We show that this imputation scheme coupled with
standard off-the-shelf procedures such as the LASSO and square-root LASSO
retains the minimax estimation rate in the random-design setting where the
covariates are i.i.d.\ sub-Gaussian. We further show that the square-root LASSO
remains \emph{pivotal} in this setting.
  It is often the case that the conditional expectation cannot be computed
exactly and must be approximated from data. We study two cases where the
covariates either follow an autoregressive (AR) process, or are jointly
Gaussian with sparse precision matrix. We propose tractable estimators for the
conditional expectation and then perform linear regression via LASSO, and show
similar estimation rates in both cases. We complement our theoretical results
with simulations on synthetic and semi-synthetic examples, illustrating not
only the sharpness of our bounds, but also the broader utility of this strategy
beyond our theoretical assumptions.

non-invasive glucometer that takes into account serum glucose for high
accuracy. In case of blood glucose measurement, serum glucose value has always
been considered precise blood glucose value during prandial modes. Serum
glucose can be measured in laboratory and more stable glucose level compare to
capillary glucose. However, this invasive approach is not convenient for
frequent measurement. Sometimes, Conventional invasive blood glucose
measurement may be responsible for cause of trauma and chance of blood related
infections. To overcome this issue, in the current paper, we propose a novel
Internet-of-Medical (IoMT) enabled glucometer for non-invasive precise serum
glucose measurement. In this work, a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic
technique has been used for glucose measurement. The novel device called iGLU
2.0 is based on optical detection and precise machine learning (ML) regression
models. The optimal multiple polynomial regression and deep neural network
models have been presented to analyze the precise measurement. The glucose
values of serum are saved on cloud through open IoT platform for
endocrinologist at remote location. To validate iGLU 2.0, Mean Absolute
Relative Difference (mARD) and Average Error (AvgE) are obtained 6.07% and
6.09%, respectively from predicted blood glucose values for capillary glucose.
For serum glucose, mARD and AvgE are found 4.86% and 4.88%, respectively. These
results represent that the proposed non-invasive glucose measurement device is
more precise for serum glucose compared to capillary glucose.

carbon nanotube material is proposed and experimentally evaluated in this
paper. The method is based on the measurement of microwave transmission through
a capacitive-resonator aperture in a conductive screen loaded with a CNT sample
under test. This method allows to measure microwave permittivity and absorption
of thin samples, several atomic layers to few micrometers thick, with linear
dimensions much smaller than the wavelength of radiation in free space. This
minimal sample requirement restricts the application of conventional microwave
characterization methods such as free-space or waveguide permittivity
characterization. It is demonstrated that the resonance E-field enhancement
inside the CRA leads to strong EM interaction of the microwave E-field with the
CNT sample under test thus enabling high sensitivity and dynamic range of the
measurement procedure. Another advantage of the proposed technique over
conventional non-resonance characterization methods is that in the resonance
transmission band, the CRA operation is reflection-less which leads to a
relatively simple qualitative algebraic de-embedding procedure of the material
parameters based on the principle of energy conservation. The experimental
microwave absorption data of the multiwall CNT samples are presented in the S
frequency band (2-4GHz), demonstrating microwave absorption properties of the
multiwall CNT ribbons.

times and high-fidelity operations, with the superconducting qubit modality
being a leading example. However, superconducting qubit coherence is impacted
by broken Cooper pairs, referred to as quasiparticles, with a density that is
empirically observed to be orders of magnitude greater than the value predicted
for thermal equilibrium by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of
superconductivity. Previous work has shown that infrared photons significantly
increase the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best isolated systems, it
still remains higher than expected, suggesting that another generation
mechanism exists. In this Letter, we provide evidence that ionizing radiation
from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this
observed difference, leading to an elevated quasiparticle density that would
ultimately limit superconducting qubits of the type measured here to coherence
times in the millisecond regime. We further demonstrate that introducing
radiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and positively
correlates with increased coherence time. Albeit a small effect for today's
qubits, reducing or otherwise mitigating the impact of ionizing radiation will
be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.

automated spine processing pipeline. Reliable and accurate processing of spine
images is expected to benefit clinical decision-support systems for diagnosis,
surgery planning, and population-based analysis on spine and bone health.
However, designing automated algorithms for spine processing is challenging
predominantly due to considerable variations in anatomy and acquisition
protocols and due to a severe shortage of publicly available data. Addressing
these limitations, the Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation Challenge (VerSe) was
organised in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image
Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2019 and 2020, with a
call for algorithms towards labelling and segmentation of vertebrae. Two
datasets containing a total of 374 multi-detector CT scans from 355 patients
were prepared and 4505 vertebrae have individually been annotated at
voxel-level by a human-machine hybrid algorithm (https://osf.io/nqjyw/,
https://osf.io/t98fz/). A total of 25 algorithms were benchmarked on these
datasets. In this work, we present the the results of this evaluation and
further investigate the performance-variation at vertebra-level, scan-level,
and at different fields-of-view. We also evaluate the generalisability of the
approaches to an implicit domain shift in data by evaluating the top performing
algorithms of one challenge iteration on data from the other iteration. The
principal takeaway from VerSe: the performance of an algorithm in labelling and
segmenting a spine scan hinges on its ability to correctly identify vertebrae
in cases of rare anatomical variations. The content and code concerning VerSe

iteration with diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA). Although this approach
is widely used and effective on many problems, there remain some practical
issues with DSA preconditioning, particularly on highly heterogeneous domains.
For large-scale parallel simulation, it is critical that both (i)
preconditioned source iteration converges rapidly, and (ii) the action of the
DSA preconditioner can be applied using fast, scalable solvers, such as
algebraic multigrid (AMG). For heterogeneous domains, these two interests can
be at odds. In particular, there exist DSA diffusion discretizations that can
be solved rapidly using AMG, but they do not always yield robust/fast
convergence of the larger source iteration. Conversely, there exist robust DSA
discretizations where source iteration converges rapidly on difficult
heterogeneous problems, but fast parallel solvers like AMG tend to struggle
applying the action of such operators. Moreover, very few current methods for
the solution of deterministic transport are compatible with voids. This paper
develops a new heterogeneous DSA preconditioner based on only preconditioning
the optically thick subdomains. The resulting method proves robust on a variety
of heterogeneous transport problems, including a linearized hohlraum mesh
related to inertial confinement fusion. Moreover, the action of the
preconditioner is easily computed using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ AMG iterations,
{convergence of the transport iteration typically requires $2-5\times$ less
iterations than current state-of-the-art ``full DSA,'' and the proposed method
is} trivially compatible with voids. On the hohlraum problem, rapid convergence
is obtained by preconditioning less than 3\% of the mesh elements with $5-10$
AMG iterations.

compares graph convolutional networks using different graph representations in

a surge of interest and applications in machine learning. However, empirical

entropically regularized OT has become a popular workaround. However, while it
enjoys fast algorithms and better statistical properties, it looses the metric
structure that Wasserstein distances enjoy. This work proposes a novel
Gaussian-smoothed OT (GOT) framework, that achieves the best of both worlds:
preserving the 1-Wasserstein metric structure while alleviating the empirical

separation, but to density depletion. Second, for astrophysically relevant
plasmas of pulsar magnetospheres, (and possible loci of Fast Radio Bursts),
where cyclotron frequency $\omega_B$ dominates over plasma frequency $\omega_p$
and the frequency of the electromagnetic wave, $\omega_B \gg \omega_p,\,
\omega$, we show that (i) there is virtually no nonlinearity due to changing
effective mass in the field of the wave; (ii) ponderomotive force is $F_p^{(B)}

$(\omega/\omega_B)^2$ if compared to the unmagnetized case ($B_0$ is the
external magnetic field and $E$ is the electric field of the wave); (iii) for
radiation beam propagating along constant magnetic field in pair plasma with
density $n_\pm$, the ponderomotive force leads to appearance of circular
currents that lead to the decrease of the field within the beam by a factor
$\Delta B/B_0 = 2\pi n_\pm m_e c^2 {E^2}/{B_0^4}$. Applications to the physics

spectrograph (R {\approx} 9,500, {\lambda} {\approx} 1550 nm). One approach to
quantifying the modal noise involved the use of broadband excitation light and
a statistical analysis of how the overall measured spectrum was affected by
variations in the input coupling conditions. This approach indicated that the
photonic reformatter could reduce modal noise by a factor of six when compared
to a multi-mode fibre with a similar number of guided modes. Another approach
to quantifying the modal noise involved the use of multiple spectrally narrow
lines, and an analysis of how the measured barycentres of these lines were
affected by variations in the input coupling. Using this approach, the photonic
reformatter was observed to suppress modal noise to the level necessary to
obtain spectra with stability close to that observed when using a single mode
fibre feed. These results demonstrate the potential of using photonic
reformatters to enable efficient multi-mode spectrographs that operate at the
diffraction limit and are free of modal noise, with potential applications
including radial velocity measurements of M-dwarfs.

growing demand for people who can train ML models. Some advocated the term
""machine teacher"" to refer to the role of people who inject domain knowledge
into ML models. One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by
which the model intelligently selects instances to query the machine teacher
for labels. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains
minimal and opaque. We begin considering AI explanations as a core element of
the human-AI interface for teaching machines. When a human student learns, it
is a common pattern to present one's own reasoning and solicit feedback from
the teacher. When a ML model learns and still makes mistakes, the human teacher
should be able to understand the reasoning underlying the mistakes. When the
model matures, the machine teacher should be able to recognize its progress in
order to trust and feel confident about their teaching outcome. Toward this
vision, we propose a novel paradigm of explainable active learning (XAL), by
introducing techniques from the recently surging field of explainable AI (XAI)
into an AL setting. We conducted an empirical study comparing the model
learning outcomes, feedback content and experience with XAL, to that of
traditional AL and coactive learning (providing the model's prediction without
the explanation). Our study shows benefits of AI explanation as interfaces for
machine teaching--supporting trust calibration and enabling rich forms of
teaching feedback, and potential drawbacks--anchoring effect with the model
judgment and cognitive workload. Our study also reveals important individual
factors that mediate a machine teacher's reception to AI explanations,
including task knowledge, AI experience and need for cognition. By reflecting
on the results, we suggest future directions and design implications for XAL.

simulated annealing based approach (ASA) as the action search method of DRL, in
which an adaptive h-mutation is used to guide the search direction and an
adaptive iteration is proposed to enhance the search efficiency during the DRL

introduced to assist the DRL to train the policy network and find the optimal
offloading policy. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate that the

the formation of spin-2 Cooper pairs which may be described by a complex
second-rank tensor order parameter. In the case of linear dispersion, for the
chemical potential at the Fermi point and at strong coupling, the energetically
preferred superconducting state is the uniaxial nematic state, which preserves
time-reversal symmetry and provides a full (anisotropic) gap for quasiparticle
excitations. In contrast, at a finite chemical potential, we find that the

validity, focuses on coverage probability of prediction regions, while a notion
of validity relevant to the other prediction-related tasks performed by

Type-2 validity, relevant to these other prediction tasks. We establish

imprecise probability considerations are required in order to achieve it. We go
on to show that both types of prediction validity can be achieved by
interpreting the conformal prediction output as the contour function of a

For
reward learning, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a widely used
paradigm. Given a Markov decision process (MDP) and a set of demonstrations for
a task, IRL learns a reward function that assigns a real-valued reward to each
state of the MDP. However, for temporally extended tasks, the underlying reward
function may not be expressible as a function of individual states of the MDP.
Instead, the history of visited states may need to be considered to determine
the reward at the current state. To address this issue, we propose an iterative
algorithm to learn a reward function for temporally extended tasks. At each
iteration, the algorithm alternates between two modules, a task inference
module that infers the underlying task structure and a reward learning module
that uses the inferred task structure to learn a reward function. The task
inference module produces a series of queries, where each query is a sequence
of subgoals. The demonstrator provides a binary response to each query by
attempting to execute it in the environment and observing the environment's
feedback. After the queries are answered, the task inference module returns an
automaton encoding its current hypothesis of the task structure. The reward
learning module augments the state space of the MDP with the states of the
automaton. The module then proceeds to learn a reward function over the
augmented state space using a novel deep maximum entropy IRL algorithm. This
iterative process continues until it learns a reward function with satisfactory
performance. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly
outperforms several IRL baselines on temporally extended tasks.

since it can process data closer to user devices. Diverse Fog nodes ranging

challenging to determine which services of an application need to be offloaded.
In this paper, a context-aware mechanism for distributing applications across
the Cloud and the Fog is proposed. The mechanism dynamically generates
(re)deployment plans for the application to maximise the performance efficiency
of the application by taking the QoS and running costs into account. The
mechanism relies on deep Q-networks to generate a distribution plan without
prior knowledge of the available resources on the Fog node, the network
condition and the application. The feasibility of the proposed context-aware
distribution mechanism is demonstrated on two use-cases, namely a face

increased utility of dynamic distribution in both use cases, when compared to a

model the ellipsoidal collapse of top-hat dark matter haloes in $f(R)$ gravity.
A good agreement between Sheth-Tormen formula and our result is achieved. The
relative difference in the ellipsoidal collapse barrier is less than or equal
to $1.6\%$. Furthermore, we verify that, for F4 and F5 cases of Hu-Sawicki
$f(R)$ gravity, the screening mechanism do not play a crucial role in the
non-linear power spectrum modelling up to $k\sim1[h/{\rm Mpc}]$. We compare two
versions of modified gravity modelling, namely with/without screening. We find
that by treating the effective Newton constant as constant number ($G_{\rm
eff}=4/3G_N$) is acceptable. The scale dependence of the gravitational coupling
is sub-relevant. The resulting spectra in F4 and F5, are in $0.1\%$ agreement
with the previous \texttt{CHAM} results. The published code is accelerated
significantly. Finally, we compare our halo model prediction with N-body
simulation. We find that the general spectrum profile agree, qualitatively.
However, via the halo model approach, there exists a systematic
under-estimation of the matter power spectrum in the co-moving wavenumber range
between $0.3 h/{\rm Mpc}$ and $3 h/{\rm Mpc}$. These scales are overlapping
with the transition scales from two halo term dominated regimes to those of one

excited-state populations $\mathcal{C} = (1+\frac{\Delta^2}{\gamma(r+\gamma)}

compared to either the spontaneous decay rate $\gamma$ or the incoherent

$\mathcal{C}$ ratio displays a maximum as a function of the dephasing rate
$\gamma_d$. We attribute the surprising dephasing-induced enhancement of
stationary Fano coherences to the environmental suppression of destructive
interference of individual incoherent excitations generated at different times.
We identify the imaginary Fano coherence with the non-equilibrium flux across a
pair of qubits coupled to two independent thermal baths, unraveling a direct
connection between the seemingly unrelated phenomena of incoherent driving of
multilevel quantum systems and non-equilibrium quantum transport in qubit
networks. The real part of the steady-state Fano coherence is found to be
proportional to the deviation of excited-state populations from their values in
thermodynamic equilibrium, making it possible to observe signatures of
steady-state Fano coherences in excited-state populations. We put forward an
experimental proposal for observing steady-state Fano coherences by detecting
the total fluorescence signal emitted by Calcium atoms excited by polarized vs.
isotropic incoherent light. Our analysis paves the way toward further
theoretical and experimental studies of non-equilibrium coherent steady states
in thermally driven atomic and molecular systems, and for the exploration of
their potential role in biological processes.

positive correlation is observed between the electron temperature and the
kinetic energy change across the shock, while weaker, if any, correlations were
found with any other macroscopic shock parameter. No VDF parameter correlated
with the shock normal angle. The electron VDF evolves from a narrowly peaked
core with flaring suprathermal tails in the upstream to either a slightly
hotter core with steeper tails or much hotter flattop core with even steeper
tails downstream of the weaker and strongest shocks, respectively. Both
quasi-static and fluctuating fields are examined as possible mechanisms
modifying the VDF but neither is sufficient alone. For instance, flattop VDFs
can be generated by nonlinear ion acoustic wave stochastic acceleration (i.e.,
inelastic collisions) while other work suggested they result from the
combination of quasi-static and fluctuating fields. This three-part study shows
that not only are these systems not thermodynamic in nature, even kinetic

consisting of hexagonal sheets of boron atoms alternating with planes of metal
atoms held together with mixed character ionic/covalent bonds. Many of the
metal diborides are ultrahigh temperature ceramics like HfB$_2$, TaB$_2$, and
ZrB$_2$, which have melting points above 3000$^\circ$C, high mechanical
hardness and strength at high temperatures, and high chemical resistance, while
MgB$_2$ is a superconductor with a transition temperature of 39 K. Here we
demonstrate that this diverse family of non-van der Waals materials can be
processed into stable dispersions of two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets using
ultrasonication-assisted exfoliation. We generate 2D nanosheets of the metal
diborides AlB$_2$, CrB$_2$, HfB$_2$, MgB$_2$, NbB$_2$, TaB$_2$, TiB$_2$, and
ZrB$_2$, and use electron and scanning probe microscopies to characterize their
structures, morphologies, and compositions. The exfoliated layers span up to
micrometers in lateral dimension and reach thicknesses down to 2-3 nm, while
retaining their hexagonal atomic structure and chemical composition. We exploit
the convenient solution-phase dispersions of exfoliated CrB$_2$ nanosheets to
incorporate them directly into polymer composites. In contrast to the hard and
brittle bulk CrB$_2$, we find that CrB$_2$ nanocomposites remain very flexible
and simultaneously provide increases in the elastic modulus and the ultimate
tensile strength of the polymer. The successful liquid-phase production of 2D
metal diborides enables their processing using scalable low-temperature
solution-phase methods, extending their use to previously unexplored
applications, and reveals a new family of non-van der Waals materials that can
be efficiently exfoliated into 2D forms.

their all-electrical control via fast, tunable exchange interactions and
immunity to global magnetic fluctuations. These qubits can experience strong
transverse interaction with photons in the resonant exchange (RX) regime, when
exchange is simultaneously active on both qubit axes. However, most theoretical
work has been based on phenomenological Fermi-Hubbard models, which may not
fully capture the complexity of the qubit spin-charge states in this regime.
Here we investigate exchange in Si/SiGe and GaAs TQDs using full configuration
interaction (FCI) calculations which better describe practical device
operation. We show that high exchange operation in general, and the RX regime
in particular, can differ significantly from simple models, presenting new
challenges and opportunities for spin-photon coupling. We highlight the impact
of device electrostatics and effective mass on exchange and identify a new
operating point (XRX) where strong spin-photon coupling is most likely to occur
in Si/SiGe TQDs. Based on our numerical results, we analyze the feasibility of
a remote entanglement cavity iSWAP protocol and discuss design pathways for
improving fidelity. Our analysis provides insight into the requirements for TQD

  Cost","14 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An increasing amount of users' sensitive information is now being collected
for analytics purposes. To protect users' privacy, differential privacy has
been widely studied in the literature. Specifically, a differentially private
algorithm adds noise to the true answer of a query to generate a noisy
response. As a result, the information about the dataset leaked by the noisy
output is bounded by the privacy parameter. Oftentimes, a dataset needs to be
used for answering multiple queries (e.g., for multiple analytics tasks), so
the level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus,
it is crucial to keep track of the privacy spending which should not exceed the
given privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is
asked again on the same dataset, we may reuse the previous noisy response for
the current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design and
implement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving
differential-privacy cost. Blockchain provides a distributed immutable ledger
that records each query's type, the noisy response used to answer each query,
the associated noise level added to the true query result, and the remaining
privacy budget in our system. Furthermore, since the blockchain records the
noisy response used to answer each query, we also design an algorithm to reuse
previous noisy response if the same query is asked repeatedly. Specifically,
considering that different requests of the same query may have different
privacy requirements, our algorithm (via a rigorous proof) is able to set the
optimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise (if
necessary) to minimize the accumulated privacy cost. Experimental results show
that the proposed algorithm can reduce the privacy cost significantly without
compromising data accuracy.

the fiducial analysis, the Hubble flow Type Ia supernova (SN~Ia) sample is
truncated to $z < 0.15$ and the deceleration parameter ($q_0$) fixed to -0.55.
We create realistic simulations of the calibrator and Pantheon samples and
account for a full systematics covariance between these two sets. We fit
several physically motivated dark energy models and derive combined constraints

Stein kernels is established, which enables the construction of kernelized

example, $Kepler$ sub-Neptunes are likely to have deep magma oceans in contact
with their atmospheres, but little is known about the effect of the magma on
the atmosphere. Here we study this effect using a basic model, assuming that
volatiles equilibrate with magma at $T$ $\sim$ 3000 K. For our Fe-Mg-Si-O-H
model system, we find that chemical reactions between the magma and the
atmosphere and dissolution of volatiles into the magma are both important.
Thus, magma matters. For H, most moles go into the magma, so the mass target
for both H$_2$ accretion and H$_2$ loss models is weightier than is usually
assumed. The known span of magma oxidation states can produce sub-Neptunes that
have identical radius but with total volatile masses varying by 20-fold. Thus,
planet radius is a proxy for atmospheric composition but not for total volatile
content. This redox diversity degeneracy can be broken by measurements of
atmosphere mean molecular weight. We emphasise H$_2$ supply by nebula gas, but
also consider solid-derived H$_2$O. We find that adding H$_2$O to Fe probably
cannot make enough H$_2$ to explain sub-Neptune radii because $>$10$^3$-km
thick outgassed atmospheres have high mean molecular weight. The hypothesis of
magma-atmosphere equilibration links observables such as atmosphere
H$_2$O/H$_2$ ratio to magma FeO content and planet formation processes. Our
model's accuracy is limited by the lack of experiments (lab and/or numerical)

the appearance of spin polarons -- bound states of carriers with spin
excitations, which show themselves as sharp peaks of the density of states and
spectral functions at the Fermi level. Hole and electron doping are strongly
asymmetric. This, in particular, manifests itself in the antiferromagnetic
response for the electron-doped case and in an incommensurate magnetic ordering
for hole doping. In the latter case, the incommensurability parameter grows
with doping. The double occupancy shows that the electron-doped system retains

connected to the Internet, straining the capacity of wireless network that has
already been overloaded with data-hungry mobile applications, such as
high-definition video streaming and virtual reality(VR)/augmented reality(AR).
How to accommodate the demand for both massive scale of IoT devices and
high-speed cellular services in the physically limited spectrum without
significantly increasing the operational and infrastructure costs is one of the
main challenges for operators. In this article, we introduce a new
multi-operator network sharing framework that supports the coexistence of IoT
and high-speed cellular services. Our framework is based on the radio access
network (RAN) sharing architecture recently introduced by 3GPP as a promising
solution for operators to improve their resource utilization and reduce the
system roll-out cost. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework
using the real base station location data in the city of Dublin collected from
two major operators in Ireland. Numerical results show that our proposed
framework can almost double the total number of IoT devices that can be
supported and coexist with other cellular services compared with the case
without network sharing.

  surface properties","7 pages, accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa252",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The large brightness variation in the observed lightcurve of Oumuamua is
probably related to its shape, i.e., to the ratio between its longest axis and
its shortest axis (aspect ratio). Several approaches found the aspect ratio of
Oumuamua to be unusually elongated. Moreover, the spin axis orientation has to
be almost perpendicular to the observer in order to obtain such an extreme
lightcurve, a configuration which is unlikely. However, interstellar Oumuamua
may have different surface properties than we know in our solar system.
Therefore, in this work we widen the parameter space for surface properties
beyond the asteroid-like models and study its effect on the lightcurve of
Oumuamua. We calculate reflection from a rotating ellipsoidal object for four
models: Lambertian reflection, specular reflection, single scattering diffusive
and backscatter. We then calculate the probability to obtain a lightcurve ratio
larger than the observed, as a function of the object aspect ratio, assuming an
isotopic spin orientation distribution. We find the elongation of Oumuamua to
be less extreme for the Lambertian and specular reflection models.
Consequently, the probability to observe the lightcurve ratio of Oumuamua given
its unknown spin axis orientation is larger for those models. We conclude that
different surface reflection properties may suggest alternatives to the extreme
shape of Oumuamua, relieving the need for complicated formation scenario,
extreme albedo variation, or unnatural origin. Although the models suggested
here are for ideal ellipsoidal shape and ideal reflection method, the results
emphasize the importance of surface properties for the derived aspect ratio.

is introduced. The proposed coding metasurface is composed of four different
graphene square patches in one layer, which has a distinct bias voltage. By
optimizing the chemical potential of each patch, the reflection phase and
amplitude of a designed element can be controlled in a real-time manner. The
chemical potential optimizing approach is a promising method to develop
metasurfaces, which can tune the reflection phase, magnitude, or polarization
dynamically at different frequencies spectrum. Indeed, by adjusting the
metasurface reflection profile, the suggested device can manipulate the
reflected wave. Also, this metasurface can reduce reflection energy in the
wide-band spectrum. The programmable surface disperses reflected power in
various directions in a first frequency band and converts incident
electromagnetic waves into heat at second frequency band. The obtained results
demonstrate that more than 10 dB reflection reduction can be realized over 1.02
to 2.82 THz under both TE and TM polarized wave incidences. Due to the
conformal properties of the graphene monolayer, the stealth feature of the
metasurface is well preserved while wrapping around a metallic curved object.
This optimization method has an excellent aptitude for phase, magnitude, and
polarization control in various beamforming applications at the THz spectrum

to use the tilted-pulse-front (TPF) technique. However, due to the
non-collinear phase-matching, the large angular dispersion leads to a spatial
and temporal break-up of the optical pump, limiting the terahertz generation
efficiency and reducing the few-cycle character of the generated terahertz
fields. To reduce the effects caused by angular dispersion, multiple schemes
with discrete pulse-front-tilt have been suggested. We propose a terahertz
generation scheme, where a spatio-temporally chirped (STC) pump pulse is
utilized. With our 2D+1 numerical model, we perform a systematic comparative
study of the conventional TPF scheme, three discrete TPF schemes, and the STC
scheme. This model predicts smaller optimal interaction length and
significantly smaller conversion efficiency compared to simple 1D models. We
conclude that the STC scheme delivers spatially homogeneous few-cycle terahertz

having accomplished a series of previous tasks. In other words, the reward that
the agent receives is non-Markovian. One natural and quite general way to
represent history-dependent rewards is via a Mealy machine; a finite state
automaton that produces output sequences (rewards in our case) from input
sequences (state/action observations in our case). In our formal setting, we
consider a Markov decision process (MDP) that models the dynamic of the

this MDP to formalise the non-Markovian reward function. While the MDP is known
by the agent, the reward function is unknown from the agent and must be learnt.
  Learning non-Markov reward functions is a challenge. Our approach to overcome
this challenging problem is a careful combination of the Angluin's L* active
learning algorithm to learn finite automata, testing techniques for
establishing conformance of finite model hypothesis and optimisation techniques
for computing optimal strategies in Markovian (immediate) reward MDPs. We also

observed oscillation in Hall resistance as well and showed that this does not
arise neither from the dominance of the SdH on Hall data nor this is the
precursor of quantum Hall effect, rather this happens due to the pinning of the
Fermi Level. Also The Hall oscillation has exactly 180$^\circ$ phase difference
from SdH oscillation and this phase shift is independent of the magnetic field
strength. It is argued that this unusual phenomenon stems from the predominance

analyze the complexity of our algorithm and compare the quality of the

defined on subdomains of the ambient space to the whole space is an old and a
well investigated theme in analysis. A related question whether the extensions
that result in the process may be chosen in a linear or a continuous manner
between appropriate spaces of functions turns out to be highly nontrivial. That
this holds for the class of continuous functions defined on metric spaces is
the well-known Borsuk-Dugundji theorem which asserts that given a metric space
M and a subspace S of M, each continuous function g on S can be extended to a
continuous function f on X such that the resulting assignment from C(S) to C(M)
is a norm-one continuous linear extension operator.
  The present paper is devoted to an investigation of this problem in the
context of extendability of Lipschitz functions from closed subspaces of a
given Banach space to the whole space such that the choice of the extended
function gives rise to a bounded linear (extension) operator between
appropriate spaces of Lipschitz functions. It is shown that the indicated
property holds precisely when the underlying space is isomorphic to a Hilbert
space. Among certain useful consequences of this theorem, we provide an
isomorphic analogue of a well-known theorem of S. Reich by show ing that closed
convex subsets of a Banach space X arise as Lipschitz retracts of X precisely
when X is isomorphically a Hilbert space. We shall also discuss the issue of
bounded linear extension operators between spaces of Lipschitz functions now
defined on arbitrary subsets of Banach spaces and provide a direct proof of the
known non-existence of such an extension operator by using methods which are
more accessible than those initially employed by the authors.

the introduction of these thin $N$ spacers between $S$ layers leads to a

continuous monitoring, however, as we cannot assume the presence of
ground-truth masks for the target domain, we propose two new metrics to monitor

learning setting. In this spatiotemporally extended game, individuals are
incentivized to implement complex berry-foraging policies and punish
transgressions against social taboos covering specific berry types. We show
that agents benefit when eating poisonous berries is taboo, meaning the
behavior is punished by other agents, as this helps overcome a
credit-assignment problem in discovering delayed health effects. Critically,
however, we also show that introducing an additional taboo, which results in
punishment for eating a harmless berry, improves the rate and stability with
which agents learn to punish taboo violations and comply with taboos.
Counterintuitively, our results show that an arbitrary taboo (a ""silly rule"")
can enhance social learning dynamics and achieve better outcomes in the middle
stages of learning. We discuss the results in the context of studying
normativity as a group-level emergent phenomenon.

a deep generative model of canonical 3D shapes with normalized pose. We train a
variational auto-encoder (VAE) for generating 3D point clouds in the canonical

exploiting the publicly available large 3D shape repositories. Since the 3D
point cloud is generated in normalized pose (with actual size), the encoder of

arbitrary view into a pose-independent 3D shape representation. Object pose is
then estimated via contrasting it with a pose-dependent feature of the input
RGBD extracted with a separate deep neural networks. We integrate the learning
of CASS and pose and size estimation into an end-to-end trainable network,

with a squared section with a configuration with slender buildings both in the
case of unit canyon width to height aspect ratio and in the case of AR = 2. The
former corresponds to skimming flow and the latter to wake-interference regime.
Measurements are performed in a water channel, measuring velocity on a vertical
mid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean flow, its
second-order turbulence statistics, the exchange fluxes, and the integral time
scales investigated, with results showing that slender buildings enhance
turbulence production and yield longer integral time scales in the region just
above the building roof. The combined analysis of the turbulence production
fields and the snapshots of the flow during sweep and ejection events
demonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon and the external flow is
significantly more unstable with slender buildings, mainly because the damping
effect of the vertical velocity fluctuations from the flat roof of the upwind
building is substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream) portion
of the interface is prone to the direct interaction of the external flow
structures. The higher turbulence intensity promotes the ventilation at the
canyon interface. In summary, the present experiments show that the effect of
the reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant when the urban
canopy consists of narrow canyons. The result is of interest since narrow
street canyons are typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture
of the old European city centres.

Unfortunately, these communications render the system vulnerable to
cyber-attacks. While many attack detection methods have begun to address these
concerns, they are limited to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Though LTI
system models provide accurate approximations for CPS such as autonomous
vehicles at constant speed and turning radii, they are inaccurate for more
complex motions such as lane changes, turns, and changes in velocity. Since
these more complex motions are more suitably described by linear time-varying
(LTV) system models rather than LTI models, Dynamic Watermarking, which adds a
private excitation to the input signal to validate measurements, has recently
been extended to LTV systems. However, this extension does not allow for LTV
systems that require several steps before the effect of a given control input
can be seen in the measurement signal. Additionally, there is no consideration
for the time-varying effects of auto-correlation. Furthermore, a proof of
concept was only provided using simulations of a simplified model.
  This paper relaxes the requirement for inputs to be visible in a single step
and constructs an auto-correlation normalizing factor to remove the effects of
auto-correlation. In addition, Dynamic Watermarking is applied to a
high-fidelity vehicle model in carsim and a 1/10 scale autonomous rover to
further reinforce the proof of concept for realistic systems. In each case, the
vehicle follows a predefined path with time-varying velocity and turning radii.
A replay attack, which replays previously recorded measurements, is shown to be
detectable using LTV Dynamic Watermarking in a quick and repeatable manner.

freshness in multi-source systems. Data freshness is measured by a
non-decreasing penalty function of \emph{age of information}, where all sources
have the same age-penalty function. Sources take turns to generate update
packets, and forward them to their destinations one-by-one through a shared
channel with random delay. There is a scheduler, that chooses the update order
of the sources, and a sampler, that determines when a source should generate a
new packet in its turn. We aim to find the optimal scheduler-sampler pairs that
minimize the total-average age-penalty at delivery times (Ta-APD) and the
total-average age-penalty (Ta-AP). We prove that the Maximum Age First (MAF)
scheduler and the zero-wait sampler are jointly optimal for minimizing the
Ta-APD. Meanwhile, the MAF scheduler and a relative value iteration with
reduced complexity (RVI-RC) sampler are jointly optimal for minimizing the
Ta-AP. The RVI-RC sampler is based on a relative value iteration algorithm
whose complexity is reduced by exploiting a threshold property in the optimal
sampler. Finally, a low-complexity threshold-type sampler is devised via an
approximate analysis of Bellman's equation. This threshold-type sampler reduces
to a simple water-filling sampler for a linear age-penalty function.

on the DEAM dataset show that by using TNNs we achieve 90% feature
dimensionality reduction with a 9% improvement in valence prediction and 4%
improvement in arousal prediction with respect to our baseline models (without

principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE). This shows that, in
addition to providing a compact latent space representation of audio features,
the proposed approach has a higher performance than the baseline models.

method. To make our analysis most instructive, we have chosen the Newton's
equation with a general oscillating force. We deal with its asymptotic
solutions in the high frequency limit. Our treatment is simple but general. The
targets of our study are \emph{the distinguished limits} and \emph{the
universal vibrogenic force}. The aim of \emph{the distinguished limit
procedure} is to identify how the small parameter can appear in an equation.
The proper appearance of a small parameter leads to \emph{valid successive
approximations}, and, in particular, to closed systems of averaged equations.
We show, that there are only two distinguished limits. This means that Newton's
equation, with high-frequency forcing, has two types of interesting asymptotic
solutions. The key item in the averaged equations for all distinguished limits
is \emph{the unique vibrogenic force}. The current state-of-the-art in this
area is: a large number of particular examples are well-known, effective and
advanced general methods (like the Krylov-Bogolyubov approach) are well
developed. However, the presented general and simple analysis of distinguished
limits and the vibrogenic force, formulated as a compact practical guide, is
novel. An advantage of our treatment is the possibility of its straightforward
use for various ODEs and PDEs with oscillating coefficients.

operating modes of combined heat and power (CHP) units in winter heating

reduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving the
operational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on
chance-constrained programming (CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest
generation cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated energy system (IES)
with CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative
auxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable
generations including wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic
spinning reserves are supplied in the form of chance-constrained; from the
perspective of user experience, a heating load model is built with
consideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a
solution approach based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where
the original CCP-based scheduling model is tackled into a solvable
mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting a chance
constraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via
the CPLEX solver. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system
demonstrate that the presented method manages to improve operational
flexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations by comprehensively
leveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary
equipments, which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy
consumption.

is an important aspect of building a privacy-centric non-intrusive smart

using a novel approach based on analyzing automatic speech recognition (ASR)
lattices using graph neural networks (GNN). The proposed approach uses the fact
that decoding lattice of a falsely triggered audio exhibits uncertainties in
terms of many alternative paths and unexpected words on the lattice arcs as
compared to the lattice of a correctly triggered audio. A pure trigger-phrase
detector model doesn't fully utilize the intent of the user speech whereas by
using the complete decoding lattice of user audio, we can effectively mitigate
speech not intended for the smart assistant. We deploy two variants of GNNs in
this paper based on 1) graph convolution layers and 2) self-attention mechanism
respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that GNNs are highly accurate in FTM
task by mitigating ~87% of false triggers at 99% true positive rate (TPR).
Furthermore, the proposed models are fast to train and efficient in parameter
requirements.

two time series can be inferred in a rigorous and quantitative sense, and,
besides, the resulting causality can be normalized. A corollary that follows
is, in the linear limit, causation implies correlation, while correlation does
not imply causation. Now suppose there is an event $A$ taking a harmonic form
(sine/cosine), and it generates through some process another event $B$ so that
$B$ always lags $A$ by a phase of $\pi/2$. Here the causality is obviously
seen, while by computation the correlation is, however, zero. This seemingly
contradiction is rooted in the fact that a harmonic system always leaves a
single point on the Poincar\'e section; it does not add information. That is to
say, though the absolute information flow from $A$ to $B$ is zero, i.e.,
$T_{A\to B}=0$, the total information increase of $B$ is also zero, so the
normalized $T_{A\to B}$, denoted as $\tau_{A\to B}$, takes the form of $\frac 0
0$. By slightly perturbating the system with some noise, solving a stochastic
differential equation, and letting the perturbation go to zero, it can be shown
that $\tau_{A\to B}$ approaches 100\%, just as one would have expected.

frameworks of Attribute-Value associations. Even though they thrive in simple
systems, they lack a way of representing higher-order entities and relations.
This is however needed in Frame Semantics, where semantic dependencies should
be able to connect groups of individuals and their properties, especially to
model quantification. To answer this issue, this master report introduces
wrappings as a way to envelop a sub-FS and treat it as a node. Following the
work of [Kallmeyer, Osswald 2013], we extend its syntax, semantics and some
properties (translation to FOL, subsumption, unification). We can then expand
the proposed pipeline. Lexical minimal model sets are generated from formulas.
They unify by FS value equations obtained by LTAG parsing to an underspecified
sentence representation. The syntactic approach of quantifiers allows us to use
existing methods to produce any possible reading. Finally, we give a
transcription to type-logical formulas to interact with the context in the view
of dynamic semantics. Supported by ideas of Frame Types, this system provides a
workable and tractable tool for higher-order relations with FS.

broad range of natural language understanding tasks. However, the size and
memory footprint of these large LMs makes them difficult to deploy in many
scenarios (e.g. on mobile phones). Recent research points to knowledge
distillation as a potential solution, showing that when training data for a
given task is abundant, it is possible to distill a large (teacher) LM into a
small task-specific (student) network with minimal loss of performance.
However, when such data is scarce, there remains a significant performance gap
between large pretrained LMs and smaller task-specific models, even when
training via distillation. In this paper, we bridge this gap with a novel
training approach, called generation-distillation, that leverages large
finetuned LMs in two ways: (1) to generate new (unlabeled) training examples,
and (2) to distill their knowledge into a small network using these examples.
Across three low-resource text classification datsets, we achieve comparable
performance to BERT while using 300x fewer parameters, and we outperform prior
approaches to distillation for text classification while using 3x fewer
parameters.
