Last-mile logistics service contributes a significant part of the e-commerce
experience. In contrast to the traditional last-mile logistics services, smart
logistics service with autonomous driving technologies provides a promising
solution to reduce the delivery cost and to improve efficiency. However, the
traffic conditions in complex traffic environments, such as those in China, are
more challenging compared to those in well-developed countries. Many types of
moving objects (such as pedestrians, bicycles, electric bicycles, and
motorcycles, etc.) share the road with autonomous vehicles, and their behaviors
are not easy to track and predict. This paper introduces a technical solution
from JD.com, a leading E-commerce company in China, to the autonomous last-mile
delivery in complex traffic environments. Concretely, the methodologies in each
module of our autonomous vehicles are presented, together with safety guarantee
strategies. Up to this point, JD.com has deployed more than 300 self-driving
vehicles for trial operations in tens of provinces of China, with an
accumulated 715,819 miles and up to millions of on-road testing hours.

  annuli","12 pages, 8 figures","Phys. Rev. Research 2, 033436 (2020)","10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033436",,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.stat-mech","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Liquid-crystalline ordering in vertically vibrated granular monolayers
confined in annuli of different sizes is examined. The annuli consist of
circular cavities with a central circular obstruction. In the absence of the
central obstruction cylinders of low aspect-ratio exhibit tetratic order,
except for the existence of four defects which restore the symmetry broken by
the circular confinement. This behaviour is demanded by topology in systems
with strong anchoring properties at the surface. By contrast, topology dictates
that the annular geometry is compatible with a distorted tetratic phase without
point defects. However, the effect of restricted geometry and limited size on
phases possessing finite anchoring energy at the wall and elastic stiffness
leads to different configurations, showing finite ordered regions separated by
domain walls. We argue that highly packed nonequilibrium vibrated granular
monolayers respond to geometrical frustration and extreme confinement as
corresponding equilibrium systems of particles do, and that the former can be
analysed in terms of surface free energies, elastic distortions and defects,
much as equilibrium liquid crystals. Therefore, selective confinement of
vertically-vibrated monolayers of rods could be used with advantage as a new
tool to study the creation and dynamics of various types of defects in ordered
systems.

reconstructions post-hoc. We render 2D views of an existing reconstruction and
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that refines inverse-depth to match
a higher-quality reconstruction. Since the views that we correct are rendered
from the same reconstruction, they share the same geometry, so overlapping
views complement each other. We take advantage of that in two ways. Firstly, we
impose a loss during training which guides predictions on neighbouring views to
have the same geometry and has been shown to improve performance. Secondly, in
contrast to previous work, which corrects each view independently, we also make
predictions on sets of neighbouring views jointly. This is achieved by warping
feature maps between views and thus bypassing memory-intensive 3D computation.
We make the observation that features in the feature maps are
viewpoint-dependent, and propose a method for transforming features with
dynamic filters generated by a multi-layer perceptron from the relative poses
between views. In our experiments we show that this last step is necessary for
successfully fusing feature maps between views.

material for electronic memory due to its suitable crystallization temperature,
amorphous to crystalline resistance contrast, and stability of the amorphous

thickness during heating inside the transmission electron microscope was
observed and characterized. The Ge2Sb2Te5 film was deposited using sputtering
on a Protochips Fusion holder and left uncapped in atmosphere for about four
months. Oxygen incorporated within the film played a significant role in the
chemical segregation observed which resulted in amorphous Ge-O grain boundaries
and Sb and Te rich crystalline domains. Such composition changes can occur when
the phase-change material interfaces insulating oxide layers in an integrated
device and would significantly impact its electrical and thermal properties.

  hardware solutions",,,,,"cs.NE cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ant Colony algorithm has been applied to various optimization problems,
however most of the previous work on scaling and parallelism focuses on
Travelling Salesman Problems (TSPs). Although, useful for benchmarks and new
idea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics does not always transfer to complex
real-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution
construction. This paper looks at real-life outbound supply chain problem using
Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO
architectures - Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results
showed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations
as the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance
was measured across three different hardware solutions - 16 core CPU, 68 core
Xeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorization
techniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although
excellent for TSP, it was concluded that for the given supply chain problem
GPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Furthermore,
compared to their sequential counterpart, vectorized CPU AVX2 implementation
achieved 25.4x speedup on CPU while Xeon Phi with its AVX512 instruction set
reached 148x on PA with Vectorized (PAwV). PAwV is therefore able to scale at
least up to 1024 parallel instances on the supply chain network problem solved.

of galactic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) via their scattering
on atomic nuclei. The liquid argon target allows exquisite discrimination
between nuclear and electron recoil signals via pulse-shape discrimination of
the scintillation signals. Atmospheric argon (AAr), however, has a naturally
occurring radioactive isotope, $^{39}$Ar, a $\beta$ emitter of cosmogenic
origin. For large detectors, the atmospheric $^{39}$Ar activity poses pile-up
concerns. The use of argon extracted from underground wells, deprived of
$^{39}$Ar, is key to the physics potential of these experiments. The
DarkSide-20k dark matter search experiment will operate a dual-phase time
projection chamber with 50 tonnes of radio-pure underground argon (UAr), that
was shown to be depleted of $^{39}$Ar with respect to AAr by a factor larger
than 1400. Assessing the $^{39}$Ar content of the UAr during extraction is
crucial for the success of DarkSide-20k, as well as for future experiments of
the Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration (GADMC). This will be carried out by

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a dead-end. This sensor does not offer
enough information for us to progress in the core domain of HAR - to recognize
everyday activities from sensor data. Despite continued and prolonged efforts
in improving feature engineering and machine learning models, the activities
that we can recognize reliably have only expanded slightly and many of the same
flaws of early models are still present today. Instead of relying on
acceleration data, we should instead consider modalities with much richer
information - a logical choice are images. With the rapid advance in image
sensing hardware and modelling techniques, we believe that a widespread
adoption of image sensors will open many opportunities for accurate and robust
inference across a wide spectrum of human activities.
  In this paper, we make the case for imagers in place of accelerometers as the
default sensor for human activity recognition. Our review of past works has led
to the observation that progress in HAR had stalled, caused by our reliance on
accelerometers. We further argue for the suitability of images for activity
recognition by illustrating their richness of information and the marked
progress in computer vision. Through a feasibility analysis, we find that
deploying imagers and CNNs on device poses no substantial burden on modern
mobile hardware. Overall, our work highlights the need to move away from
accelerometers and calls for further exploration of using imagers for activity
recognition.

heterogeneous node fitness and aging. We propose a novel analytical framework

exponential network growth. Conversely, the breaking of such time-invariance
explains the winner-takes-all effect in some model settings, revealing the
connection between the Bose-Einstein condensation in the Bianconi-Barab\'{a}si

a Lagrangian that is pseudoinvariant under local Lorentz transformations of the
tetrad field. This procedure consequently leads to the loss of the local
pseudoinvariance and the appearance of additional degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).
The constraint structure of f(T) gravity suggests the existence of one extra
d.o.f. when compared with GR, which should describe some aspect of the
orientation of the tetrad. The purpose of this article is to better understand
the nature of this extra d.o.f. by means of a toy model that mimics essential
features of f(T) gravity. We find that the nonlinear modification of a
Lagrangian L possessing a local rotational pseudoinvariance produces two types
of solutions. In one case the original gauge-invariant variables -- the
analogue of the metric in teleparallelism -- evolve like when governed by the
(nondeformed) Lagrangian L; these solutions are characterized by a (selectable)
constant value of its Lagrangian, which is the manifestation of the extra
d.o.f. In the other case, the solutions do contain new dynamics for the
original gauge-invariant variables, but the extra d.o.f. does not materialize
because the Lagrangian remains invariant on-shell. Coming back to f(T) gravity,
the first case includes solutions where the torsion scalar T is a constant, to
be chosen at the initial conditions (extra d.o.f.), and no new dynamics for the
metric is expected. The latter case covers those solutions displaying a genuine
modified gravity; T is not a constant, but it is (on-shell) invariant under
Lorentz transformations depending only on time. Both kinds of f(T) solutions
are exemplified in a flat FLRW universe. Finally, we present a toy model for a
higher-order Lagrangian with rotational invariance [analogous to f(R) gravity]
and derive its constraint structure and number of d.o.f.

initial magnetic field existing in inflowing matter rises sharply, is the
source of the CME that prevails significantly the erasure of the CME due to the
spin-flip through Coulomb collisions in plasma. The growth of the magnetic
field just behind the shock given by the instability term $\nabla\times (\alpha

throws out the mantle of a protoneutron star. As a result, such an explosion
interrupts the transfer of strongly magnetized plasma from the shock onto NS

modeling, back-translation, and supervised translation. We evaluate this method
on two adaptation settings: adaptation between specific domains and adaptation
from a general domain to specific domains, and on two language pairs: German to
English and Romanian to English. With substantial performance improvement
achieved---up to +19.31 BLEU over the strongest baseline, and +47.69 BLEU
improvement over the unadapted model---we present this method as a simple but
tough-to-beat baseline in the field of semi-supervised domain adaptation for
NMT.

research their properties in the single channel interactions, where the

$I=1$ since the potential is too weak. In our results, the states of $\sigma$

in the coupled channel and the single channel cases. We find that the $\pi\eta$
components is much important in the coupled channel interactions to dynamically
reproduce the $a_{0}(980)$ state, which means that $a_{0}(980)$ state can not
be a pure $K\bar{K}$ molecular state. We obtain their radii as: $|\langle r^2

a $K\bar{K}$ bound state, the $\sigma$ state a resonance of $\pi\pi$ and the
$a_{0}(980)$ state a loose $K\bar{K}$ bound state. From the results of the

application on devices with limited resources is still a big challenge; this is
mainly due to the huge memory and computation requirements of the CNN. To
counter the limitation imposed by the network size, we use pruning to reduce
the network size and -- implicitly -- the number of floating point operations
(FLOPs). Contrary to the filter norm method -- used in ``conventional`` network
pruning -- based on the assumption that a smaller norm implies ``less
importance'' to its associated component, we develop a novel filter importance
norm that is based on the change in the empirical loss caused by the presence
or removal of a component from the network architecture.
  Since there are too many individual possibilities for filter configuration,
we repeatedly sample from these architectural components and measure the system
performance in the respective state of components being active or disabled. The
result is a collection of filter ensembles -- filter masks -- and associated
performance values. We rank the filters based on a linear and additive model
and remove the least important ones such that the drop in network accuracy is
minimal. We evaluate our method on a fully connected network, as well as on the
ResNet architecture trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Using our pruning method,
we managed to remove $60\%$ of the parameters and $64\%$ of the FLOPs from the
ResNet with an accuracy drop of less than $0.6\%$.

mixed regression model to estimate network flows in a bike-sharing network if
only the hourly differences of in- and outdegrees at bike stations are known.
We also include exogenous covariates such as weather conditions. Two different
parameterizations of the model are considered to estimate 1) the whole network

proposed via an iterative penalized maximum likelihood approach. This is
exemplified by modeling network flows in the Vienna Bike-Sharing Network.
Furthermore, a simulation study is conducted to show the performance of the

We perform local and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium studies in order to

H$_2$ densities around 10$^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Although the gas in the cavity is only

hyperuniformity of the original lattice, that is, normalized density
fluctuations vanish in the limit of infinite wavelengths. In addition to a
diffuse contribution, the scattering intensity from the the resulting point
pattern typically inherits the Bragg peaks (long-range order) of the original
lattice. Here we demonstrate how these Bragg peaks can be hidden in the
effective diffraction pattern of independent and identically distributed
perturbations. All Bragg peaks vanish if and only if the sum of all probability
densities of the positions of the shifted lattice points is a constant at all
positions. The underlying long-range order is then 'cloaked' in the sense that
it cannot be reconstructed from the pair correlation function alone. On the one
hand, density fluctuations increase monotonically with the strength of
perturbations $a$, as measured by the hyperuniformity order metric
$\overline{\Lambda}$. On the other hand, the disappearance and reemergence of
long-range order, depending on whether the system is cloaked or not as the
perturbation strength increases, is manifestly captured by the $\tau$ order
metric. Therefore, while the perturbation strength $a$ may seem to be a natural
choice for an order metric of perturbed lattices, the $\tau$ order metric is a
superior choice. It is noteworthy that cloaked perturbed lattices allow one to
easily simulate very large samples (with at least $10^6$ particles) of
disordered hyperuniform point patterns without Bragg peaks.

estimation imposes unduly strong functional form assumptions, treatment effect
estimates may be significantly biased. In this study, we compare the
performance of a wide variety of treatment effect estimation methods. We do so

qualification, participants were enrolled in either a randomized trial arm or

during brain maturation. To do so, we extract effective connectivity (EC)
through Granger causality (GC) for two different groups of subjects, i.e.,
children and young adults. The motivation is that the inclusion of causal
interaction may further discriminate brain connections between two age groups
and help to discover new connections between brain regions. The contributions
of this study are threefold. First, there has been a lack of attention to
EC-based feature extraction in the context of brain development. To this end,
we propose a new kernel-based GC (KGC) method to learn nonlinearity of complex
brain network, where a reduced Sine hyperbolic polynomial (RSP) neural network
was used as our proposed learner. Second, we used causality values as the
weight for the directional connectivity between brain regions. Our findings

FC-based analysis from Philadelphia neurocohort (PNC) study with better
discrimination of the different age groups. Moreover, the fusion of these two

quadratic program (QCQP), which has finitely many variables and infinitely many
constraints. Since QCQPs are non-convex in general and practically infeasible
to solve, we resort to the so-called convex-concave procedure to convexify the
QCQP. Even though convex, the resulting optimization problem still has
infinitely many constraints and is NP-hard. For uncertainty sets that form
convex polytopes, we provide a transformation of the problem to a convex QCQP
with finitely many constraints. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach
by means of several case studies that highlight typical bottlenecks for our
problem. In particular, we show that we are able to solve benchmarks with
hundreds of thousands of states, hundreds of different observations, and we
investigate the effect of different levels of uncertainty in the models.

electroencephalography (EEG), is a potential biomarker for major depressive
disorder (MDD). Though this measure is functional in nature (defined on the
frequency domain), it is typically reduced to a scalar value prior to analysis,
possibly obscuring the relationship between brain function and MDD. To overcome
this issue, we sought to fit a functional regression model to estimate the
association between CSD power asymmetry and MDD diagnostic status, adjusting
for age, sex, cognitive ability, and handedness using data from a large
clinical study. Unfortunately, nearly 40\% of the observations were missing
either their functional EEG data, their cognitive ability score, or both. In
order to take advantage of all of the available data, we propose an extension
to multiple imputation by chained equations that handles both scalar and
functional data. We also propose an extension to Rubin's Rules for pooling
estimates from the multiply imputed data sets in order to conduct valid
inference. We investigate the performance of the proposed extensions in a
simulation study and apply them to our clinical study data. Our analysis
reveals that the association between CSD power asymmetry and diagnostic status
depends on both age and sex.

from relativistic hydrodynamics to kinetic particle transport. This switching
entails the sampling of particles from the distribution of energy, momentum and
conserved currents provided by hydrodynamics. Usually this sampling ensures the
conservation of these quantities only on the average, i.e. the conserved
quantities may actually fluctuate among the sampled particle configurations and
only their averages over many such configurations agree with their values from
hydrodynamics. Here we apply a recently invented method [Oliinychenko, Koch;
PRL 123, 18, 182302 (2019)] to ensure conservation laws for each sampled
configuration in spatially compact regions (patches) and study their effects:
from the well-known (micro-)canonical suppression of means and variances to
little studied (micro-)canonical correlations and higher order fluctuations.
Most of these effects are sensitive to the patch size. Many of them do not
disappear even in the thermodynamic limit, when the patch size goes to
infinity. The developed method is essential for particlization of stochastic
hydrodynamics. It is useful for studying the chiral magnetic effect, small
systems, and in general for fluctuation and correlation observables.

How to represent longitudinal patient EHR? How to extract complex logical rules
from EC? Most existing works rely on manual rule-based extraction, which is
time consuming and inflexible for complex inference. To address these

pre-trained Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers(BERT) model
to encode clinical trial information into sentence embedding. And uses a
hierarchical embedding model to represent patient longitudinal EHR. In
addition, DeepEnroll is augmented by a numerical information embedding and
entailment module to reason over numerical information in both EC and EHR.
These encoders are trained jointly to optimize patient-trial matching score. We
evaluated DeepEnroll on the trial-patient matching task with demonstrated on

generation, we need to explore models that produce statistically valid
configurations of roads. These sort of models will help us to derive plausible
mechanisms for the spatial location of population.
  This task is of fundamental importance, as we need to create an experimental
environment that allows us to disentangle the specificities of a spatial
configuration from the ideal system. Creating statistically valid models of
road networks along with models of city generation allows to average the
effects of geometry bringing us one step closer to understanding urban
environments.
  To completely understand road networks we need to be able to grasp what
principles of economy do their growth entail. It is therefore of interest to
explore the possible shape that a performance function would have for
transportation systems.
  In this work, we tackle this issue by proposing a network generation model
based on a single parameter $\alpha$ which is capable of creating any type of
network from trees to quasi-surfaces and which is shown to generate networks
close to the real road networks under study. This is obtained through the
definition of local and weighted versions of centrality measures. These
centrality measures deal with distance-decay effects and nodes having different
masses.
  We set ourselves to determine the properties and different regimes of this
$\alpha$-model and we lay out a definition for the performance of a network
taking into account factors such as robustness, construction cost, congestion
and distance. We obtain the optimal alpha from the analysis of the space of
possible performance functions, giving an intuition on the self-organisational
properties of the original network.

address potential shortcomings of previous studies on the topic. We use $0.2''$
angular resolution $K_{s}$ data to create a stellar density map in the central
$86.4$pc x $21$pc at the Galactic center. We include data from selected
adaptive-optics-assisted images obtained for the inner parsecs. In addition, we
use IRAC/Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) images. We model the Galactic bulge and the
nuclear stellar disk in order to subtract them from the MWNSC. Finally, we fit
a S\'ersic model to the MWNSC and investigate its symmetry. Results. Our
results are consistent with previous work. The MWNSC is flattened with an axis
ratio of $q=0.71 \pm0.10$, an effective radius of $R_{e}=(5.1 \pm1.0)$ pc, and
a S\'ersic index of $n=2.2 \pm0.7$. Its major axis may be tilted out of the
Galactic plane by up to $-10$ degrees. The distribution of the giants brighter
than the Red Clump (RC) is found to be significantly flatter than the
distribution of the faint stars. We investigate the 3D structure of the central
stellar cusp using our results on the MWNSC structure on large scales to
constrain the deprojection of the measured stellar surface number density,
obtaining a value of the 3D inner power law of
$\gamma=1.38\pm0.06_{sys}\pm0.01_{stat}$. Conclusions. The MWNSC shares its
main properties with other extragalactic NSCs found in spiral galaxies. The
differences in the structure between bright giants and RC stars might be
related to the existence of not completely mixed populations of different ages.
This may hint at recent growth of the MWNSC through star formation or cluster
accretion.

literature. While traditional techniques are based on generating structures
that adhere to a pre-decided distribution, recent techniques have shifted
towards learning this distribution directly from the data. While learning-based
approaches have imparted significant improvement in quality, some limitations
remain to be addressed. First, learning graph distributions introduces
additional computational overhead, which limits their scalability to large
graph databases. Second, many techniques only learn the structure and do not
address the need to also learn node and edge labels, which encode important
semantic information and influence the structure itself. Third, existing
techniques often incorporate domain-specific rules and lack generalizability.
Fourth, the experimentation of existing techniques is not comprehensive enough
due to either using weak evaluation metrics or focusing primarily on synthetic
or small datasets. In this work, we develop a domain-agnostic technique called
GraphGen to overcome all of these limitations. GraphGen converts graphs to
sequences using minimum DFS codes. Minimum DFS codes are canonical labels and
capture the graph structure precisely along with the label information. The
complex joint distributions between structure and semantic labels are learned
through a novel LSTM architecture. Extensive experiments on million-sized, real
graph datasets show GraphGen to be 4 times faster on average than
state-of-the-art techniques while being significantly better in quality across
a comprehensive set of 11 different metrics. Our code is released at

coupled oscillators, explosive synchronization is a particular type of
transition to phase synchrony that is first-order as the coupling strength
increases. Explosive sychronization has been observed in several natural
systems, and recent evidence suggests that it might also occur in the brain. A
natural system to study this phenomenon is the Kuramoto model that describes an
ensemble of coupled phase oscillators. Here we calculate bi-variate similarity
measures (the cross-correlation, $\rho_{ij}$, and the phase locking value,
PLV$_{ij}$) between the phases, $\phi_i(t)$ and $\phi_j(t)$, of pairs of
oscillators and determine the lag time between them as the time-shift,
$\tau_{ij}$, which gives maximum similarity (i.e., the maximum of
$\rho_{ij}(\tau)$ or PLV$_{ij}(\tau)$). We find that, as the transition to
synchrony is approached, changes in the distribution of lag times provide an
earlier warning of the synchronization transition (either gradual or
explosive). The analysis of experimental data, recorded from Rossler-like
electronic chaotic oscillators, suggests that these findings are not limited to
phase oscillators, as the lag times display qualitatively similar behavior with
increasing coupling strength, as in the Kuramoto oscillators. We also analyze
the statistical relationship between the lag times between pairs of oscillators
and the existence of a direct connection between them. We find that depending
on the strength of the coupling, the lags can be informative of the network
connectivity.

length, such as the Jeans length, result in CO abundances that are too high at
a given H$_2$ abundance. We find that a model with a distribution of shielding

  Certificates Under Uncertainty",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in Deep Machine Learning have shown promise in solving
complex perception and control loops via methods such as reinforcement and
imitation learning. However, guaranteeing safety for such learned deep policies
has been a challenge due to issues such as partial observability and
difficulties in characterizing the behavior of the neural networks. While a lot
of emphasis in safe learning has been placed during training, it is non-trivial
to guarantee safety at deployment or test time. This paper extends how under
mild assumptions, Safety Barrier Certificates can be used to guarantee safety
with deep control policies despite uncertainty arising due to perception and
other latent variables. Specifically for scenarios where the dynamics are
smooth and uncertainty has a finite support, the proposed framework wraps
around an existing deep control policy and generates safe actions by
dynamically evaluating and modifying the policy from the embedded network. Our
framework utilizes control barrier functions to create spaces of control
actions that are safe under uncertainty, and when the original actions are
found to be in violation of the safety constraint, uses quadratic programming
to minimally modify the original actions to ensure they lie in the safe set.
Representations of the environment are built through Euclidean signed distance
fields that are then used to infer the safety of actions and to guarantee
forward invariance. We implement this method in simulation in a drone-racing
environment and show that our method results in safer actions compared to a
baseline that only relies on imitation learning to generate control actions.

principles of Lorentzian geometry into the language of quantum information.
Intervals along time-like trajectories, and their associated causal diamonds,
completely characterize a Lorentzian geometry. The
Bekenstein-Hawking-Gibbons-'t Hooft-Jacobson-Fischler-Susskind-Bousso Covariant
Entropy Principle, equates the logarithm of the dimension of the Hilbert space
associated with a diamond to one quarter of the area of the diamond's
holographic screen, measured in Planck units. The most convincing argument for
this principle is Jacobson's derivation of Einstein's equations as the
hydrodynamic expression of this entropy law. In that context, the null energy
condition (NEC) is seen to be the analog of the local law of entropy increase.
The quantum version of Einstein's relativity principle is a set of constraints
on the mutual quantum information shared by causal diamonds along different
time-like trajectories. The implementation of this constraint for trajectories
in relative motion is the greatest unsolved problem in HST. The other key
feature of HST is its claim that, for non-negative cosmological constant or
causal diamonds much smaller than the asymptotic radius of curvature for
negative c.c., the degrees of freedom localized in the bulk of a diamond are
constrained states of variables defined on the holographic screen. This
principle gives a simple explanation of otherwise puzzling features of BH
entropy formulae, and resolves the firewall problem for black holes in
Minkowski space. It motivates a covariant version of the CKN\cite{ckn} bound on
the regime of validity of quantum field theory (QFT) and a detailed picture of
the way in which QFT emerges as an approximation to the exact theory.

using a Taylor series expansion for convolution integrals. This naturally
extends into being able to approximate convolution integrals for a wider class
of convolution integral kernels $K(t-s)$. One of the main advantages under this
approach is the ability to numerically approximate weakly singular kernels,
which fail to converge under traditional quadrature methods. We provide
stability and convergence analysis for these composite quadratures, which offer
optimal convergence for approximating functions in $C^{\gamma}[0,T]$, where
$\alpha \leq \gamma \leq 5$ and $0<\alpha < 1$. For the order $\gamma =
1,2,3,4,5$ scheme, the resulting approximation is $O(\tau^{\gamma})$ accurate,
where $\tau$ is the size of the partition of the time domain. By instead
utilizing a fractional Taylor series expansion, we are able to obtain for
$\gamma \in (0,5)-\{1,2,3,4\}$ order scheme, which yields an approximation of
$O(\tau^{\gamma})$ with a constant dependent on the kernel function which
improves the order of convergence. This allows for a far wider class of
functions to be approximated, and by strengthening the regularity assumption,
we are able to obtain more accurate results. General convolution integrals
exhibit these results up to $\gamma = 2$ without the assumption of $K$ being
decreasing. Finally, some numerical examples are presented, which validate our
findings.

supersymmetric and solve the fully backreacted equations of motion of
ten-dimensional supergravity with smeared D5-brane sources. In all cases the
geometry flows to $AdS_{5}\times {\mathbb S}^5$ in the UV, signaling an
isotropic UV fixed point of the dual field theory. In the IR, depending on the
parameters of the solution, we find two possible behaviors: an isotropic fixed
point or a geometry with anisotropic Lifshitz-like scaling symmetry. We study
several properties of the solutions, including the entanglement entropy of

probability that it is gravitationally bound to its host by performing common
proper motion checks and modelling of synthetic stellar populations around the

measured $K$ band contrasts indicate that these are stellar companions of
$0.35\pm0.02\,M_{\odot}$ and $0.62^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\,M_{\odot}$, respectively.
Including the re-detection and confirmation of previously known companions in
13 other systems we derived a multiplicity fraction of
$55.4^{+5.9}_{-9.4}\,\%$. For the representative sub-sample of 40 hot Jupiter
host stars among our targets, the derived multiplicity rate is
$54.8^{+6.3}_{-9.9}\,\%$. Our data do not confirm any trend that systems with
eccentric planetary companions are preferably part of multiple systems. On
average, we reached a magnitude contrast of $8.5\pm0.9$ mag at an angular
separation of 0.5''. This allows to exclude additional stellar companions with
masses larger than $0.08$ M$_\odot$ for almost all observed systems; around the
closest and youngest systems this sensitivity is achieved at physical
separations as small as 10 au. The presented study shows that SPHERE is an
ideal instrument to detect and characterize close companions to exoplanetary

measured physical properties are very different for the three scenarios
considered (ignoring binarity, planet transits brighter star, and planet
transits fainter star). In the other five cases our results are very similar to
those obtained neglecting contaminating light. We use our results to determine
the mean correction factors to planet radius, $\langle X_R\rangle$, mass,
$\langle X_M\rangle$, and density, $\langle X_\rho\rangle$, caused by nearby
objects. We find $\langle X_R\rangle=1.009\pm0.045$, which is smaller than
literature values because we were able to reject the possibility that the
planet orbits the fainter star in all but one case. We find $\langle
X_M\rangle=1.031\pm0.019$, which is larger than $\langle X_R\rangle$ because of
the strength of the effect of contaminating light on the radial velocity
measurements of the host star. We find $\langle X_\rho\rangle=0.995\pm 0.046$:
the small size of this correction is due to two effects: the corrections on
planet radius and mass partially cancel; and some nearby stars are close enough
to contaminate the light curves of the system but not radial velocities of the
host star. We conclude that binarity of planet host stars is important for the
small number of transiting hot Jupiters with a very bright and close nearby
star, but it has only a small effect on population-level studies of these
objects.

the rate of heating can be exponentially suppressed when the drive frequency is

a prethermal regime in the Bose-Hubbard model. By measuring the energy
absorption of the cloud as the driving frequency is increased, we observe an
exponential-in-frequency reduction of the heating rate persisting over more
than 2 orders of magnitude. The tunability of the lattice potentials allows us
to explore one- and two-dimensional systems in a range of different interacting
regimes. Alongside the exponential decrease, the dependence of the heating rate
on the frequency displays features characteristic of the phase diagram of the
Bose-Hubbard model, whose understanding is additionally supported by numerical
simulations in one dimension. Our results show experimental evidence of the
phenomenon of Floquet prethermalization, and provide insight into the

main result of this work is to place the most stringent constraints to date on

questions in neurovascular medicine until the present moment. The complexity of
aneurysm mechanobiology and pathobiology staggeringly combine intertwining
biological and physical processes that are tightly connected. Recently,
transition to turbulence in IA blood flow is thought to play a central role in
IA growth and rupture as it can be directly linked to endothelial dysfunction.
However, the problem of turbulence brings unprecedented complications to the
topic. We found turbulence in IA to be of non-Kolmogorov type. For the first
time, we detected inverse kinetic energy cascade in blood flow and in
non-Kolmogorov turbulence. Here, we hypothesize that the near-wall turbulence
undergoing inverse energy cascade have scales that could affect the
mechano-signaling of endothelial cells. Our findings could be a paradigm shift
in the contemporary theory of aneurysm hemodynamics.

decays, consistent with existing limits on the life time, are assumed to be
driven by higher dimensional effective operators. We consider both two-body
decays of a scalar dark particle and a dark sector having three-body decays,
producing two standard model particles. It is found that the Fermi-LAT data on
isotropic $\gamma$-ray background provides the best constraints so far,
although the CTA telescope may be more effective for decays where one or two
photons are directly produced. In all cases, deeper probes of the effective
operators are possible in the upcoming SKA radio telescope with a few hundred
hours of observation, using the radio synchrotron flux coming from energetic
electrons produced in the decay cascades within dwarf spheroidal galaxies.
Finally, we estimate how the SKA can constrain the parameter space spanned by
the galactic magnetic field and the diffusion coefficient, if observations
consistent with $\gamma$-ray data actually take place.

exploits the computational search to optimize different processes when

category of such complex systems that permits to optimize different functional
and non-functional objectives/criteria under changing environments (e.g.,
requirements and workload), which involves problems that are subject to search.
In this regard, over years, there has been a considerable amount of work that
investigates SBSE for SASs. In this paper, we provide the first systematic and
comprehensive survey exclusively on SBSE for SASs, covering papers in 27 venues
from 7 repositories, which eventually leads to several key statistics from the
most notable 74 primary studies in this particular field of research. Our
results, surprisingly, have revealed five disappointments that are of utmost
importance and can result in serve consequences but have been overwhelmingly
ignored in existing studies. We provide theoretical and/or experimental
evidence to justify our arguments against the disappointments, present
suggestions, and highlight the promising research opportunities towards their
mitigation. We also elaborate on three other emergent, but currently
under-explored opportunities for future work on SBSE for SASs. By mitigating
the disappointments revealed in this work, together with the highlighted
opportunities, we hope to be able to excite a much more significant growth in
this particular research direction.

specific theories. We find a relation with the conformal anomaly of the 3+1
dimensional relativistic counterpart which suggests the existence of a
non-relativistic version of the a-theorem. We consider a model realizing a
$\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric extension of the Bargmann group in 2+1
dimensions with non-vanishing superpotential, obtained by null reduction of a
relativistic Wess-Zumino model. We check that the superpotential is protected
against quantum corrections as in the relativistic parent theory, thus finding
a non-relativistic version of the non-renormalization theorem. We find evidence
that the theory is one-loop exact, due to the causal structure of the
non-relativistic propagator together with mass conservation. In the second part
of the thesis we review the holographic conjectures proposed by Susskind to
describe the time-evolution of the Einstein-Rosen bridge in gravity: the
complexity=volume and complexity=action. We investigate both the volume and the
action for black holes living in warped $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ spacetime. There exist
extensions of the proposals when the dual state from the field theory side is
mixed; we then analytically compute the subregion action complexity for a
general segment on the boundary in the BTZ black hole background, finding that
it is equal to the sum of a linearly divergent term proportional to the size of
the subregion and of a term proportional to the entanglement entropy. We also
find that mutual holographic complexity carries a different content compared to
mutual information. This means that entropy is not enough!

a power law spectrum. Near proton-kinetic scales, a spectral break occurs which
is commonly interpreted as a transition to kinetic turbulence. However, this
transition is not yet entirely understood. By studying the scaling of the break
with various plasma properties, it may be possible to constrain the processes
leading to the onset of kinetic turbulence. Using data from Parker Solar Probe
(\textit{PSP}), we measure the proton scale break over a range of heliocentric
distances, enabling a measurement of the transition from inertial to kinetic
scale turbulence under various plasma conditions. We find that the break
frequency $f_b$ increases as the heliocentric distance $r$ decreases in the
slow solar wind following a power law $f_b\sim r^{-1.11}$. We also compare this
to the characteristic plasma ion scales to relate the break to the possible
physical mechanisms occurring at this scale. The ratio between $f_b$ and $f_c$,
the Doppler shifted ion cyclotron resonance scale, is approximately unity for
all plasma $\beta_p$. At high $\beta_p$ the ratio between $f_b$ and $f_\rho$,
the Doppler shifted gyroscale, is approximately unity; while at low $\beta_p$
the ratio between $f_b$ and $f_d$, the Doppler shifted proton-inertial length
is unity. Due to the large comparable Alfv\'en and solar wind speeds, we
analyze these results using both the standard and modified Taylor hypothesis,
demonstrating robust statistical results.

binary systems, measurements for blue supergiants and reddenings derived from
Str\""{o}mgren photometry of B-type stars. We obtained intrinsic color of the

is E$(B-V)_{\mathrm{LMC}}$=0.127 mag and E$(B-V)_{\mathrm{SMC}}$=0.084 mag for
the LMC and SMC, respectively. The systematic uncertainty of the average
reddening value assigned to each field of our maps is 0.013 mag for both

B-splines with periodic knot vectors to obtain discretizations of closed curves

the fluid volume inside closed co-dimension one solids is a well-known issue
for IB methods. The DCIB method results in volume changes orders of magnitude
lower than conventional IB methods. This is a byproduct of discretizing the
velocity-pressure pair with divergence-conforming B-splines, which lead to
negligible incompressibility errors at the Eulerian level. The higher
inter-element continuity of divergence-conforming B-splines is also crucial to
avoid the quadrature/interpolation errors of IB methods becoming the dominant

identifying objects from aerial images faces the following challenges: 1)
objects of interests are often too small and too dense relative to the images;
2) objects of interests are often in different relative sizes; and 3) the
number of objects in each category is imbalanced. A novel network structure,
Points Estimated Network (PENet), is proposed in this work to answer these

datasets, a coarse anchor-free detector (CPEN) to effectively predict the
center points of the small object clusters, and a fine anchor-free detector
FPEN to locate the precise positions of the small objects. An adaptive merge
algorithm Non-maximum Merge (NMM) is implemented in CPEN to address the issue
of detecting dense small objects, and a hierarchical loss is defined in FPEN to
further improve the classification accuracy. Our extensive experiments on

the datacenter network (DCN), where flow sizes are highly variable, would
suggest scheduling every individual flow. However, we show that considering
scheduling delay (including scheduler's computational and communication
delays), serving most of the flows without any scheduling and only in
first-come-first-served (FCFS) manner significantly improves their performance
even when it is compared to the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT)-known
as optimum algorithm when scheduling delay is zero. To do so, we only require
to have two coarse classes of flows categorized based on flows' sizes
(1st-class including flows smaller than a threshold, H, and 2nd-class including
others) and serve 1st-class flows always before serving 2nd-class ones. To show
that, we take SRPT scheduling algorithm accompanied by the global knowledge of
flows, formulate impact of scheduling delay on its performance, and prove that
for any flow size distribution and network load (<1), there is always a
threshold, H, which guarantees 1st-class flows achieve lower AFCT under FCFS
compared to SRPT. Our numerically calculated results and extensive flow-level
simulations show that on average, more than 90% of flows could be in 1st-class

reduction of the cortical excitability in certain neurological diseases that,
unlike ordinary transcranial magnetic stimulation, makes use of static magnetic
fields generated by permanent magnets. The physical principle underlying
transcranial magnetic stimulation is well known, that is, the Faradays law. By
contrast, the physical mechanism that explains the interaction between neurons
and static magnetic fields in transcranial static magnetic stimulation remains
unclear, which makes it difficult to improve and fine tune the treatment. In
the present work it is discussed the possibility that this mechanism might be
the Lorentz force exerted on the ions flowing along the membrane channels of
neurons. To support this hypothesis, a dimensional analysis it is carried out
to compare the Larmor radius of the ions in the presence of a static magnetic
field with the dimensions of the cross section of human axons and membrane
channels in neurons. This analysis shows that whereas a moderate static
magnetic field is not expected to affect the ion flux through axons,
nevertheless it can affect the ion flux along membrane channels. The overall
effect of the static magnetic field would be to introduce an additional
friction between the ions and the walls of the membrane channels, thus reducing
its conductance. Calculations performed by using a Hodgkin-Huxley model
demonstrate that even a slight reduction of the conductance of the membrane
channels can lead to the suppression of the action potential, thus inhibiting
neuronal activity.

As VR devices improve and become more widely available, there remains a number
of unanswered questions regarding the impact of VR on student learning and how
best to use this technology in the classroom. On the topic of electrostatics,
for example, a large, controlled, randomized study performed by Smith et al.
2017\cite{smith17}, found that VR-based instruction had an overall negligible
impact on student learning compared to videos or images. However, they did find
a strong trend for students who reported frequent video game play to learn
better from VR than other media. One possible interpretation of this result is
that extended videogame play provides a kind of ""training"" that enables a
student to learn more comfortably in the virtual environment. In the present
work we consider if a VR training activity that is unrelated to electrostatics
can help prepare students to learn electrostatics from subsequent VR
instruction. We find that preliminary VR training leads to a small but
statistically significant improvement in student performance on our
electrostatics assessment. We also find that student reported game play is
still correlated with higher scores on this metric.

Massive-MIMO enables simultaneous uplink transmissions from all users,
significantly shortening the data offloading time compared to sequential

downloading have comparable durations. Based on this three-phase structure, we
formulate a novel problem to minimize a weighted sum of the energy consumption

using a combination of data partitioning, transmit power control and CPU
frequency scaling at both the user and server ends. We design a novel nested

offloaded to the MECs to reduce local computation time in order to meet the
latency constraint, despite higher energy cost of wireless transmissions.
Massive-MIMO channel estimation errors under pilot contamination also causes
more data to be offloaded to the MECs. Compared to binary offloading, partial

and precision of the trigonometric parallaxes measured by Gaia. Our aim is to
build a complete sample of PN central star detections with minimal
contamination.
  Methods: We develop and apply an automated technique based on the likelihood

known PNe in the Hong Kong/AAO/Strasbourg H$\alpha$ (HASH) PN catalogue, taking
into account the BP--RP colours of the \emph{Gaia} sources as well as their

  Results: We present a catalogue of over 1000 Gaia sources that our method has
automatically identified as likely PN central stars. We demonstrate how the
best matches enable us to trace nebula and central star evolution and to
validate existing statistical distance scales, and discuss the prospects for
further refinement of the matching based on additional data. We also compare

near-term quantum computing. In practice, quantum optimization will have to
compete with cheaper classical heuristic methods, which have the advantage of
decades of empirical domain-specific enhancements. Consequently, to achieve
optimal performance we will face the issue of algorithm selection, well-studied
in practical computing. Here we introduce this problem to the quantum
optimization domain.
  Specifically, we study the problem of detecting those problem instances of
where QAOA is most likely to yield an advantage over a conventional algorithm.
As our case study, we compare QAOA against the well-understood approximation
algorithm of Goemans and Williamson (GW) on the Max-Cut problem. As exactly
predicting the performance of algorithms can be intractable, we utilize machine
learning to identify when to resort to the quantum algorithm. We achieve
cross-validated accuracy well over 96\%, which would yield a substantial
practical advantage. In the process, we highlight a number of features of
instances rendering them better suited for QAOA. While we work with simulated
idealised algorithms, the flexibility of ML methods we employed provides

main and early shocks in 1485 RR~Lyrae stars in the Galactic bulge observed by
the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE). We selected non-modulated
fundamental-mode RR~Lyrae stars with good-quality photometry. Using a
self-developed method, we determined the centers and strengths of main and
early shock features in the phased light curves. We found that the position of
both humps and bumps are highly correlated with the pulsation properties of the
studied variables. Pulsators with a pronounced main shock are concentrated in
the low-amplitude regime of the period-amplitude diagram, while stars with a
strong early shock have average and above-average pulsation amplitudes. A
connection between the main and early shocks and the Fourier coefficients is
also observed. In the color-magnitude diagram (CMD), we see a separation
between stars with strong and weak shocks. Variables with a pronounced main
shock cluster close to the fundamental red edge of the instability strip (IS),
while stars with a strong early shock tend to clump in the center and near the
fundamental blue edge of the IS. The appearance of shocks and their properties
seem independent of the direction of evolution estimated from the period change
rate of the studied stars. In addition, the differences in the period change
rate between the two main Oosterhoff groups found in the Galactic bulge suggest
that stars of Oosterhoff type I are located close to the zero-age horizontal
branch while Oosterhoff type II variables are on their way toward the
fundamental red edge of the instability strip, thus having already left the
zero-age horizontal branch.

momentum distribution. Such an asymmetry depends on both the spatial position
along the transverse gradient and path length of a propagating parton as shown
by numerical solutions of the Boltzmann transport in the simplified form of a
drift-diffusion equation. In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, this asymmetry
with respect to a plane defined by the beam and trigger particle (photon,
hadron or jet) with a given orientation relative to the event plane is shown to
be closely related to the transverse position of the initial jet production in
full event-by-event simulations within the linear Boltzmann transport model.
Such a gradient tomography can be used to localize the initial jet production

discontinuous functions. However, most, if not all existing models only deal
with fitting continuous functions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of
fitting a discontinuous piecewise affine function to given data that lie in an
orthogonal grid, where no restriction on the partition is enforced (i.e., its
geometric shape can be nonconvex). This is useful for segmentation and
denoising when data corresponding to images. We propose a novel Mixed Integer
Program (MIP) formulation for the piecewise affine fitting problem, where
binary variables determine the location of break-points. To obtain consistent
partitions (i.e. image segmentation), we include multi-cut constraints in the
formulation. Since the resulting problem is $\mathcal{NP}$-hard, two techniques
are introduced to improve the computation. One is to add facet-defining
inequalities to the formulation and the other to provide initial integer
solutions using a special heuristic algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments
by some synthetic images as well as real depth images, and the results
demonstrate the feasibility of our model.

  Federated Learning",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning is a powerful machine learning paradigm to cooperatively
train a global model with highly distributed data. A major bottleneck on the
performance of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for
large-scale Federated Learning is the communication overhead on pushing local
gradients and pulling global model. In this paper, to reduce the communication
complexity of Federated Learning, a novel approach named Pulling Reduction with
Local Compensation (PRLC) is proposed. Specifically, each training node
intermittently pulls the global model from the server in SGD iterations,
resulting in that it is sometimes unsynchronized with the server. In such a
case, it will use its local update to compensate the gap between the local
model and the global model. Our rigorous theoretical analysis of PRLC achieves
two important findings. First, we prove that the convergence rate of PRLC
preserves the same order as the classical synchronous SGD for both
strongly-convex and non-convex cases with good scalability due to the linear
speedup with respect to the number of training nodes. Second, we show that PRLC
admits lower pulling frequency than the existing pulling reduction method
without local compensation. We also conduct extensive experiments on various
machine learning models to validate our theoretical results. Experimental
results show that our approach achieves a significant pulling reduction over
the state-of-the-art methods, e.g., PRLC requiring only half of the pulling
operations of LAG.

closer to the host star in a near coplanar configuration with their planetary

is 179$\pm$15. Respectively, the max/min ratios 8.1$\pm$10.5 and 34.0$\pm$45.5
confirmed the variability of the Mg~II emission line and of the Fe~II band. The
highest levels of emission lines fluxes recorded coincide with a superluminal
jet component traversing through a stationary component located at $\sim$0.1
mas from the 43 GHz core. Additionally, comparing the Mg~II line profile in the
minimum of activity against the one in the maximum, we found that the latter is
broader and blue-shifted. As a result of these findings, we can conclude that
the non-thermal continuum emission produced by material in the jet moving at
relativistic speeds is related to the broad emission line fluctuations. In
consequence, these fluctuations are also linked to the presence of broad-line
region (BLR) clouds located at $\sim$25 pc from the central engine, outside
from the inner parsec, where the canonical BLR is located. Our results suggest
that during strong activity in CTA~102, the source of non-thermal emission and
broad-line clouds outside the inner parsec introduces uncertainties in the
estimates of black hole (BH) mass. Therefore, it is important to estimate the
BH mass, using single-epoch or reverberation mapping techniques, only with
spectra where the continuum luminosity is dominated by the accretion disk.

training. Collecting all such data at a central location can be challenging due
to data privacy and communication bandwidth restrictions. Federated learning is
an effective way of training a machine learning model in a distributed manner
from local data collected by client devices, which does not require exchanging
the raw data among clients. A challenge is that among the large variety of data
collected at each client, it is likely that only a subset is relevant for a
learning task while the rest of data has a negative impact on model training.
Therefore, before starting the learning process, it is important to select the
subset of data that is relevant to the given federated learning task. In this
paper, we propose a method for distributedly selecting relevant data, where we
use a benchmark model trained on a small benchmark dataset that is
task-specific, to evaluate the relevance of individual data samples at each
client and select the data with sufficiently high relevance. Then, each client
only uses the selected subset of its data in the federated learning process.
The effectiveness of our proposed approach is evaluated on multiple real-world
image datasets in a simulated system with a large number of clients, showing up
to $25\%$ improvement in model accuracy compared to training with all data.

weighted mean distance $\big < d \big>$ = 8.1 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc. The distribution
of RRab and RRc stars on the HB shows a clear segregation around the first
overtone red edge of the instability strip, which seems to be a common feature

membership analysis of 60,447 stars in our FoV using the data from $Gaia$-DR2

found evidence of non-member stars in the FoV of the cluster being tidally

Unfortunately, evaluating our proposed loss function is computationally

through a simulated study and through designing an air quality monitoring

to explicitly construct and explore the ground-state phase diagram. The phase

feature adaptation step often happens globally, at a coarse level, hindering
its applicability to tasks such as semantic segmentation, where details are of
crucial importance to provide sharp results. In this thesis, we present a novel
architecture, which learns to adapt features across domains by taking into
account per class information. To that aim, we design a conditional pixel-wise
discriminator network, whose output is conditioned on the segmentation masks.
Moreover, following recent advances in image translation, we adopt the recently
introduced StarGAN architecture as image translation backbone, since it is able
to perform translations across multiple domains by means of a single generator
network. Preliminary results on a segmentation task designed to assess the
effectiveness of the proposed approach highlight the potential of the model,
improving upon strong baselines and alternative designs.

demonstrated that neural activity is dominated by dynamics on a low-dimensional
manifold that can be clustered according to behavioral states. Despite progress
in modeling the dynamics with linear or locally linear models, it remains
unclear how a single network of neurons can produce the observed features. In
particular, there are multiple clusters, or fixed points, observed in the data
which cannot be characterized by a single linear model. We propose a nonlinear
control model which is global and parameterized by only four free parameters
that match the features displayed by the low-dimensional C. elegans neural
activity. In addition to reproducing the average probability distribution of
the data, long and short time-scale changes in transition statistics can be
characterized via changes in a single parameter. Some of these macro-scale
transitions have experimental correlates to single neuro-modulators that seem
to act as biological controls, allowing this model to generate testable
hypotheses about the effect of these neuro-modulators on the global dynamics.
The theory provides an elegant characterization of the neuron population

that can frequently occur in a Bayesian analysis of multivariate parameters. It
refers to the phenomenon that a parameter estimate based on a posterior is more
extreme than both of those inferred based on either the prior or the likelihood
alone. Inferential claims that exhibit DPP defy the common intuition that the
posterior is a prior-data compromise, and the phenomenon can be surprisingly
ubiquitous in well-behaved Bayesian models. In this paper we revisit this
phenomenon and, using point estimation as an example, derive conditions under
which the DPP occurs in Bayesian models with exponential quadratic likelihoods
and conjugate multivariate Gaussian priors. The family of exponential quadratic
likelihood models includes Gaussian models and those models with local
asymptotic normality property. We provide an intuitive geometric interpretation
of the phenomenon and show that there exists a nontrivial space of marginal
directions such that the DPP occurs. We further relate the phenomenon to the
Simpson's paradox and discover their deep-rooted connection that is associated
with marginalization. We also draw connections with Bayesian computational
algorithms when difficult geometry exists. Our discovery demonstrates that DPP
is more prevalent than previously understood and anticipated. Theoretical
results are complemented by numerical illustrations. Scenarios covered in this
study have implications for parameterization, sensitivity analysis, and prior

that these transitions can be predicted from neurons previously implicated in
behavioral transitions, but also additional neurons previously unidentified.
Moreover, our decomposition method allows one to understand the observed
nonlinear global dynamics instead as linear dynamics with control. The proposed
mathematical framework is generic and can be generalized to other neurosensory

However, large monolingual corpora might not always be available for the

corpora of other languages to complement the scarcity of monolingual corpora
for the LOI. A case study of low-resource Japanese-English neural machine
translation (NMT) reveals that leveraging large Chinese and French monolingual

script mapping (Chinese to Japanese) to increase the similarity between the two
monolingual corpora leading to further improvements in translation quality.
Additionally, we propose simple data-selection techniques to be used prior to
pre-training that significantly impact the quality of S2S pre-training. An
empirical comparison of our proposed methods reveals that leveraging assisting

important for NMT pre-training in low-resource scenarios.

functions, but it can be trapped at local minima. On the other hand, Langevin
dynamics (LD) can explore the state space and find global minima, but in order
to give accurate estimates, LD needs to run with a small discretization step
size and weak stochastic force, which in general slow down its convergence.
This paper shows that these two algorithms and their non-swapping variants. can
``collaborate"" through a simple exchange mechanism, in which they swap their
current positions if LD yields a lower objective function. This idea can be
seen as the singular limit of the replica-exchange technique from the sampling
literature. We show that this new algorithm converges to the global minimum
linearly with high probability, assuming the objective function is strongly
convex in a neighborhood of the unique global minimum. By replacing gradients
with stochastic gradients, and adding a proper threshold to the exchange

thus it's hard to learn a good decision function for classification. In this
work, we use a sophisticated network architecture to learn better feature
representation and focus on the second issue. A novel continual local
replacement strategy is proposed to address the data deficiency problem. It
takes advantage of the content in unlabeled images to continually enhance
labeled ones. Specifically, a pseudo labeling method is adopted to constantly
select semantically similar images on the fly. Original labeled images will be
locally replaced by the selected images for the next epoch training. In this
way, the model can directly learn new semantic information from unlabeled
images and the capacity of supervised signals in the embedding space can be
significantly enlarged. This allows the model to improve generalization and
learn a better decision boundary for classification. Our method is conceptually
simple and easy to implement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it can

this situation and examine the performance of the HMM, we compare the model
with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM), which is with no temporal regularization

synthetic time series generated from empirical resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We compared the GMM and HMM for various
sampling frequencies, lengths of recording per participant, numbers of
participants, and numbers of independent component signals. We find that the
HMM attains a better accuracy of estimating the hidden state than the GMM in a
majority of cases. However, we also find that the accuracy of the GMM is
comparable to that of the HMM under the condition that the sampling frequency
is reasonably low (e.g., TR = 2.88 or 3.60 s) or the data is relatively short.

CT-ECS circuits, are IQP, Clifford Magic, and conjugated Clifford circuits.
This means that there exist various CT-ECS circuits such that their output
probability distributions are anti-concentrated and not classically simulatable
in the noise-free setting (under plausible assumptions). First, we consider a
noise model where a depolarizing channel with an arbitrarily small constant
rate is applied to each qubit at the end of computation. We show that, under
this noise model, if an approximate value of the noise rate is known, any
CT-ECS circuit with an anti-concentrated output probability distribution is
classically simulatable. This indicates that the presence of small noise
drastically affects the classical simulatability of CT-ECS circuits. Then, we
consider an extension of the noise model where the noise rate can vary with
each qubit, and provide a similar sufficient condition for classically
simulating CT-ECS circuits with anti-concentrated output probability
distributions.

efficiently the underlying dynamics of VaR and ES. We refer to this model as
LSTM-AL. We adopt the adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for

given clues about the target speaker, has attracted increasing attention. We
have recently proposed SpeakerBeam, which exploits an adaptation utterance of
the target speaker to extract his/her voice characteristics that are then used
to guide a neural network towards extracting speech of that speaker.
SpeakerBeam presents a practical alternative to speech separation as it enables
tracking speech of a target speaker across utterances, and achieves promising
speech extraction performance. However, it sometimes fails when speakers have
similar voice characteristics, such as in same-gender mixtures, because it is
difficult to discriminate the target speaker from the interfering speakers. In
this paper, we investigate strategies for improving the speaker discrimination
capability of SpeakerBeam. First, we propose a time-domain implementation of
SpeakerBeam similar to that proposed for a time-domain audio separation network
(TasNet), which has achieved state-of-the-art performance for speech
separation. Besides, we investigate (1) the use of spatial features to better
discriminate speakers when microphone array recordings are available, (2)
adding an auxiliary speaker identification loss for helping to learn more
discriminative voice characteristics. We show experimentally that these
strategies greatly improve speech extraction performance, especially for
same-gender mixtures, and outperform TasNet in terms of target speech
extraction.

millions of instances, explaining predictions for single data instances can
easily miss a bigger picture. Besides, many outperforming RNN models use
multi-hot encoding to represent the presence/absence of features, where the
interpretability of feature value attribution is missing. We present ViSFA, an
interactive system that visually summarizes feature attribution over time for
different feature values. ViSFA scales to large data such as the MIMIC dataset
containing the electronic health records of 1.2 million high-dimensional

rate, but has also been associated with potential harms due to low specificity,
leading to unnecessary exams or procedures, and low sensitivity. Digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) improves on conventional mammography by increasing both
sensitivity and specificity and is becoming common in clinical settings.
However, deep learning (DL) models have been developed mainly on conventional
2D full-field digital mammography (FFDM) or scanned film images. Due to a lack
of large annotated DBT datasets, it is difficult to train a model on DBT from
scratch. In this work, we present methods to generalize a model trained on FFDM
images to DBT images. In particular, we use average histogram matching (HM) and
DL fine-tuning methods to generalize a FFDM model to the 2D maximum intensity
projection (MIP) of DBT images. In the proposed approach, the differences
between the FFDM and DBT domains are reduced via HM and then the base model,
which was trained on abundant FFDM images, is fine-tuned. When evaluating on
image patches extracted around identified findings, we are able to achieve
similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of
$\sim 0.9$ for FFDM and $\sim 0.85$ for MIP images, as compared to a ROC AUC of
$\sim 0.75$ when tested directly on MIP images.

radiologists for decades, it has failed to improve the interpretation of
full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images due to its low sensitivity over

with loose bounding boxes of mammographically significant findings to train a
deep learning detector with extreme sensitivity. Building upon work from the
Hourglass architecture, we train a model that produces segmentation-like images
with high spatial resolution, with the aim of producing 2D Gaussian blobs
centered on ground-truth boxes. We replace the pixel-wise $L_2$ norm with a
weak-supervision loss designed to achieve high sensitivity, asymmetrically
penalizing false positives and false negatives while softening the noise of the
loose bounding boxes by permitting a tolerance in misaligned predictions. The
resulting system achieves a sensitivity for malignant findings of 0.99 with
only 4.8 false positive markers per image. When utilized in a CADe system, this
model could enable a novel workflow where radiologists can focus their
attention with trust on only the locations proposed by the model, expediting
the interpretation process and bringing attention to potential findings that
could otherwise have been missed. Due to its nearly perfect sensitivity, the
proposed detector can also be used as a high-performance proposal generator in
two-stage detection systems.

breast density deep learning (DL) model in a multi-site setting for synthetic
two-dimensional mammography (SM) images derived from digital breast
tomosynthesis exams using full-field digital mammography (FFDM) images and
limited SM data.
  Materials and Methods: A DL model was trained to predict BI-RADS breast
density using FFDM images acquired from 2008 to 2017 (Site 1: 57492 patients,
187627 exams, 750752 images) for this retrospective study. The FFDM model was
evaluated using SM datasets from two institutions (Site 1: 3842 patients, 3866
exams, 14472 images, acquired from 2016 to 2017; Site 2: 7557 patients, 16283
exams, 63973 images, 2015 to 2019). Each of the three datasets were then split
into training, validation, and test datasets. Adaptation methods were
investigated to improve performance on the SM datasets and the effect of
dataset size on each adaptation method is considered. Statistical significance
was assessed using confidence intervals (CI), estimated by bootstrapping.
  Results: Without adaptation, the model demonstrated substantial agreement
with the original reporting radiologists for all three datasets (Site 1 FFDM:
linearly-weighted $\kappa_w$ = 0.75 [95% CI: 0.74, 0.76]; Site 1 SM: $\kappa_w$
= 0.71 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.78]; Site 2 SM: $\kappa_w$ = 0.72 [95% CI: 0.70,
0.75]). With adaptation, performance improved for Site 2 (Site 1: $\kappa_w$ =
0.72 [95% CI: 0.66, 0.79], 0.71 vs 0.72, P = .80; Site 2: $\kappa_w$ = 0.79
[95% CI: 0.76, 0.81], 0.72 vs 0.79, P $<$ .001) using only 500 SM images from
that site.

on FFDM and SM images from two institutions without training on SM images and
improved using few SM images.

It is important to quantify the impact of relevant physics on the IGM
temperature between $z=10$ and $z \sim 30$, in order to interpret recent and
oncoming observations, including results reported by EDGES. We revisit the gas
heating due to structure formation shocks in this era, using a set of fixed
grid cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed by three different
codes. In all our simulations, the cosmic gas is predicted to be in multiphase
state since $z>30$. The gas surrounding high density peaks gradually develops a
relation more sharp than $T \propto \rho^{2/3}$, approximately $T \propto
\rho^{2}$, from $z=30$ to $z=11$, might due to shock heating. Meanwhile, the
gas in void region tends to have a large local mach number, and their thermal
state varies significantly from code to code. In the redshift range $11-20$,
the mass fraction of gas shock heated above the CMB temperature in our
simulations is larger than previous semi-analytical results by a factor of 2 to
8. At $z=15$, the fraction varies from $\sim 19\%$ to $52 \%$ among different
codes. Between $z=11$ and $z=20$, the gas temperature $<1/T_{\rm{K}}>_M^{-1}$
is predicted to be $\sim 10-20$ K by two codes, much higher than the adiabatic
cooling model and some previous works. However, in our simulations performed by
RAMSES, $<1/T_{\rm{K}}>_M^{-1}$ is predicted to be even below the temperature
required to explain result of the EDGES. Given the fact that different codes
give different predictions, currently, it seems a challenge to make solid
prediction on the temperature of gas at $z \sim 17$ in simulations.

proposed approach is that it explicitly models how potential actions not only
affect objective cost, but also transform the social context in which it plans
and acts. We investigate strategies to limit the complexity of our algorithm,
so that our planner will remain tractable for mobile platforms in complex HSEs
like hospitals and factories. The planner will also consider the relative
importance and urgency of its tasks, which it uses to determine when it is and
is not appropriate to violate social expectations to achieve its objective.
This social awareness will allow robots to understand a fundamental rule of
society: just because something makes your job easier, does not make it the
right thing to do!
  To our knowledge, the proposed work is the first task and motion planning
approach that supports socially intelligent robot policy for HSEs. Through this
ongoing work, robots will be able to understand, respect, and leverage social

static analysis and collaborative filtering to identify the minimum permissions

MPDroid first employs collaborative filtering to identify the initial minimum

overprivilege risk by inspecting the apps extra privileges, i.e., the

ALMA at millimeter wavelength have raised doubts about their being produced by
dust grains aligned with the magnetic field lines. These conclusions were based
on the calculations of dust polarized emission in the Rayleigh regime, i.e. for
grain sizes much smaller than the wavelength. However, the grain size in such
disks is estimated to be typically in the range 0.1 - 1 mm from independent
observations. We study the dust polarization properties of aligned grains in
emission in the Mie regime, i.e. when the mean grain size approches the
wavelength. Using the T-MATRIX and DustEM codes, we compute the spectral
dependence of the polarization fraction in emission for grains in perfect
spinning alignment, for various grain size distributions of weakly-elongated
oblate and prolate grains of astrosilicate composition, with a mean size
ranging from 10 {\mu}m to 1 mm. In the submillimeter and millimeter wavelength
range, the polarization by B-field aligned grains becomes negative for grains
larger than ~ 250 {\mu}m, meaning that the polarization vector becomes parallel
to the B-field. The transition from the positive to the negative polarization
occurs at a wavelength {\lambda} ~ 1 mm. The regime of negative polarization
does not exist for grains smaller than ~ 100 {\mu}m. When using realistic grain
size distributions for disks with grains up to the submillimeter sizes, the
polarization direction of thermal emission by aligned grains is shown to be
parallel to the direction of the magnetic field over a significant fraction of
the wavelengths typically used to observe young protoplanetary disks. This
property may explain the peculiar azimuthal orientation of the polarization
vectors in some of the disks observed with ALMA and attest of the conserved
ability of dust polarized emission to trace the magnetic field in disks.

monotonely increasing as a function of increasing distance between the
parameter estimate and the null value. Resulting in an upward biased $p$-value
and loss of power, the aberration can lead to very damaging consequences such
as in variable selection. The HDE afflicts many types of regression models and
corresponds to estimates near the boundary of the parameter space. This article
presents several new results, and its main contributions are to (i) propose a
very general test for detecting the HDE, regardless of its underlying cause;
(ii) fundamentally characterize the HDE by pairwise ratios of Wald and Rao
score and likelihood ratio test statistics for 1-parameter distributions; (iii)
show that the parameter space may be partitioned into an interior encased by 5
HDE severity measures (faint, weak, moderate, strong, extreme); (iv) prove that
a necessary condition for the HDE in a 2 by 2 table is a log odds ratio of at
least 2; (v) give some practical guidelines about HDE-free hypothesis testing.
Overall, practical post-fit tests can now be conducted potentially to any model
estimated by iteratively reweighted least squares, such as the generalized
linear model (GLM) and Vector GLM (VGLM) classes, the latter which encompasses
many popular regression models.

is relatively open to data acquisition compared to social media platforms like
Facebook and Twitter, the technical barriers to acquisition still remain. Thus,
Reddit's millions of subreddits, hundreds of millions of users, and hundreds of
billions of comments are at the same time relatively accessible, but time
consuming to collect and analyze systematically. In this paper, we present the
Pushshift Reddit dataset. Pushshift is a social media data collection,
analysis, and archiving platform that since 2015 has collected Reddit data and
made it available to researchers. Pushshift's Reddit dataset is updated in
real-time, and includes historical data back to Reddit's inception. In addition
to monthly dumps, Pushshift provides computational tools to aid in searching,
aggregating, and performing exploratory analysis on the entirety of the
dataset. The Pushshift Reddit dataset makes it possible for social media
researchers to reduce time spent in the data collection, cleaning, and storage
phases of their projects.

networking and business logistics. A common property of graphs used in the
domain of graph analytics is a power-law distribution of vertex connectivity,
wherein a small number of vertices are responsible for a high fraction of all
connections in the graph. These richly-connected (hot) vertices inherently
exhibit high reuse. However, their sparse distribution in memory leads to a
severe underutilization of on-chip cache capacity. Prior works have proposed
lightweight skew-aware vertex reordering that places hot vertices adjacent to
each other in memory, reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices. However, in
doing so, they may inadvertently destroy the inherent community structure
within the graph, which may negate the performance gains achieved from the
reduced footprint of hot vertices.
  In this work, we study existing reordering techniques and demonstrate the
inherent tension between reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices and
preserving original graph structure. We quantify the potential performance loss
due to disruption in graph structure for different graph datasets. We further
show that reordering techniques that employ fine-grain reordering significantly
increase misses in the higher level caches, even when they reduce misses in the
last-level cache.
  To overcome the limitations of existing reordering techniques, we propose
Degree-Based Grouping (DBG), a novel lightweight reordering technique that
employs a coarse-grain reordering to largely preserve graph structure while
reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices. Our evaluation on 40 combinations
of various graph applications and datasets shows that, compared to a baseline
with no reordering, DBG yields an average application speed-up of 16.8% vs
11.6% for the best-performing existing lightweight technique.

given luminosity (with $L_{70} \propto L_{6.7}^{0.6}$). The maser host clumps
have higher mass and higher FIR luminosities than the general Galactic
population of protostellar MYSOs. Using principal component analysis, we find

lack a detection in the MMB. Finding a 70$\mu$m flux density deficiency in

modification of the dispersion relation between energy and momentum for
photons, which can be probed with the time-lag (the arrival time delay between
light curves in different energy bands) of Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this
paper, by using the detailed time-delay measurements of GRB 160625B at
different energy bands, as well as 23 time-delay GRBs covering the redshifts
range of $z=0.168-2.5$ (which were measured at different energy channels from
the light curves), we propose an improved model-independent method (based on
the newly-compiled sample of $H(z)$ measurements) to probe the energy-dependent
velocity due to the modified dispersion relation for photons. In the framework
of a more complex and reasonable theoretical expression to describe the time
delays, our results imply that the intrinsic time lags can be better described
with more GRBs time delay data. More importantly, through direct fitting of the
time-delay measurements of a sample of GRBs, our limit on the LIV energy scale
is comparable to that with unknown constant for the intrinsic time lag, much

equation of state (EOS) and a simplified leptonic transport. As a
demonstration, we apply it to two types of PNS models with different internal
structures: fully-convective model and spherical-shell convection model. By
varying the spin rate of models, the rotational dependence of convection and
dynamo that operate inside the PNS is investigated. We find that, as a
consequence of turbulent transport by rotating stratified convection,
large-scale structures of flow and thermodynamic fields are developed in all
models. Depending on the spin rate and the convection zone depth, various
profiles of the large-scale structures are obtained, which can be physically
understood as steady-state solutions to the ""mean-field"" equation of motion.
Additionally to those hydrodynamic structures, the large-scale magnetic
component with $\mathcal{O}(10^{15})$ G is also spontaneously organized in
disordered tangled magnetic fields in all models. The higher the spin rate, the
stronger the large-scale magnetic component is built up. Intriguingly, as an
overall trend, the fully-convective models have a stronger large-scale magnetic
component than that in the spherical-shell convection models. The deeper the
convection zone extends, the larger the size of the convection eddies becomes.
As a result, the rotationally-constrained convection seems to be more easily
achieved in the fully-convective model, resulting in the higher efficiency of
the large-scale dynamo there. To gain a better understanding of the origin of
the diversity of NS's magnetic field, we need to study the PNS dynamo in a
wider parameter range.

uniquely as the sum of non-consecutive shifted Fibonacci numbers $\{F_n\}$,
where we take $F_1=1$ and $F_2=2$. This has been generalized for any Positive
Linear Recurrence Sequence (PLRS), which informally is a sequence satisfying a
homogeneous linear recurrence with a positive leading coefficient and
non-negative integer coefficients. These decompositions are generalizations of
base $B$ decompositions. In this and the follow-up paper, we provide two
approaches to investigate linear recurrences with leading coefficient zero,
followed by non-negative integer coefficients, with differences between indices
relatively prime (abbreviated ZLRR). The first approach involves generalizing
the definition of a legal decomposition for a PLRS found in Kolo\u{g}lu, Kopp,
Miller and Wang. We prove that every positive integer $N$ has a legal
decomposition for any ZLRR using the greedy algorithm. We also show that a
specific family of ZLRRs loses uniqueness of decompositions. The second
approach converts a ZLRR to a PLRR that has the same growth rate. We develop
the Zeroing Algorithm, a powerful helper tool for analyzing the behavior of
linear recurrence sequences. We use it to prove a very general result that
guarantees the possibility of conversion between certain recurrences, and
develop a method to quickly determine whether certain sequences diverge to
$+\infty$ or $-\infty$, given any real initial values. This paper investigates
the first approach.

directions of the driving force: step up and step down. The processes happen in
different adatom concentrations and differ in character. In this study we show
how the overall picture of the bunching process depends on the strength of
short range step-step repulsion. The repulsive interaction between steps,
controlled by an additional parameter, is introduced into the recently studied
atomistic scale model of vicinal crystal growth, based on cellular automata. It
is shown that the repulsion modifies bunching process in a different way,
depending on the direction of the destabilizing force. In particular, bunch
profiles, stability diagrams and time-scaling dependences of various bunch
properties are affected when the step-step repulsion increases. The repulsion
between steps creates a competition between two characteristic sizes - bunch
width and macrostep height, playing the role of the second length scale that
describes the step bunching phenomenon. A new characteristic time scale
dependent on the step-step repulsion parameter emerges as an effect of
interplay between (01) faceted macrosteps and (11) faceted bunches. The bunch
height being the major characteristic size of the bunches is not influenced
dramatically by the repulsion.

mixture of massive \emph{truth} (true information) and \emph{rumor} (false
information) flooded over social networks. Under such circumstances, it is very
essential to infer whether each claim (e.g., news, messages) is a truth or a
rumor, and identify their \emph{sources}, i.e., the users who initially spread
those claims. While most prior arts have been dedicated to the two tasks
respectively, this paper aims to offer the joint inference on truth/rumor and
their sources. Our insight is that a joint inference can enhance the mutual
performance on both sides.
  To this end, we propose a framework named SourceCR, which alternates between
two modules, i.e., \emph{credibility-reliability training} for truth/rumor
inference and \emph{division-querying} for source detection, in an iterative
manner. To elaborate, the former module performs a simultaneous estimation of
claim credibility and user reliability by virtue of an Expectation Maximization
algorithm, which takes the source reliability outputted from the latter module
as the initial input. Meanwhile, the latter module divides the network into two
different subnetworks labeled via the claim credibility, and in each subnetwork
launches source detection by applying querying of theoretical budget guarantee
to the users selected via the estimated reliability from the former module. The
proposed SourceCR is provably convergent, and algorithmic implementable with
reasonable computational complexity. We empirically validate the effectiveness
of the proposed framework in both synthetic and real datasets, where the joint
inference leads to an up to 35\% accuracy of credibility gain and 29\% source
detection rate gain compared with the separate counterparts.

Solar System are large eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These accelerated particles can generate radio
emission through various mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by a
variety of solar radio bursts with different shapes and characteristics in
dynamic spectra. Radio bursts directly associated with CMEs often show movement
in the direction of CME expansion. Here, we aim to determine the emission
mechanism of multiple moving radio bursts that accompanied a flare and CME that
took place on 14 June 2012. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nancay
Radioheliograph, combined with observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory
and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, to analyse these moving
radio bursts in order to determine their emission mechanism and
three-dimensional (3D) location with respect to the expanding CME. Results. In
using a 3D representation of the particle acceleration locations in relation to
the overlying coronal magnetic field and the CME propagation, for the first
time, we provide evidence that these moving radio bursts originate near the CME
flanks and some that are possible signatures of shock-accelerated electrons
following the fast CME expansion in the low corona. Conclusions. The moving
radio bursts, as well as other stationary bursts observed during the eruption,
occur simultaneously with a type IV continuum in dynamic spectra, which is not
usually associated with emission at the CME flanks. Our results show that
moving radio bursts that could traditionally be classified as moving type IVs

Therefore, the monitoring frequency has a significant influence on the success
of AMD therapy. However, the monitoring frequency of current treatment schemes
is not individually adapted to the patient and therefore often insufficient.
While a higher monitoring frequency would have a positive effect on the success
of treatment, in practice it can only be achieved with a home monitoring
solution. One of the key requirements of a home monitoring OCT system is a
computer-aided diagnosis to automatically detect and quantify pathological
changes using specific OCT-based biomarkers. In this paper, for the first time,
retinal scans of a novel self-examination low-cost full-field OCT (SELF-OCT)
are segmented using a deep learning-based approach. A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is utilized to segment the total retina as well as pigment
epithelial detachments (PED). It is shown that the CNN-based approach can
segment the retina with high accuracy, whereas the segmentation of the PED
proves to be challenging. In addition, a convolutional denoising autoencoder
(CDAE) refines the CNN prediction, which has previously learned retinal shape

analytically the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in a field close to its critical
point, we show that even in a paramagnetic phase the forcing of two real
replicas to an overlap small enough leads the model to a phase transition where
the symmetry between replicas is spontaneously broken. More importantly, this
phase transition is related to the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) critical line. In
the second part of the work, we exploit the phase transition in the overlap
between two real replicas to identify the critical line in a field in
finite-dimensional spin glasses. This is a notoriously difficult computational
problem, because of huge finite-size corrections. We introduce a new method of
analysis of Monte Carlo data for disordered systems, where the overlap between
two real replicas is used as a conditioning variate. We apply this analysis to
equilibrium measurements collected in the paramagnetic phase in a field, $h>0$

definitions to higher dimensions under appropriate assumptions, we evaluate
their small sphere limits along lightcone cuts shrinking towards the lightcone
vertex. The results in vacuum are conveniently represented in terms of the
electromagnetic decompositions of the Weyl tensor. We find that the limits at
presence of matter yield the stress tensor as expected, but the vacuum limits
are in general not proportional to the Bel-Robinson superenergy $Q$ in
dimensions $n>4$. The result defies the role of the Bel-Robinson superenergy as
characterising the gravitational energy in higher dimensions, albeit the fact
that it uniquely generalises. Surprisingly, the Hawking energy and the
Brown-York energy exactly agree upon the small sphere limits across all
dimensions. The new vacuum limit $\mathcal{Q}$, however, cannot be interpreted
as a gravitational energy because of its non-positivity. Furthermore, we also
give the small sphere limits of the Kijowski-Epp-Liu-Yau type energy in higher

formation in periodically driven disordered systems. In amorphous solids for
example, the athermal response to shear is due to localized plastic events
(soft spots). As shown recently by one of us, the plastic response to applied
shear can be rigorously described in terms of a directed network whose
transitions correspond to one or more soft spots changing states. The topology
of this graph depends on the interactions between soft-spots and when such
interactions are negligible, the resulting description becomes that of the
Preisach model. A first step in linking transition graph topology with the
underlying soft-spot interactions is therefore to determine the structure of
such graphs in the absence of interactions. Here we perform a detailed analysis
of the transition graph of the Preisach model. We highlight the important role
played by return point memory in organizing the graph into a hierarchy of loops
and sub-loops. Our analysis reveals that the topology of a large portion of
this graph is actually not governed by the values of the switching fields that
describe the individual hysteretic behavior of the individual elements, but by
a coarser parameter, a permutation $\rho$ which prescribes the sequence in
which the individual hysteretic elements change their states as the main
hysteresis loop is traversed. This in turn allows us to derive combinatorial
properties, such as the number of major loops in the transition graph as well
as the number of states $| \mathcal{R} |$ constituting the main hysteresis loop
and its nested subloops. We find that $| \mathcal{R} |$ is equal to the number
of increasing subsequences contained in the permutation $\rho$.

The

$\sim R^2\phi$. For the axion mass in the range $m_{a}\sim 10^{-11}-10^{-10}$
eV the solitonic core within neutron star and corresponding halo with size
$\sim 100$ km can exist. Therefore the effective contribution of $R^2$ term
grows inside the star and it leads to change of star parameters (namely, mass
and radius). We obtained the increase of star mass independent from central
density for wide range of masses. Therefore, maximal possible mass for given
equation of state grows. At the same time, the star radius increases not so
considerably in comparison with GR. {Hence, our model may predict possible
existence of supermassive compact stars with masses $M\sim 2.2-2.3M_\odot$ and
radii $R_{s}\sim 11$ km for realistic equation of state (we considered APR
equation of state). In General Relativity one can obtain neutron stars with
such characteristics only for unrealistic, extremely stiff equations of state.}
Note that this increase of mass occurs due to change of solution for scalar
curvature outside the star. In GR curvature drops to zero on star surface where
$\rho=p=0$. In the model under consideration the scalar curvature dumps more
slowly in comparison with vacuum $R^2$ gravity due to axion ""galo"" around the

These features, which have been called umbral filaments (UFs), differ in
morphology, evolution, and magnetic configuration from light bridges that are
usually observed to intrude in sunspots.
  To study an UF observed in the leading sunspot of active region NOAA 12529,
we have analyzed spectro-polarimetric observations taken in the photosphere
with the spectropolarimeter (SP) aboard the Hinode satellite. High-resolution
observations in the upper chromosphere and transition region taken with the
IRIS telescope and observations acquired by SDO/HMI and SDO/AIA have been used
to complement the spectro-polarimetric analysis.
  The results obtained from the inversion of the Hinode/SP measurements allow
us to discard the hypothesis that UFs are a kind of light bridge. In fact, we
find no field-free or low-field strength region cospatial to the observed UF.
In contrast, we detect in the structure Stokes profiles that indicate the
presence of strong horizontal fields, larger than 2500 G. Furthermore, a
significant portion of the UF has opposite polarity with respect to the hosting
umbra. In the upper atmospheric layers, we observe filaments being cospatial to
the UF in the photosphere. We interpret these findings as suggesting that the
UF could be the photospheric manifestation of a flux rope hanging above the
sunspot, which triggers the formation of penumbral-like filaments within the

  (IEEE TNNLS)",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel network pruning approach by information preserving of
pre-trained network weights (filters). Network pruning with the information
preserving is formulated as a matrix sketch problem, which is efficiently
solved by the off-the-shelf Frequent Direction method. Our approach, referred
to as FilterSketch, encodes the second-order information of pre-trained
weights, which enables the representation capacity of pruned networks to be
recovered with a simple fine-tuning procedure. FilterSketch requires neither
training from scratch nor data-driven iterative optimization, leading to a
several-orders-of-magnitude reduction of time cost in the optimization of
pruning. Experiments on CIFAR-10 show that FilterSketch reduces 63.3% of FLOPs
and prunes 59.9% of network parameters with negligible accuracy cost for
ResNet-110. On ILSVRC-2012, it reduces 45.5% of FLOPs and removes 43.0% of
parameters with only 0.69% accuracy drop for ResNet-50. Our code and pruned
models can be found at https://github.com/lmbxmu/FilterSketch.

is a molecular imaging methodology capable of mapping brain metabolites with
relatively high spatial resolution. Specificity is the main goal of such

molecular species. Here, we overcome this major limitation using a general
framework termed overlap-resolved CEST (orCEST) - a kind of spectrally-edited

CEST experiments targeting the central nervous system's primary excitatory
neurotransmitter, Glutamate (GluCEST) - is significantly contaminated by
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
CNS. Then, we harness the novel orCEST methodology to separate Glutamate and -

In-vivo orCEST experiments resolved the rat brain's primary neurotransmitters
and revealed changes in Glutamate and GABA levels upon water deprivation in
thirst-related areas. orCEST's features bode well for many applications in
neuroscience and biomedicine.

quantum emitters in cavities has important implications in quantum
technologies, e.g. for shaping the emitted photons waveform, for generating

preventing photon emission. Here we demonstrate the dynamical control of the
Purcell enhanced emission of a small ensemble of erbium ions doped into

on- and out of-resonance by controlling its length with sub-nanometer
precision, on a time scale more than two orders of magnitude faster than the
natural lifetime of the erbium ions. This allows us to shape in real time the
Purcell enhanced emission of the ions and to achieve full control over the
emitted photons' waveforms. This capability opens prospects for the realization
of efficient nanoscale quantum interfaces between solid-state spins and single
telecom photons with controllable waveform, and for the realization of quantum

develop its approximation bound for MESP, which improves the best-known bound

scintillation and water Cherenkov detectors can measure $\bar{\nu}_e$ flux
through inverse $\beta$ decay process. The flux of $\nu_e$ ($\bar{\nu}_e$) is a

different styles do not necessarily map one-on-one to different observers, the

the best data partition with a genetic algorithm. Therefore, each network can
learn a specific style of segmentation from grouped training data. We provide

and compare to methods in the literature. Simplifying the $\Psi$ estimate by
basing it on dust-corrected MUV can help to reduce the impact of template set
degeneracies on slope and intercept estimates, but act to bias the intrinsic
scatter estimate. We find that broad-band fluxes alone cannot constrain the
contribution from emission lines, implying that strong priors on the
emission-line contribution are required if no medium-band constraints are
available. Therefore at high redshifts, where emission lines contribute a
higher fraction of the broad-band flux, photometric fitting is sensitive to
$\Psi$ variations on short ($\sim$ 10 Myr) timescales. Priors on age imposed
with a constant (or rising) star formation history (SFH) do not allow one to
investigate a possible dependence of $\sigma$ on M$_{*}$ at high redshifts.
Delayed exponential SFHs have less constrained priors, but do not account for
$\Psi$ variations on short timescales, a problem if $\sigma$ increases due to
stochasticity of star formation. A simple SFH with current star formation
decoupled from the previous history is appropriate. We show that, for simple
exposure-time calculations assuming point sources, with low levels of dust, we

propose a new channel pruning method based on artificial bee colony algorithm

the combinations where the preserved channels are limited to a specific space,
thus the combinations of pruned structure can be significantly reduced. And
then, we formulate the search of optimal pruned structure as an optimization

lessen human interference. ABCPruner has been demonstrated to be more
effective, which also enables the fine-tuning to be conducted efficiently in an
end-to-end manner. The source codes can be available at

sector. We illustrate this by building an anisotropic extension of the well
known Tolman IV solution, providing in this way an exact and physically
acceptable solution that represents the behavior of compact objects. We show
that, in this way, it is not necessary to use the usual mimic constraint
conditions. Our solution is free from physical and geometrical singularities,
as expected. We have presented the main physical characteristics of our
solution both analytically and graphically and verified the viability of the
solution obtained by studying the usual criteria of physical acceptability.

A detailed study of background sources capable of producing apparently

a low probability ($10^{-3}$ or less). An additional strong argument against
the background hypothesis was provided by the observation of a high degree of
correlation between anomalous ring radii in the liquid and gaseous radiators in
the selected events.The results obtained are interpreted in this paper in terms
of observation of faster-than-light particles (tachyons). In the framework of

seven-dimensional spacetime, in which the brane has four non-compact dimensions
and two curled extra dimensions. The relevant aspects of the resulting model
are studied and the requirements to avoid the well known seesaw-like behavior
are discussed. We show that under certain conditions it is possible to
circumvent such a pathological behavior that characterizes most of the models

considering possible extensions of this model to a setup with multiple branes
and orbifold-like extra dimension. For this, we compute the consistency
conditions to be obeyed by this more general configuration as predicted by the
braneworld sum rules formalism. This study indicates the possibility of
exclusively positive brane tensions in the model.

greater than $1$, if two Riemannian metrics are conformal and have the same
geodesics up to a reparametrization, then one metric is a constant scaling of
the other one. In the present paper, we investigate the analogous property for
sub-Riemannian metrics. In particular, we prove that the analogous statement,
called the Weyl projective rigidity, holds either in real analytic category for
all sub-Riemannian metrics on distributions with a specific property of their
complex abnormal extremals, called minimal order, or in smooth category for all
distributions such that all complex abnormal extremals of their nilpotent
approximations are of minimal order. This also shows, in real analytic
category, the genericity of distributions for which all sub-Riemannian metrics
are Weyl projectively rigid and genericity of Weyl projectively rigid
sub-Riemannian metrics on a given bracket generating distributions. Finally,
this allows us to get analogous genericity results for projective rigidity of

detecting and removing polyps before they become cancerous. However,
colonoscopy is hampered by the fact that endoscopists routinely miss 22-28% of
polyps. While some of these missed polyps appear in the endoscopist's field of
view, others are missed simply because of substandard coverage of the
procedure, i.e. not all of the colon is seen. This paper attempts to rectify
the problem of substandard coverage in colonoscopy through the introduction of
the C2D2 (Colonoscopy Coverage Deficiency via Depth) algorithm which detects
deficient coverage, and can thereby alert the endoscopist to revisit a given
area. More specifically, C2D2 consists of two separate algorithms: the first
performs depth estimation of the colon given an ordinary RGB video stream;
while the second computes coverage given these depth estimates. Rather than
compute coverage for the entire colon, our algorithm computes coverage locally,
on a segment-by-segment basis; C2D2 can then indicate in real-time whether a
particular area of the colon has suffered from deficient coverage, and if so
the endoscopist can return to that area. Our coverage algorithm is the first
such algorithm to be evaluated in a large-scale way; while our depth estimation
technique is the first calibration-free unsupervised method applied to
colonoscopies. The C2D2 algorithm achieves state of the art results in the
detection of deficient coverage. On synthetic sequences with ground truth, it
is 2.4 times more accurate than human experts; while on real sequences, C2D2
achieves a 93.0% agreement with experts.

for precisely monitoring changes in lesion/tumor growth. This task, however, is
very challenging since manual segmentation is prohibitively time-consuming,
expensive, and requires professional knowledge. Current practices rely on an
imprecise substitute called response evaluation criteria in solid tumors
(RECIST). Although these markers lack detailed information about the lesion
regions, they are commonly found in hospitals' picture archiving and
communication systems (PACS). Thus, these markers have the potential to serve
as a powerful source of weak-supervision for 2D lesion segmentation. To
approach this problem, this paper proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN)
based weakly-supervised lesion segmentation method, which first generates the
initial lesion masks from the RECIST measurements and then utilizes
co-segmentation to leverage lesion similarities and refine the initial masks.
In this work, an attention-based co-segmentation model is adopted due to its
ability to learn more discriminative features from a pair of images.
Experimental results on the NIH DeepLesion dataset demonstrate that the
proposed co-segmentation approach significantly improves lesion segmentation
performance, e.g the Dice score increases about 4.0% (from 85.8% to 89.8%).

produced in heavy ion collision is a concept that is not uniquely defined and
subject to significant theoretical and experimental uncertainties. We argue
that a more robust connection between the initial-state sources with
final-state multiplicity could be established from the event-by-event
multiplicity correlation between two subevents separated in pseudorapidity,
$N_a$ vs $N_b$. This correlation is sensitive to two main types of centrality
fluctuations (CF): 1) particle production for each source $p(n)$ which smears
the relation between $V$ and $N_a$ used for experimental centrality, and 2)
decorrelations between the sources in the two subevents $V_b$ and $V_a$. The CF
is analyzed in terms of cumulants of $V_b$ and $N_b$ as a function of $N_a$,
i.e. experimental centrality is defined with $N_a$. We found that the mean
values $\langle V_b\rangle_{N_a}$ and $\langle N_b\rangle_{N_a}$ increase
linearly with $N_a$ in mid-central collisions, but flatten out in ultra-central
collisions. Such non-linear behavior is sensitive to the centrality resolution
of $N_a$. In the presence of centrality decorrelations, the scaled variances
$\langle(\delta V_b)^2\rangle/\langle V_b\rangle$ and $\langle(\delta
N_b)^2\rangle/\langle N_b\rangle$ are found to decrease linearly with $N_a$ in
mid-central collisions, while the $p(n)$ leads to another sharp decrease in the
ultra-central region. The higher-order cumulants of $V_b$ and $N_b$ show
interesting but rather complex behaviors which deserve further studies. Our
results suggest that one can use the cumulants of the two-dimensional
multiplicity correlation, especially the mean and variance, to constrain the
particle production mechanism as well as the longitudinal fluctuations of the
initial-state sources.

different hierarchies and types of dialog features. We propose the Variational
Hierarchical Dialog Autoencoder (VHDA) for modeling the complete aspects of
goal-oriented dialogs, including linguistic features and underlying structured
annotations, namely speaker information, dialog acts, and goals. The proposed
architecture is designed to model each aspect of goal-oriented dialogs using
inter-connected latent variables and learns to generate coherent goal-oriented
dialogs from the latent spaces. To overcome training issues that arise from
training complex variational models, we propose appropriate training
strategies. Experiments on various dialog datasets show that our model improves
the downstream dialog trackers' robustness via generative data augmentation. We
also discover additional benefits of our unified approach to modeling
goal-oriented dialogs: dialog response generation and user simulation, where
our model outperforms previous strong baselines.

derive cluster ages assuming single stellar populations, and secondly, to

sequence, subgiant and red giant branches, and to derive their age differences.
Based on a combination of UV and optical filters used in this project, we apply
the Gaussian mixture models to distinguish the multiple stellar populations.
Applying statistical isochrone fitting, we derive self-consistent ages,
distances, metallicities, and reddening values for the sample clusters. An
average of $12.3\pm0.4$ Gyr was obtained both using Dartmouth and BaSTI
(accounting atomic diffusion effects) isochrones, without a clear distinction
between the moderately metal-poor and the more metal-rich bulge clusters,
except for NGC 6717 and the inner halo NGC 6362 with $\sim 13.5$ Gyr. We
derived a weighted mean age difference between the multiple populations hosted
by each globular cluster of $41\pm170$ Myr adopting canonical He abundances;
whereas for higher He in 2G stars, this difference reduces to $17\pm170$ Myr,
but with individual uncertainties of $500$ Myr.

the aid of artificial noise. Due to a lack of the closed-form expression for
secrecy rate (SR) in secure PSM systems, it is hard to optimize the RAS. To
address this issue, the cut-off rate is used as an approximation of the SR.
Further, two low-complexity RAS schemes for maximizing SR, called Max-SR-L and
Max-SR-H, are derived in the low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions,
respectively. Due to the fact that the former works well in the low SNR region
but becomes worse in the medium and high SNR regions while the latter also has
the similar problem, a novel RAS strategy Max-SR-A is proposed to cover all SNR
regions. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SR-H and Max-SR-L
schemes approach the optimal SR performances of the exhaustive search (ES) in
the high and low SNR regions, respectively. In particular, the SR performance
of the proposed Max-SR-A is close to that of the optimal ES and better than
that of the random method in almost all SNR regions.

are made by the rapid neutron capture process (or r process). For very
neutron-rich astrophysical conditions, such at those found in the tidal ejecta
of neutron stars, nuclear fission determines the r-process endpoint, and the
fission fragment yields shape the final abundances of $110\le A \le 170$
nuclei. The knowledge of fission fragment yields of hundreds of nuclei
inhabiting very neutron-rich regions of the nuclear landscape is thus crucial
for the modeling of heavy-element nucleosynthesis.
  $\textbf{Purpose}$ In this study, we propose a model for the fast calculation
of fission fragment yields based on the concept of shell-stabilized
prefragments defined with help of the nucleonic localization functions.
  $\textbf{Methods}$ To generate realistic potential energy surfaces and
nucleonic localizations, we apply Skyrme Density Functional Theory. The
distribution of the neck nucleons among the two prefragments is obtained by
means of a statistical model.
  $\textbf{Results}$ We benchmark the method by studying the fission yields of
$^{178}$Pt, $^{240}$Pu, $^{254}$Cf, and $^{254,256,258}$Fm and show that it
satisfactorily explains the experimental data. We then make predictions for
$^{254}$Pu and $^{290}$Fm as two representative cases of fissioning nuclei that
are expected to significantly contribute during the r-process nucleosynthesis
occurring in neutron star mergers.
  $\textbf{Conclusions}$ The proposed framework provides an efficient
alternative to microscopic approaches based on the evolution of the system in a
space of collective coordinates all the way to scission. It can be used to
carry out global calculations of fission fragment distributions across the
r-process region.

people is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and the primary prevention of SCD
is with an implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). Concerning the
incidence of appropriate ICD therapy and the complications associated with ICD
implantation and discharge, patients with implanted ICDs are closely monitored
and interrogation reports are generated from clinical consultations. Methods:
In this study, we compared the performance of structured device data and
unstructured interrogation reports for extracting information of ICD therapy
and heart rhythm. We sampled 687 reports with a gold standard generated through
manual chart review. A rule-based natural language processing (NLP) system was
developed using 480 reports and the information in the corresponding device
data was aggregated for the task. We compared the performance of the NLP system
with information aggregated from structured device data using the remaining 207
reports. Results: The rule-based NLP system achieved F-measure of 0.92 and 0.98
for ICD therapy and heart rhythm while the performance of aggregating device
data was significantly lower with F-measure of 0.78 and 0.45 respectively.
Limitations of using only structured device data include no differentiation of
real events from management events, data availability, and disparate
perspectives of vendor and data granularity while using interrogation reports
needs to overcome non-representative keyword/pattern and contextual errors.
Conclusions: Extracting phenotyping information from data generated in
real-world requires the incorporation of medical knowledge. It is essential to
analyze, compare, and harmonize multiple data sources for real-world evidence
generation.

data from 40 low-dose chest CT scans, simulating acquisitions at 10%, 25% and
50% dose and reconstructing the scans at 1.0mm and 2.0mm slice thickness. A 3D
generative adversarial network (GAN) was used to simultaneously normalize
reduced dose, thick slice (2.0mm) images to normal dose (100%), thinner slice
(1.0mm) images. We evaluated the normalized image quality using peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) and Learned
Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Our GAN improved perceptual
similarity by 35%, compared to a baseline CNN method. Our analysis also shows
that the GAN-based approach led to a significantly smaller error (p-value <

could be used to normalize heterogeneous CT images and reduce the variability

two novel methods for the restoration of old degraded handwritten documents

heritage letters images is introduced. The ground truth data to train the
desired network is generated semi automatically involving a pragmatic
combination of color transformation, Gaussian mixture model based segmentation
and shape correction by using mathematical morphological operators. In the
first approach, a deep neural network has been used for text extraction from
the document image and later background reconstruction has been done using
Gaussian mixture modeling. But Gaussian mixture modelling requires to set
parameters manually, to alleviate this we propose a second approach where the
background reconstruction and foreground extraction (which which includes
extracting text with its original colour) both has been done using deep neural
network. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed systems perform well on
handwritten document images with severe degradations, even when trained with
small dataset. Hence, the proposed methods are ideally suited for digital
heritage preservation repositories. It is worth mentioning that, these methods
can be extended easily for printed degraded documents.

for possible target modifications and to reduce uncertainties in the final
cross-section results. A common technique used for these purposes is the
Nuclear Resonant Reaction Analysis (NRRA), which however requires that a narrow

with intra-parallel BiLSTM and inter-parallel BiLSTM components is introduced
to reduce performance sub-variances among different branches. Secondly, we
propose to use global context aware inter-intra cross-parallel BiLSTM to
further perceive the global contextual information. Finally, a spiral
multi-stage dual-path BiLSTM is proposed to iteratively refine the separation
results of the previous stages. All these networks take the mixed utterance of
two speakers and map it to two separate utterances, where each utterance
contains only one speaker's voice. For the objective, we propose to train the
network by directly optimizing the utterance level scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) in a permutation invariant training (PIT)
style. Our experiments on the public WSJ0-2mix data corpus results in 20.55dB
SDR improvement, 20.35dB SI-SDR improvement, 3.69 of PESQ, and 94.86\% of

solvers that are equipped with a set of cycle avoidance clauses. These cycle
avoidance clauses are generated in a pre-processing step and define various key
combinations that could open or close cycles without making the circuit
oscillating or stateful. In this paper, we show that this pre-processing step
has to generate cycle avoidance conditions on all cycles in a netlist,
otherwise, a missing cycle could trap the solver in an infinite loop or make it
exit with an incorrect key. Then, we propose several techniques by which the
number of cycles is exponentially increased as a function of the number of
inserted feedbacks. We further illustrate that when the number of feedbacks is
increased, the pre-processing step of the attack faces an exponential increase
in complexity and runtime, preventing the correct composition of cycle
avoidance clauses in a reasonable time. On the other hand, if the
pre-processing is not concluded, the attack formulated by the satisfiability
solver will either get stuck or exit with an incorrect key. Hence, when the
cyclic obfuscation under the conditions proposed in this paper is implemented,
it would impose an exponentially difficult problem for the satisfiability
solver based attacks.

residual dense block (f-RDB) to retain the ability of local feature fusion and
local residual learning of original RDB, which can reduce the computing efforts
at the same time. After fully learning local residual dense features, we
utilize the sum operation and several f-RDBs to define a new block termed
global dense block (GDB) by imitating the construction of dense blocks to learn
global dense residual features adaptively in a holistic way. Finally, we use
two convolution layers to construct a down-sampling block to reduce the global
feature size and extract deeper features. Extensive simulations show that FDRN
obtains the enhanced recognition results, compared with other related models.

networking and business logistics. A common property of graphs used in the
domain of graph analytics is a power-law distribution of vertex connectivity,
wherein a small number of vertices are responsible for a high fraction of all
connections in the graph. These richly-connected, hot, vertices inherently
exhibit high reuse. However, this work finds that state-of-the-art hardware
cache management schemes struggle in capitalizing on their reuse due to highly
irregular access patterns of graph analytics.
  In response, we propose GRASP, domain-specialized cache management at the
last-level cache for graph analytics. GRASP augments existing cache policies to
maximize reuse of hot vertices by protecting them against cache thrashing,
while maintaining sufficient flexibility to capture the reuse of other vertices
as needed. GRASP keeps hardware cost negligible by leveraging lightweight
software support to pinpoint hot vertices, thus eliding the need for
storage-intensive prediction mechanisms employed by state-of-the-art cache
management schemes. On a set of diverse graph-analytic applications with large
high-skew graph datasets, GRASP outperforms prior domain-agnostic schemes on
all datapoints, yielding an average speed-up of 4.2% (max 9.4%) over the
best-performing prior scheme. GRASP remains robust on low-/no-skew datasets,
whereas prior schemes consistently cause a slowdown.
