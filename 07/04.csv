energy is purely geometric in nature. We start by employing a well motivated
$f(Q,T)$ gravity model, $f(Q,T)=mQ^{n}+bT$ where $m,n$ and $b$ are model
parameters. Additionally we also assume the universe to be dominated by
pressure-less matter which yields a power law type scale factor of the form $%
a(t)=c_{2}(At+c_{1})^{\frac{1}{A}}$, where $A=\dfrac{3(8\pi +b)}{n(16\pi +3b)%
}$ and $c_{1}$ \& $c_{2}$ are just integration constants. To investigate the
cosmological viability of the model, constraints on the model parameters were
imposed from the updated 57 points of Hubble data sets and 580 points of union
2.1 compilation supernovae data sets. We have thoroughly investigated the
nature of geometrical dark energy mimicked by the parametrization of
$f(Q,T)=mQ^{n}+bT$ with the assistance of statefinder diagnostic in $\{s,r\}$
and $\{q,r\}$ planes and also performed the $Om$ -diagnostic analysis. The
present analysis makes it clear-cut that $f(Q,T)$ gravity can be promising in
addressing the current cosmic acceleration and therefore a suitable alternative
to the dark energy problem. Further studies in other cosmological areas are
therefore encouraging to further investigate the viability of $f(Q,T)$ gravity.

called ProtoryNet, based on a new concept of prototype trajectories. Motivated
by the prototype theory in modern linguistics, ProtoryNet makes a prediction by
finding the most similar prototype for each sentence in a text sequence and
feeding an RNN backbone with the proximity of each sentence to the
corresponding active prototype. The RNN backbone then captures the temporal
pattern of the prototypes, which we refer to as prototype trajectories.
Prototype trajectories enable intuitive and fine-grained interpretation of the
reasoning process of the RNN model, in resemblance to how humans analyze texts.
We also design a prototype pruning procedure to reduce the total number of
prototypes used by the model for better interpretability. Experiments on
multiple public data sets show that ProtoryNet is more accurate than the
baseline prototype-based deep neural net and reduces the performance gap
compared to state-of-the-art black-box models. In addition, after prototype
pruning, the resulting ProtoryNet models only need less than or around 20
prototypes for all datasets, which significantly benefits interpretability.
Furthermore, we report a survey result indicating that human users find
ProtoryNet more intuitive and easier to understand than other prototype-based
methods.

performance, and perform additional experiments which rule out causes not

the asymptotic theories of the resultant Pilot Estimation Based Local Linear

enable: 1) access library operations to be offloaded to storage system servers,
2) the independent evolution of access libraries and storage systems and 3)
fully leveraging of the existing load balancing, elasticity, and failure
management of distributed storage systems like Ceph. They also create more
opportunities to conduct storage server-local optimizations specific to storage
servers. For example, storage servers might include local key/value stores
combined with chunk stores that require different optimizations than a local
file system. As storage servers evolve to support new storage devices like
non-volatile memory, these server-local optimizations can be implemented while
minimizing disruptions to applications. We will report progress on the means by

representative candidates based on voters' preferences. It occurs in
applications ranging from politics (parliamentary elections) to the design of
modern computer applications (collaborative filtering, dynamic Q&A platforms,
diversifying search results). All these applications share the problem of
identifying a representative subset of alternatives -- and the study of
multi-winner voting is the principled analysis of this task.
  This book provides a thorough and in-depth look at multi-winner voting based
on approval preferences. One speaks of approval preferences if voters express
their preferences by providing a set of candidates they approve. Approval
preferences thus separate candidates in approved and disapproved ones, a
simple, binary classification. The corresponding multi-winner voting rules are
called approval-based committee (ABC) rules. Due to the simplicity of approval
preferences, ABC rules are widely suitable for practical use.
  Recent years have seen a rising interest in ABC voting. While multi-winner
voting has been originally a topic studied by economists and political
scientists, a significant share of recent progress has occurred in the field of
computational social choice. This discipline is situated in the intersection of
artificial intelligence, computer science, economics, and (to a lesser degree)
political science, combining insights and methods from these distinct fields.
The goal of this book is to present fundamental concepts and results for ABC
voting and to discuss the recent advances in computational social choice. The
main focus is on axiomatic analysis, algorithmic results, and relevant
applications.

exposure on outcomes is mediated through intermediate variables. Although many
applications involve longitudinal data, the existing methods are not directly
applicable to settings where the mediator and outcome are measured on sparse
and irregular time grids. We extend the existing causal mediation framework
from a functional data analysis perspective, viewing the sparse and irregular
longitudinal data as realizations of underlying smooth stochastic processes. We
define causal estimands of direct and indirect effects accordingly and provide
corresponding identification assumptions. For estimation and inference, we
employ a functional principal component analysis approach for dimension
reduction and use the first few functional principal components instead of the
whole trajectories in the structural equation models. We adopt the Bayesian
paradigm to accurately quantify the uncertainties. The operating
characteristics of the proposed methods are examined via simulations. We apply
the proposed methods to a longitudinal data set from a wild baboon population
in Kenya to investigate the causal relationships between early adversity,
strength of social bonds between animals, and adult glucocorticoid hormone
concentrations. We find that early adversity has a significant direct effect (a
9-14% increase) on females' glucocorticoid concentrations across adulthood, but
find little evidence that these effects were mediated by weak social bonds.

using pristine graphene aerogel intends to avoid the complex processing steps
and the use of toxic chemicals in the ink formulation and lower the
concentration of other additive components. Thus, a higher loading of active
functional material in the printable ink is achieved. The aerogel ink directly
employed to write the interdigitated {\mu}-SCs devices on a flexible polyimide
substrate at room temperature via inkjet printing. The electrochemical
performance measured using the organic ionic liquid in the voltage range of 0-1
volt. These printed {\mu}-SCs showed an areal capacity of 55 {\mu}F/cm2 at a
current density of 6 micro-amp/cm2. The printed devices showed good stability,
with ~80% of capacity retention after 10,000 cycles. Contrary to the
graphene-based {\mu}-SCs, the aerogel micro-supercapacitors do not show a
significant distortion in the CV scan even at a very high scan rate of ~2Vs-1.
Thus, we propose graphene aerogel as promising electrode material for

of solids, where otherwise homogeneous flow becomes localized in narrow
micrometer-scale bands. Shear bands have broad implications for materials
processing and failure under dynamic loading in a wide variety of material
systems ranging from metals to rocks. This year marks 75 years since the
publication of Zener and Hollomon's pioneering work on shear bands which is
widely credited with drawing the attention of the mechanics community to shear
bands and related localization phenomena. There has since been significant
experimental and theoretical investigation into the onset of shear banding.
Yet, given the extremely small length and time scales associated with band
development, several challenges persist in studying the evolution of single
bands. Recent full-field displacement measurements, coupled with numerical
modeling, have only begun to ameliorate this problem. This article summarizes
our present understanding of plastic flow dynamics around single shear bands
and the subsequent transition to fracture, with special applications to
materials processing. We begin with a semi-historical look at some of Zener's
early ideas on shear bands and discuss recent advances in experimental methods
for mapping localized flow during band formation, including direct \emph{in
situ} imaging as well as \emph{ex situ}/post-mortem analyses. Classical
theories are revisited in the light of recently published experimental data.
Shear bands exhibit a wealth of complex flow characteristics that bear striking
resemblance to boundary layer phenomena in fluid flows. It is hoped that these
will help further our understanding of shear band dynamics, the subsequent
transition to fracture, and lead to practical `control' strategies for
suppressing shear band-driven failures in processing applications.

(MC) systems in cylindrical environments is of particular interest for
applications such as micro-fluidics and targeted drug delivery in blood
vessels. Therefore, the accurate modeling of the corresponding MC channel is of
high importance. The propagation of particles in these systems is caused by a
combination of diffusion and flow with a parabolic velocity profile, i.e.,
laminar flow. The propagation characteristics of the particles can be
categorized into three different regimes: The flow dominant regime where the
influence of diffusion on the particle transport is negligible, the dispersive
regime where diffusion has a much stronger impact than flow, and the mixed
regime where both effects are important. For the limiting regimes, i.e., the
flow dominant and dispersive regimes, there are well-known solutions and
approximations for particle transport. In contrast, there is no general
analytical solution for the mixed regime, and instead, approximations,
numerical techniques, and particle based simulations have been employed. In
this paper, we develop a general model for the advection-diffusion problem in
cylindrical environments which provides an analytical solution applicable in
all regimes. The modeling procedure is based on a transfer function approach
and the main focus lies on the incorporation of laminar flow into the
analytical model. The properties of the proposed model are analyzed by
numerical evaluation for different scenarios including the uniform and point
release of particles. We provide a comparison with particle based simulations
and the well-known solutions for the limiting regimes to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed analytical model.

aim to address the possible unstable end behaviors of a suspension bridge

chord-wise direction is modeled through a piston-theoretic approximation, which
provides both weak (frictional) dissipation and non-conservative forces. The
long-time behavior of solutions is analyzed from various points of view.
Compact global attractors, as well as fractal exponential attractors, are
constructed using the recent quasi-stability theory. The non-conservative
nature of the dynamics requires the direct construction of a uniformly
absorbing ball, and this relies on the superlinearity of the stretching. For
some parameter ranges, the non-triviality of the attractor is shown through the
spectral analysis of the stationary linearized (non self-adjoint) equation and
the existence of multiple unimodal solutions is shown. Several stability
results, obtained through energy estimates under various smallness conditions

existence of a finite set of determining modes for the dynamics is
demonstrated, justifying the usual modal truncation in engineering for the

designing and optimising large scale structure surveys. To predict the
performance of such surveys, the Fisher matrix formalism is frequently used as
a fast and easy way to compute constraints on cosmological parameters. Among
them lies the study of the properties of dark energy which is one of the main
goals in modern cosmology. As so, a metric for the power of a survey to
constrain dark energy is provided by the Figure of merit (FoM). This is defined
as the inverse of the surface contour given by the joint variance of the dark
energy equation of state parameters $\{w_0,w_a\}$ in the
Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parameterisation, which can be evaluated from the
covariance matrix of the parameters. This covariance matrix is obtained as the
inverse of the Fisher matrix. Inversion of an ill-conditioned matrix can result
in large errors on the covariance coefficients if the elements of the Fisher

is a metric providing a mathematical lower limit to the required precision for
a reliable inversion, but it is often too stringent in practice for Fisher
matrices with size larger than $2\times2$. In this paper we propose a general
numerical method to guarantee a certain precision on the inferred constraints,
like the FoM. It consists on randomly vibrating (perturbing) the Fisher matrix
elements with Gaussian perturbations of a given amplitude, and then evaluating
the maximum amplitude that keeps the FoM within the chosen precision. The steps
used in the numerical derivatives and integrals involved in the calculation of
the Fisher matrix elements can then be chosen accordingly in order to keep the
precision of the Fisher matrix elements below this maximum amplitude...

In this task, vehicles need to navigate in narrow, crowded and GPS-denied
parking lots. Accurate localization ability is of great importance. Traditional
visual-based methods suffer from tracking lost due to texture-less regions,
repeated structures, and appearance changes. In this paper, we exploit robust
semantic features to build the map and localize vehicles in parking lots.
Semantic features contain guide signs, parking lines, speed bumps, etc, which
typically appear in parking lots. Compared with traditional features, these
semantic features are long-term stable and robust to the perspective and
illumination change. We adopt four surround-view cameras to increase the
perception range. Assisting by an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and wheel
encoders, the proposed system generates a global visual semantic map. This map
is further used to localize vehicles at the centimeter level. We analyze the
accuracy and recall of our system and compare it against other methods in real
experiments. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practicability of the proposed
system by the autonomous parking application.

probabilistic analysis to inverse problems such as system identification and
damage diagnosis. In this study, a physics-based recurrent neural network model
is designed that is able to learn the dynamics of linear and nonlinear multiple
degrees of freedom systems given a ground motion. The model is able to estimate
a complete set of responses, including displacement, velocity, acceleration,
and internal forces. Compared to the most advanced counterparts, this model
requires a smaller number of trainable variables while the accuracy of
predictions is higher for long trajectories. In addition, the architecture of
the recurrent block is inspired by differential equation solver algorithms and
it is expected that this approach yields more generalized solutions. In the
training phase, we propose multiple novel techniques to dramatically accelerate
the learning process using smaller datasets, such as hardsampling, utilization
of trajectory loss function, and implementation of a trust-region approach.
Numerical case studies are conducted to examine the strength of the network to
learn different nonlinear behaviors. It is shown that the network is able to
capture different nonlinear behaviors of dynamic systems with very high
accuracy and with no need for prior information or very large datasets.

inverse of a rank-$k$ correction of some matrix can be computed by doing a
rank-k correction to the inverse of the original matrix. This identity is
crucial to accelerate the matrix inverse computation when the matrix involves
correction. Many scientific and engineering applications have to deal with this
matrix inverse problem after updating the matrix, e.g., sensitivity analysis of
linear systems, covariance matrix update in kalman filter, etc. However, there
is no similar identity in tensors. In this work, we will derive the

identity for tensors with moore-penrose generalized inverse by utilizing
orthogonal projection of the correction tensor part into the original tensor

sherman-morrison-woodbury identity for tensors, we can perform sensitivity

the solution of a multilinear system. Several numerical examples are also

experience additional tangential and rolling constraints, require an average of
1.5 - 2 fewer particle contacts as compared to smooth colloids, in order to
generate the same shear thickening strength. This is because the surface
roughness enhances geometric friction in a way that the rough colloids do not
experience a large change in the free volume near the jamming point. In
contrast, smooth colloids must undergo significant reduction in the free volume

ellipticities have been incorporated into the analysis, necessitating a hybrid
model of non-linear scales that blends perturbative and non-perturbative
approaches, and an assessment of contributions by astrophysical effects. All
weak lensing signals are measured consistently via Fourier-space statistics
that are insensitive to the survey mask and display low levels of mode mixing.
The calibration of photometric redshift distributions and multiplicative
gravitational shear bias has been updated, and a more complete tally of
residual calibration uncertainties is propagated into the likelihood. A
dedicated suite of more than 20000 mocks is used to assess the performance of
covariance models and to quantify the impact of survey geometry and spatial
variations of survey depth on signals and their errors. The sampling
distributions for the likelihood and the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit statistic
have been validated, with proposed changes to the number of degrees of freedom.
Standard weak lensing point estimates on $S_8=\sigma_8\,(\Omega_{\rm
m}/0.3)^{1/2}$ derived from its marginal posterior are easily misinterpreted to
be biased low, and an alternative estimator and associated credible interval
have been proposed. Known systematic effects pertaining to weak lensing
modelling and inference are shown to bias $S_8$ by no more than 0.1 standard
deviations, with the caveat that no conclusive validation data exist for models
of intrinsic galaxy alignments. Compared to the previous KiDS analyses, $S_8$
constraints are expected to improve by 20% for weak lensing alone and by 29%
for the joint analysis. [abridged]

effective number density of $6.17$ galaxies per square arcminute. We quantify
the accuracy of the spatial, temporal, and flux-dependent point-spread function

Through a series of two-point null-tests, we validate the shear estimates,

The PSF residuals are detected in the highest-redshift bins, originating from
object selection and/or weight bias. The amplitude is, however, shown to be
sufficiently low and within our stringent requirements. With a shear-ratio
null-test, we verify the expected redshift scaling of the galaxy-galaxy lensing

knowledge of the redshift distribution of all sources. The clustering-redshift
technique exploits the angular cross-correlation of a target galaxy sample with
unknown redshifts and a reference sample with known redshifts, and is an
attractive alternative to colour-based methods of redshift calibration. We test
the performance of such clustering redshift measurements using mock catalogues
that resemble the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS). These mocks are created from the
MICE simulation and closely mimic the properties of the KiDS source sample and
the overlapping spectroscopic reference samples. We quantify the performance of
the clustering redshifts by comparing the cross-correlation results with the
true redshift distributions in each of the five KiDS photometric redshift bins.
Such a comparison to an informative model is necessary due to the
incompleteness of the reference samples at high redshifts. Clustering mean
redshifts are unbiased at $|\Delta z|<0.006$ under these conditions. The
redshift evolution of the galaxy bias can be reliably mitigated at this level
of precision using auto-correlation measurements and self-consistency
relations, and will not become a dominant source of systematic error until the
arrival of Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. Using redshift distributions from a
direct colour-based estimate instead of the true redshift distributions as a
model for comparison with the clustering redshifts increases the biases in the
mean to up to $|\Delta z|\sim0.04$. This indicates that the interpretation of
clustering redshifts in real-world applications will require more sophisticated
(parameterised) models of the redshift distribution in the future. If such
better models are available, the clustering-redshift technique promises to be a
highly complementary alternative to other methods of redshift calibration.

approaches to detect anomalies: directly comparing in the input space or,
instead, working in the latent space. In order to facilitate general search

correlation regularization are also studied. We find that the naive
mass-decorrelated VAEs fail at maintaining proper detection performance, by
assigning higher probabilities to some anomalous samples. To build a performant
mass-decorrelated anomalous jet tagger, we propose the Outlier Exposed VAE
(OE-VAE), for which some outlier samples are introduced in the training process
to guide the learned information. OE-VAEs are employed to achieve two goals at

jet mass from the anomaly score. We succeed in reaching excellent results from

the Kondo effect is sensitive to the presence of spin impurities. Here we use

progenitor and explosion process of these energetic events. The modeling of
these data requires the exploration of very high dimensional posterior
probabilities with expensive radiative transfer codes. Even modest
parametrizations of supernovae contain more than ten parameters and a detailed
exploration demands at least several million function evaluations. Physically
realistic models require at least tens of CPU minutes per evaluation putting a
detailed reconstruction of the explosion out of reach of traditional
methodology. The advent of widely available libraries for the training of
neural networks combined with their ability to approximate almost arbitrary
functions with high precision allows for a new approach to this problem.
Instead of evaluating the radiative transfer model itself, one can build a
neural network proxy trained on the simulations but evaluating orders of
magnitude faster. Such a framework is called an emulator or surrogate model. In
this work, we present an emulator for the TARDIS supernova radiative transfer
code applied to Type Ia supernova spectra. We show that we can train an
emulator for this problem given a modest training set of a hundred thousand
spectra (easily calculable on modern supercomputers). The results show an
accuracy on the percent level (that are dominated by the Monte Carlo nature of
TARDIS and not the emulator) with a speedup of several orders of magnitude.

assigning a more general random value to each loop. The operator $e^{i \beta
N(z)}$ remains primary with conformal dimension $\frac {\lambda}{10}(1 -
\phi(\beta))$, where $\phi(\beta)$ is the characteristic function of the
probability distribution used to assign random values to each loop. Using
recent results we compute in closed form the exact two-point functions in the
upper half-plane and four-point functions in the full plane of this very
general class of operators. These correlation functions depend analytically on
the parameters $\lambda, \beta_i, z_i$, and on the characteristic function
$\phi(\beta)$. They satisfy the conformal Ward identities and are crossing
symmetric. As in previous work, the conformal block expansion of the four-point
function reveals the existence of additional and as-yet uncharacterized
conformal primary operators.

problem in astrophysics. The number of complex mechanisms involved in the
process of star cluster formation, such as turbulence, magnetic fields and
stellar feedback, make understanding and modeling the IMF a challenging task.
In this paper, we aim to assert the importance of stellar heating feedback in
the star cluster formation process and its effect on the shape of the IMF. We
use an analytical sub-grid model to implement the radiative feedback in fully
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster
formation, with the ultimate objective of obtaining numerical convergence on
the IMF. We compare a set of MHD adaptive-mesh-refinement (AMR) simulations
with three different implementations of the heating of the gas: 1) a polytropic
equation of state (EOS), 2) a spherically symmetric stellar heating feedback,
and 3) our newly developed polar heating model that takes into account the
geometry of the accretion disc and the resulting shielding of stellar radiation
by dust. For each of the three heating models, we analyse the distribution of
stellar masses formed in ten molecular cloud simulations with different
realizations of the turbulence to obtain a statistically representative IMF. We
conclude that stellar heating feedback has a profound influence on the number
of stars formed and plays a crucial role in controlling the IMF. We find that
the simulations with the polar heating model achieve the best convergence on
the observed IMF.

binding of modes whose stability can be traced back to that of convectional
edge states. The reduced dimensionality of these objects renders the
possibility of arranging them in distinct geometries, such as arrays that
branch or terminate in the bulk. We show that the prospect of hybridizing the
modes in such new kinds of channels poses profound opportunities in a dynamical
context. In particular, we find that creating junctions of $\pi$-flux chains or
extending them as function of time can induce transistor and stop-and-go

extended defect array can be actively biased. Discussing these physical effects

evolution. Density variations are seeded and amplified by gas motion, but the
exact nature of this motion is unknown across spatial scale and galactic
environment. Although dense star-forming gas likely emerges from a combination
of instabilities, convergent flows, and turbulence, establishing the precise
origin is challenging because it requires quantifying gas motion over many
orders of magnitude in spatial scale. Here we measure the motion of molecular
gas in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxy NGC 4321, assembling observations
that span an unprecedented spatial dynamic range ($10^{-1}{-}10^3$ pc). We
detect ubiquitous velocity fluctuations across all spatial scales and galactic
environments. Statistical analysis of these fluctuations indicates how
star-forming gas is assembled. We discover oscillatory gas flows with
wavelengths ranging from $0.3{-}400$ pc. These flows are coupled to
regularly-spaced density enhancements that likely form via gravitational
instabilities. We also identify stochastic and scale-free velocity and density
fluctuations, consistent with the structure generated in turbulent flows. Our
results demonstrate that ISM structure cannot be considered in isolation.
Instead, its formation and evolution is controlled by nested, interdependent
flows of matter covering many orders of magnitude in spatial scale.

higher-ionization nebular emission lines and absorption features. We
successfully observe the OIII]1666 and CIII]909 collisionally excited emission
lines and the HeII1640 recombination feature, as well as the resonant CIV1550
doublet either in emission or P-Cygni. We compare the observed spectral

with the observational and physical properties of the LAEs. In particular, the
mean spectra of LAEs with larger Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths, fainter UV
magnitudes, bluer UV spectral slopes and lower stellar masses show the
strongest nebular emission. The line ratios of these lines are similar to those
measured in the spectra of local metal-poor galaxies, while their equivalent
widths are weaker compared to the handful of extreme values detected in
individual spectra of z>2 galaxies. This suggests that weak UV features are

typical microstate, the `cap' of the microstructure is exponentially close to
the horizon, making it an effective sub-Planckian correction to the black hole

microcanonical ensemble average over geometries, we find support for the claim

overdense environments at high-z characterized by abundant dust-obscured star
formation and stellar mass growth which rapidly give way to widespread
quenching. Data spanning the near- to far-infrared (IR) spectrum can directly
trace this transformation; however, such studies have largely been limited to
the massive galaxy end of cluster populations. In this work, we present ``total
light"" stacking techniques spanning 3.4-500{\mu}m aimed at revealing the total
cluster IR emission, including low mass members and potential intracluster
dust. We detail our procedures for WISE, Spitzer, and Herschel imaging,
including corrections to recover the total stacked emission in the case of high
fractions of detected galaxies. We apply our stacking techniques to 232
well-studied massive (log M200/Msun~13.8) clusters across multiple z bins,
recovering extended cluster emission at all wavelengths, typically at >5sigma.
We measure the averaged near- to far-IR radial profiles and SEDs, quantifying
the total stellar and dust content. The near-IR radial profiles are well
described by an NFW model with a high (c~7) concentration parameter. Dust
emission is similarly concentrated, albeit suppressed at small radii
(r<0.2Mpc). The measured SEDs lack warm dust, consistent with the colder SEDs
expected for low mass galaxies. We derive total stellar masses consistent with
the theoretical Mhalo-M_star relation and specific-star formation rates that
evolve strongly with redshift, echoing that of massive (log Mstar/Msun>10)
cluster galaxies. Separating out the massive galaxy population reveals that the
majority of cluster far-IR emission (~70-80%) is provided by the low mass
constituents, which differs from field galaxies. This effect may be a
combination of mass-dependent quenching and excess dust in low mass cluster
galaxies.

constraint-based causal discovery from observational time series in the
presence of latent confounders. We show that existing causal discovery methods
such as FCI and variants suffer from low recall in the autocorrelated time
series case and identify low effect size of conditional independence tests as
the main reason. Information-theoretical arguments show that effect size can
often be increased if causal parents are included in the conditioning sets. To
identify parents early on, we suggest an iterative procedure that utilizes
novel orientation rules to determine ancestral relationships already during the
edge removal phase. We prove that the method is order-independent, and sound
and complete in the oracle case. Extensive simulation studies for different
numbers of variables, time lags, sample sizes, and further cases demonstrate
that our method indeed achieves much higher recall than existing methods for
the case of autocorrelated continuous variables while keeping false positives
at the desired level. This performance gain grows with stronger
autocorrelation. At https://github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite we provide Python

self-consistently reproducing the properties of the SMG population in a
large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulation has not yet been achieved.
We use a scaling relation derived from previous simulations plus radiative
transfer calculations to predict the submm flux densities of simulated SMGs
drawn from cosmological simulations from the Illustris and IllustrisTNG
projects based on the simulated galaxies' star formation rates (SFRs) and dust
masses and compare the predicted number counts with observations. We find that
the predicted SMG number counts based on IllustrisTNG are significantly less
than observed (more than 1 dex at $S_{850} \gtrsim 4$ mJy). The simulation from
the original Illustris project yields more SMGs than IllustrisTNG: the
predicted counts are consistent with those observed at both $S_{850} \lesssim
5$ mJy and $S_{850} \gtrsim 9$ mJy and only a factor of $\sim 2$ lower than
observed at intermediate flux densities. The redshift distribution of SMGs with
$S_{850} > 3$ mJy in IllustrisTNG is consistent with the observed distribution,
whereas the Illustris redshift distribution peaks at significantly lower
redshift (1.5 vs. 2.8). We demonstrate that IllustrisTNG hosts fewer SMGs than
Illustris because in the former, high-mass ($M_{\star} \sim 10^{11} \,
\text{M}_{\odot}$) $z \sim 2-3$ galaxies have lower dust masses and SFRs than
in Illustris owing to differences in the sub-grid models for stellar or/and
active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback between the two simulations (we
unfortunately cannot isolate the specific cause(s) post hoc). Our results
demonstrate that because our method enables predicting SMG number counts in
post-processing with a negligible computational expense, SMGs can provide
useful constraints for tuning sub-grid models in future large-volume
cosmological simulations.

biodiversity decline, culminating in extinction events near the

ozone, possibly due to a global temperature rise. Here we study an alternative
possible cause for the postulated ozone drop: a nearby supernova explosion that
could inflict damage by accelerating cosmic rays that can deliver ionizing
radiation for up to $\sim 100$ kyr. We therefore propose that the end-Devonian
extinctions were triggered by supernova explosions at $\sim 20$ pc, somewhat
beyond the ""kill distance"" that would have precipitated a full mass extinction.
Such nearby supernovae are likely due to core-collapses of massive stars; these
are concentrated in the thin Galactic disk where the Sun resides. Detecting
either of the long-lived radioisotopes Sm-146 or Pu-244 in one or more
end-Devonian extinction strata would confirm a supernova origin, point to the
core-collapse explosion of a massive star, and probe supernova nucleosythesis.
Other possible tests of the supernova hypothesis are discussed.

Here $s,p,T$ and $l_T$ represent a sparsity parameter, model dimension,
sampling period and the separation of the change point from its parametric

logarithmic terms of $T,$ it allows the existence of limiting distributions.
These distributions are then derived as the {\it argmax} of a two sided

vanishing and non-vanishing jump size regimes, respectively. Thereby allowing
inference of the change point parameter in the high dimensional setting.

in the world. A lockdown for a period of 2 months, due to the pandemic, was
enough to cause a drop of 7% of the anthropogonic CO2 in the atmosphere. In
addition to the world in general, the excess of the anthropogonic CO2 emission
in the atmosphere has always been a threat to the oceans as well. Oceans play a
key role to buffer the greenhouse effect, but in the process, it becomes
warmer, more acidic, and less oxygenated. While there have already been
investigations done on the effect of pandemic on atmosphere, the question what
happens to oceans during the pandemic remains unanswered. The aim of this paper
is to study the pandemic's effect and the resultant reduction in CO2 emissions
on the productivity of the global oceans. Often Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a),
Particulate organic and inorganic carbon (PIC:POC) and sea surface
temperature(SST), are used to indicate the productivity of oceans. Herein,
satellite-derived estimates of the aforementioned parameters are used. Based on
these estimates, a drop in Chl-a (0.5 mgm-3) is observed off Alaska, North
Europe,South China and Southeast USA during the pandemic. CO2 reduction of 123
MtCO2 during the pandemic in China might have caused reduction in mean Chl-a by
around 5% (2.5 to 1.6 mgm-3). Reduction of Chl-a during the pandemic is mostly
associated with the reduction of PIC:POC. The pandemic demonstrates noticeable
effect on Chl-a and/or SST. A cooling response of 0.5 oC in mean SST is
observed over most of the coastal areas, especially off Alaska,north Indian
ocean and eastern Pacific. The decrease in the CO2 emissions in India by 30%
during the pandemic translates into a drop of mean SST in the north Indian
ocean by 5% (from 29.95 to 28.46 oC). All these suggest that maintaining global
activities as sustainable as the pandemic period, can help to recover the
oceans.

show that, under general assumptions and on average over all states, imperfect

  for COVID-19 trials",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  COVID-19 has fast-paced drug re-positioning for its treatment. This work
builds computational models for the same. The aim is to assist clinicians with
a tool for selecting prospective antiviral treatments. Since the virus is known
to mutate fast, the tool is likely to help clinicians in selecting the right
set of antivirals for the mutated isolate.
  The main contribution of this work is a manually curated database publicly
shared, comprising of existing associations between viruses and their
corresponding antivirals. The database gathers similarity information using the
chemical structure of drugs and the genomic structure of viruses. Along with
this database, we make available a set of state-of-the-art computational drug
re-positioning tools based on matrix completion. The tools are first analysed
on a standard set of experimental protocols for drug target interactions. The
best performing ones are applied for the task of re-positioning antivirals for
COVID-19. These tools select six drugs out of which four are currently under
various stages of trial, namely Remdesivir (as a cure), Ribavarin (in
combination with others for cure), Umifenovir (as a prophylactic and cure) and
Sofosbuvir (as a cure). Another unanimous prediction is Tenofovir alafenamide,
which is a novel tenofovir prodrug developed in order to improve renal safety
when compared to the counterpart tenofovir disoproxil. Both are under trail,
the former as a cure and the latter as a prophylactic. These results establish
that the computational methods are in sync with the state-of-practice. We also
demonstrate how the selected drugs change as the SARS-Cov-2 mutates over time,
suggesting the importance of such a tool in drug prediction.

customers are offered a personalized price based on features that are
predictive of their valuation of a product. It is desirable for this pricing
policy to be simple and interpretable, so it can be verified, checked for
fairness, and easily implemented. However, efforts to incorporate machine
learning into a pricing framework often lead to complex pricing policies which
are not interpretable, resulting in slow adoption in practice. We present a
customized, prescriptive tree-based algorithm that distills knowledge from a
complex black-box machine learning algorithm, segments customers with similar
valuations and prescribes prices in such a way that maximizes revenue while
maintaining interpretability. We quantify the regret of a resulting policy and
demonstrate its efficacy in applications with both synthetic and real-world

frequency interleaved digital-to-analog converters (FI-DACs). The technique is
applicable to high speed digital transceivers such as those used in coherent
optical communications. Although compensation of FI-DACs has been discussed
before in the technical literature, adaptive background techniques have not yet
been reported. The importance of the latter lies in their capability to
automatically compensate errors caused by process, voltage, and temperature
variations in the echnology (e.g., CMOS, SiGe, etc.) implementations of the
data converters, and therefore ensure high manufacturing yield. The key
ingredients of the proposed technique are a multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO) equalizer and the backpropagation algorithm used to adapt the
coefficients of the aforementioned equalizer. Simulations show that the
impairments of the analog signal path are accurately compensated and their
effect is essentially eliminated, resulting in a high performance transmitter
system.

angular diameters from photometric observations. They have various
astrophysical applications, such as the distance determination of eclipsing
binaries or the determination of exoplanet parameters. However, strong
discrepancies between the SBCRs still exist in the literature, in particular
for early and late-type stars. We aim to calibrate new SBCRs as a function of
the spectral type and the luminosity class of the stars. Our goal is also to
apply homogeneous criteria to the selection of the reference stars and in view
of compiling an exhaustive and up-to-date list of interferometric late-type
targets. We implemented criteria to select measurements in the JMMC Measured
Diameters Catalog (JMDC). We then applied additional criteria on the
photometric measurements used to build the SBCRs, together with stellar
characteristics diagnostics. We built SBCRs for F5/K7-II/III, F5/K7-IV/V,
M-II/III and M-V stars, with respective RMS of $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0022$ mag,
$\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0044$ mag, $\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0046$ mag, and
$\sigma_{F_{V}} = 0.0038$ mag. This results in a precision on the angular
diameter of 1.0\%, 2.0\%, 2.1\%, and 1.7\%, respectively. These relations cover
a large $V-K$ colour range of magnitude, from 1 to 7.5. Our work demonstrates
that SBCRs are significantly dependent on the spectral type and the luminosity
class of the star. Through a new set of interferometric measurements, we
demonstrate the critical importance of the selection criteria proposed for the
calibration of SBCR. Finally, using the Gaia photometry for our samples, we
obtained (G-K) SBCRs with a precision on the angular diameter between 1.1\% and

elastic and viscoelastic parameters, which characterize the arterial wall
behavior, in one-dimensional modeling of the human arterial hemodynamics. The
chosen uncertain parameters are modeled as random Gaussian-distributed
variables, making stochastic the system of governing equations. The proposed
methodology is initially validated on a model equation, presenting a thorough
convergence study which confirms the spectral accuracy of the stochastic
collocation method and the second-order accuracy of the IMEX finite volume
scheme chosen to solve the mathematical model. Then, univariate and
multivariate uncertain quantification analyses are applied to the a-FSI blood
flow model, concerning baseline and patient-specific single-artery test cases.
A different sensitivity is depicted when comparing the variability of flow rate
and velocity waveforms to the variability of pressure and area, the latter ones
resulting much more sensitive to the parametric uncertainties underlying the
mechanical characterization of vessel walls. Simulations performed considering
both the simple elastic and the more realistic viscoelastic constitutive law
show that the great uncertainty of the viscosity parameter plays a major role
in the prediction of pressure waveforms, enlarging the confidence interval of
this variable. In-vivo recorded patient-specific pressure data falls within the
confidence interval of the output obtained with the proposed methodology and
expectations of the computed pressures are comparable to the recorded
waveforms.

(J-PAS) will soon start to scan thousands of square degrees of the northern
extragalactic sky with a unique set of $56$ optical filters from a dedicated
$2.55$m telescope, JST, at the Javalambre Astrophysical Observatory. Before the
arrival of the final instrument (a 1.2 Gpixels, 4.2deg$^2$ field-of-view
camera), the JST was equipped with an interim camera (JPAS-Pathfinder),
composed of one CCD with a 0.3deg$^2$ field-of-view and resolution of 0.23
arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. To demonstrate the scientific potential of J-PAS, with the
JPAS-Pathfinder camera we carried out a survey on the AEGIS field (along the
Extended Groth Strip), dubbed miniJPAS. We observed a total of $\sim 1$
deg$^2$, with the $56$ J-PAS filters, which include $54$ narrow band (NB,
$\rm{FWHM} \sim 145$Angstrom) and two broader filters extending to the UV and
the near-infrared, complemented by the $u,g,r,i$ SDSS broad band (BB) filters.
In this paper we present the miniJPAS data set, the details of the catalogues
and data access, and illustrate the scientific potential of our multi-band
data. The data surpass the target depths originally planned for J-PAS, reaching
$\rm{mag}_{\rm {AB}}$ between $\sim 22$ and $23.5$ for the NB filters and up to
$24$ for the BB filters ($5\sigma$ in a $3$~arcsec aperture). The miniJPAS
primary catalogue contains more than $64,000$ sources extracted in the $r$
detection band with forced photometry in all other bands. We estimate the
catalogue to be complete up to $r=23.6$ for point-like sources and up to
$r=22.7$ for extended sources. Photometric redshifts reach subpercent precision
for all sources up to $r=22.5$, and a precision of $\sim 0.3$% for about half
of the sample. (Abridged)

simulations, and in observations, study this process and provide useful steps
for a better understanding of galaxy systems and their evolution. We aim at
exploring the streaming flow of galaxies onto groups using observational
peculiar velocity data. The effects of distance uncertainties are also analyzed
as well as the relation between the infall pattern and group and environment
properties.This work deals with analysis of peculiar velocity data and their
projection on the direction to group centers, to determine the mean galaxy
infall flow. We applied this analysis to the galaxies and groups extracted from
the Cosmicflows-3 catalog. We also use mock catalogs derived from numerical
simulations to explore the effects of distance uncertainties on the derivation
of the galaxy velocity flow onto groups. We determine the infalling velocity
field onto galaxy groups with cz < 0.033 using peculiar velocity data. We
measure the mean infall velocity onto group samples of different mass range,
and also explore the impact of the environment where the group reside. Well
beyond the group virial radius, the surrounding large-scale galaxy overdensity
may impose additional infalling streaming amplitudes in the range 200 to 400 km
s$^{-1}$. Also, we find that groups in samples with a well controlled galaxy
density environment show an increasing infalling velocity amplitude with group
mass, consistent with the predictions of the linear model. These results from
observational data are in excellent agreement with those derived from the mock
catalogs.

($-0.221 Z^{5/3}$ and $-0.021 Z \ln Z$ respectively) even in the lowest-rung or
local density approximation. We find that hydrogenic densities lead to
$E_x(N,Z) \approx -0.354 N^{2/3} Z$ (as known before only for $Z \gg N \gg 1$)
and $E_c \approx -0.02 N \ln N$. These asymptotic estimates are most correct
for atomic ions with large $N$ and $Z \gg N$, but we find that they are
qualitatively and semi-quantitatively correct even for small $N$ and for $N
\approx Z$. The large-$N$ asymptotic behavior of the energy is pre-figured in
small-$N$ atoms and atomic ions, supporting the argument that widely-predictive
approximate density functionals should be designed to recover the correct
asymptotics. It is shown that the exact Kohn-Sham correlation energy, when
calculated from the pure ground-state wavefunction, should have no contribution
proportional to $Z$ in the $Z\to \infty$ limit for any fixed $N$.

latent variables can be computationally challenging, due to the need for
marginalization over large or combinatorial sets. To circumvent this issue, one
typically resorts to sampling-based approximations of the true marginal,
requiring noisy gradient estimators (e.g., score function estimator) or
continuous relaxations with lower-variance reparameterized gradients (e.g.,
Gumbel-Softmax). In this paper, we propose a new training strategy which
replaces these estimators by an exact yet efficient marginalization. To achieve
this, we parameterize discrete distributions over latent assignments using
differentiable sparse mappings: sparsemax and its structured counterparts. In
effect, the support of these distributions is greatly reduced, which enables
efficient marginalization. We report successful results in three tasks covering
a range of latent variable modeling applications: a semisupervised deep
generative model, a latent communication game, and a generative model with a
bit-vector latent representation. In all cases, we obtain good performance
while still achieving the practicality of sampling-based approximations.

compression technique in which a compact model (student) is trained under the
supervision of a larger pretrained model or an ensemble of models (teacher).
Various techniques have been proposed since the original formulation, which
mimic different aspects of the teacher such as the representation space,
decision boundary, or intra-data relationship. Some methods replace the one-way
knowledge distillation from a static teacher with collaborative learning
between a cohort of students. Despite the recent advances, a clear
understanding of where knowledge resides in a deep neural network and an
optimal method for capturing knowledge from teacher and transferring it to
student remains an open question. In this study, we provide an extensive study
on nine different KD methods which covers a broad spectrum of approaches to
capture and transfer knowledge. We demonstrate the versatility of the KD
framework on different datasets and network architectures under varying
capacity gaps between the teacher and student. The study provides intuition for
the effects of mimicking different aspects of the teacher and derives insights
from the performance of the different distillation approaches to guide the
design of more effective KD methods. Furthermore, our study shows the
effectiveness of the KD framework in learning efficiently under varying
severity levels of label noise and class imbalance, consistently providing
generalization gains over standard training. We emphasize that the efficacy of
KD goes much beyond a model compression technique and it should be considered
as a general-purpose training paradigm which offers more robustness to common
challenges in the real-world datasets compared to the standard training

transversely polarized. Second, they are only sensitive to the so-called ERBL
region where GPDs are not much constrained by forward quark distributions.
Third, the skewness parameter $\xi$ is not related to the Bjorken $x_\text{Bj}$
variable, but to the size of the rapidity gap. We analyze different channels
($\rho_L^0\,\rho_{L/T}, \rho^0_L\,\omega_{L/T}$ and $\rho^0_L\,\pi$ production)
on nucleon and deuteron targets. The analysis is performed in the kinematical
domain where a large momentum transfer from the photon to the diffractively
produced vector meson introduces a hard scale (the virtuality of the exchanged
hard Pomeron). This enables the description of the hadronic part of the process
in the framework of collinear factorization of GPDs. We show that the
unpolarized cross sections depend very much on the parameterizations of both

with inclination the contact line is pinned at acute corners of the ridge. When

broadly defined as the spontaneous organization of multiple subunits (e.g.
macromolecules, particles) into ordered multi-unit structures. The vast
majority of equilibrium assembly processes give rise to two states: one
consisting of dispersed disassociated subunits, and the other, a bulk-condensed
state of unlimited size. This review focuses on the more specialized class of
{\it self-limiting assembly}, which describes equilibrium assembly processes
resulting in finite-size structures. These systems pose a generic and basic
question, how do thermodynamic processes involving non-covalent interactions
between identical subunits ``measure'' and select the size of assembled
structures? In this review, we begin with an introduction to the basic
statistical mechanical framework for assembly thermodynamics, and use this to
highlight the key physical ingredients that ensure equilibrium assembly will
terminate at finite dimensions. Then, we introduce examples of self-limiting
assembly systems, and classify them within this framework based on two broad
categories: {\it self-closing assemblies} and {\it open-boundary assemblies}.
These include well-known cases in biology and synthetic soft matter --
micellization of amphiphiles and shell/tubule formation of tapered subunits --
as well as less widely known classes of assemblies, such as short-range
attractive/long-range repulsive systems and geometrically-frustrated
assemblies. For each of these self-limiting mechanisms, we describe the
physical mechanisms that select equilibrium assembly size, as well as potential
limitations of finite-size selection. Finally, we discuss alternative
mechanisms for finite-size assemblies, and draw contrasts with the size-control
that these can achieve relative to self-limitation in equilibrium,
single-species assemblies.

spectrum is made possible by making use of the frequency dependence of such
gravitational lensing dispersions originating from the wave optics nature of
the propagation of gravitational waves. We first study the small-scale behavior
of the matter power spectrum in detail taking the so-called halo model approach
including effects of baryons and subhalos. We find that the matter power
spectrum at the wavenumber $k\sim 10^6h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ is mainly determined by
the abundance of dark low-mass halos with mass $1h^{-1}M_\odot \lesssim M
\lesssim 10^4h^{-1}M_\odot$ and is relatively insensitive to baryonic effects.
The matter power spectrum at this wavenumber is probed by gravitational lensing
dispersions of gravitational waves at frequencies of $f\sim 0.1-1$~Hz with
predicted signals of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$. We also find that primordial black
holes (PBHs) with $M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 0.1~M_\odot$ can significantly enhance
the matter power spectrum at $k \gtrsim 10^5h{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ due to both the
enhanced halo formation and the shot noise from PBHs. We find that
gravitational lensing dispersions at $f\sim 10-100$~Hz are particularly
sensitive to PBHs and can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude

initial impact force, greatest at the moment when breaking through the free

may reduce this high impact force. Here, we test this idea experimentally by
allowing two spheres to consecutively enter the water and measuring the forces
on the trailing sphere. We find that the impact acceleration reduction on the
trailing sphere depends on the dynamics of the cavity created by the first
sphere and the relative timing of the second sphere impact. These combined
effects are captured by the non-dimensional `Matryoshka' number, which
classifies the observed phenomena into four major regimes. In three of these
regimes, we find that the impact acceleration on the second sphere is reduced
by up to 78\% relative to impact on a quiescent water surface. Surprisingly, in
one of the regimes, the force on the trailing sphere is dramatically increased
by more than 400\% in the worst case observed. We explain how the various

localization maps from classifiers as supervision signals, and struggle to make
the localization maps capture more complete object content. Rather than
previous efforts that primarily focus on intra-image information, we address
the value of cross-image semantic relations for comprehensive object pattern
mining. To achieve this, two neural co-attentions are incorporated into the
classifier to complimentarily capture cross-image semantic similarities and
differences. In particular, given a pair of training images, one co-attention
enforces the classifier to recognize the common semantics from co-attentive
objects, while the other one, called contrastive co-attention, drives the
classifier to identify the unshared semantics from the rest, uncommon objects.
This helps the classifier discover more object patterns and better ground
semantics in image regions. In addition to boosting object pattern learning,
the co-attention can leverage context from other related images to improve
localization map inference, hence eventually benefiting semantic segmentation
learning. More essentially, our algorithm provides a unified framework that
handles well different WSSS settings, i.e., learning WSSS with (1) precise
image-level supervision only, (2) extra simple single-label data, and (3) extra
noisy web data. It sets new state-of-the-arts on all these settings,
demonstrating well its efficacy and generalizability. Moreover, our approach

  To alleviate the spatial encoding limitations of single-shot EPI by
developing multi-shot segmented EPI for ultra-high-resolution fMRI with reduced
ghosting artifacts from subject motion and respiration.
  Methods
  Segmented EPI can reduce readout duration and reduce acceleration factors,
however, the time elapsed between segment acquisitions (on the order of
seconds) can result in intermittent ghosting, limiting its use for fMRI. Here,
""FLEET"" segment ordering--where segments are looped over before slices--was
combined with a variable flip angle progression (VFA-FLEET) to improve
inter-segment fidelity and maximize signal for fMRI. Scaling a sinc pulse's
flip angle for each segment (VFA-FLEET-Sinc) produced inconsistent slice
profiles and ghosting, therefore, a recursive Shinnar-Le Roux (SLR) RF pulse
design was developed (VFA-FLEET-SLR) to generate unique pulses for every
segment that together produce consistent slice profiles and signals.
  Results
  The temporal stability of VFA-FLEET-SLR was compared against
conventional-segmented EPI and VFA-FLEET-Sinc at 3 T and 7 T. VFA-FLEET-SLR
showed reductions in both intermittent and stable ghosting compared to
conventional-segmented and VFA-FLEET-Sinc, resulting in improved image quality
with a minor trade-off in temporal SNR. Combining VFA-FLEET-SLR with
acceleration, we achieved a 0.6-mm isotropic acquisition at 7 T--without zoomed
imaging or partial Fourier--demonstrating reliable detection of BOLD responses
to a visual stimulus. To counteract the increased repetition time from
segmentation, simultaneous multi-slice VFA-FLEET-SLR was demonstrated using
RF-encoded controlled aliasing.
  Conclusions
  VFA-FLEET with a recursive RF pulse design supports acquisitions with low
levels of artifact and spatial blur, enabling fMRI at previously inaccessible
spatial resolutions with a ""full-brain"" field of view.

is learned by distilling from soft matching scores between the detected object
names and candidate phrases within an image-sentence pair, while the
image-sentence score function is supervised by ground-truth image-sentence
pairs. The design of such score functions removes the need of object detection
at test time, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. Without bells

space; and the second, from DeGroot's (1970) result concerning an additivity

Designing circuits in QCA technology with minimum costs such as cells count and
the area is very important. This paper presents novel structures of D-latch and

this work, we study the caveats of applying directly translated corpora for

a comparison of directly translated against curated Spanish SQuAD datasets on

exact phase excitation during the hydrodynamic propagation of localized
envelope solitons and breathers, which modulate a plane wave of constant

in intermediate water depth and pulsating Peregrine breathers in deep-water, we
show how these localized envelopes disintegrate while they evolve over a long
propagation distance when the initial phase shift is zero. By setting the
envelope phases to zero, the dark solitons will disintegrate into two gray-type
solitons and dispersive elements. In the case of the doubly-localized Peregrine
breather the maximal amplification is considerably retarded; however locally,
the shape of the maximal focused wave measured together with the respective
signature phase-shift are almost identical to the exact analytical Peregrine
characterization at its maximal compression location. The experiments,
conducted in two large-scaled shallow-water as well as deep-water wave

novel interpretation of RMs in the multi-agent setting explicitly encodes
required teammate interdependencies, allowing the team-level task to be
decomposed into sub-tasks for individual agents. We define such a notion of RM
decomposition and present algorithmically verifiable conditions guaranteeing
that distributed completion of the sub-tasks leads to team behavior

a natural approach to decentralized learning: agents may learn to accomplish
their sub-tasks while observing only their local state and abstracted
representations of their teammates. We accordingly propose a decentralized
q-learning algorithm. Furthermore, in the case of undiscounted rewards, we use
local value functions to derive lower and upper bounds for the global value

irrelevant, autonomously computable, and pseudo-irrelevant with respect to a
given extractor. Finally, we propose algorithms to detect pseudo-irrelevant

produces deformation fields that modify images of diseased patients to resemble
images of healthy patients. We validate the method studying chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) evidence in chest x-rays (CXRs) and Alzheimer's
disease (AD) evidence in brain MRIs. When extracting disease evidence in
longitudinal data, we show compelling results against a baseline producing
difference maps. DeFI-GAN also highlights disease biomarkers not found by
previous methods and potential biases that may help in investigations of the

in red-giant stars. These modes carry a wealth of information about red-giant
cores, but are of limited use when constraining rapid structural variations in
their envelopes. This limitation can be circumvented if we have access to the
frequencies of the pure acoustic dipolar modes in red giants, i.e. the dipole
modes that would exist in the absence of coupling between gravity and acoustic
waves. We present a pilot study aimed at evaluating the implications of using
these pure acoustic mode frequencies in seismic studies of the helium
structural variation in red giants. The study is based on artificial seismic
data for a red-giant-branch stellar model, bracketing seven acoustic dipole
radial orders around vmax. The pure acoustic dipole-mode frequencies are
derived from a fit to the mixed-mode period spacings and then used to compute
the pure acoustic dipole-mode second differences. The pure acoustic dipole-mode
second differences inferred through this procedure follow the same oscillatory
function as the radial modes second differences. The additional constraints
brought by the dipolar modes allow us to adopt a more complete description of
the glitch signature when performing the fit to the second differences. The
amplitude of the glitch retrieved from this fit is 15% smaller than that from
the fit based on the radial modes alone. Also, we find that thanks to the
additional constraints, a bias in the inferred glitch location, found when
adopting the simpler description of the glitch, is avoided.

non-violent mortality of Peru, controlling for the effect of quarantine.
Methods: Analysis of longitudinal data from the departments of Peru using
official public information from the National Death Information System and the
Ministry of Health of Peru. The analysis is performed between January 1, 2018
and June 23, 2020 (100 days of quarantine). The daily death rate per million
inhabitants has been used. The days in which the departments were quarantined
with a limit number of accumulated cases of COVID-19 were used to estimate the
quarantine impact. Three limits were established for cases: less than 1, 10 and
100 cases. Result: In Peru, the daily death rate per million inhabitants
decreased by -1.89 (95% CI: -2.70; -1.07) on quarantine days and without
COVID-19 cases. When comparing this result with the total number of non-violent
deaths, the excess deaths during the first 100 days of quarantine is 36,230.
This estimate is 1.12 times the estimate with data from 2019 and 4.2 times the
deaths officers by COVID-19. Conclusion: Quarantine reduced nonviolent deaths;
however, they are overshadowed by the increase as a direct or indirect cause of
the pandemic. Therefore, the difference between the number of current deaths
and that of past years underestimates the real excess of deaths.

an acceleration effect allows us to faster approach the global minima.
Furthermore, by discretizing the replica exchange Langevin diffusion, we obtain

lattice distortion can lead to structural reconstruction in slightly twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) with the twist angle being smaller than a characteristic
angle {\theta}c. Experimentally, the {\theta}c is demonstrated to be very close
to the magic angle ({\theta} ~ 1.05{\deg}). In this work, we address the
transition between reconstructed and unreconstructed structures of the TBG
across the magic angle by using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). Our
experiment demonstrates that both the two structures are stable in the TBG
around the magic angle. By applying a STM tip pulse, we show that the two
structures can be switched to each other and the bandwidth of the flat bands,
which plays a vital role in the emergent strongly correlated states in the
magic-angle TBG, can be tuned. The observed tunable lattice reconstruction and
bandwidth of the flat bands provide an extra control knob to manipulate the
exotic electronic states of the TBG near the magic angle.

iteration $x_{k+1}=q(x_k)$, including Anderson acceleration (AA), nonlinear
GMRES (NGMRES), and Nesterov-type acceleration (corresponding to AA with window
size one). We focus on fixed-point methods that converge asymptotically
linearly with convergence factor $\rho<1$ and that solve an underlying fully
smooth and non-convex optimization problem. It is often observed that AA and
NGMRES substantially improve the asymptotic convergence behavior of the
fixed-point iteration, but this improvement has not been quantified
theoretically. We investigate this problem under simplified conditions. First,
we consider stationary versions of AA and NGMRES, and determine coefficients
that result in optimal asymptotic convergence factors, given knowledge of the
spectrum of $q'(x)$ at the fixed point $x^*$. This allows us to understand and
quantify the asymptotic convergence improvement that can be provided by
nonlinear convergence acceleration, viewing $x_{k+1}=q(x_k)$ as a nonlinear
preconditioner for AA and NGMRES. Second, for the case of infinite window size,
we consider linear asymptotic convergence bounds for GMRES applied to the
fixed-point iteration linearized about $x^*$. Since AA and NGMRES are
equivalent to GMRES in the linear case, one may expect the GMRES convergence
factors to be relevant for AA and NGMRES as $x_k \rightarrow x^*$. Our results
are illustrated numerically for a class of test problems from canonical tensor
decomposition, comparing steepest descent and alternating least squares (ALS)
as the fixed-point iterations that are accelerated by AA and NGMRES. Our
numerical tests show that both approaches allow us to estimate asymptotic
convergence speed for nonstationary AA and NGMRES with finite window size.

a family of models from simple to complex ones that couples a pair of

structural sparsity on weights of fully connected and convolutional layers.
Such a differential inclusion scheme has a simple discretization, proposed as
Deep structurally splitting Linearized Bregman Iteration (DessiLBI), whose
global convergence analysis in deep learning is established that from any
initializations, algorithmic iterations converge to a critical point of
empirical risks. Experimental evidence shows that DessiLBI achieve comparable

structural sparsity of several widely used backbones on the benchmark datasets.
Remarkably, with early stopping, DessiLBI unveils ""winning tickets"" in early

4,378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The
occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered
according to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create
different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological

models were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series

outlines how these models can enhance comfort preference prediction when

from very poor visibility caused by low contrast, color distortion and
significant measurement noise. Low-light image enhancement is about improving
the visibility of low-light images. As the measurement noise in low-light
images is usually significant yet complex with spatially-varying
characteristic, how to handle the noise effectively is an important yet
challenging problem in low-light image enhancement. Based on the Retinex
decomposition of natural images, this paper proposes a deep learning method for
low-light image enhancement with a particular focus on handling the measurement
noise. The basic idea is to train a neural network to generate a set of
pixel-wise operators for simultaneously predicting the noise and the
illumination layer, where the operators are defined in the bilateral space.
Such an integrated approach allows us to have an accurate prediction of the
reflectance layer in the presence of significant spatially-varying measurement
noise. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets have shown that the
proposed method is very competitive to the state-of-the-art methods, and has
significant advantage over others when processing images captured in extremely

Despite current studies on common mobility metrics, research specifically on

location data from over 100 million anonymous devices, we estimate the
population flow between all states in the United States. We first analyze the
temporal pattern and spatial differences of between-state flow from January 1,

we discern different time-course patterns of between-state population flow by

varies with different policies. This paper is promising in predicting imported

networks (RAN) in 5G networks, using programmable data plane switches. In 5G
networks, the NG-RAN architecture splits the Base Band Unit (BBU) into Central
and Distributed Units (CU and DU). This structure has created a mid-haul
Network, connecting CUs and DUs. The recent advancements in dataplane
programmability can be used to enhance system performance. We show how P4
switches can be used to parse the packets between DU, CU, and Back Haul (Core
Network) for potential system improvements. In particular, we consider the
scenario of mobile handover. The proposed protocol is called SMARTHO,
illustrating a smart handover.
  Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) is a programming
language designed to support specification and programming the forwarding plane
behavior of network switches/routers. In SMARTHO, we use P4 Switches to
intervene in the handover process for fixed-path mobile users. A resource
pre-allocation scheme that reserves resources before the UE reaches a future
cell, is proposed. The solution is implemented using a P4-based switch
introduced between the CU and the DU. The P4 switch is used to spoof the
behavior of User Equipment (UE) and perform the resource allocation in advance.
  The proposed SMARTHO framework is implemented in the mininet emulation
environment and in a reconfigurable hardware environment using NetFPGA-SUME
boards. The emulation results show a handover response time improvement of 18%
for a tandem of two HOs and 25% for a tandem of three HOs. For testbed
implementation, we used NetFPGA-SUME boards as P4 switches. The handover time
was measured to be approximately 50~milliseconds in the experiments conducted.

modeling both appearance and motion cues. First, to obtain a robust appearance
model, we develop a novel late fusion method to infer the fusion weight maps of
both RGB and thermal (T) modalities. The fusion weights are determined by using
offline-trained global and local multimodal fusion networks, and then adopted
to linearly combine the response maps of RGB and T modalities. Second, when the
appearance cue is unreliable, we comprehensively take motion cues, i.e., target
and camera motions, into account to make the tracker robust. We further propose
a tracker switcher to switch the appearance and motion trackers flexibly.
Numerous results on three recent RGB-T tracking datasets show that the proposed
tracker performs significantly better than other state-of-the-art algorithms.

intensity mapping functions (IMFs) which are computed using camera response

are then enhanced by using a data-driven approach, i.e. a residual
convolutional neural network to approach the ground truth images. The
model-driven approach and the data-driven one compensate each other in the

fusing the original image and two virtual images via a multi-scale exposure
fusion algorithm with properly defined weights. Experimental results show that
the proposed brightening algorithm outperforms existing algorithms in terms of
the MEF-SSIM metric.

simulations have been used to explore the interaction of gyrotropic vortex core
dynamics with the curling modes observed in the region of circulating in-plane
magnetization. Hybridization of the fundamental gyrotropic mode with the
degenerate, lowest-frequency, azimuthal modes has previously been reported to
lead to their splitting and counter propagating motion, as we observe in our
spectra and measured images. The curling nature of the modes can be ascribed to
asymmetry in the static and dynamic magnetization across the disc thickness,
but here we also present evidence that spiral spin waves emitted by the core
can influence the spatial character of higher frequency curling modes for which
hybridization is only permitted with gyrotropic modes of the same sense of
azimuthal motion. While it is challenging to identify if such modes are truly
hybridized from the mode dispersion in a confined disc, our simulations reveal
that spiral spin waves from the core may act as mediators of the interaction
between the core dynamics and azimuthal modes. At higher frequency, modes with
radial character only do not exhibit marked curling, but instead show evidence
of interaction with spin waves generated at the edge of the disc. The measured
spatio-temporal character of the observed curling modes is accurately
reproduced by our simulations, which reveal the emission of propagating
short-wavelength spiral spin waves from both core and edge regions of the disc.
Our simulations suggest that the propagating modes are not inconsequential, but
may play a role in the dynamic overlap required for hybridization of modes of
the core and in-plane magnetised regions.

MPF motion control problem is solved for a large class of robotic vehicles that
require a minimum positive forward speed to operate, which poses additional
constraints, and is developed using geometric concepts, wherein the attitude
control problem is formulated on Special Orthogonal group SO(3). Furthermore,
the proposed control law is derived from a novel MPF error model formulation
that allows to exclude the conservative constraints on the initial position of
the vehicle with respect to the reference path by enabling the explicit control
of the progression of a virtual point moving along the reference path. The task
of the MPF control law is then to steer the vehicle towards the moving path and
converge to the virtual point. Formal stability and convergence guarantees are
provided using the Input-to-State Stability concept. In particular, we show
that the proposed controller is robust to imperfect tracking errors by the
autopilot and wind gusts. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the

necessary to study the origin of the adversarial vulnerability. Here, we
establish a fundamental relationship between geometry of hidden representations

For this purpose, we choose a deep neural network trained by local errors, and
then analyze emergent properties of trained networks through the manifold
dimensionality, manifold smoothness, and the generalization capability. To
explore effects of adversarial examples, we consider independent Gaussian noise
attacks and fast-gradient-sign-method (FGSM) attacks. Our study reveals that a
high generalization accuracy requires a relatively fast power-law decay of the
eigen-spectrum of hidden representations. Under Gaussian attacks, the
relationship between generalization accuracy and power-law exponent is
monotonic, while a non-monotonic behavior is observed for FGSM attacks. Our
empirical study provides a route towards a final mechanistic interpretation of
adversarial vulnerability under adversarial attacks.

chain with small random Langevin-like perturbations which imitate the
environmental temperature $T$ and under the influence of a constant electric
field. In the semiclassical Holstein model the region of existence of polarons
in the thermodynamic equilibrium state depends not only on temperature but also
on the chain length. Therefore when we compute dynamics from initial polaron
data, the mean displacement of the charge mass center differs for
different-length chains at the same temperature. For a large radius polaron, it
is shown numerically that the ``mean polaron displacement'' (which takes
account only of the polaron peak and its position) behaves similarly for
different-length chains during the time when the polaron persists. A similar
slope of the polaron displacement enables one to find the polaron mean velocity
and, by analogy with the charge mobility, assess the ``polaron mobility''. The
calculated values of the polaron mobility for $T \approx 0$ are close to the
value at $T=0$, which is small but not zero. For the parameters corresponding
to the small radius polaron, simulations of dynamics demonstrate switching mode
between immobile polaron and delocalized state. The position of the new polaron
is not related to the position of the previous one; charge transfer occurs in
the delocalized state.

sample frequencies on traditional filter-based methods, however, an extensive
study of the effect of ECG sample frequency on deep learning-based models
(convolutional networks), exploring their generalisability and complexity is

degradation. To limit this pollution several effective practices have been
defined: shields on lighting fixtures to prevent direct upward light; no over
lighting, i.e. avoid using higher lighting levels than strictly needed for the
task, constraining illumination to the area where and when it is needed.
Nevertheless, even after the best control of the light distribution is reached
and when the proper quantity of light is used, upward light emission remains,
due to reflections from the lit surfaces and atmospheric scatter. The
environmental impact of this ""residual light pollution"" cannot be neglected and
should be limited too. We propose a new way to limit the effects of this
residual light pollution on wildlife, human health and stellar visibility. We
performed analysis of the spectra of common types of lamps for external use,
including the new LEDs. We evaluated their emissions relative to the spectral
response functions of human eye photoreceptors, in the photopic, scotopic and
melatonin suppressing bands finding that the amount of pollution is strongly
dependent on the spectral characteristics of the lamps, with the more
environmentally friendly lamps being low pressure sodium, followed by high
pressure sodium. Most polluting are the lamps with a strong blue emission, like
white LEDs. Migration from the now widely used sodium lamps to white lamps
(Metal Halide and LEDs) would produce an increase of pollution in the scotopic
and melatonin suppression bands of more than five times the present levels,
supposing the same photopic installed flux. This increase will exacerbate known
and possible unknown effects of light pollution on human health, environment

objects whose classification is not sufficiently certain, a fusion model is
designed to fuse selected key observations that provide different perspectives

performance gain over global methods, although being able to explicitly focus
on small details that are relevant for distinguishing highly similar classes.
We assume that part-based methods suffer from a missing representation of local
features, which is invariant to the order of parts and can handle a varying
number of visible parts appropriately. The order of parts is artificial and
often only given by ground-truth annotations, whereas viewpoint variations and
occlusions result in parts that are not observable. Therefore, we propose
integrating a Fisher vector encoding of part features into convolutional neural
networks. The parameters for this encoding are estimated jointly with those of
the neural network in an end-to-end manner. Our approach improves
state-of-the-art accuracies for bird species classification on CUB-200-2011

may be interested in some resources more than others, therefore, a coordination
scheme is required to satisfy the users' requirements. This scheme may
implement certain policies such as ""never allocate more than X units of
resource Z"". One policy that is of particular interest is the inability of
users to access a single resource at the same time, which is called the problem
of mutual exclusion. Resource management concerns the coordination and
collaboration of users, and it is usually based on making a decision. In the
case of mutual exclusion, that decision is about granting access to a resource.
Therefore, mutual exclusion is useful for supporting resource access
management. The first true solution to the mutual exclusion problem is known as
the Bakery algorithm that does not rely on any lower-lever mutual exclusion. We
examine the problem of register overflow in real-world implementations of the
Bakery algorithm and present a variant algorithm named Bakery++ that prevents
overflows from ever happening. Bakery++ avoids overflows without allowing a
process to write into other processes' memory and without using additional
memory or complex arithmetic or redefining the operations and functions used in
Bakery. Bakery++ is almost as simple as Bakery and it is straightforward to
implement in real systems. With Bakery++, there is no reason to keep
implementing Bakery in real computers because Bakery++ eliminates the
probability of overflows and hence it is more practical than Bakery. Previous
approaches to circumvent the problem of register overflow included introducing
new variables or redefining the operations or functions used in the original
Bakery algorithm, while Bakery++ avoids overflows by using simple conditional
statements. (the abstract does not end here.)

along with a domain reduction approach in order to reduce the grid that covers

current scene model to select the next viewpoints. The objective is to select

total of 7,879 images obtained from 97 subjects who underwent orbit CT scans
due to suspected TAO were enrolled in this study. Eighty-eight patients were
randomly selected into the training/validation dataset, and the rest were put
into the test dataset. Contours of the total EOM and ON in all the patients

three-dimensional (3D) end-to-end fully convolutional neural network called

Results: Our model in the test dataset achieved an overall IoU of 0.8207; the
IoU was 0.7599 for the superior rectus muscle, 0.8183 for the lateral rectus
muscle, 0.8481 for the medial rectus muscle, 0.8436 for the inferior rectus

excellent performance of our method in automatically extracting the total EOM

policy is encoded in the weights of multi-channel stacked self-attention neural
networks and trained with efficient Q-learning by maximizing users' overall

model in physics, we propose a temporal gravity model to identify influential

masses of the objects and the distance between two objects. In the temporal
gravity model, we treat nodes as the objects, basic node properties, such as
static and temporal properties, as the nodes' masses. We define temporal
distances, i.e., fastest arrival distance and temporal shortest distance, as
the distance between two nodes in our model. We utilize our model as well as
the baseline centrality methods on important nodes identification. Experimental
results on ten real-world datasets show that the temporal gravity model
outperforms the baseline methods in quantifying node structural influence.
Moreover, when we use the temporal shortest distance as the distance between
two nodes, our model is robust and performs the best in quantifying node
spreading influence compared to the baseline methods.

depends on their capability of modeling local geometric patterns. Conventional
point-based models exploit local patterns through a symmetric function (e.g.
max pooling) or based on graphs, which easily leads to loss of fine-grained
geometric structures. Regarding capturing spatial patterns, CNNs are powerful
but it would be computationally costly to directly apply convolutions on point
data after voxelizing the entire point clouds to a dense regular 3D grid. In
this work, we aim to improve performance of point-based models by enhancing
their pattern learning ability through leveraging CNNs while preserving
computational efficiency. We propose a novel and principled Local Grid
Rendering (LGR) operation to render the small neighborhood of a subset of input
points into a low-resolution 3D grid independently, which allows small-size
CNNs to accurately model local patterns and avoids convolutions over a dense
grid to save computation cost. With the LGR operation, we introduce a new
generic backbone called LGR-Net for point cloud feature extraction with simple
design and high efficiency. We validate LGR-Net for 3D object detection on the
challenging ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets. It advances state-of-the-art
results significantly by 5.5 and 4.5 mAP, respectively, with only slight
increased computation overhead.

supernovae has been observed in a handful of cases. Multiple scenarios have
been proposed to explain this. It has been shown that for at least one object
(SN~2018oh) the excess emission observed could be the result of a large amount
of $^{56}$Ni in the outer ejecta ($\sim$0.03~$M_{\rm{\odot}}$). We present a
series of model light curves and spectra for ejecta profiles containing
$^{56}$Ni shells of varying masses (0.01, 0.02, 0.03, and
0.04~$M_{\rm{\odot}}$) and widths. We find that even for our lowest mass
$^{56}$Ni shell, an increase of \textgreater2 magnitudes is produced in the
bolometric light curve at one day after explosion relative to models without a
$^{56}$Ni shell. We show that the colour evolution of models with a $^{56}$Ni
shell differs significantly from those without and shows a colour inversion
similar to some double-detonation explosions. Spectra of our $^{56}$Ni shell
models show that strong suppression of flux between $\sim$3\,700 --
4\,000~$\AA$ close to maximum light appears to be a generic feature for this
class of model. Comparing our models to observations of SNe~2017cbv and 2018oh,
we show that a $^{56}$Ni shell of 0.02 -- 0.04~$M_{\rm{\odot}}$ can match
shapes of the early optical light curve bumps, but the colour and spectral
evolution are in disagreement. This would indicate that an alternative origin
for the flux excess is necessary. Based on existing explosion scenarios,
producing such a $^{56}$Ni shell in the outer ejecta as required to match the
light curve shape, without the presence of additional short-lived radioactive
material, may prove challenging. Given that only a small amount of $^{56}$Ni in
the outer ejecta is required to produce a bump in the light curve, such
non-monotonically decreasing $^{56}$Ni distributions in the outer ejecta must
be rare, if they were to occur at all.

several prediction regions are developed and their performance are compared
through simulation studies. The methods are applied to the problem of
forecasting daily and cumulative deaths in the United States (US) due to
COVID-19. To examine their performance relative to what actually happened,
daily deaths data until May 15th were used to forecast cumulative deaths by
June 1st. It was observed that there is over-dispersion in the observed data

model is therefore proposed. This new model builds on frailty ideas in Survival

Poisson regression model is a hidden model in this over-dispersed Poisson
regression model and obtains as a limiting case when the over-dispersion
parameter increases to infinity. A prediction region for the cumulative number
of US deaths due to COVID-19 by July 16th, given the data until July 2nd, is

demand decrease of about $64\%$ (IATA, April 2020) which triggered already
several bankruptcies of airline companies all over the world. While the
robustness of the world airline network (WAN) was mostly studied as an
homogeneous network, we introduce a new tool for analyzing the impact of a
company failure: the `airline company network' where two airlines are connected
if they share at least one route segment. Using this tool, we observe that the
failure of companies well connected with others has the largest impact on the
connectivity of the WAN. We then explore how the global demand reduction
affects airlines differently, and provide an analysis of different scenarios if
its stays low and does not come back to its pre-crisis level. Using traffic
data from the Official Aviation Guide (OAG) and simple assumptions about
customer's airline choice strategies, we find that the local effective demand
can be much lower than the average one, especially for companies that are not
monopolistic and share their segments with larger companies. Even if the
average demand comes back to $60\%$ of the total capacity, we find that between
$46\%$ and $59\%$ of the companies could experience a reduction of more than
$50\%$ of their traffic, depending on the type of competitive advantage that
drives customer's airline choice. These results highlight how the complex

growth, the size of the critical nucleus for a homogeneous process (r*homo=r* )
has been assumed to be a time invariant constant of the transformation. The
strain associated with the process has a positive energy contribution and leads
to an increase in the value of r*, with respect to that for nucleation from a
liquid. With the progress of such a transformation, the strain energy stored in
the matrix increases and nuclei forming at a later stage encounter a strained
matrix. Using devitrification of a bulk metallic glass as a model system, we
demonstrate that r* is not a cardinal time invariant constant for homogeneous
nucleation and can increase or decrease depending on the strain energy penalty.
We show that the assumption regarding the constancy of r* is true only in the
early stages of the transformation and establish that the progress of the
transformation leads to an altered magnitude of r*, which is a function of the
microstructural details, geometrical variables and physical parameters. With
the aid of high-resolution lattice fringe imaging and computations of r*, we
further argue that, 'liquid-like' homogeneous nucleation can occur and that the
conclusions are applicable to a broad set of solid-state diffusional
transformations. The above effect 'opens up' a lower barrier transformation
pathway arising purely from the internal variables of the system.

machine learning that has demonstrated significantly reduced energy usage
compared to neural networks alike, while performing competitively accuracy-wise
on several benchmarks. However, TMs rely heavily on energy-costly random number
generation to stochastically guide a team of Tsetlin Automata to a Nash
Equilibrium of the TM game. In this paper, we propose a novel finite-state
learning automaton that can replace the Tsetlin Automata in TM learning, for
increased determinism. The new automaton uses multi-step deterministic state
jumps to reinforce sub-patterns. Simultaneously, flipping a coin to skip every
$d$'th state update ensures diversification by randomization. The $d$-parameter
thus allows the degree of randomization to be finely controlled. E.g., $d=1$
makes every update random and $d=\infty$ makes the automaton completely
deterministic. Our empirical results show that, overall, only substantial
degrees of determinism reduces accuracy. Energy-wise, random number generation
constitutes switching energy consumption of the TM, saving up to 11 mW power
for larger datasets with high $d$ values. We can thus use the new $d$-parameter
to trade off accuracy against energy consumption, to facilitate low-energy
machine learning.

modeling settings where parameter estimates from previous data can be used as
anchoring points, yet may not be available for all parameters, thus covariance
information cannot be reused. A procedure that updates through targeted
penalized estimation, which shrinks the estimator towards a nonzero value, is
presented. The parameter estimate from the previous data serves as this nonzero
value when an update is sought from novel data. This naturally extends to a
sequence of data sets with the same response, but potentially only partial
overlap in covariates. The iteratively updated regression parameter estimator
is shown to be asymptotically unbiased and consistent. The penalty parameter is
chosen through constrained cross-validated loglikelihood optimization. The
constraint bounds the amount of shrinkage of the updated estimator toward the
current one from below. The bound aims to preserve the (updated) estimator's
goodness-of-fit on all-but-the-novel data. The proposed approach is compared to

provide significant feedback to their host system, in form of both gas enriched
in nuclear-burning products and dust formed in their winds, which they eject
into the interstellar medium. Therefore AGB stars are an essential ingredient
for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Aims: We study
AGB models with super-solar metallicity, to complete our large database, so far
extending from metal-poor to solar chemical compositions. We provide chemical
yields for masses in the range 1-8 Msun and metallicities Z=0.03 and Z=0.04. We
also study dust production in this metallicity domain. Methods: We calculated
the evolutionary sequences from the pre main sequence through the whole AGB
phase. We follow the variation of the surface chemical composition to calculate
the chemical yields of the various species and model dust formation in the
winds to determine the dust production rate and the total dust mass produced by
each star during the AGB phase. Results: The physical and chemical evolution of
the star is sensitive to the initial mass: M> 3Msun stars experience hot bottom
burning, whereas the surface chemistry of the lower mass counterparts is
altered only by third dredge-up. The carbon-star phase is reached by
2.5-3.5Msun stars of metallicity Z=0.03, whereas all the Z=0.04 stars (except
the 2.5 Msun) remain O-rich for the whole AGB phase. Most of the dust produced
by metal-rich AGBs is in the form of silicates particles. The total mass of
dust produced increases with the mass of the star, reaching
  ~ 0.012 Msun for 8Msun stars.

evolved 2-point correlator requires multiplicative renormalization, in contrast
to the nonevolved case, and confirm, in agreement with other results in the
literature, that such renormalization ought to be identified with a universal
renormalization of the evolved elementary fermion field in all evolved
fermion-bilinear currents, whereas the gauge coupling renormalizes as usual. We
explicitly derive the asymptotic solution of the Callan-Symanzik equation for
the connected 2-point correlators of these evolved currents in the limit of
small gradient-flow time $\sqrt{t}$, at fixed separation $|x-y|$. Incidentally,
this computation determines the leading coefficient of the operator-product
expansion (OPE) in the small $t$ limit for the evolved currents in terms of
their local nonevolved counterpart. Our computation also implies that, in the
evolved case, conservation of the vector current, hence transversality of the
corresponding 2-point correlator, is no longer related to the
nonrenormalization, in contrast to the nonevolved case. Indeed, for small flow
time the evolved vector current is conserved up to $O(t)$ softly violating
effects, despite its $t$-dependent nonvanishing anomalous dimension.

As automated experiments and numerical simulations produce ever-increasing

quantitatively accurate. In this study, we develop and test a physics-based
reduced-order model of a ducted premixed flame in which the model parameters

assimilated into a level-set solver using an ensemble Kalman filter. This leads
to an optimally calibrated reduced-order model with quantified uncertainties,

expected on physical grounds. This study shows how reduced-order models can be
updated rapidly whenever new experimental or numerical data becomes available,

requires fitting an in-shop cloth image on the image of a person, which is
highly challenging because it involves cloth warping, image compositing, and
synthesizing. Casting virtual try-on into a supervised task faces a difficulty:
available datasets are composed of pairs of pictures (cloth, person wearing the
cloth). Thus, we have no access to ground-truth when the cloth on the person
changes. State-of-the-art models solve this by masking the cloth information on
the person with both a human parser and a pose estimator. Then, image synthesis
modules are trained to reconstruct the person image from the masked person
image and the cloth image. This procedure has several caveats: firstly, human
parsers are prone to errors; secondly, it is a costly pre-processing step,
which also has to be applied at inference time; finally, it makes the task
harder than it is since the mask covers information that should be kept such as
hands or accessories. In this paper, we propose a novel student-teacher
paradigm where the teacher is trained in the standard way (reconstruction)
before guiding the student to focus on the initial task (changing the cloth).
The student additionally learns from an adversarial loss, which pushes it to
follow the distribution of the real images. Consequently, the student exploits
information that is masked to the teacher. A student trained without the
adversarial loss would not use this information. Also, getting rid of both
human parser and pose estimator at inference time allows obtaining a real-time

line under LTE in M16 and W43 regions. Here, SCD is defined by $dN_{\rm

under-estimates the H$_2$ density in a cloud or region, where SCD exceeds a
critical value ($ \sim 3\times 10^{21}\ [{\rm H_2 \ cm^{-2} \ (km \

the actual CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor varies with the H$_2$ column density
or with the CO-line intensity: It increases in the inner and opaque parts of
molecular clouds, whereas it decreases in the low-density envelopes. However,
in so far as the current $X_{\rm CO}$ is used combined with the integrated

constants obtained by fitting to the observed data. The formula corrects for

convolutional networks, the autoencoder step is added to reduce the information
loss brought by Laplacian smoothing. We consider applying our model on both
homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs. For homogeneous graphs, the
autoencoder approximates to the adjacency matrix of the input graph by taking
hidden layer representations as encoder and another one-layer graph
convolutional network as decoder. For heterogeneous graphs, since there are
multiple adjacency matrices corresponding to different types of edges, the
autoencoder approximates to the feature matrix of the input graph instead, and
changes the encoder to a particularly designed multi-channel pre-processing
network with two layers. In both cases, the error occurred in the autoencoder
approximation goes to the penalty term in the loss function. In extensive
experiments on citation networks and other heterogeneous graphs, we demonstrate
that adding autoencoder constraints significantly improves the performance of
graph convolutional networks. Further, we notice that our technique can be
applied on graph attention network to improve the performance as well. This
reveals the wide applicability of the proposed autoencoder technique.

two singular points, characterizing them topologically except $4$-dimensional
cases. The class contains canonical projections of unit spheres for example.
  This class has been found to be interesting, restricting the topologies and
the differentiable structures of the manifolds strictly: Saeki, Sakuma and
Wrazidlo found explicit phenomena.
  The present paper concerns fold maps on $7$-dimensional closed and
simply-connected spin manifolds whose integral cohomology rings are isomorphic
to that of the product of the $2$-dimensional complex projective space and the
$3$-dimensional sphere.

finite element simulations, surrogate models have been widely applied in
computer-aided engineering design. Machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have been
implemented as surrogate models due to their capability of learning the complex
interrelations between the design variables and the response from big datasets.
Typically, an MLA regression model contains model parameters and
hyperparameters. The model parameters are obtained by fitting the training
data. Hyperparameters, which govern the model structures and the training
processes, are assigned by users before training. There is a lack of systematic
studies on the effect of hyperparameters on the accuracy and robustness of the
surrogate model. In this work, we proposed to establish a hyperparameter
optimization (HOpt) framework to deepen our understanding of the effect. Four
frequently used MLAs, namely Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Artificial Neural Network
(ANN), are tested on four benchmark examples. For each MLA model, the model
accuracy and robustness before and after the HOpt are compared. The results
show that HOpt can generally improve the performance of the MLA models in
general. HOpt leads to few improvements in the MLAs accuracy and robustness for
complex problems, which are featured by high-dimensional mixed-variable design
space. The HOpt is recommended for the design problems with intermediate
complexity. We also investigated the additional computational costs incurred by
HOpt. The training cost is closely related to the MLA architecture. After HOpt,
the training cost of ANN and RFR is increased more than that of the GPR and
SVM. To sum up, this study benefits the selection of HOpt method for the
different types of design problems based on their complexity.

undergoing cultural evolution. Mental representations of knowledge and
experiences play the role of catalytic molecules, and interactions amongst them
(e.g., the forging of new associations) play the role of reactions, and result
in representational redescription. The approach tags mental representations
with their source, i.e., whether they were acquired through social learning,
individual learning (of pre-existing information), or creative thought
(resulting in the generation of new information). This makes it possible to
model how cognitive structure emerges, and to trace lineages of cumulative
culture step by step. We develop a formal representation of the cultural
transition from Oldowan to Acheulean tool technology using Reflexively
Autocatalytifc and Food set generated (RAF) networks. Unlike more primitive
Oldowan stone tools, the Acheulean hand axe required not only the capacity to
envision and bring into being something that did not yet exist, but
hierarchically structured thought and action, and the generation of new mental
representations: the concepts EDGING, THINNING, SHAPING, and a meta-concept,
HAND AXE. We show how this constituted a key transition towards the emergence
of semantic networks that were self-organizing, self-sustaining, and
autocatalytic, and discuss how such networks replicated through social
interaction. The model provides a promising approach to unraveling one of the
greatest anthropological mysteries: that of why development of the Acheulean
hand axe was followed by over a million years of cultural stasis.

this work, in contrast to other energy-based approaches that use internal
energy and the work done by the external loads, a novel arc-length approach is
proposed. It directly extracts the dissipated energy based on crack openings
and tractions (displacement jumps and cohesive forces between two surfaces of
one crack), taking advantage of the global/extended method of cracking
elements. Its linearized form is developed, and the stiffness factor of the
arc-length restraint is naturally obtained by means of the Sherman-Morrison
formula. Once cohesive cracks appear, the proposed approach can be applied
until most of the fracture energy is dissipated. Results from several numerical
tests, in which arc-length control and self-propagating cracks are jointly
